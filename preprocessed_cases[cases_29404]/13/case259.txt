the federal meat inspection act fmia,et,regulates a broad range of activities at slaughterhouses to ensure the safety of meat and the humane handling of animals.the department of agriculture food safety and inspection service fsis,which administers the fmia,has issued extensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals and meat,as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses operations and facilities.see cfr et.the fsis inspection procedure begins with an inspection of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse.if,at that inspection,a nonambulatory animal is found to suffer from a particularly severe disease or condition,it must be classified as condemned and killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food is produced,et.nonambulatory animals that are not condemned are classified as suspect.b.they are set apart,specially monitored,and slaughtered separately from other livestock.n.following slaughter,an inspector decides at a examination which parts,if any,of the suspect animal carcass may be processed into food for humans.see cfr pts.fsis regulations additionally prescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process,cfr pt,including specific provisions for the humane treatment of nonambulatory animals,cfr d.
the fmia preemption clause,precludes states from imposing requirements that are within the scope of the fmia,relate to slaughterhouse premises,facilities and operations,and are in addition to,or different than those made under the fmia.in,california amended its penal code to provide that no slaughterhouse shall buy,sell,or receive a nonambulatory animal process,butcher,or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human consumption or hold a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.a c.petitioner national meat association nma,a trade association representing meatpackers and processors,sued to enjoin enforcement of against swine slaughterhouses,arguing that the fmia preempts application of the state law.the district court agreed,and granted the nma a preliminary injunction.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that is not preempted because it regulates only the kind of animal that may be slaughtered,not the inspection or slaughtering process itself.
held the fmia expressly preempts application against federally inspected swine slaughterhouses.
a the fmia preemption clause sweeps widely,and so blocks the applications of challenged here.the clause prevents a state from imposing any additional or different even if nonconflicting requirements that fall within the fmia scope and concern slaughterhouse facilities or operations.section imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig,under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.for example,when a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to a slaughterhouse,c prohibits the slaughterhouse from hold ing the pig without immediately euthanizing it and b prohibits the slaughterhouse from process ing or butcher ing the animal to make food.by contrast,the fmia and its regulations allow a slaughterhouse to hold without euthanizing any nonambulatory animal that has not been condemned,and to process and butcher such an animal meat,subject to an fsis official approval at inspection.similarly,when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery,a prohibits a slaughterhouse from receiv ing or buy ing the pig.but the fmia and its regulations expressly allow slaughterhouses to purchase nonambulatory pigs.see cfr c.and the fsis inspection regime clearly contemplates that slaughterhouses will receive nonambulatory animals.so substitutes a new regulatory regime for the one the fmia prescribes.
respondent humane society argues that a ban on purchasing nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because it would not be preempted if applied to purchases occurring off slaughterhouse premises.but the record does not disclose whether a ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate,much less how an application of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse operations.moreover,even if the state could regulate purchases,it does not follow that purchases would escape preemption,because the fmia preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse premises,facilities and operations.and while the humane society is correct that the fmia does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activities,sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises.its effect is to make sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process.it is therefore preempted by the fmia.
b also rejected is the broad argument that challenged provisions fall outside the fmia scope because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process,while the fmia extends only to animals that are going to be turned into meat.in fact,the fmia regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be turned into meat.for example,the act implementing regulations exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process,swine with hog cholera,cfr a.the argument that exclusion avoids the fmia scope because it is designed to ensure the humane treatment of pigs,rather than meat safety,misunderstands the fmia scope.the fmia addresses not just food safety,but humane treatment,as well.see,b.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal meat inspection act fmia or act,et,regulates the inspection,handling,and slaughter of livestock for human consumption.we consider here whether the fmia expressly preempts a california law dictating what slaughterhouses must do with pigs that can not walk,known in the trade as nonambulatory pigs.we hold that the fmia forecloses the challenged applications of the state statute.
the fmia regulates a broad range of activities at slaughterhouses to ensure both the safety of meat and the humane handling of animals first enacted in,after upton sinclair muckraking novel the jungle sparked an uproar over conditions in the meatpacking industry,the act establishes an elaborate system of inspecti ng live animals and carcasses in order to prevent the shipment of impure,unwholesome,and unfit meat and products.pittsburgh melting totten.and since amended in,see stat,the fmia requires all slaughterhouses to comply with the standards for humane handling and slaughter of animals set out in the humane methods of slaughter act of,hmsa,stat,et,which originally applied only to slaughterhouses selling meat to the federal government.
the department of agriculture food safety and inspection service fsis has responsibility for administering the fmia to promote its dual goals of safe meat and humane slaughter.over the years,the fsis has issued extensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals and meat,as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses operations and facilities.see cfr et.the fsis employs about inspectors,veterinarians,and investigators to implement its inspection regime and enforce its requirements.see hearings on appropriations before the subcommittee on agriculture of the house committee on appropriations,pt.in fiscal year,those personnel examined about million head of livestock and carried out more than humane handling verification procedures.at.
the fsis inspection procedure begins with an examination of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse.see cfr.if the inspector finds no evidence of disease or injury,he approves the animal for slaughter.if,at the other end of the spectrum,the inspector sees that an animal is dead or dying,comatose,suffering from a high fever,or afflicted with a serious disease or condition,he designates the animal as condemned.see et listing diseases requiring condemnation.a condemned animal if not already dead must be killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food is produced,and no part of its carcass may be sold for human consumption.see a c.
the inspector also has an intermediate option if he determines that an animal has a less severe condition or merely suspects the animal of having a disease meriting condemnation he classifies the animal as suspect.see cfr.that category includes all nonambulatory animals not found to require condemnation see b.suspect livestock must be set apart,specially monitored,and if not reclassified because of a change in condition slaughtered separately from other livestock.n.following slaughter,an inspector decides at a examination which parts,if any,of the suspect animal carcass may be processed into food for humans.see cfr pts.
the regulations implementing the fmia additionally prescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process.those rules apply from the moment a truck carrying livestock enters,or is in line to enter,a slaughterhouse premises.humane handling and slaughter of livestock,fsis directive,ch.ii i.and they include specific provisions for the humane treatment of animals that can not walk.see cfr d.under the regulations,slaughterhouse employees may not drag conscious,nonambulatory animals,see d,and may move them only with equipment suitable for such purposes,d.similarly,employees must place nonambulatory animals,as well as other sick and disabled livestock,in covered pens sufficient to protect the animals from adverse climatic conditions.see d c.
the fmia contains an express preemption provision,at issue here,addressing state laws on these and similar matters.that provision first sentence reads 
requirements within the scope of this act with respect to premises,facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided under this act which are in addition to,or different than those made under this act may not be imposed by any state.
in,the humane society of the united states released an undercover video showing workers at a slaughterhouse in california dragging,kicking,and sick and disabled cows in an effort to move them.the video led the federal government to institute the largest beef recall in history in order to prevent consumption of meat from diseased animals.of greater relevance here,the video also prompted the california legislature to strengthen a statute governing the treatment of nonambulatory animals and to apply that statute to slaughterhouses regulated under the fmia.see national meat brown.
as amended,the california law of the state penal code provides in relevant part 
a no slaughterhouse,stockyard,auction,market agency,or dealer shall buy,sell,or receive a nonambulatory animal.
b no slaughterhouse shall process,butcher,or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human consumption.
c no slaughterhouse shall hold a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.cal.penal code ann.west.
the maximum penalty for violating any of these prohibitions is one year in jail and a fine.see h.
petitioner national meat association nma is a trade association representing meatpackers and processors,operators of swine slaughterhouses.it sued to enjoin the enforcement of against those slaughterhouses,principally on the ground that the fmia preempts application of the state law the district court granted the nma motion for a preliminary injunction,reasoning that is expressly preempted because it requires swine to be handled in a manner other than that prescribed by the fmia and its regulations.app.to pet.for cert.but the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated the injunction.according to that court,the fmia does not expressly preempt because the state law regulates only the kind of animal that may be slaughtered,and not the inspection or slaughtering process itself,at.
we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
the fmia preemption clause sweeps widely and in so doing,blocks the applications of challenged here.the clause prevents a state from imposing any additional or different even if requirements that fall within the scope of the act and concern a slaughterhouse facilities or operations.and at every turn imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses it compels them to deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal act and regulations do not.in essence,california statute substitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the fsis uses.where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig,under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.
consider first what the two statutes tell a slaughterhouse to do when as not infrequently occurs a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to the slaughterhouse section c prohibits the slaughterhouse from hold ing such an animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize it.and b provides that no part of the animal carcass may be process ed or butcher ed to make food.by contrast,under the fmia and its regulations,a slaughterhouse may hold without euthanizing any nonambulatory pig that has not been condemned.see supra,at.and the slaughterhouse may process or butcher such an animal meat for human consumption,subject to an fsis official approval at a inspection.see ibid.the state proscriptions thus exceed the fmia.to be sure,nothing in the federal act requires what the state law forbids or forbids what the state law requires california is right to note that t he fmia does not mandate that suspect nonambulatory animals be placed into the human food production process.brief for state respondents.but that is irrelevant,because the fmia preemption clause covers not just conflicting,but also different or additional state requirements.it therefore precludes california effort in b and c to new rules,beyond any the fsis has chosen to adopt,on what a slaughterhouse must do with a pig that nonambulatory during the production process.
similarly,consider how the state and federal laws address what a slaughterhouse should do when a pig is at the time of delivery,usually because of harsh transportation conditions section a of the california law bars a slaughterhouse from receiv ing or buy ing such a pig,thus obligating the slaughterhouse to refuse delivery of the animal but that directive,too,deviates from any imposed by federal law.a regulation issued under the fmia specifically authorizes slaughterhouses to buy disabled or diseased animals including nonambulatory swine,by exempting them from a general prohibition on such purchases.see cfr c.and other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses will in fact take,rather than refuse,receipt of nonambulatory swine.recall that the fmia regulations provide for the inspection of all pigs at delivery,see supra,at in the case of nonambulatory pigs,often right on the truck,see humane handling and slaughter of livestock,fsis directive,ch.ii i.they further instruct slaughterhouses to kill and dispose of any nonambulatory pigs labeled condemned,and to slaughter separately those marked suspect.see supra,at.in short,federal law establishes rules for handling and slaughtering pigs brought to a slaughterhouse,rather than ordering them returned to sender.so a and the fmia require different things of a slaughterhouse confronted with a delivery truck containing nonambulatory swine.the former says do not receive or buy them the latter does not.
the humane society counters that at least a ban on buying nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because that provision applies no matter when or where a purchase takes place.the argument proceeds in three steps a ban covers purchases of pigs made prior to delivery,away from the slaughterhouse itself say,at
