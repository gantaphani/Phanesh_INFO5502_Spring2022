respondent,the public company accounting oversight board,was created as part of a series of accounting reforms in the act of.the board is composed of five members appointed by the securities and exchange commission.it was modeled on private organizations in the securities industry such as the new york stock exchange that investigate and discipline their own members subject to commission oversight.unlike these organizations,the board is a entity with expansive powers to govern an entire industry.every accounting firm that audits public companies under the securities laws must register with the board,pay it an annual fee,and comply with its rules and oversight.the board may inspect registered firms,initiate formal investigations,and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.the parties agree that the board is part of the government for constitutional purposes,lebron national railroad passenger corporation,and that its members are officers of the united states who exercis e significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states,buckley valeo.while the sec has oversight of the board,it can not remove board members at will,but only for good cause shown,in accordance with specified procedures.e,d.the parties also agree that the commissioners,in turn,can not themselves be removed by the president except for inefficiency,neglect of duty,or malfeasance in office.humphrey executor united states.
the board inspected petitioner accounting firm,released a report critical of its auditing procedures,and began a formal investigation.the firm and petitioner free enterprise fund,a nonprofit organization of which the firm is a member,sued the board and its members,seeking,inter alia,a declaratory judgment that the board is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the board from exercising its powers.petitioners argued that the act contravened the separation of powers by conferring executive power on board members without subjecting them to presidential control.the basis for petitioners challenge was that board members were insulated from presidential control by two layers of tenure protection board members could only be removed by the commission for good cause,and the commissioners could in turn only be removed by the president for good cause.petitioners also challenged the board appointment as violating the appointments clause,which requires officers to be appointed by the president with the senate advice and consent,or in the case of inferior officers by the president alone,the courts of law,or the heads of departments,art.ii,cl.the united states intervened to defend the statute.the district court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to respondents.the court of appeals affirmed.it first agreed that the district court had jurisdiction.it then ruled that the dual restraints on board members removal are permissible,and that board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent with the appointments clause.
the district court had jurisdiction over these claims.the commission may review any board rule or sanction,and an aggrieved party may challenge the commission final order or rule in a court of appeals under.the government reads as an exclusive route to review,but the text does not expressly or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.it is presumed that congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review if the suit is wholly collateral to a statute review provisions and if the claims are outside the agency expertise.thunder basin coal reich.
these considerations point against any limitation on review here.section provides only for review of commission action,and petitioners challenge is collateral to any commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.the government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a board sanction,but petitioners have not been sanctioned,and it is no meaningful avenue of relief,thunder basin,supra,at,to require a plaintiff to incur a sanction in order to test a law validity,medimmune,genentech.petitioners constitutional claims are also outside the commission competence and expertise,and the statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations of agency policy.
the dual limitations on the removal of board members contravene the constitution separation of powers.
a the constitution provides that t he executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america.art.ii,cl.since,the constitution has been understood to empower the president to keep executive officers accountable by removing them from office,if necessary.see generally myers united states.this court has determined that this authority is not without limit.in humphrey executor,supra,this court held that congress can,under certain circumstances,create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the president,whom the president may not remove at will but only for good cause.and in united states perkins,and morrison olson,the court sustained similar restrictions on the power of principal executive officers themselves responsible to the president to remove their own inferiors.however,this court has not addressed the consequences of more than one level of tenure.
b where this court has upheld limited restrictions on the president removal power,only one level of protected tenure separated the president from an officer exercising executive power.the president or a subordinate he could remove at will decided whether the officer conduct merited removal under the standard.here,the act not only protects board members from removal except for good cause,but withdraws from the president any decision on whether that good cause exists.that decision is vested in other tenured officers the commissioners who are not subject to the president direct control.because the commission can not remove a board member at will,the president can not hold the commission fully accountable for the board conduct.he can only review the commissioner determination of whether the act rigorous standard is met.and if the president disagrees with that determination,he is powerless to intervene unless the determination is so unreasonable as to constitute inefficiency,neglect of duty,or malfeasance in office.humphrey executor,supra,at.
this arrangement contradicts article ii vesting of the executive power in the president.without the ability to oversee the board,or to attribute the board failings to those whom he can oversee,the president is no longer the judge of the board conduct.he can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed,nor be held responsible for a board member breach of faith.if this dispersion of responsibility were allowed to stand,congress could multiply it further by adding still more layers of tenure.such diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability without a clear and effective chain of command,the public can not determine where the blame for a pernicious measure should fall.the act restrictions are therefore incompatible with the constitution separation of powers.
c the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient,convenient,and useful in facilitating functions of government,standing alone,will not save it if it is contrary to the constitution.bowsher synar.the act multilevel tenure protections provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.congress controls the salary,duties,and existence of executive offices,and only presidential oversight can counter its influence.the framers created a structure in which a dependence on the people would be the primary controul on the government,and that dependence is maintained by giving each branch the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.the federalist.a key constitutional means vested in the president was the power of appointing,overseeing,and controlling those who execute the laws.annals of congress.while a government of opposite and rival interests may sometimes inhibit the smooth functioning of administration,the federalist,at,t he framers recognized that,in the long term,structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.bowsher,supra,at.
d the government errs in arguing that,even if some constraints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the constitution,the restrictions here do not.there is no construction of the commission removal power that is broad enough to avoid invalidation.nor is the commission broad power over board functions the equivalent of a power to remove board members.altering the board budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control an inferior officer the commission can not supervise individual board members if it must destroy the board in order to fix it.moreover,the commission power over the board is hardly plenary,as the board may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of the commission.enacting new sec rules through the required notice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micromanaging the board,and without certain findings,the act forbids any general rule requiring sec preapproval of board actions.finally,the act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of removal.
the unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.because t he unconstitutionality of a part of an act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions,champlin refining corporation comm of,the normal rule is that partial invalidation is the required course,brockett spokane arcades.the board existence does not violate the separation of powers,but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by e and d do.concluding that the removal restrictions here are invalid leaves the board removable by the commission at will.with the tenure restrictions excised,the act remains fully operative as a law,new york united states,and nothing in the act text or historical context makes it evident that congress would have preferred no board at all to a board whose members are removable at will,alaska airlines,brock.the consequence is that the board may continue to function as before,but its members may be removed at will by the commission.
the board appointment is consistent with the appointments clause.
a the board members are inferior officers whose appointment congress may permissibly vest in a hea d of departmen t.inferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by superiors appointed by the president with the senate consent.edmond united states.because the restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and void,the commission possesses the power to remove board members at will,in addition to its other oversight authority.board members are therefore directed and supervised by the commission.
b the commission is a departmen t under the appointments clause.freytag commissioner,specifically reserved the question whether a principal agenc y,such as the sec,is a departmen t.the court now adopts the reasoning of the concurring justices in freytag,who would have concluded that the sec is such a departmen t because it is a freestanding component of the executive branch not subordinate to or contained within any other such component.this reading is consistent with the common,definition of a department with the early practice of congress,see,stat.and with this court cases,which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment.
c the several commissioners,and not the chairman,are the commission hea d.the commission powers are generally vested in the commissioners jointly,not the chairman alone.the commissioners do not report to the chairman,who exercises administrative functions subject to the full commission policies.there is no reason why a multimember body may not be the hea d of a departmen t that it governs.the appointments clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the courts of law,art.ii,cl,and each house of congress appoints its officers collectively,see,art.i,cl.practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.

chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
our constitution divided the powers of the new federal government into three defined categories,legislative,executive,and judicial.ins chadha.article ii vests t he executive power in a president of the united states of america,who must take care that the laws be faithfully executed.art.ii,cl.in light of t he impossibility that one man should be able to perform all the great business of the state,the constitution provides for executive officers to assist the supreme magistrate in discharging the duties of his trust.writings of george washington fitzpatrick ed.
since,the constitution has been understood to empower the president to keep these officers accountable by removing them from office,if necessary.see generally myers united states.this court has determined,however,that this authority is not without limit.in humphrey executor united states,we held that congress can,under certain circumstances,create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the president,whom the president may not remove at will but only for good cause.likewise,in united states perkins,and morrison olson,the court sustained similar restrictions on the power of principal executive officers themselves responsible to the president to remove their own inferiors.the parties do not ask us to reexamine any of these precedents,and we do not do so.
we are asked,however,to consider a new situation not yet encountered by the court.the question is whether these separate layers of protection may be combined.may the president be restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer,who is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an inferior officer,even though that inferior officer determines the policy and enforces the laws of the united states 
we hold that such multilevel protection from removal is contrary to article ii vesting of the executive power in the president.the president can not take care that the laws be faithfully executed if he can not oversee the faithfulness of the officers who execute them.here the president can not remove an officer who enjoys more than one level of protection,even if the president determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or discharging them improperly.that judgment is instead committed to another officer,who may or may not agree with the president determination,and whom the president can not remove simply because that officer disagrees with him.this contravenes the president constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.at.
after a series of celebrated accounting debacles,congress enacted the act of or act,stat.among other measures,the act introduced tighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new public company accounting oversight board.the board is composed of five members,appointed to staggered terms by the securities and exchange commission.it was modeled on private organizations in the securities industry such as the new york stock exchange that investigate and discipline their own members subject to commission oversight.congress created the board as a private nonprofit corporation,and board members and employees are not considered government officer s or employee s for statutory purposes.a,b.the board can thus recruit its members and employees from the private sector by paying salaries far above the standard government pay scale.see f,
unlike the organizations,however,the board is a,entity,with expansive powers to govern an entire industry.every accounting firm both foreign and domestic that participates in auditing public companies under the securities laws must register with the board,pay it an annual fee,and comply with its rules and oversight.a,a,f,a.the board is charged with enforcing the act,the securities laws,the commission rules,its own rules,and professional accounting standards.b,c.to this end,the board may regulate every detail of an accounting firm practice,including hiring and professional development,promotion,supervision of audit work,the acceptance of new business and the continuation of old,internal inspection procedures,professional ethics rules,and such other requirements as the board may prescribe.a b.

the act places the board under the sec oversight,particularly with respect to the issuance of rules or the imposition of sanctions both of which are subject to commission approval and alteration.b c.but the individual members of the board like the officers and directors of the organizations are substantially insulated from the commission control.the commission can not remove board members at will,but only for good cause shown,in accordance with certain procedures.e.

before the district court,petitioners argued that the act contravened the separation of powers by conferring executive power on board members without subjecting them to presidential control,at.petitioners also challenged the act under the appointments clause,which requires officers of the united states to be appointed by the president with the senate advice and consent.art.ii,cl.the clause provides an exception for inferior officers,whose appointment congress may choose to vest in the president alone,in the courts of law,or in the heads of departments.ibid.because the board is appointed by the sec,petitioners argued that board members are not inferior officers who may be appointed by heads of departments even if they are,the commission is not a departmen t and even if it is,the several commissioners as opposed to the chairman are not its hea d.see app.the united states intervened to defend the act constitutionality.both sides moved for summary judgment the district court determined that it had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to respondents.app.to pet.for cert.
a divided court of appeals affirmed.cadc.it agreed that the district court had jurisdiction over petitioners claims,at.on the merits,the court of appeals recognized that the removal issue was a question of first impression,as neither that court nor this one ha d considered a situation where a restriction on removal passes through two levels of control.at.it ruled that the dual restraints on board members removal are permissible because they do not render the president unable to perform his constitutional duties.at.the majority reasoned that although the president does not directly select or supervise the board members,at,the board is subject to the comprehensive control of the commission,and thus the president influence over the commission implies a constitutionally sufficient influence over the board as well,at.the majority also held that board members are inferior officers subject to the commission direction and supervision,at,and that their appointment is otherwise consistent with the appointments clause,at.
judge kavanaugh dissented.he agreed that the case was one of first impression,at,but argued that the double removal provisions in the act combine to eliminate any meaningful presidential control over the board,at.judge kavanaugh also argued that board members are not effectively supervised by the commission and thus can not be inferior officers under the appointments clause,at.
we granted certiorari.
we first consider whether the district court had jurisdiction.we agree with both courts below that the statutes providing for judicial review of commission action did not prevent the district court from considering petitioners claims.
the act empowers the commission to review any board rule or sanction.see b,c.once the commission has acted,aggrieved parties may challenge a final order of the commission or a rule of the commission in a court of appeals under,and n o objection may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.a,b,c.
the government reads as an exclusive route to review.but the text does not expressly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.see.nor does it do so implicitly.provisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review unless the statutory scheme displays a fairly discernible intent to limit jurisdiction,and the claims at issue are of the type congress intended to be reviewed within th e statutory structure.thunder basin coal reich,internal quotation marks omitted.generally,when congress creates procedures designed to permit agency expertise to be brought to bear on particular problems,those procedures are to be exclusive.whitney nat.bank in jefferson parish bank of new orleans trust.but we presume that congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review if the suit is wholly collateral to a statute review provisions and if the claims are outside the agency expertise.thunder basin,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.these considerations point against any limitation on review here.
we do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pursue their constitutional claims under the government theory.section provides only for judicial review of commission action,and not every board action is encapsulated in a final commission order or rule.
the government suggests that petitioners could first have sought commission review of the board auditing standards,registration requirements,or other rules.brief for united states.but petitioners object to the board existence,not to any of its auditing standards.petitioners general challenge to the board is collateral to any commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.mcnary haitian refugee center.requiring petitioners to select and challenge a board rule at random is an odd procedure for congress to choose,especially because only new rules,and not existing ones,are subject to challenge.see b,a,b.
alternatively,the government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a board sanction.brief for united states.but the investigation of beckstead and watts produced no sanction,see,at,reply brief for petitioners,hereinafter reply brief,and an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject to judicial review,see h.so the government proposes that beckstead and watts incur a sanction such as a sizable fine by ignoring board requests for documents and testimony.brief for united states.if the commission then affirms,the firm will win access to a court of appeals and severe punishment should its challenge fail.we normally do not require plaintiffs to bet the farm by taking the violative action before testing the validity of the law,medimmune,genentech,accord,ex parte young,and we do not consider this a meaningful avenue of relief.thunder basin,at.
petitioners constitutional claims are also outside the commission competence and expertise.in thunder basin,the petitioner primary claims were statutory at root they ar o se under the mine act and f e ll squarely within the agency expertise,given that the agency had extensive experience on the issue and had recently addressed the precise claims presented.at.likewise,in united states ruzicka,on which the government relies,we reserved for the agency inquiries that,even if formulated in constitutional terms,rested ultimately on factors that call for an understanding of the milk industry,to which the court made no pretensions,at.no similar expertise is required here,and the statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations of agency policy.johnson robison.they are instead standard questions of administrative law,which the courts are at no disadvantage in answering.
we therefore conclude that did not strip the district court of jurisdiction over these claims,which are properly presented for our review 
we hold that the dual limitations on the removal of board members contravene the constitution separation of powers.
the constitution provides that t he executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america.art.ii,cl.as madison stated on the floor of the first congress,if any power whatsoever is in its nature executive,it is the power of appointing,overseeing,and controlling those who execute the laws.annals of cong.
the removal of executive officers was discussed extensively in congress when the first executive departments were created.the view that prevailed,as most consonant to the text of the constitution and to the requisite responsibility and harmony in the executive department,was that the executive power included a power to oversee executive officers through removal because that traditional executive power was not expressly taken away,it remained with the president.letter from james madison to thomas jefferson june,documentary history of the first federal congress.this decision of provides contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the constitution meaning since many of the members of the first congress had taken part in framing that instrument.bowsher synar,internal quotation marks omitted.and it soon became the settled and well understood construction of the constitution.ex parte hennen,pet.
the landmark case of myers united states reaffirmed the principle that article ii confers on the president the general administrative control of those executing the laws.at.it is his responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.the buck stops with the president,in harry truman famous phrase.as we explained in myers,the president therefore must have some power of removing those for whom he can not continue to be responsible.at.
nearly a decade later in humphrey executor,this court held that myers did not prevent congress from conferring tenure on the principal officers of certain independent agencies.that case concerned the members of the federal trade commission,who held terms and could not be removed by the president except for inefficiency,neglect of duty,or malfeasance in office.at quoting.the court distinguished myers on the ground that myers concerned an officer who is merely one of the units in the executive department and,hence,inherently subject to the exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the chief executive,whose subordinate and aid he is.at.by contrast,the court characterized the ftc as and rather than purely executive,and held that congress could require it to act independently of executive control.at.because one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another,can not be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter will,the court held that congress had power to fix the period during which the commissioners shall continue in office,and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.at.
humphrey executor did not address the removal of inferior officers,whose appointment congress may vest in heads of departments.if congress does so,it is ordinarily the department head,rather than the president,who enjoys the power of removal.see myers,supra,at,hennen,supra,at.this court has upheld limitations on that power as well.
in perkins,a naval was honorably discharged from the navy because his services were no longer required.he brought a claim for his salary under statutes barring his peacetime discharge except by a or by the secretary of the navy for misconduct.stat.this court adopted verbatim the reasoning of the court of claims,which had held that when congress vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads of departments,it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest.at.because perkins had not been dismissed for misconduct or upon the sentence of a,the court agreed that he was still in office and entitled to his pay.ibid 
we again considered the status of inferior officers in morrison.that case concerned the ethics in government act,which provided for an independent counsel to investigate allegations of crime by high executive officers.the counsel was appointed by a special court,wielded the full powers of a prosecutor,and was removable by the attorney general only for good cause.at quoting a.we recognized that the independent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer,rather than or but we stated as our present considered view that congress had power to impose restrictions on her removal,at.the court noted that the statute g a ve the attorney general,an officer directly responsible to the president and through whom the president could act,several means of supervising or controlling the independent counsel m ost importantly the power to remove the counsel for good cause.at internal quotation marks omitted.under those circumstances,the court sustained the statute.morrison did not,however,address the consequences of more than one level of tenure leaving the issue,as both the court and dissent below recognized,a question of first impression in this court,at see,at dissenting opinion.
as explained,we have previously upheld limited restrictions on the president removal power.in those cases,however,only one level of protected tenure separated the president from an officer exercising executive power.it was the president or a subordinate he could remove at will who decided whether the officer conduct merited removal under the standard.
the act before us does something quite different.it not only protects board members from removal except for good cause,but withdraws from the president any decision on whether that good cause exists.that decision is vested instead in other tenured officers the commissioners none of whom is subject to the president direct control.the result is a board that is not accountable to the president,and a president who is not responsible for the board.
the added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.without a layer of insulation between the commission and the board,the commission could remove a board member at any time,and therefore would be fully responsible for what the board does.the president could then hold the commission to account for its supervision of the board,to the same extent that he may hold the commission to account for everything else it does.
a second level of tenure protection changes the nature of the president review.now the commission can not remove a board member at will.the president therefore can not hold the commission fully accountable for the board conduct,to the same extent that he may hold the commission accountable for everything else that it does.the commissioners are not responsible for the board actions.they are only responsible for their own determination of whether the act rigorous standard is met.and even if the president disagrees with their determination,he is powerless to intervene unless that determination is so unreasonable as to constitute inefficiency,neglect of duty,or malfeasance in office.humphrey executor,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this novel structure does not merely add to the board independence,but transforms it.neither the president,nor anyone directly responsible to him,nor even an officer whose conduct he may review only for good cause,has full control over the board.the president is stripped of the power our precedents have preserved,and his ability to execute the laws by holding his subordinates accountable for their conduct is impaired.
that arrangement is contrary to article ii vesting of the executive power in the president.without the ability to oversee the board,or to attribute the board failings to those whom he can oversee,the president is no longer the judge of the board conduct.he is not the one who decides whether board members are abusing their offices or neglecting their duties.he can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed,nor be held responsible for a board member breach of faith.this violates the basic principle that the president can not delegate ultimate responsibility or the active obligation to supervise that goes with it,because article ii makes a single president responsible for the actions of the executive branch.clinton jones,breyer,concurring in judgment 
indeed,if allowed to stand,this dispersion of responsibility could be multiplied.if congress can shelter the bureaucracy behind two layers of tenure,why not a third at oral argument,the government was unwilling to concede that even five layers between the president and the board would be too many.tr.of oral arg.the officers of such an agency safely encased within a matryoshka doll of tenure protections would be immune from presidential oversight,even as they exercised power in the people name.
perhaps an individual president might find advantages in tying his own hands.but the separation of powers does not depend on the views of individual presidents,see freytag commissioner,nor on whether the branch approves the encroachment,new york united states.the president can always choose to restrain himself in his dealings with subordinates.he can not,however,choose to bind his successors by diminishing their powers,nor can he escape responsibility for his choices by pretending that they are not his own.
the diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability.the people do not vote for the officers of the united states.art.ii,cl.they instead look to the president to guide the assistants or deputies subject to his superintendence.the federalist,cooke ed.hamilton.without a clear and effective chain of command,the public can not determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure,or series of pernicious measures ought really to fall.at same.that is why the framers sought to ensure that those who are employed in the execution of the law will be in their proper situation,and the chain of dependence be preserved the lowest officers,the middle grade,and the highest,will depend,as they ought,on the president,and the president on the community.annals of,at madison.
by granting the board executive power without the executive oversight,this act subverts the president ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed as well as the public ability to pass judgment on his efforts.the act restrictions are incompatible with the constitution separation of powers.
respondents and the dissent resist this conclusion,portraying the board as the kind of practical accommodation between the legislature and the executive that should be permitted in a workable government.metropolitan washington airports authority citizens for abatement of aircraft noise,mwaa quoting youngstown sheet tube sawyer,jackson,concurring see,post,at opinion of breyer.according to the dissent,congress may impose multiple levels of tenure between the president and his subordinates when it rests agency independence upon the need for technical expertise.post,at.the board mission is said to demand both technical competence and apolitical expertise,and its powers may only be exercised by technical professional experts.post,at internal quotation marks omitted.in this respect the statute creating the board is,we are told,simply one example of the vast numbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects,concerned with vast numbers of different problems,that provide for,or foresee,their execution or administration through the work of administrators organized within many different kinds of administrative structures,exercising different kinds of administrative authority,to achieve their legislatively mandated objectives.post,at.
no one doubts congress power to create a vast and varied federal bureaucracy.but where,in all this,is the role for oversight by an elected president the constitution requires that a president chosen by the entire nation oversee the execution of the laws.and the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient,convenient,and useful in facilitating functions of government,standing alone,will not save it if it is contrary to the constitution,for c onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives or the hallmarks of democratic government.bowsher,at quoting chadha,at.
one can have a government that functions without being ruled by functionaries,and a government that benefits from expertise without being ruled by experts.our constitution was adopted to enable the people to govern themselves,through their elected leaders.the growth of the executive branch,which now wields vast power and touches almost every aspect of daily life,heightens the concern that it may slip from the executive control,and thus from that of the people.this concern is largely absent from the dissent paean to the administrative state.
for example,the dissent dismisses the importance of removal as a tool of supervision,concluding that the president power to get something done more often depends on who controls the agency budget requests and funding,the relationships between one agency or department and another,purely political factors including congress ability to assert influence,and indeed whether particular unelected officials support or resist the president policies.post,at,emphasis deleted.the framers did not rest our liberties on such bureaucratic minutiae.as we said in bowsher,supra,at,t he separated powers of our government can not be permitted to turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exercising executive power is on good terms with congress.
in fact,the multilevel protection that the dissent endorses provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power.mwaa,supra,at.in a system of checks and balances,p ower abhors a vacuum,and one branch handicap is another strength,at,kavanaugh,dissenting internal quotation marks omitted.even when a branch does not arrogate power to itself,therefore,it must not impair another in the performance of its constitutional duties.loving united states,congress has plenary control over the salary,duties,and even existence of executive offices.only presidential oversight can counter its influence.that is why the constitution vests certain powers in the president that the legislature has no right to diminish or modify.annals of,at madison 
the framers created a structure in which a dependence on the people would be the primary controul on the government.the federalist,at madison.that dependence is maintained,not just by parchment barriers,at same,but by letting a mbition counteract ambition,giving each branch the necessary constitutional means,and personal motives,to resist encroachments of the others,at.a key constitutional means vested in the president perhaps the key means was the power of appointing,overseeing,and controlling those who execute the laws.annals of,at.and while a government of opposite and rival interests may sometimes inhibit the smooth functioning of administration,the federalist,at,t he framers recognized that,in the long term,structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.bowsher,supra,at.
calls to abandon those protections in light of the era perceived necessity,new york,at,are not unusual.nor is the argument from bureaucratic expertise limited only to the field of accounting.the failures of accounting regulation may be a pressing national problem,but a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional government with each issue of comparable gravity would,in the long run,be far worse.at.neither respondents nor the dissent explains why the board task,unlike so many others,requires more than one layer of insulation from the president or,for that matter,why only two.the point is not to take issue with limitations in general we do not do that.the question here is far more modest.we deal with the unusual situation,never before addressed by the court,of two layers of tenure.and though it may be criticized as elementary arithmetical logic,post,at,two layers are not the same as one.
the president has been given the power to oversee executive officers he is not limited,as in harry truman lament,to persuad ing his unelected subordinates to do what they ought to do without persuasion.post,at internal quotation marks omitted.in its pursuit of a workable government,congress can not reduce the chief magistrate to a.
the united states concedes that some constraints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the constitution.see brief for united states.it contends,however,that the removal restrictions at issue here do not.
to begin with,the government argues that the commission removal power over the board is broad,and could be construed as broader still,if necessary to avoid invalidation.see,at,and pcaob brief.but the government does not contend that simple disagreement with the board policies or priorities could constitute good cause for its removal.see tr.of oral arg.nor do our precedents suggest as much.humphrey executor,for example,rejected a removal premised on a lack of agreement on either the policies or the administering of the federal trade commission,because the ftc was designed to be independent in character,free from political domination or control,and not subject to anybody in the government or to the orders of the president.at.accord,morrison,at noting that the congressional determination to limit the removal power of the attorney general was essential to establish the necessary independence of the office wiener united states,describing removal as involving the rectitude of an officer.and here there is judicial review of any effort to remove board members,see a,so the commission will not have the final word on the propriety of its own removal orders.the removal restrictions set forth in the statute mean what they say.
indeed,this case presents an even more serious threat to executive control than an ordinary dual standard.congress enacted an unusually high standard that must be met before board members may be removed.a board member can not be removed except for willful violations of the act,board rules,or the securities laws willful abuse of authority or unreasonable failure to enforce compliance as determined in a formal commission order,rendered on the record and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.d see a.the act does not even give the commission power to fire board members for violations of other laws that do not relate to the act,the securities laws,or the board authority.the president might have less than full confidence in,say,a board member who cheats on his taxes but that discovery is not listed among the grounds for removal under d 
the rigorous standard that must be met before a board member may be removed was drawn from statutes concerning private organizations like the new york stock exchange.h,d.while we need not decide the question here,a removal standard appropriate for limiting government control over private bodies may be inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power of the united states.
alternatively,respondents portray the act limitations on removal as irrelevant,because as the court of appeals held the commission wields removal power over board functions if not board members.at emphasis added accord,brief for united states pcaob brief.the commission general oversight and enforcement authority over the board,a,is said to blun t the constitutional impact of removal,at,and to leave the president no worse off than if congress had lodged the board functions in the sec own staff,pcaob brief.
broad power over board functions is not equivalent to the power to remove board members.the commission may,for example,approve the board budget,b,issue binding regulations,a,b,relieve the board of authority,d,amend board sanctions,c,or enforce board rules on its own,b,c.but altering the budget or powers of an agency as a whole is a problematic way to control an inferior officer.the commission can not wield a free hand to supervise individual members if it must destroy the board in order to fix it.
even if commission power over board activities could substitute for authority over its members,we would still reject respondents premise that the commission power in this regard is plenary.as described above,the board is empowered to take significant enforcement actions,and does so largely independently of the commission.see supra,at.its powers are,of course,subject to some latent commission control.see supra,at.but the act nowhere gives the commission effective power to start,stop,or alter individual board investigations,executive activities typically carried out by officials within the executive branch.
the government and the dissent suggest that the commission could govern and direct the board daily exercise of prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new sec rules,or by amending those of the board.brief for united states post,at.enacting general rules through the required notice and comment procedures is obviously a poor means of micromanaging the board affairs.see c,b,b,a,pcaob brief,so the government offers another proposal,that the commission require the board by rule to secure sec approval for any actions that it now may take itself.brief for united states.that would surely constitute one of the limitations upon the activities,functions,and operations of the board that the act forbids,at least without commission findings equivalent to those required to fire the board instead.d.the board thus has significant independence in determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs of regulated firms and the lives of their associated persons without commission preapproval or direction.
finally,respondents suggest that our conclusion is contradicted by the past practice of congress.but the act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of removal including at one level a sharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes good cause,and rigorous procedures that must be followed prior to removal.
the parties have identified only a handful of isolated positions in which inferior officers might be protected by two levels of tenure.see,pcaob brief.as judge kavanaugh noted in dissent below 
perhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with the pcaob is the lack of historical precedent for this entity.neither the majority opinion nor the pcaob nor the united states as intervenor has located any historical analogues for this novel structure.they have not identified any independent agency other than the pcaob that is appointed by and removable only for cause by another independent agency.at.
the dissent here suggests that other such positions might exist,and complains that we do not resolve their status in this opinion.post,at.the dissent itself,however,stresses the very size and variety of the federal government,see post,at,and those features discourage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed nor argued here.in any event,the dissent fails to support its premonitions of doom none of the positions it identifies are similarly situated to the board.see post,at.
for example,many civil servants within independent agencies would not qualify as officers of the united states,who exercis e significant authority pursuant to the laws of the united states,buckley,at the parties here concede that board members are executive officers,as that term is used in the constitution.see supra,at see also art.ii,cl.we do not decide the status of other government employees,nor do we decide whether lesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the united states must be subject to the same sort of control as those who exercise significant authority pursuant to the laws.buckley,supra,at,and.
nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy the same significant and unusual protections from presidential oversight as members of the board.senior or policymaking positions in government may be excepted from the competitive service to ensure presidential control,see a b,b,and members of the senior executive service may be reassigned or reviewed by agency heads and entire agencies may be excluded from that service by the president,see,c,a,d,b,c a b ii.while the full extent of that authority is not before us,any such authority is of course wholly absent with respect to the board.nothing in our opinion,therefore,should be read to cast doubt on the use of what is colloquially known as the civil service system within independent agencies 
finally,the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests that today opinion might increase the president authority to remove military officers.without expressing any view whatever on the scope of that authority,it is enough to note that we see little analogy between our nation armed services and the public company accounting oversight board.military officers are broadly subject to presidential control through the chain of command and through the president powers as commander in chief.art.ii,cl.see,g.the president and his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry or to hear claims of misconduct or poor performance by those officers.see,a,a.here,by contrast,the president has no authority to initiate a board member removal for cause.
there is no reason for us to address whether these positions identified by the dissent,or any others not at issue in this case,are so structured as to infringe the president constitutional authority.nor is there any substance to the dissent concern that the work of all these various officials will be put on hold.post,at.as the judgment in this case demonstrates,restricting certain officers to a single level of insulation from the president affects the conditions under which those officers might some day be removed,and would have no effect,absent a congressional determination to the contrary,on the validity of any officer continuance in office.the only issue in this case is whether congress may deprive the president of adequate control over the board,which is the regulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement authority for a vital sector of our economy.we hold that it can not.
petitioners complaint argued that the board freedom from presidential oversight and control rendered it and all power and authority exercised by it in violation of the constitution.app.we reject such a broad holding.instead,we agree with the government that the unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.
generally speaking,when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute,we try to limit the solution to the problem,severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.ayotte planned parenthood of northern new.because t he unconstitutionality of a part of an act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions,champlin refining corporation comm of,the normal rule is that partial,rather than facial,invalidation is the required course,brockett spokane arcades.putting to one side petitioners appointments clause challenges addressed below,the existence of the board does not violate the separation of powers,but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by e and d do.under the traditional default rule,removal is incident to the power of appointment.see,sampson murray,myers,at ex parte hennen,at.concluding that the removal restrictions are invalid leaves the board removable by the commission at will,and leaves the president separated from board members by only a single level of tenure.the commission is then fully responsible for the board actions,which are no less subject than the commission own functions to presidential oversight.
the act remains fully operative as a law with these tenure restrictions excised.new york,at quoting alaska airlines,brock.we therefore must sustain its remaining provisions u nless it is evident that the legislature would not have enacted those provisions independently of that which is invalid.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.though this inquiry can sometimes be elusive,chadha,at,the answer here seems clear the remaining provisions are not incapable of functioning independently,alaska airlines,at,and nothing in the statute text or historical context makes it evident that congress,faced with the limitations imposed by the constitution,would have preferred no board at all to a board whose members are removable at will.see also ayotte,supra,at.
it is true that the language providing for removal is only one of a number of statutory provisions that,working together,produce a constitutional violation.in theory,perhaps,the court might a sufficient number of the board responsibilities so that its members would no longer be officers of the united states.or we could restrict the board enforcement powers,so that it would be a purely recommendatory panel.or the board members could in future be made removable by the president,for good cause or at will.but such editorial freedom far more extensive than our holding today belongs to the legislature,not the judiciary.congress of course remains free to pursue any of these options going forward.
petitioners raise three more challenges to the board under the appointments clause.none has merit.
first,petitioners argue that board members are principal officers requiring presidential appointment with the senate advice and consent.we held in edmond united states,that w hether one is an inferior officer depends on whether he has a superior,and that inferior officers are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level by other officers appointed by the president with the senate consent.in particular,we noted that t he power to remove officers at will and without cause is a powerful tool for control of an inferior,at.as explained above,the statutory restrictions on the commission power to remove board members are unconstitutional and void.given that the commission is properly viewed,under the constitution,as possessing the power to remove board members at will,and given the commission other oversight authority,we have no hesitation in concluding that under edmond the board members are inferior officers whose appointment congress may permissibly vest in a hea d of departmen t.
but,petitioners argue,the commission is not a departmen t like the executive departments state,treasury,defense listed in.in freytag,at,we specifically reserved the question whether a principal agenc y,such as the securities and exchange commission,is a departmen t under the appointments clause.four justices,however,would have concluded that the commission is indeed such a departmen t,see,at scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment,because it is a entity in the executive branch,at.
respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those entities not addressed by our opinion in freytag,see brief for united states pcaob brief,and we do.respondents reading of the appointments clause is consistent with the common,definition of a department as a separate allotment or part of business a distinct province,in which a class of duties are allotted to a particular person.webster,american dictionary of the english language def.facsimile ed.it is also consistent with the early practice of congress,which in authorized the postmaster general to appoint an assistant,and deputy postmasters,at all places where such shall be found necessary,stat.thus treating him as the hea d of a departmen t without the title of secretary or any role in the president cabinet.and it is consistent with our prior cases,which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment.see freytag,supra,at burnap united states,united states germaine.because the commission is a freestanding component of the executive branch,not subordinate to or contained within any other such component,it constitutes a departmen t for the purposes of the appointments clause 
but petitioners are not done yet.they argue that the full commission can not constitutionally appoint board members,because only the chairman of the commission is the commission hea d.the commission powers,however,are generally vested in the commissioners jointly,not the chairman alone.see.the commissioners do not report to the chairman,who exercises administrative and executive functions subject to the full commission policies.see reorg.plan of,b,stat.the chairman is also appointed from among the commissioners by the president alone,at,which means that he can not be regarded as the head of an agency for purposes of the reorganization act.see.the commission as a whole,on the other hand,does meet the requirements of the act,including its provision that the head of an agency may be an individual or a commission or board with more than one member.
as a constitutional matter,we see no reason why a multimember body may not be the hea d of a departmen t that it governs.the appointments clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the courts of law,art.ii,cl,and each house of congress,too,appoints its officers collectively,see art.i,cl,cl.petitioners argue that the framers vested the nomination of principal officers in the president to avoid the perceived evils of collective appointments,but they reveal no similar concern with respect to inferior officers,whose appointments may be vested elsewhere,including in multimember bodies.practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.see freytag,supra,at scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment see also classification act of,ch,stat.defining the head of the department to mean the officer or group of officers who are not subordinate or responsible to any other officer of the department emphasis added op,endorsing collective appointment by the civil service commission.we conclude that the board members have been validly appointed by the full commission.
in light of the foregoing,petitioners are not entitled to broad injunctive relief against the board continued operations.but they are entitled to declaratory relief sufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and auditing standards to which they are subject will be enforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the executive.see bowsher,at,concluding that a separation of powers violation may create a injury that can be remedied by a court internal quotation marks omitted.
the constitution that makes the president accountable to the people for executing the laws also gives him the power to do so.that power includes,as a general matter,the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.without such power,the president could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities the buck would stop somewhere else.such diffusion of authority would greatly diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief magistrate himself.the federalist,at.
while we have sustained in certain cases limits on the president removal power,the act before us imposes a new type of restriction two levels of protection from removal for those who nonetheless exercise significant executive power.congress can not limit the president authority in this way.

justice breyer,with whom justice stevens,justice ginsburg,and justice sotomayor join,dissenting.
the court holds unconstitutional a statute providing that the securities and exchange commission can remove members of the public company accounting oversight board from office only for cause.it argues that granting the inferior officer s on the accounting board more than one level of protection contravenes the president constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.ante,at.i agree that the accounting board members are inferior officers.see ante,at.but in my view the statute does not significantly interfere with the president executive power.art.ii.it violates no principle.and the court contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the fair and efficient administration of the laws.i consequently dissent.
the legal question before us arises at the intersection of two general constitutional principles.on the one hand,congress has broad power to enact statutes necessary and proper to the exercise of its specifically enumerated constitutional authority.art.i,cl.as chief justice marshall wrote for the court nearly years ago,the necessary and proper clause reflects the framers efforts to create a constitution that would endure for ages to come.mcculloch maryland,wheat.it embodies their recognition that it would be unwise to prescribe the means by which government should,in all future time,execute its powers.ibid.such immutable rules would deprive the government of the needed flexibility to respond to future exigencies which,if foreseen at all,must have been seen dimly.ibid.thus the necessary and proper clause affords congress broad authority to create governmental offices and to structure those offices as it chooses.buckley valeo,per curiam lottery case.and congress has drawn on that power over the past century to create numerous federal agencies in response to various crises of human affairs as they have arisen.mcculloch,supra,at emphasis deleted.wong yang sung mcgrath.
on the other hand,the opening sections of articles i,ii,and iii of the constitution separately and respectively vest all legislative powers in congress,the executive power in the president,and the judicial power in the supreme court and such inferior courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish in doing so,these provisions imply a structural principle.see,miller french.and that principle,along with the instruction in article ii,that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,limits congress power to structure the federal government.see,ins chadha,freytag commissioner,northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,commodity futures trading comm schor.indeed,this court has held that the principle guarantees the president the authority to dismiss certain executive branch officials at will.myers united states.
but neither of these two principles is absolute in its application to removal cases.the necessary and proper clause does not grant congress power to free all executive branch officials from dismissal at the will of the president.ibid.nor does the principle grant the president an absolute authority to remove any and all executive branch officials at will.rather,depending on,say,the nature of the office,its function,or its subject matter,congress sometimes may,consistent with the constitution,limit the president authority to remove an officer from his post.see humphrey executor united states,overruling in part myers,supra morrison olson.and we must here decide whether the circumstances surrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.
in answering the question presented,we can not look to more specific constitutional text,such as the text of the appointments clause or the presentment clause,upon which the court has relied in other cases.see,chadha,supra,at buckley,supra,at.that is because,with the exception of the general vesting and take care language,the constitution is completely silent with respect to the power of removal from office.ex parte hennen,pet,see also morrison,supra,at scalia,dissenting there is,of course,no provision in the constitution stating who may remove executive officers 
nor does history offer significant help.the president power to remove executive branch officers was not discussed in the constitutional convention.myers,supra,at.the first congress enacted federal statutes that limited the president ability to oversee executive branch officials,including the comptroller of the united states,federal district attorneys precursors to today united states attorneys,and,to a lesser extent,the secretary of the treasury.see,lessig,readings by our unitary executive,cardozo,teifer,the constitutionality of independent officers as checks on abuses of executive power,casper,an essay in separation of powers some early versions and practices,mary,hereinafter casper bruff,balance of forces separation of powers in the administrative state.but those statutes did not directly limit the president authority to remove any of those officials a subject that was much disputed during the early history of this government,and upon which a great diversity of opinion was entertained.hennen,supra,at see also united states ex rel.goodrich guthrie,how,mclean,dissenting casper recounting the debate of.scholars,like members of this court,have continued to disagree,not only about the inferences that should be drawn from the inconclusive historical record,but also about the nature of the original disagreement.compare ante,at myers,supra,at majority opinion of taft,and prakash,new light on the decision of,cornell,with,myers,supra,at mcreynolds,dissenting corwin,tenure of office and the removal power under the constitution,colum,lessig sunstein,the president and the administration,colum,hereinafter lessig sunstein and fisher,president and congress power and policy.
nor does this court precedent fully answer the question presented.at least it does not clearly invalidate the provision in dispute.see part,infra.in myers,supra,the court invalidated for the first and only time a congressional statute on the ground that it unduly limited the president authority to remove an executive branch official.but soon thereafter the court expressly disapproved most of myers broad reasoning.see humphrey executor,at,overruling in part myers,supra wiener united states,stating that humphrey executor explicitly disapproved of much of the reasoning in myers.moreover,the court has since said that the essence of the decision in myers was the judgment that the constitution prevents congress from draw ing to itself the power to remove or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.morrison,supra,at emphasis added.and that feature of the statute a feature that would aggrandize the power of congress is not present here.congress has not granted itself any role in removing the members of the accounting board.freytag,at jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch emphasis added buckley,at same schor,at same bowsher synar,same.compare myers,supra,striking down statute where congress granted itself removal authority over executive branch official,with humphrey executor,supra,upholding statute where such aggrandizing was absent wiener,supra same morrison,supra same.
in short,the question presented lies at the intersection of two sets of conflicting,broadly framed constitutional principles.and no text,no history,perhaps no precedent provides any clear answer.chicago morales,thomas,joined by rehnquist,and scalia,dissenting expressing the view that this court is most vulnerable when it deals with constitutional law that lacks roots in the language of the constitution internal quotation marks omitted.
when previously deciding this kind of nontextual question,the court has emphasized the importance of examining how a particular provision,taken in context,is likely to function.thus,in crowell benson,a foundational case,the court said that regard must be had,as in other cases where constitutional limits are invoked,not to mere matters of form,but to the substance of what is required.the court repeated this injunction in schor and again in morrison.see schor,supra,at stating that the court must look beyond form to the substance of what congress has done morrison,at the analysis contained in our removal cases is designed not to define rigid categories of those officials who may or may not be removed at will by the president,but rather asks whether,given the functions of the officials in question,a removal provision interfere s with the president exercise of the executive power emphasis added.the court has thereby written into law justice jackson wise perception that the constitution contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government.youngstown sheet tube sawyer,opinion concurring in judgment emphasis added.see also ibid.the actual art of governing under our constitution does not and can not conform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated clauses or even single articles torn from context 
it is not surprising that the court in these circumstances has looked to function and context,and not to rules.for one thing,that approach embodies the intent of the framers.as chief justice marshall long ago observed,our constitution is fashioned so as to allow the three coordinate branches,including this court,to exercise practical judgment in response to changing conditions and exigencies,which at the time of the founding could be seen only dimly,and perhaps not at all.mcculloch,at.
for another,a functional approach permits congress and the president the flexibility needed to adapt statutory law to changing circumstances.that is why the powers conferred upon the federal government by the constitution were phrased in language broad enough to allow for the expansion of the federal government role over time.new york united states.indeed,the federal government at the time of the founding consisted of about employees and served a population of about million.see kaufman,the growth of the federal personnel system,in the federal government service,sayre ed.of commerce,census bureau,historical statistics of the united states colonial times to,pt.today,however,the federal government employs about million workers who serve a nation of more than million people living in a society characterized by rapid technological,economic,and social change.see office of management and budget,analytical perspectives,budget of the government,fiscal year.
federal statutes now require or permit government officials to provide,regulate,or otherwise administer,not only foreign affairs and defense,but also a wide variety of such subjects as taxes,welfare,social security,medicine,pharmaceutical drugs,education,highways,railroads,electricity,natural gas,nuclear power,financial instruments,banking,medical care,public health and safety,the environment,fair employment practices,consumer protection and much else besides.those statutes create a host of different organizational structures.sometimes they delegate administrative authority to the president directly,a c sometimes they place authority in a cabinet department,c b,supp.ii sometimes they delegate authority to an independent commission or board,b sometimes they place authority directly in the hands of a single senior administrator,c sometimes they place it in a bureau,office,division or other agency,sometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency task groups,ed.and supp.ii sometimes they vest it in commissions or advisory committees made up of members of more than one branch,a a,supp.ii sometimes they divide it among groups of departments,commissions,bureaus,divisions,and administrators,a,supp.ii g and sometimes they permit state or local governments to participate as well,a.statutes similarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers for example,the power to make rules,develop informal practices,investigate,adjudicate,impose sanctions,grant licenses,and provide goods,services,advice,and so forth.see generally et.
the upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects,concerned with vast numbers of different problems,provide for,or foresee,their execution or administration through the work of administrators organized within many different kinds of administrative structures,exercising different kinds of administrative authority,to achieve their legislatively mandated objectives.and,given the nature of the government work,it is not surprising that administrative units come in many different shapes and sizes.
the functional approach required by our precedents recognizes this administrative complexity and,more importantly,recognizes the various ways presidential power operates within this context and the various ways in which a removal provision might affect that power.as human beings have known ever since ulysses tied himself to the mast so as safely to hear the sirens song,sometimes it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve a broader objective.thus,legally enforceable commitments such as contracts,statutes that can not instantly be changed,and,as in the case before us,the establishment of independent administrative institutions hold the potential to empower precisely because of their ability to constrain.if the president seeks to regulate through impartial adjudication,then insulation of the adjudicator from removal at will can help him achieve that goal.and to free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal without cause can similarly help create legitimacy with respect to that official regulatory actions by helping to insulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political pressure.
neither is power always susceptible to the equations of elementary arithmetic.a rule that takes power from a president friends and allies may weaken him.but a rule that takes power from the president opponents may strengthen him.and what if the rule takes power from a functionally neutral independent authority in that case,it is difficult to predict how the president power is affected in the abstract.
these practical reasons not only support our precedents determination that cases such as this should examine the specific functions and context at issue they also indicate that judges should hesitate before a for cause decision made by the other branches.see,chadha,at applying a presumption that the challenged statute is valid bowsher,at stevens,concurring in judgment.compared to congress and the president,the judiciary possesses an inferior understanding of the realities of administration,and the manner in which power,including and most especially political power,operates in context.
there is no indication that the two comparatively more expert branches were divided in their support for the for cause provision at issue here.in this case,the act embodying the provision was passed by a vote of to in the house of representatives and a by vote of to in the senate.cong.rec.the creation of the accounting board was discussed at great length in both bodies without anyone finding in its structure any constitutional problem.see,at.the president signed the act.and,when he did so,he issued a signing statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the act but did not express any concerns.see president statement on signing the act of,weekly comp.of doc.aba,report of task force on presidential signing statements and the separation of powers doctrine,online at all internet materials as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file noting that president bush asserted over constitutional objections through signing statements in his first term,including related to his theory of the unitary executive 
thus,here,as in similar cases,we should decide the constitutional question in light of the provision practical functioning in context.and our decision should take account of the judiciary comparative lack of institutional expertise.
to what extent then is the act for cause provision likely,as a practical matter,to limit the president exercise of executive authority in practical terms no for cause provision can,in isolation,define the full measure of executive power.this is because a legislative decision to place ultimate administrative authority in,say,the secretary of agriculture rather than the president,the way in which the statute defines the scope of the power the relevant administrator can exercise,the decision as to who controls the agency budget requests and funding,the relationships between one agency or department and another,as well as more purely political factors including congress ability to assert influence are more likely to affect the president power to get something done.that is why president truman complained that the powers of the president amount to bringing people in and try ing to persuade them to do what they ought to do without persuasion.rossiter,the american presidency ed.and that is why scholars have written that the president is neither dominant nor powerless in his relationships with many government entities,whether denominated executive or independent.strauss,the place of agencies in government separation of powers and the fourth branch,colum,hereinafter strauss.those entities are all subject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their functioning,and are each able to resist presidential direction in others.ibid.emphasis added.
indeed,notwithstanding the majority assertion that the removal authority is the key mechanism by which the president oversees inferior officers in the independent agencies,ante,at,it appears that no president has ever actually sought to exercise that power by testing the scope of a for cause provision.see bruff,bringing the independent agencies in from the cold,vanderbilt en banc,online at.noting that presidents do not test the limits of their power by removing commissioners lessig sunstein noting that courts have not had occasion to define what constitutes cause because presidents rarely test removal provisions.
but even if we put all these other matters to the side,we should still conclude that the for cause restriction before us will not restrict presidential power significantly.for one thing,the restriction directly limits,not the president power,but the power of an already independent agency.the court seems to have forgotten that fact when it identifies its central constitutional problem according to the court,the president is powerless to intervene if he has determined that the board members conduct merit s removal because t hat decision is vested instead in other tenured officers the commissioners none of whom is subject to the president direct control.ante,at.but so long as the president is legitimately foreclosed from removing the commissioners except for cause as the majority assumes,nullifying the commission power to remove board members only for cause will not resolve the problem the court has identified the president will still be powerless to intervene by removing the board members if the commission reasonably decides not to do so.
in other words,the court fails to show why two layers of for cause protection layer one insulating the commissioners from the president,and layer two insulating the board from the commissioners impose any more serious limitation upon the president powers than one layer.consider the four scenarios that might arise 
the president and the commission both want to keep a board member in office.neither layer is relevant.
the president and the commission both want to dismiss a board member.layer two stops them both from doing so without cause.the president ability to remove the commission layer one is irrelevant,for he and the commission are in agreement.
the president wants to dismiss a board member,but the commission wants to keep the member.layer one allows the commission to make that determination notwithstanding the president contrary view.layer two is irrelevant because the commission does not seek to remove the board member.
the president wants to keep a board member,but the commission wants to dismiss the board member.here,layer two helps the president,for it hinders the commission ability to dismiss a board member whom the president wants to keep in place.
thus,the majority decision to eliminate only layer two accomplishes virtually nothing.and that is because a removal restriction effect upon presidential power depends not on the presence of a of removal,as the majority pretends,but rather on the nature of the president relationship with the commission.if the president confronts a commission that seeks to resist his policy preferences a distinct possibility when,as here,a commission membership must reflect both political parties,a the restriction on the commission ability to remove a board member is either irrelevant as in scenario or may actually help the president as in scenario.and if the president faces a commission that seeks to implement his policy preferences,layer one is irrelevant,for the president and commission see eye to eye.
in order to avoid this elementary logic,the court creates two alternative scenarios.in the first,the commission and the president both want to remove a board member,but have varying judgments as to whether they have good cause to do so,the president and the commission both conclude that a board member should be removed,but disagree as to whether that conclusion which they have both reached is reasonable.ante,at.in the second,the president wants to remove a board member and the commission disagrees but,notwithstanding its freedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the president afforded by layer one,the commission while apparently telling the president that it agrees with him and would like to remove the board member uses layer two as an excuse to pursue its actual aims an excuse which,given layer one,it does not need.ante,at.
both of these circumstances seem unusual.i do not know if they have ever occurred.but i do not deny their logical possibility.i simply doubt their importance.and the fact that,with respect to the president power,the double layer of removal sometimes might help,sometimes might hurt,leads me to conclude that its overall effect is at most indeterminate.
but once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and view the removal provision at issue in the context of the entire act,its lack of practical effect becomes readily apparent.that is because the statute provides the commission with full authority and virtually comprehensive control over all of the board functions.those who created the accounting board modeled it,in terms of structure and authority,upon the semiprivate regulatory bodies prevalent in the area of financial regulation,such as the new york stock exchange and other similar organizations.see generally brief for former chairmen of the sec as amici curiae hereinafter brief for former sec chairmen.and those organizations which rely on private financing and on officers drawn from the private sector exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory authority that is pervasively controlled by,and is indeed entirely derivative of,the sec.see national of securities dealers,sec,cadc.
adhering to that model,the statute here gives the accounting board the power to adopt rules and standards relating to the preparation of audit reports to adjudicate disciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that fail to follow these rules to impose sanctions and to engage in other related activities,such as conducting inspections of accounting firms registered as the law requires and investigations to monitor compliance with the rules and related legal obligations.see.but,at the same time,
no accounting board rule takes effect unless and until the commission approves it,b 
the commission may abrogat e,delet e or ad d to any rule or any portion of a rule promulgated by the accounting board whenever,in the commission view,doing so further s the purposes of the securities and laws,b 
the commission may review any sanction the board imposes and enhance,modify,cancel,reduce,or require the remission of that sanction if it find the board action not appropriate,e,c 
the commission may promulgate rules restricting or directing the accounting board conduct of all inspections and investigations,c,h,b 
the commission may itself initiate any investigation or promulgate any rule within the accounting board purview,and may also remove any accounting board member who has unreasonably failed to enforce compliance with the relevant rule s,or any professional standard,d c emphasis added 
the commission may at any time relieve the board of any responsibility to enforce compliance with any provision of the act,the rules,or professional standards if,in the commission view,doing so is in the public interest,d emphasis added.
as these statutory provisions make clear,the court is simply wrong when it says that the act nowhere gives the commission effective power to start,stop,or alter board investigations.ante,at.on the contrary,the commission control over the board investigatory and legal functions is virtually absolute.moreover,the commission has general supervisory powers over the accounting board itself it controls the board budget,b,d it can assign to the board any duties or functions that it determines are necessary or appropriate,c it has full oversight and enforcement authority over the board,a,including the authority to inspect the board activities whenever it believes it appropriate to do so,d emphasis added.and it can censure the board or its members,as well as remove the members from office,if the members,for example,fail to enforce the act,violate any provisions of the act,or abuse the authority granted to them under the act,d.shurtleff united states,holding that removal authority is not always restricted to a removal for th e causes set forth by statute bowsher,at rejecting the arguable premis e that the enumeration of certain specified causes of removal excludes the possibility of removal for other causes contra,ante,at.see generally pildes,putting power back into separation of powers analysis why the structure is constitutional,vand.en banc,online at explaining further the comprehensive nature of the commission powers.
what is left the commission inability to remove a board member whose perfectly reasonable actions cause the commission to overrule him with great frequency what is the practical likelihood of that occurring,or,if it does,of the president serious concern about such a matter everyone concedes that the president control over the commission is constitutionally sufficient.see humphrey executor,wiener,ante,at.and if the president control over the commission is sufficient,and the commission control over the board is virtually absolute,then,as a practical matter,the president control over the board should prove sufficient as well.
at the same time,congress and the president had good reason for enacting the challenged for cause provision.first and foremost,the board adjudicates cases.see.this court has long recognized the appropriateness of using for cause provisions to protect the personal independence of those who even only sometimes engage in adjudicatory functions.humphrey executor,supra,at see also wiener,supra,at morrison,at,and mcallister united states,field,dissenting.indeed,as early as james madison stated that there may be strong reasons why an executive officer such as the comptroller of the united states should not hold his office at the pleasure of the executive branch if one of his principal dut ies partakes strongly of the judicial character.annals of congress ante,at,noting that the statute congress ultimately enacted limited presidential control over the comptroller in a different fashion see supra,at.the court,however,all but ignores the board adjudicatory functions when conducting its analysis.see,ante,at.and when it finally does address that central function in a footnote,it simply asserts that the board does not perform adjudicative functions,ante,at,emphasis added,an assertion that is inconsistent with the terms of the statute.see c governing proceeding s by the board to determine whether a registered public accounting firm,or an associated person thereof,should be disciplined 
moreover,in addition to their adjudicative functions,the accounting board members supervise,and are themselves,technical professional experts.see e requiring that board members have a demonstrated technical understanding of the responsibilities and obligations of accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance of audit reports this court has recognized that the difficulties involved in the preparation of sound auditing reports require the application of scientific accounting principles.united states anderson.and this court has recognized the constitutional legitimacy of a justification that rests agency independence upon the need for technical expertise.see humphrey executor,supra,at see also breger edles,established by practice the theory and operation of independent federal agencies,admin,explaining how the need for administrators with technical competence,apolitical expertise,and skill in scientific management led to original creation of independent agencies hereinafter breger edles landis,the administrative process similar woodrow wilson,democracy and efficiency,atlantic monthly,describing need for insulation of experts from political influences.
here,the justification for insulating the technical experts on the board from fear of losing their jobs due to political influence is particularly strong.congress deliberately sought to provide that kind of protection.see,cong.rec.it did so for good reason.see ante,at noting that the accounting board was created in response to a series of celebrated accounting debacles same brief for former sec chairmen.and historically,this regulatory subject matter financial regulation has been thought to exhibit a particular need for independence.see,cong.rec.remarks of morgan upon creation of the federal trade commission i t is unsafe for an administrative officer representing a great political party to hold the power of life and death over the great business interests of this country.that is why i believe in taking these business matters out of politics and congress,by,for example,providing the board with a revenue stream independent of the congressional appropriations process,helped insulate the board from congressional,as well as other,political influences.see,cong.rec.statement of stabenow.
in sum,congress and the president could reasonably have thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative board members from fear of purely politically based removal.civil service comm letter carriers,i t is not only important that the government and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice,but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be avoiding it,if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent and in a world in which we count on the federal government to regulate matters as complex as,say,production,the court assertion that we should simply learn to get by without being regulated by experts is,at best,unrealistic at worst,dangerously so.ante,at.
where a for cause provision is so unlikely to restrict presidential power and so likely to further a legitimate institutional need,precedent strongly supports its constitutionality.first,in considering a related issue in nixon administrator of general services,the court made clear that when determining whether the act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate branches,the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to which it prevents the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.at.the court said the same in morrison,where it upheld a restriction on the president removal power,at t he real question is whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the president ability to perform his constitutional duty,and the functions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that light here,the removal restriction may somewhat diminish the commission ability to control the board,but it will have little,if any,negative effect in respect to the president ability to control the board,let alone to coordinate the executive branch.see part,supra.indeed,given morrison,where the court upheld a restriction that significantly interfered with the president important historic power to control criminal prosecutions,a purely executive function,at,the constitutionality of the present restriction would seem to follow a fortiori.
second,as previously pointed out,this court has repeatedly upheld for cause provisions where they restrict the president power to remove an officer with adjudicatory responsibilities.compare humphrey executor,at wiener,at schor,at morrison,supra,at,with ante,at ignoring these precedents.and we have also upheld such restrictions when they relate to officials with technical responsibilities that warrant a degree of special independence,humphrey executor,supra,at.the accounting board functions involve both kinds of responsibility.and,accordingly,the accounting board adjudicatory responsibilities,the technical nature of its job,the need to attract experts to that job,and the importance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job to the public strongly justify a statute that assures that board members need not fear for their jobs when competently carrying out their tasks,while still maintaining the commission as the ultimate authority over board policies and actions.see part,supra.
third,consider how several cases fit together in a way that logically compels a holding of constitutionality here.in perkins,at,which was reaffirmed in myers,at and in morrison,supra,at,the court upheld a removal restriction limiting the authority of the secretary of the navy to remove a whom the court explicitly defined as an inferior officer.the court said,
we have no doubt that when congress,by law,vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads of departments it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest.the constitutional authority in congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit,restrict,and regulate the removal by such laws as congress may enact in relation to the officers so appointed.perkins,supra,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
see also morrison,supra,at scalia,dissenting agreeing that the power to remove an inferior officer who is appointed by a department head can be restricted.ante,at holding that sec commissioners are heads of departments 
in humphrey executor,the court held that congress may constitutionally limit the president authority to remove certain principal officers,including heads of departments,at.and the court has consistently recognized the validity of that holding.see wiener,supra united states nixon,buckley,at chadha,at,bowsher,at morrison,supra,at mistretta united states.
and in freytag,at,justice scalia stated in a concurring opinion written for four justices,including justice kennedy,that adjusting the remainder of the constitution to compensate for humphrey executor is a fruitless endeavor.in these justices view,the court should not create a separate constitutional jurisprudence for the independent agencies.that being so,the law should treat their heads as it treats other executive branch heads of departments.consequently,as the court held in perkins,congress may constitutionally limit and restrict the commission power to remove those whom they appoint,the accounting board members.
fourth,the court has said that o ur jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.freytag,supra,at emphasis added accord,buckley,supra,at schor,supra,at morrison,supra,at bowsher,supra.indeed,it has added that the essence of the decision in myers,which is the only one of our cases to have struck down a for cause removal restriction,was the judgment that the constitution prevents congress from draw ing to itself the power to remove.morrison,supra,at quoting myers,supra,at emphasis added.congress here has drawn no power to itself to remove the board members.it has instead sought to limit its own power,by,for example,providing the accounting board with a revenue stream independent of the congressional appropriations process.see supra,at see also brief for former sec chairmen.and this case thereby falls outside the ambit of the court most serious constitutional concern.
in sum,the court prior cases impose functional criteria that are readily met here.once one goes beyond the court elementary arithmetical logic,one plus one is greater than one our precedent virtually dictates a holding that the challenged for cause provision is constitutional.
we should ask one further question.even if the for cause provision before us does not itself significantly interfere with the president authority or aggrandize congress power,is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a rule forbidding the provision lest,through a series of such provisions,each itself upheld as reasonable,congress might undercut the president central constitutional role strauss.the answer to this question is that no such need has been shown.moreover,insofar as the court seeks to create such a rule,it fails.and in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious than any imaginable harm this for cause provision might bring about.
the court fails to create a rule because of considerable uncertainty about the scope of its holding an uncertainty that the court opinion both reflects and generates.the court suggests,for example,that its rule may not apply where an inferior officer perform s adjudicative functions.ante,at.but the accounting board performs adjudicative functions.see supra,at.what,then,are we to make of the court potential exception and would such an exception apply to an administrative law judge who also has important administrative duties beyond pure adjudication see,cfr,cfr.the court elsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal statutes that provide for judicial review of a n effort to remove an official for cause.ante,at ante,at.but we have previously stated that all officers protected by a removal provision and later subject to termination are entitled to notice and a hearing in the courts,as without such review the appointing power otherwise could remove at pleasure or for such cause as only it deemed sufficient.reagan united states,shurtleff,at humphrey executor,supra entertaining civil suit challenging removal.but bowsher,supra,at.what weight,then,should be given to this hint of an exception 
the court further seems to suggest that its holding may not apply to inferior officers who have a different relationship to their appointing agents than the relationship between the commission and the board.see ante,at.but the only characteristic of the relationship between the commission and the board that the court apparently deems relevant is that the relationship includes two layers of removal.see,ante,at broad power over board functions is not equivalent to the power to remove board members why then would any different relationship that also includes two layers of removal survive where this one has not part,supra describing the commission near absolute control over the board.in a word,what differences are relevant if the court means to state that its holding in fact applies only where congress has enacted an unusually high standard of removal and does not otherwise render two layers of ordinary removal unconstitutional i should welcome the statement.ante,at emphasis added see also ante,at,underscoring this statute sharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes good cause and its rigorous,significant and unusual removal protections but much of the majority opinion appears to avoid so narrow a holding in favor of a broad,basically mechanical rule a rule that,as i have said,is divorced from the context of the case at hand.compare parts,ante,with parts,supra.and such a mechanical rule can not be cabined simply by saying that,perhaps,the rule does not apply to instances that,at least at first blush,seem highly similar.a judicial holding by its very nature is not a restricted railroad ticket,good for one day and train only.smith allwright,roberts,dissenting.
the court begins to reveal the practical problems inherent in its double rule when it suggests that its rule may not apply to the civil service.ante,at.the civil service is defined by statute to include all appointive positions in the government of the united states,excluding the military,but including all civil officer s up to and including those who are subject to senate confirmation,a b.the civil service thus includes many officers indistinguishable from the members of both the commission and the accounting board.indeed,as this court recognized in myers,the competitive service the class within the broader civil service that enjoys the most robust career protection includes a vast majority of all the civil officers in the united states,at emphasis added c.
but even if i assume that the majority categorically excludes the competitive service from the scope of its new rule,ante,at leaving this question open,the exclusion would be insufficient.this is because the court double rule applies to appointees who are inferior officer s.ante,at.and who are they courts and scholars have struggled for more than a century to define the constitutional term inferior officers,without much success.see story,commentaries on the constitution,ed.t here does not seem to have been any exact line drawn,who are and who are not to be deemed inferior officers,in the sense of the constitution edmond united states,our cases have not set forth an exclusive criterion for defining inferior officers memorandum from steven bradbury,acting assistant attorney general,office of legal counsel,to the general counsels of the executive branch officers of the united states within the meaning of the appointments clause,hereinafter olc memo,online at t he supreme court has not articulated the precise scope and application of the inferior officer clause requirements konecke,the appointments clause and military judges inferior appointment to a principal office,seton hall const,same burkoff,appointment and removal under the federal constitution the impact of buckley valeo,wayne,describing our early precedent as circular and our later law as not particularly useful the court does not clarify the concept.but without defining who is an inferior officer,to whom the majority new rule applies,we can not know the scope or the coherence of the legal rule that the court creates.i understand the virtues of a approach.but here that kind of approach when applied without more specificity than i can find in the court opinion threatens serious harm.
the problem is not simply that the term inferior officer is indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably conclude that the term sweep is unusually broad.consider the court definitions inferior officers are,inter alia,those charged with the administration and enforcement of the public law,buckley,at ante,at those granted significant authority,at ante,at those with responsibility for conducting civil litigation in the courts of the united states,at and those who can be said to hold an office,united states germaine,that has been created either by regulations or by statute,united states mouat.
consider the definitional conclusion that the department of justice more recently reached an inferior officer is anyone who holds a continuing position and who is invested by legal authority with a portion of the sovereign powers of the federal government,including,inter alia,the power to arrest criminals,seize persons or property,issue regulations,issue authoritative legal opinions,conduc t civil litigation,collec t revenue,represent the united states to foreign nations,command military force,or enter into contracts on behalf of the nation.olc memo,internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
and consider the fact that those whom this court has held to be officers include a district court clerk,hennen,at thousands of clerks in the departments of the treasury,interior and the othe r departments,germaine,supra,at,who are responsible for the records,books,and papers appertaining to the office,hennen,supra,at a clerk to the assistant treasurer stationed at boston,united states hartwell,wall,an and a appointed by the secretary of the navy,united states moore,perkins,at election monitors,ex parte siebold,united states attorneys,myers,supra,at federal marshals,sieblod,supra,at morrison,at military judges,weiss united states,judges in article i courts,freytag,at and the general counsel of the department of transportation,edmond united states.individual members of the court would add to the list the federal communication commission managing director,the federal trade commission secretary,the general counsel of the commodity futures trading commission,and more generally,bureau chiefs,general counsels,and administrative law judges,see freytag,supra,at scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment,as well as ordinary commissioned military officers,weiss,supra,at souter,concurring.
reading the criteria above as stringently as possible,i still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds,perhaps thousands of high level government officials within the scope of the court holding,putting their job security and their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally at risk.to make even a conservative estimate,one would have to begin by listing federal departments,offices,bureaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute removable only for cause.i have found such agencies,which i have listed in appendix a,infra.then it would be necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies just below the top who themselves are removable only for cause.i have identified such officials,whom i have listed in appendix b,infra.they include most of the leadership of the nuclear regulatory commission including that agency executive director as well as the directors of its office of nuclear reactor regulation and office of enforcement,virtually all of the leadership of the social security administration,the executive directors of the federal energy regulatory commission and the federal trade commission,as well as the general counsels of the chemical safety board,the federal mine safety and health review commission,and the national mediation board.
this list is a conservative estimate because it consists only of career appointees in the senior executive service ses,see,a,a group of officials distinct from the competitive service,see a c,who serve in the key positions just below the top presidential appointees,office of personnel management,about the senior executive service,online at a c,and who are,without exception,subject to removal only for cause.see also a substantially limiting conditions under which a career appointee in the senior executive service may be transfer red,or reassign ed ses officials include,for example,the director of the bureau of prisons,the director of the national drug intelligence center,and the director of the office of international monetary policy in the treasury department.see senate committee on homeland security and government affairs,united states government policy and supporting positions,hereinafter plum book.and by virtually any definition,essentially all ses officials qualify as inferior officers,for their duties,as defined by statute,require them to direc t the work of an organizational unit,carry out managerial functions,or otherwise exercis e important,or other executive functions.a emphasis added.ante,at describing an inferior officer as someone who determines the policy and enforces the laws of the united states ante,at acknowledging that career ses appointees in independent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in future cases.is the ses exempt from today rule or is it not the court,after listing reasons why the ses may be different,simply says that it will not addres s the matter.ante,at.perhaps it does not do so because it can not do so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the ses from the accounting board and thereby also revealing the inherent instability of the legal rule it creates.
the potential list of those whom today decision affects is yet larger.as justice scalia has observed,administrative law judges aljs are all executive officers.freytag,at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment emphasis deleted see also,at majority opinion a special trial judge is an inferior officer edmond,supra,at m ilitary trial and appellate judges are inferior officers but ante,at.and aljs are each removable only for good cause established and determined by the merit systems protection board,a b.but the members of the merit systems protection board are themselves protected from removal by the president absent good cause.d.
my research reflects that the federal government relies on aljs to adjudicate administrative matters in over agencies.see appendix c,infra see also memorandum of juanita love,office of personnel management,to supreme court library may,available in clerk of court case file.these aljs adjudicate social security benefits,employment disputes,and other matters highly important to individuals.does every losing party before an alj now have grounds to appeal on the basis that the decision entered against him is unconstitutional ante,at,o ur holding also does not address this question.
and what about the military commissioned military officers are inferior officers.weiss,at souter,concurring,at majority opinion.there are over commissioned officers currently serving in the armed forces.see of defense,active duty military personnel by rank,online at.numerous statutory provisions provide that such officers may not be removed from office except for cause at least in peacetime.see.and such officers can generally be so removed only by other commissioned officers,see,who themselves enjoy the same career protections.
the majority might simply say that the military is different.but it will have to explain how it is different.it is difficult to see why the constitution would provide a president who is the military art.ii,cl,with less authority to remove inferior military officers than to remove comparable civil officials.see barron lederman,the commander in chief at the lowest ebb a constitutional history,harv,describing president superintendence prerogative over the military.ante,at not expressing any view whatever as to whether military officers authority is now unconstitutional.
the majority sees no reason to address whether any of these positions,or any others,might be deemed unconstitutional under its new rule,preferring instead to leave these matters for a future case.ante,at.but what is to happen in the meantime is the work of all these various officials to be put on hold while the courts of appeals determine whether today ruling applies to them will congress have to act to remove the for cause provisions buckley,at.can the president then restore them via executive order and,still,what about the military a clearer line would help avoid these practical difficulties.
the majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the government ability to function while these many questions are litigated in the lower courts because the court holding concerns only the conditions under which th e se officers might some day be removed.ante,at.but this case was not brought by federal officials challenging their potential removal.it was brought by private individuals who were subject to regulation and who object to the very existence of the regulators themselves.ante,at,emphasis added.and those private individuals have prevailed.thus,any person similarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially subject to the court amorphous new rule will be able to bring an implied private right of action directly under the constitution seeking a declaratory judgment that the official actions are unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the official from exercising his powers.ante,at,legal services corporation velazquez,affirming grant of preliminary injunction to cure,inter alia,a violation youngstown sheet tube,same.such a plaintiff need not even first exhaust his administrative remedies.ante,at.
nor is it clear that courts will always be able to cure such a constitutional defect merely by severing an offending removal provision.for a court ability to devise such a judicial remedy often depends on how clearly the background constitutional rules at issue have been articulated severance will be unavailable in a murky constitutional context,which is precisely the context that the court new rule creates.ayotte planned parenthood of northern new.moreover,the touchstone of the severability analysis is legislative intent,at,and congress has repeatedly expressed its judgment over the last century that it is in the best interest of the country,indeed essential,that federal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service,civil service comm n,at see also bush lucas,describing the history of congressional attention to the problem of removals and so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the many questions the majority opinion raises will not only apply the court new rule to its logical conclusion,but will also determine that the only available remedy to certain double problems is to invalidate entire agencies.
thus,notwithstanding the majority assertions to the contrary,the potential consequences of today holding are worrying.the upshot,i believe,is a legal dilemma.to interpret the court decision as applicable only in a few circumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbitrary.to interpret the rule more broadly will make the rule more rational,but destructive.
one last question how can the court simply assume without deciding that the sec commissioners themselves are removable only for cause see ante,at w e decide the case with th e understanding that the commissioners can not themselves be removed by the president except for cause emphasis added.unless the commissioners themselves are in fact protected by a for cause requirement,the accounting board statute,on the court own reasoning,is not constitutionally defective.i am not aware of any other instance in which the court has similarly on its own or through stipulation created a constitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that defect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional.alabama north carolina,opinion for the court by scalia,slip,at we do not we can not add provisions to a federal statute especially if concerns would thereby arise the anaconda american sugar refining,describing parties inability to stipulate away what the legislation declares 
it is certainly not obvious that the sec commissioners enjoy for cause protection.unlike the statutes establishing the federal agencies listed in appendix a,infra,the statue that established the commission says nothing about removal.it is silent on the question.as far as its text is concerned,the president authority to remove the commissioners is no different from his authority to remove the secretary of state or the attorney general.see shurtleff,at to take away th e power of removal would require very clear and explicit language.it should not be held to be taken away by mere inference or implication see also memorandum from david barron,acting assistant attorney general,office of legal counsel,to the principal deputy counsel to the president removability of the federal coordinator for alaska natural gas transportation projects,online at where congress did not explicitly provide tenure protection the president,consistent with settled principles,may remove without cause the constitutional separation of powers between the president and congress,op.legal counsel,same.
nor is the absence of a for cause provision in the statute that created the commission likely to have been inadvertent.congress created the commission during the period after this court decided myers,and thereby cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all for cause removal provisions,but before it decided humphrey executor,which removed any doubt in respect to the constitutionality of making commissioners of independent agencies removable only for cause.in other words,congress created the sec at a time when,under this court precedents,it would have been unconstitutional to make the commissioners removable only for cause.and,during that period,congress created at least three major federal agencies without making any of their officers removable for cause.see stat,securities and exchange commission,stat,federal communications commission stat.federal power commission reformed executor as the federal energy regulatory commission with for cause protection,stat.by way of contrast,only one month after humphrey executor was decided,congress returned to its practice of including such provisions in statutes creating independent commissions.see,stat,establishing national labor relations board with an explicit removal limitation.
the fact that congress did not make the sec commissioners removable for cause does not mean it intended to create a dependent,rather than an independent agency.agency independence is a function of several different factors,of which for cause protection is only one.those factors include,inter alia,an agency separate rather than presidentially dependent budgeting authority,its separate litigating authority,its composition as a multimember bipartisan board,the use of the word independent in its authorizing statute,and,above all,a political environment,reflecting tradition and function,that would impose a heavy political cost upon any president who tried to remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.see generally breger edles.
the absence of a for cause provision is thus not fatal to agency independence.indeed,a congressional research service official suggests that there are at least independent agencies without a removal provision in their statutes.at,emphasis added citing congressional testimony.but it does draw the majority rule into further confusion.for not only are we left without a definition of an inferior officer,but we are also left to guess which department heads will be deemed by the majority to be subject to removal notwithstanding statutes containing no such provision.if any agency deemed independent will be similarly treated,the scope of the majority holding is even broader still.see appendix d,infra listing agencies potentially affected.
the court then,by assumption,reads into the statute books a for cause removal phrase that does not appear in the relevant statute and which congress probably did not intend to write.and it does so in order to strike down,not to uphold,another statute.this is not a statutory construction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question,but its opposite.see ashwander tva,brandeis,concurring it is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case internal quotation marks omitted nlrb catholic bishop of chicago,a n act of congress ought not to be construed to violate the constitution if any other possible construction remains available 
i do not need to decide whether the commissioners are in fact removable only for cause because i would uphold the accounting board removal provision as constitutional regardless.but were that not so,a determination that the silent sec statute means no more than it says would properly avoid the determination of unconstitutionality that the court now makes.
in my view the court decision is wrong very wrong.as parts,and of this opinion make clear,if the court were to look to the proper functional and contextual considerations,it would find the accounting board provision constitutional.as part shows,insofar as the court instead tries to create a rule,it fails to do so.its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly broad.in light of the present imprecision,it must either narrow its rule arbitrarily,leaving it to apply virtually alone to the accounting board,or it will have to leave in place a broader rule of decision applicable to many other inferior officers as well.in doing the latter,it will undermine the president authority.and it will create an obstacle,indeed pose a serious threat,to the proper functioning of that workable government that the constitution seeks to create in provisions this court is sworn to uphold.
with respect i dissent.
appendixes 
there are federal agencies,departments whose heads are,by statute,removable by the president only for cause.moreover,there are at least additional offices,boards,or bureaus situated within departments that are similarly subject,by statute,to removal provisions.the chart below first lists the departments and then lists the additional offices,boards,and bureaus.i have highlighted those instances in which a office is situated within a department,instances of double removal that are essentially indistinguishable from this case with the notable exception that the accounting board may not be statutorily subject to two layers of removal,part iii,supra.this list does not include instances of double removal that arise in article i courts,although such instances might also be affected by the majority holding,ante,at.compare a,a,with a,i,and,a.
