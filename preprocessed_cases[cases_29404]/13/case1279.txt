the united states appeals from a final order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,judge granting an application by the new york times company the times to gain access to sealed wiretap applications relating to the investigation of the emperor club,a prostitution ring once patronized by the former governor of new york,elliot spitzer.this appeal raises two questions does title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,b title iii which permits disclosure of wiretap applications,orders,and related documents only upon a showing of good cause allow disclosure of those types of documents based solely on the news media interest in publishing the information contained in those documents do the news media have a common law or first amendment right to gain access to wiretap applications that overrides any statutory requirement of good cause for access 
background 
the underlying facts of the case are not in dispute.in march,the government charged four people with running a prostitution ring called the emperor club.soon after,the news media identified governor spitzer as a client of the ring spitzer resigned his office within days.attached to the government criminal complaint was an affidavit signed by a special agent of the federal bureau of investigation setting forth evidence in support of the charges against the four defendants,including evidence obtained pursuant to wiretaps on cellular telephones used in connection with the prostitution ring.the four people charged as a result of the emperor club investigation all waived indictment and pleaded guilty without requesting or receiving discovery.
the wiretaps used in the emperor club investigation were obtained pursuant to orders entered by several judges of the southern district of new york pursuant to the provisions of title iii.under that statute,each wiretap application and order was placed under judicial seal and,at the direction of the issuing district judge,held by the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york for safekeeping.see b requiring that wiretap materials be placed under judicial seal.in the ordinary course,wiretap orders and applications are unsealed during criminal proceedings or discovery.see requiring disclosure of a wiretap application and order to a party before intercepted communications may be used against the party in court.however,because the four people charged in the criminal complaint waived indictment and pleaded guilty in the late spring and summer of,the wiretap materials remained under seal.
in december,the times submitted an application to the district court to unseal the government wiretap and search warrant applications in the emperor club investigation.the times claimed a common law right of access to judicial records,and a first amendment right of access to the records.the government agreed to disclose the search warrant applications,but opposed unsealing wiretap materials on the ground that disclosure was prohibited by title iii.specifically,the government argued that title iii only permitted disclosure of sealed wiretap applications for good cause,and that a general journalistic interest in information did not constitute good cause under title iii.see b applications made and orders granted under this chapter shall be sealed by the judge.custody of the applications and orders shall be wherever the judge directs.such applications and orders shall be disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent jurisdiction emphasis added.
the district court heard argument on the times application on january.the times agreed at the hearing that the government could redact the names and identifying information of all customers whose names appear in the materials.accordingly,the district court ruled that t he scope of the motion was limited to seeking the release of the wiretap materials so redacted.in re times,d.in a february,opinion and order,the district court granted the times application to unseal the wiretap applications as redacted to protect the identities of emperor club clients.id.the district court offered four reasons for its decision.
first,the district court concluded that the wiretap applications were judicial records because they are relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process.id.at quoting united states amodeo,cir amodeo i setting forth the definition of judicial records,and applying that definition to a sealed investigation report regarding labor union corruption.
second,the district court held that at common law and under the first amendment,the press enjoyed a right of access to judicial records,amounting to a presumption in favor of disclosure.in re times,d at.the district court reasoned that this presumption reached its zenith when,as here,the documents are directly relevant to the exercise of a court article iii judicial power.id.citing united states amodeo,cir amodeo ii t he weight to be given the presumption of access must be governed by the role of the material at issue in the exercise of article iii judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal courts.
third,the district court balanced the asserted strong presumption in favor of disclosure of judicial records against the government interest in maintaining confidentiality and protecting privacy.in this case,the district court concluded there was no longer any concern about confidentiality because the investigation had concluded,and any concerns about privacy could be mitigated through redactions.in re times,d at.because the asserted strong presumption in favor of disclosure outweighed the government interests,the court granted the times application.id.
fourth and finally,the district court rejected the government argument that title iii good cause requirement created a statutory presumption against disclosure.under the government definition,good cause requires a need for disclosure and an aggrieved person,and is not satisfied by mere journalistic interest or curiosity.in the district court view,there is no reason to believe that congress intended good cause to be anything other than a synonym for the balancing dictated by the aforementioned constitutional and common law principles.in re times,d at.
this appeal followed.before this court,the government renews its argument that the text,context,and legislative history of title iii create a strong presumption against disclosure of wiretap applications,which may be overcome only upon a showing of good cause,and good cause means,essentially,necessity.the times responds that the district court applied the correct definition of good cause as incorporating the common law presumption in favor of disclosure of judicial materials,and even if title iii has a more restrictive meaning of good cause,the statute is trumped by the news media first amendment right of access to judicial records.
discussion 
standard of review 
because the district court february,opinion and order involved solely a question of law,we review that decision de novo.see,williams beemiller,cir.
it is undisputed by the parties that there is a qualified common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents,which courts administer by balancing the government interest in confidentiality and privacy against the public interest in inspection.nixon warner communications,d footnote omitted.we assume arguendo that wiretap applications are a judicial records and b included in this qualified common law right of access,and turn our attention to title iii,which supersedes any arguable common law right.see city of milwaukee illinois,d f ederal common law is resorted to only in absence of an applicable act of congress.internal citations,quotation marks,and alteration marks omitted.title iii provides,in relevant part 
wiretap a pplications made and orders granted under this chapter shall be sealed by the judge.custody of the applications and orders shall be wherever the judge directs.such applications and orders shall be disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent jurisdiction and shall not be destroyed except on order of the issuing or denying judge,and in any event shall be kept for ten years.
instead of beginning with the statute,the district court considered principally the contours of the common law and first amendment rights of access to judicial records,and then interpreted title iii good cause requirement in a manner consistent with the perceived rights.see in re times,d at t here is no reason to believe that congress intended good cause to be anything other than a synonym for the balancing dictated by the aforementioned constitutional and common law principles.however,where there is a statute on point,we begin our consideration there.in construing the text of any federal statute,we first consider the precedents that bind us as an intermediate appellate court,which provide definitive interpretations of otherwise ambiguous language.insofar as those precedents fail to resolve an apparent ambiguity,we examine the text of the statute itself,interpreting provisions in light of their ordinary meaning and their contextual setting.see united states magassouba,cir in determining whether statutory language is ambiguous,we reference the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.quoting robinson shell oil,d.where the statutory language remains ambiguous,we resort to canons of construction and,if the meaning still remains ambiguous,to legislative history.magassouba,at internal alterations and quotation marks omitted.
the central question of statutory interpretation in this case is the meaning of good cause within the context of title iii.congress did not define the term,and we are aware of no supreme court case that has done so.however,our court concluded a ago that good cause could be found where the applicant seeking to unseal wiretap applications was an aggrieved person,but not upon any lesser showing.see broadcasting dep t of justice,cir nbc also noting that nbc had not demonstrated a need for the materials.in that case,the national broadcasting company,nbc appealed a decision by chief judge gilroy daly of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,denying nbc application to unseal wiretap applications for lack of good cause.nbc argued that it satisfied title iii good cause requirement because it ha d shown a need for disclosure in that the materials will certainly lead to discovery of admissible evidence in that libel action.id.quotation marks omitted.
we observed that congress enacted title iii in the wake of katz united states,d,which held that,absent prior authorization by a court,wiretapping violated the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure.see nbc,at.we further commented that,in light of the supreme court concerns about privacy,title iii created a strong presumption against disclosure of the fruits of wiretap applications.see id.citing n o part of the contents of intercepted communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial,hearing or other proceeding in or before any court if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.chief judge feinberg addressed the argument of nbc that it is somehow unseemly that only the government can take advantage of wiretaps.id.at.this argument,he concluded,does not have much force.id.he explained under title iii,with few exceptions not here relevant,no one other than the government can lawfully engage in wiretapping and it therefore is not so unusual that only the government can enjoy its fruits.id.accordingly,we concluded that turning title iii into a general civil discovery mechanism would simply ignore the privacy rights of those whose conversations are overheard.we agree with the government that this was not the intention of congress.nbc,at.
turning to nbc request to disclose wiretap applications,as opposed to the fruits of wiretap surveillance,we concluded that b reflected the same presumption against disclosure w e believe that congress also did not intend this section to be used as an avenue for discovery by all private litigants in civil cases,unless they are directly aggrieved by a wiretap.id.at.we reached this conclusion regarding wiretap applications relying,in part,on the legislative history of title iii 
t he senate report on the enactment of title iii states that applications and orders for authorization shall be treated confidentially they may not be disclosed except incidental to the disclosure or use of the records themselves after showing of good cause,for example,under subsection a,sess,at,reprinted in cong.ad.news.subsection a provides for standing for an aggrieved person to move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom id.nbc was not an aggrieved person because,according to the express terms of title iii,it was not a party to any intercepted wire or oral communication or a person against whom the interception was directed.id.quoting defining aggrieved person.
we further agreed with the district court that,in addition to not having any claim as an aggrieved person,nbc had not even made the lesser showing that they had any need for the materials.nbc,at in any event,nbc has not shown why it can not defend its broadcasts without the sealed material,through the information it has in its own files and through the sources that were available to it at the time it prepared the news stories at issue.under the statute,one must show good cause,which means that,at least minimally,there must be a need for disclosure.in re applications of kansas city star,cir.if,after all,a party does not have a need for the materials,then there is no good cause to disclose them.in nbc,we further refined the required showing of good cause by requiring that the party claiming access be an aggrieved person.nbc,at.in our circuit,then,the required showing that a claimant be an aggrieved person assumes that there has been a showing of need.because nbc was not an aggrieved person under the statute,showing need was still could not gain access to the wiretap applications.id.nonetheless,our passing reference to the fact that nbc had not demonstrated need buttressed the argument that it was not an aggrieved person in either the statutory or colloquial sense.accordingly,we held that,in that context,nbc had not shown good cause for unsealing the wiretap applications.id.
the times argues that,unlike nbc,it is not a civil litigant,and therefore the reasoning in nbc does not apply.rather,the times posits that,unlike a private litigant,it has a public interest in the materials or the common law or first amendment right of access to them.appellee br.however,we see no reason why our analysis in nbc that title iii good cause requirement demands a showing of an aggrieved person should not also apply to the instant case.it is irrelevant for the purposes of title iii that the times is a newspaper investigating a matter of public importance.like nbc,the times does not suggest,much less show,that it is an aggrieved person within the express terms of the is,like nbc,the times does not claim to be a party to any intercepted wire or oral communication or a person against whom the interception was directed.nbc,at quoting.
the times further asserts that title iii can not be read to supplant or forbid entirely the preexisting common law right to access judicial records unless the statute intent to abrogate the common law rule is evident.appellee br.in the times view,the district court properly interpreted title iii to be consistent with the common law presumption in favor of disclosure.however,our decision in nbc,which is a binding precedent of our court,precludes this interpretation.in that case,we concluded that the structure and purpose of title the provision governing disclosure of wiretap a manifest congressional intent that wiretap applications be treated confidentially and clearly negated a presumption in favor of disclosure.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the times has not demonstrated good caus
