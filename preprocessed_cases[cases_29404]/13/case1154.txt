background 
the following facts are drawn from mcgarry pro se pleadings,which we construe liberally.see weixel bd.of educ.of city of,cir.in december,vermont police arrested mcgarry on charges stemming from a domestic dispute.the state denied his bail application and remanded him to the crcf,where he remained until his release in june.all charges against him were subsequently dismissed.crcf houses approximately persons,including both federal and state pretrial detainees and sentenced inmates.the facility is divided into different living units,referred to as houses.mcgarry alleges that all inmates in house,including pretrial detainees,are required to work in the prison facility.defendants essentially concede this point but seek to justify the work requirement for convicted inmates as well as pretrial detainees on the ground that it serves a legitimate rehabilitative interest in educating offenders about real world responsibilities.appellees br.at.
mcgarry alleges that in defendants directed him to move to house and required him to work in the prison laundry over his repeated objections.he alleges that he had no choice because defendants told him that his refusal to work would result in his being placed in administrative segregation or put in the hole,which,he alleges,involves for and the use of shackles.mcgarry further alleges that defendants told him that he would receive an inmate disciplinary report dr if he refused to work,and that even minor drs affect when sentenced inmates are eligible for release.
mcgarry alleges that he was compelled to work long hours in the prison laundry in hot,unsanitary conditions.he alleges that the bathroom adjacent to the laundry room was bolted shut and that,although he was required to handle other inmates soiled clothing,he was not provided with gloves or access to a sink or products.he further alleges that he was required to work under these conditions on shifts lasting up to fourteen hours per day,three days a week.finally,he alleges that his work in the laundry caused a painful staph infection in his neck that manifested itself as a series of reoccurring lesions.
after unsuccessfully grieving these conditions,mcgarry filed a pro se complaint against various prison officials defendants moved under rule b to dismiss mcgarry complaint.the court referred the motion to magistrate judge john conroy,who issued a report and recommendation r r recommending,inter alia,that mcgarry thirteenth amendment claim be dismissed.mcgarry,wl,at.the magistrate sua sponte concluded that mcgarry thirteenth amendment allegations were barred as a matter of law because being forced to work in the laundry was nothing like the slavery that gave rise to the enactment of the amendment.id.at.finding that mcgarry laundry claim failed to allege labor that was akin to african slavery,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the magistrate recommended dismissing his claim and denying leave to amend,holding that any other outcome would trivialize the pain and anguish that the thirteenth amendment sought to remedy.id.quoting ford nassau cnty,d.the district court adopted the r r in full and dismissed the complaint.id.at.this appeal followed.
on appeal,mcgarry contends that his allegations of work compelled by threats of physical force or legal sanction state a claim under the thirteenth amendment.defendants contend that compelled work is insufficient to state a claim and that mcgarry must also allege that the work was similar to african slavery,a condition which defendants contend is not present here,and that,in any event,they are entitled to qualified immunity.we review the dismissal of mcgarry thirteenth amendment claim de novo.see papelino albany coll.of pharmacy of union,cir.in conducting this review,we construe the complaint liberally,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.chase grp.alliance llc city of dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we are cautious about the hasty dismissal of complaints alleging civil rights violations.see gregory daly,cir.
discussion 
the thirteenth amendment provides that n either slavery nor involuntary servitude,except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,shall exist within the united states,or any place subject to their jurisdiction.const.amend.xiii.shortly after its passage,the supreme court held that the amendment is not a mere prohibition of state laws establishing or upholding slavery,but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the united states.civil rights cases.contrary to the district court conclusion,it is that the term involuntary servitude is not limited to chattel conditions.the amendment was intended to prohibit all forms of involuntary labor,not solely to abolish chattel slavery.see slaughter house cases,the word servitude is of larger meaning than slavery see also pollock williams,noting that the undoubted aim of the thirteenth amendment was not merely to end slavery but to maintain a system of completely free and voluntary labor throughout the united states.although passed in response to the scourge of american slavery,the amendment is not a declaration in favor of a particular people,hodges.united states,overruled in part on other grounds,jones alfred mayer,but extends to reach every race and every individual,id.in united states nelson,cir,for example,we held that jews were among the races protected by the thirteenth amendment.
because the thirteenth amendment denounces a status or condition,irrespective of the manner or authority by which it is created,clyatt united states,institutions housing pretrial detainees are not exempt from the amendment scope.mcgarry was not duly convicted,const.amend xiii,and therefore does not fall within the category of persons to whom the amendment,on its face,does not apply.of course,persons sometimes may be detained in advance of securing a conviction.see united states salerno.on entering state custody,pretrial detainees surrender m any of the liberties and privileges enjoyed by other citizens even though they are still clothed in the presumption of innocence see overton bazzetta.however,although a state may subject a pretrial detainee to restrictions and conditions of the detention facility,such conditions may not violate the constitution.see bell wolfish.pretrial detainees are not outside the ambit of the thirteenth amendment involuntary servitude provision 
in united states kozminski,the supreme court defined involuntary servitude as a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury,or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process.kozminski did not break new ground.this court in united states shackney,cir concluded that work obtained or maintained by the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion is akin to
