after this court held that the eighth and fourteenth amendments forbid the execution of persons with intellectual disability,see atkins virginia,hall asked a florida state court to vacate his sentence,presenting evidence that included an iq test score of.the court denied his motion,determining that a florida statute mandated that he show an iq score of or below before being permitted to present any additional intellectual disability evidence.the state supreme court rejected hall appeal,finding the state threshold constitutional.
held the state threshold requirement,as interpreted by the florida supreme court,is unconstitutional.
a the eighth amendment,which reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,roper simmons,prohibits the execution of persons with intellectual disability.no legitimate penological purpose is served by executing the intellectually disabled.atkins,at.prohibiting such executions also protects the integrity of the trial process for individuals who face a special risk of wrongful execution because they are more likely to give false confessions,are often poor witnesses,and are less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel,at.in determining whether florida intellectual disability definition implements these principles and atkins holding,it is proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the purpose and meaning of iq scores and how the scores relate to atkins,and to consider how the several states have implemented atkins.
b florida rule disregards established medical practice.on its face,florida statute could be consistent with the views of the medical community discussed in atkins and with the conclusions reached here.it defines intellectual disability as the existence of concurrent deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning,long the defining characteristic of intellectual disability.see atkins,supra,at.and nothing in the statute precludes florida from considering an iq test standard error of measurement sem,a statistical fact reflecting the test inherent imprecision and acknowledging that an individual score is best understood as a range,five points on either side of the recorded score.as interpreted by the florida supreme court,however,florida rule disregards established medical practice in two interrelated ways it takes an iq score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant intellectual capacity,when experts would consider other evidence and it relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of a defendant abilities,while refusing to recognize that measurement inherent imprecision.while professionals have long agreed that iq test scores should be read as a range,florida uses the test score as a fixed number,thus barring further consideration of other relevant evidence,deficits in adaptive functioning,including evidence of past performance,environment,and upbringing.
c the rejection of a strict cutoff in the vast majority of states and a consistency in the trend,roper,supra,at,toward recognizing the sem provide strong evidence of consensus that society does not regard this strict cutoff as proper or humane.at most,nine states mandate a strict iq score cutoff at.thus,in states,an individual in hall position would not be deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.the direction of change has been consistent.since atkins,many states have passed legislation to comply with the constitutional requirement that persons with intellectual disability not be executed.two of those states appear to set a strict cutoff at,but at least others have either abolished the death penalty or passed legislation allowing defendants to present additional intellectual disability evidence when their iq score is above.every state legislature,save one,to have considered the issue after atkins and whose law has been interpreted by its courts has taken a position contrary to florida.
d atkins acknowledges the inherent error in iq testing and provides substantial guidance on the definition of intellectual disability.the states play a critical role in advancing the protections of atkins and providing this court with an understanding of how intellectual disability should be measured and assessed,but atkins did not give them unfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitutional protection.clinical definitions for intellectual disability which,by their express terms,rejected a strict iq test score cutoff at,and which have long included the sem,were a fundamental premise of atkins.see,at,nn.a fleeting mention of florida in a citation listing states that had outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled,at,did not signal the atkins court approval of the state current understanding of its law,which had not yet been interpreted by the florida supreme court to require a strict cutoff.
e when a defendant iq test score falls within the test acknowledged and inherent margin of error,the defendant must be able to present additional evidence of intellectual disability,including testimony regarding adaptive deficits.this legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis but is informed by the medical community diagnostic framework,which is of particular help here,where no alternative intellectual disability definition is presented,and where this court and the states have placed substantial reliance on the medical profession expertise.

freddie lee hall,petitioner florida 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of florida 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this court has held that the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution forbid the execution of persons with intellectual disability.atkins virginia.florida law defines intellectual disability to require an iq test score of or less.if,from test scores,a prisoner is deemed to have an iq above,all further exploration of intellectual disability is foreclosed.this rigid rule,the court now holds,creates an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,and thus is unconstitutional.
on february,freddie lee hall,petitioner here,and his accomplice,mark ruffin,kidnaped,beat,raped,and murdered karol hurst,a pregnant,newlywed.afterward,hall and ruffin drove to a convenience store they planned to rob.in the parking lot of the store,they killed lonnie coburn,a sheriff deputy who attempted to apprehend them.hall received the death penalty for both murders,although his sentence for the coburn murder was later reduced on account of insufficient evidence of premeditation.hall florida,so,per curiam.
hall argues that he can not be executed because of his intellectual disability.previous opinions of this court have employed the term mental retardation.this opinion uses the term intellectual disability to describe the identical phenomenon.see rosa law,stat.changing entries in the code from mental retardation to intellectual disability schalock et.al,the renaming of mental retardation understanding the change to the term intellectual disability,intellectual developmental disabilities.this change in terminology is approved and used in the latest edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,one of the basic texts used by psychiatrists and other experts the manual is often referred to by its initials dsm,followed by its edition number,see american psychiatric association,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.
when hall was first sentenced,this court had not yet ruled that the eighth amendment prohibits states from imposing the death penalty on persons with intellectual disability.see penry lynaugh.and at the time,florida law did not consider intellectual disability as a statutory mitigating factor.
after this court held that capital defendants must be permitted to present nonstatutory mitigating evidence in death penalty proceedings,hitchcock dugger,hall was resentenced.hall then presented substantial and unchallenged evidence of intellectual disability.school records indicated that his teachers identified him on numerous occasions as m entally retarded.app.hall had been prosecuted for a different,earlier crime.his lawyer in that matter later testified that the lawyer c ould really understand anything hall said.at.and,with respect to the murder trial given him in this case,hall counsel recalled that hall could not assist in his own defense because he had a mental level much lower than his age,at best comparable to the lawyer daughter.brief for petitioner.a number of medical clinicians testified that,in their professional opinion,hall was significantly retarded,app.was mentally retarded,at and had levels of understanding typically seen with toddlers,at.
as explained below in more detail,an individual ability or lack of ability to adapt or adjust to the requirements of daily life,and success or lack of success in doing so,is central to the framework followed by psychiatrists and other professionals in diagnosing intellectual disability.see,at.hall siblings testified that there was something very wrong with him as a child.app.hall was slow with speech and slow to learn.at.he walked and talked long after his other brothers and sisters,at,and had great difficulty forming his words,at.
hall upbringing appeared to make his deficits in adaptive functioning all the more severe.hall was raised in the words of the sentencing judge under the most horrible family circumstances imaginable.at.t eachers and siblings alike immediately recognized hall to be significantly mentally retarded t his retardation did not garner any sympathy from his mother,but rather caused much scorn to befall him.at.hall was c onstantly beaten because he was slow or because he made simple mistakes.ibid.his mother would strap hall to his bed at night,with a rope thrown over a rafter.in the morning,she would awaken hall by hoisting him up and whipping him with a belt,rope,or cord.ibid.hall was beaten ten or fifteen times a week sometimes.at.his mother tied him in a croaker sack,swung it over a fire,and beat him,buried him in the sand up to his neck to strengthen his legs,and held a gun on hall while she poked him with sticks.hall florida,so,barkett,dissenting.
the jury,notwithstanding this testimony,voted to sentence hall to death,and the sentencing court adopted the jury recommendation.the court found that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that freddie lee hall has been mentally retarded his entire life.app.yet the court also suspect ed that the defense experts were guilty of some professional overkill,because n othing of which the experts testified could explain how a psychotic,person could formulate a plan whereby a car was stolen and a convenience store was robbed.at.the sentencing court went on to state that,even assuming the expert testimony to be accurate,the learning disabilities,mental retardation,and other mental difficulties can not be used to justify,excuse or extenuate the moral culpability of the defendant in this cause.at.hall was again sentenced to death.the florida supreme court affirmed,concluding that hall argument that his mental retardation provided a pretense of moral or legal justification had no merit.hall,so,at.chief justice barkett dissented,arguing that executing a person with intellectual disability violated the state constitution prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment,at.
in,this court ruled that the eighth amendment prohibited the execution of persons with intellectual disability.atkins virginia,at.on november,hall filed a motion claiming that he had intellectual disability and could not be executed.more than five years later,florida held a hearing to consider hall motion.hall again presented evidence of intellectual disability,including an iq test score of.hall had received nine iq evaluations in years,with scores ranging from to,brief for respondent,but the sentencing court excluded the two scores below for evidentiary reasons,leaving only scores between and.see app.so.in response,florida argued that hall could not be found intellectually disabled because florida law requires that,as a threshold matter,hall show an iq test score of or below before presenting any additional evidence of his intellectual disability.app.u nder the law,if an is above,a person is not mentally retarded the florida supreme court rejected hall appeal and held that florida threshold was constitutional.so,at.
this court granted certiorari.
the eighth amendment provides that e xcessive bail shall not be required,nor excessive fines imposed,nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.the fourteenth amendment applies those restrictions to the states.roper simmons,furman georgia,per curiam.by protecting even those convicted of heinous crimes,the eighth amendment reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons.roper,supra,at see also trop dulles,plurality opinion the basic concept underlying the eighth amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man 
the eighth amendment is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.weems united states.to enforce the constitution protection of human dignity,this court looks to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.trop,supra,at.the eighth amendment protection of dignity reflects the nation we have been,the nation we are,and the nation we aspire to be.this is to affirm that the nation constant,unyielding purpose must be to transmit the constitution so that its precepts and guarantees retain their meaning and force.
the eighth amendment prohibits certain punishments as a categorical matter.no citizen may be denaturalized.ibid.no person may be sentenced to death for a crime committed as a juvenile.roper,supra,at.and,as relevant for this case,persons with intellectual disability may not be executed.atkins,at.
no legitimate penological purpose is served by executing a person with intellectual disability,at.to do so contravenes the eighth amendment,for to impose the harshest of punishments on an intellectually disabled person violates his or her inherent dignity as a human being.p unishment is justified under one or more of three principal rationales rehabilitation,deterrence,and retribution.kennedy louisiana.rehabilitation,it is evident,is not an applicable rationale for the death penalty.see gregg georgia,joint opinion of stewart,powell,and stevens,jj.as for deterrence,those with intellectual disability are,by reason of their condition,likely unable to make the calculated judgments that are the premise for the deterrence rationale.they have a diminished ability to process information,to learn from experience,to engage in logical reasoning,or to control impulses which make s it less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and,as a result,control their conduct based upon that information.atkins,at.retributive values are also by executing those with intellectual disability.the diminished capacity of the intellectually disabled lessens moral culpability and hence the retributive value of the punishment.see,at if the culpability of the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the state,the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution 
a further reason for not imposing the death penalty on a person who is intellectually disabled is to protect the integrity of the trial process.these persons face a special risk of wrongful execution because they are more likely to give false confessions,are often poor witnesses,and are less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel,at.this is not to say that under current law persons with intellectual disability who meet the law requirements for criminal responsibility may not be tried and punished,at.they may not,however,receive the law most severe sentence,at.
the question this case presents is how intellectual disability must be defined in order to implement these principles and the holding of atkins.to determine if florida cutoff rule is valid,it is proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the purpose and meaning of iq scores to determine how the scores relate to the holding of atkins.this in turn leads to a better understanding of how the legislative policies of various states,and the holdings of state courts,implement the atkins rule.that understanding informs our determination whether there is a consensus that instructs how to decide the specific issue presented here.and,in conclusion,this court must express its own independent determination reached in light of the instruction found in those sources and authorities.
that this court,state courts,and state legislatures consult and are informed by the work of medical experts in determining intellectual disability is unsurprising.those professionals use their learning and skills to study and consider the consequences of the classification schemes they devise in the diagnosis of persons with mental or psychiatric disorders or disabilities.society relies upon medical and professional expertise to define and explain how to diagnose the mental condition at issue.and the definition of intellectual disability by skilled professionals has implications far beyond the confines of the death penalty for it is relevant to education,access to social programs,and medical treatment plans.in determining who qualifies as intellectually disabled,it is proper to consult the medical community opinions.
as the court noted in atkins,the medical community defines intellectual disability according to three criteria significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,deficits in adaptive functioning the inability to learn basic skills and adjust behavior to changing circumstances,and onset of these deficits during the developmental period.see,at,at brief for american psychological association et as amici curiae hereinafter apa brief.this last factor,referred to as age of onset,is not at issue.
the first and second criteria deficits in intellectual functioning and deficits in adaptive functioning are central here.in the context of a formal assessment,t he existence of concurrent deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning has long been the defining characteristic of intellectual disability.at.
on its face,the florida statute could be consistent with the views of the medical community noted and discussed in atkins.florida statute defines intellectual disability for purposes of an atkins proceeding as significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the period from conception to age.stat.the statute further defines significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as performance that is two or more standard deviations from the mean score on a standardized intelligence test.ibid.the mean iq test score is.the concept of standard deviation describes how scores are dispersed in a population.standard deviation is distinct from standard error of measurement,a concept which describes the reliability of a test and is discussed further below.the standard deviation on an iq test is approximately points,and so two standard deviations is approximately points.thus a test taker who performs two or more standard deviations from the mean will score approximately points below the mean on an iq test,a score of approximately points.
on its face this statute could be interpreted consistently with atkins and with the conclusions this court reaches in the instant case.nothing in the statute precludes florida from taking into account the iq test standard error of measurement,and as discussed below there is evidence that florida legislature intended to include the measurement error in the calculation.but the florida supreme court has interpreted the provisions more.it has held that a person whose test score is above,including a score within the margin for measurement error,does not have an intellectual disability and is barred from presenting other evidence that would show his faculties are limited.see cherry state,so,per curiam.that strict iq test score cutoff of is the issue in this case.
pursuant to this mandatory cutoff,sentencing courts can not consider even substantial and weighty evidence of intellectual disability as measured and made manifest by the defendant failure or inability to adapt to his social and cultural environment,including medical histories,behavioral records,school tests and reports,and testimony regarding past behavior and family circumstances.this is so even though the medical community accepts that all of this evidence can be probative of intellectual disability,including for individuals who have an iq test score above.see apa brief t he relevant clinical authorities all agree that an individual with an iq score above may properly be diagnosed with intellectual disability if significant limitations in adaptive functioning also exist at a person with an iq score above may have such severe adaptive behavior problems that the person actual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower iq score 
florida rule disregards established medical practice in two interrelated ways.it takes an iq score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant intellectual capacity,when experts in the field would consider other evidence.it also relies on a purportedly scientific measurement of the defendant abilities,his iq score,while refusing to recognize that the score is,on its own terms,imprecise.
the professionals who design,administer,and interpret iq tests have agreed,for years now,that iq test scores should be read not as a single fixed number but as a range.see wechsler,the measurement of adult intelligence ed.reporting the range of error on an early iq test.each iq test has a standard error of measurement,often referred to by the abbreviation sem.a test sem is a statistical fact,a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself.see furr bacharach,psychometrics ed.identifying the sem as one of the most important concepts in measurement theory an individual iq test score on any given exam may fluctuate for a variety of reasons.these include the health practice from earlier tests the environment or location of the test the examiner demeanor the subjective judgment involved in scoring certain questions on the exam and simple lucky guessing.see american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities,schalock et,user guide to accompany the edition of intellectual disability definition,classification,and systems of supports hereinafter aaidd manual kaufman,iq testing.
the sem reflects the reality that an individual intellectual functioning can not be reduced to a single numerical score.for purposes of most iq tests,the sem means that an individual score is best understood as a range of scores on either side of the recorded score.the sem allows clinicians to calculate a range within which one may say an individual true iq score lies.see apa brief sem is a unit of measurement sem equates to a confidence of that the measured score falls within a given score range,while sem provides a confidence level that the measured score is within a broader range a score of,for instance,is generally considered to reflect a range between and with confidence and a range of and with a confidence.see,at individuals with intellectual disability have scores of approximately two standard deviations or more below the population mean,including a margin for measurement error generally points t his involves a score of apa brief for example,the average sem for the is iq test points and the average sem for the is iq test points test manuals report sems by different age groupings these scores are similar,but not identical,often due to sampling error even when a person has taken multiple tests,each separate score must be assessed using the sem,and the analysis of multiple iq scores jointly is a complicated endeavor.see schneider,principles of assessment of aptitude and achievement,in the oxford handbook of child psychological assessment,saklofske,reynolds,schwean,eds.in addition,because the test itself may be flawed,or administered in a consistently flawed manner,multiple examinations may result in repeated similar scores,so that even a consistent score is not conclusive evidence of intellectual functioning.
despite these professional explanations,florida law used the test score as a fixed number,thus barring further consideration of other evidence bearing on the question of intellectual disability.for professionals to diagnose and for the law then to determine whether an intellectual disability exists once the sem applies and the individual iq score is or below the inquiry would consider factors indicating whether the person had deficits in adaptive functioning.these include evidence of past performance,environment,and upbringing.
a significant majority of states implement the protections of atkins by taking the sem into account,thus acknowledging the error inherent in using a test score without necessary adjustment.this calculation provides objective indicia of society standards in the context of the eighth amendment.roper,at.only the kentucky and virginia legislatures have adopted a fixed score cutoff identical to florida.stat.ann.lexis supp.bowling commonwealth.code ann.lexis supp.johnson commonwealth,vacated and remanded on other grounds.alabama also may use a strict iq score cutoff at,although not as a result of legislative action.see smith state,so.crim.app.the alabama supreme court did not adopt any margin of error when examining a defendant iq score petitioner does not question the rule in states which use a cutoff at or greater,tr.of oral arg,and so they are not included alongside florida in this analysis.
in addition to these states,arizona,delaware,kansas,north carolina,and washington have statutes which could be interpreted to provide a cutoff leading to the same result that florida mandates in its cases.see.stat.ann.f west.code ann.tit,d supp.stat.ann.supp.stat.ann.lexis.code c.that these state laws might be interpreted to require a cutoff does not mean that they will be so interpreted,however.see,state vela,although nebraska statute specifies a n intelligence quotient of seventy or below on a reliably administered intelligence quotient test,t he district court found that the defendant score of on the iq test,considered in light of the standard error of measurement,could be considered as subaverage general intellectual functioning for purposes of diagnosing mental retardation 
arizona statute appears to set a broad statutory cutoff at.stat.ann.f west,but another provision instructs courts to take into account the margin of error for a test administered.id.at k.how courts are meant to interpret the statute in a situation like hall is not altogether clear.the principal arizona case on the matter,state roque,ariz,states that the statute accounts for margin of error by requiring multiple tests,and that if the defendant achieves a score of or below on any one of the tests,then the court proceeds to a hearing.id.at.but that case also notes that the defendant had an iq score of,well outside the margin of error,and that all but one of the of the iq test were above.id.
kansas has not had an execution in almost five decades,and so its laws and jurisprudence on this issue are unlikely to receive attention on this specific question.see atkins,at e ven in those states that allow the execution of mentally retarded offenders,the practice is uncommon.some states continue to authorize executions,but none have been carried out in decades.thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring the execution of the mentally retarded in those states delaware has executed three individuals in the past decade,while washington has executed one person,and has recently suspended its death penalty.none of the four individuals executed recently in those states appears to have brought a claim similar to that advanced here.
thus,at most nine states mandate a strict iq score cutoff at.of these,four states delaware,kansas,north carolina,and washington appear not to have considered the issue in their courts.on the other side of the ledger stand the states that have abolished the death penalty,either in full or for new offenses,and oregon,which has suspended the death penalty and executed only two individuals in the past years.see roper,at the court should have considered those states that had abandoned the death penalty altogether as part of the consensus against the juvenile death penalty in those states,of course,a person in hall position could not be executed even without a finding of intellectual disability.thus in states an individual in hall position an individual with an iq score of would not be deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.
these aggregate numbers are not the only considerations bearing on a determination of consensus.consistency of the direction of change is also relevant.see,at quoting atkins,supra,at.since atkins,many states have passed legislation to comply with the constitutional requirement that persons with intellectual disability not be executed.two of these states,virginia and delaware,appear to set a strict cutoff at,although as discussed,delaware courts have yet to interpret the law.in contrast,at least states have either abolished the death penalty or passed legislation allowing defendants to present additional evidence of intellectual disability when their iq test score is above.
since atkins,five states have abolished the death penalty through legislation.see.pub.acts.comp.stat.ch,west.correc.servs.code ann.et lexis stat.ann.b west supp.laws ch.in addition,the new york court of appeals invalidated new york death penalty under the state constitution in,see people levalle,and legislation has not been passed to reinstate it.and when it did impose the death penalty,new york did not employ an iq cutoff in determining intellectual disability.crim.proc.law ann.e west.
in addition to these states,at least five others have passed legislation allowing a defendant to present additional evidence of intellectual disability even when an iq test score is above.see cal.penal code ann.west supp.no iq cutoff idaho code lexis supp.seventy or below pizzutto state,idaho,the alleged error in iq testing is plus or minus five points.the district court was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the undisputed facts code crim.proc,west supp.no iq cutoff.stat.no iq cutoff utah code ann lexis no iq cutoff.the code likewise does not set a strict iq cutoff.see c.and no state that previously allowed defendants with an iq score over to present additional evidence of intellectual disability has modified its law to create a strict cutoff at.roper,supra,at since stanford kentucky,no state that previously prohibited capital punishment for juveniles has reinstated it 
in summary,every state legislature to have considered the issue after atkins save virginia and whose law has been interpreted by its courts has taken a position contrary to that of florida.indeed,the florida legislature,which passed the relevant legislation prior to atkins,might well have believed that its law would not create a fixed cutoff at.the staff analysis accompanying the bill states that it does not contain a set iq level.two standard deviations from these tests is a iq,although it can be extended up to.senate staff analysis and economic impact statement.but the florida supreme court interpreted the law to require a cutoff at,see cherry,so,at,and the court is bound by that interpretation.
the rejection of the strict cutoff in the vast majority of states and the consistency in the trend,roper,supra,at,toward recognizing the sem provide strong evidence of consensus that our society does not regard this strict cutoff as proper or humane.
atkins itself acknowledges the inherent error in iq testing.it is true that atkins did not provide definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person who claims mental retardation falls within the protection of the eighth amendment.bobby bies.in atkins,the court stated 
not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.as was our approach in ford wainwright with regard to insanity,we leave to the state s the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.at quoting ford wainwright,citation omitted.
as discussed above,the states play a critical role in advancing protections and providing the court with information that contributes to an understanding of how intellectual disability should be measured and assessed.but atkins did not give the states unfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitutional protection.
the atkins court twice cited definitions of intellectual disability which,by their express terms,rejected a strict iq test score cutoff at.atkins first cited the definition provided in the mild mental retardation is typically used to describe people with an iq level of to approximately.at,citing diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.the court later noted that an iq between and or lower is typically considered the cutoff iq score for the intellectual function prong of the mental retardation definition.at.furthermore,immediately after the court declared that it left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction,at,the court stated in an accompanying footnote that t he state statutory definitions of mental retardation are not identical,but generally conform to the clinical definitions,ibid.
thus atkins itself not only cited clinical definitions for intellectual disability but also noted that the states standards,on which the court based its own conclusion,conformed to those definitions.in the words of atkins,those persons who meet the clinical definitions of intellectual disability by definition have diminished capacities to understand and process information,to communicate,to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience,to engage in logical reasoning,to control impulses,and to understand the reactions of others.at.thus,they bear diminish ed personal culpability.ibid.the clinical definitions of intellectual disability,which take into account that iq scores represent a range,not a fixed number,were a fundamental premise of atkins.and those clinical definitions have long included the sem.see diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.since any measurement is fallible,an iq score is generally thought to involve an error of measurement of approximately five points hence,an iq of is considered to represent a band or zone of to.treating the iq with some flexibility permits inclusion in the mental retardation category of people with iqs somewhat higher than who exhibit significant deficits in adaptive behavior 
respondent argues that the current florida law was favorably cited by the atkins court.see brief for respondent as evidence of the national consensus,the court specifically cited florida statute at issue here,which has not substantively changed while atkins did refer to florida law in a citation listing states which had outlawed the execution of the intellectually disabled,at,that fleeting mention did not signal the court approval of florida current understanding of the law.as discussed above,when atkins was decided the florida supreme court had not yet interpreted the law to require a strict iq cutoff at.that new interpretation runs counter to the clinical definition cited throughout atkins and to florida own legislative report indicating this kind of cutoff need not be used.
respondent argument also conflicts with the logic of atkins and the eighth amendment.if the states were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,the court decision in atkins could become a nullity,and the eighth amendment protection of human dignity would not become a reality.this court thus reads atkins to provide substantial guidance on the definition of intellectual disability.
the actions of the states and the precedents of this court give us essential instruction,roper,at,but the inquiry must go further.t he constitution contemplates that in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty under the eighth amendment.coker georgia,plurality opinion.that exercise of independent judgment is the court judicial duty.see roper,supra,at t o the extent stanford was based on a rejection of the idea that this court is required to bring its independent judgment to bear on the proportionality of the death penalty for a particular class of crimes or offenders,it suffices to note that this rejection was inconsistent with prior eighth amendment decisions citation omitted.
in this court independent judgment,the florida statute,as interpreted by its courts,is unconstitutional.
in addition to the views of the states and the court precedent,this determination is informed by the views of medical experts.these views do not dictate the court decision,yet the court does not disregard these informed assessments.see kansas crane,t he science of psychiatry informs but does not control ultimate legal determinations it is the court duty to interpret the constitution,but it need not do so in isolation.the legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis,but it is informed by the medical community diagnostic framework.atkins itself points to the diagnostic criteria employed by psychiatric professionals.and the professional community teachings are of particular help in this case,where no alternative definition of intellectual disability is presented and where this court and the states have placed substantial reliance on the expertise of the medical profession.
by failing to take into account the sem and setting a strict cutoff at,florida goes against the unanimous professional consensus.apa brief.neither florida nor its amici point to a single medical professional who supports this cutoff.the repudiates it iq test scores are approximations of conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to assess reasoning in situations and mastery of practical tasks.at.this statement well captures the court independent assessment that an individual with an iq test score between and or lower,atkins,supra,at,may show intellectual disability by presenting additional evidence regarding difficulties in adaptive functioning.
the flaws in florida law are the result of the inherent error in iq tests themselves.an iq score is an approximation,not a final and infallible assessment of intellectual functioning.see apa brief i t is standard pyschometric practice to report the estimates of relevant reliabilities and standard errors of measurement when reporting a test score ibid.the margin of error is inherent to the accuracy of iq scores furr,psychometrics,at t he standard error of measurement is an important psychometric value with implications for applied measurement sem is not a concept peculiar to the psychiatric profession and iq tests.it is a measure that is recognized and relied upon by those who create and devise tests of all sorts,at identifying the sem as one of the most important concepts in measurement theory 
this awareness of the iq test limits is of particular importance when conducting the conjunctive assessment necessary to assess an individual intellectual ability.see american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities,intellectual disability definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.it must be stressed that the diagnosis of intellectual disability is intended to reflect a clinical judgment rather than an actuarial determination 
intellectual disability is a condition,not a number.see,at.courts must recognize,as does the medical community,that the iq test is imprecise.this is not to say that an iq test score is unhelpful.it is of considerable significance,as the medical community recognizes.but in using these scores to assess a defendant eligibility for the death penalty,a state must afford these test scores the same studied skepticism that those who design and use the tests do,and understand that an iq test score represents a range rather than a fixed number.a state that ignores the inherent imprecision of these tests risks executing a person who suffers from intellectual disability.see apa brief under the universally accepted clinical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability,the court determination that hall is not intellectually disabled can not be considered valid 
this court agrees with the medical experts that when a defendant iq test score falls within the test acknowledged and inherent margin of error,the defendant must be able to present additional evidence of intellectual disability,including testimony regarding adaptive deficits.
it is not sound to view a single factor as dispositive of a conjunctive and interrelated assessment.see,at a person with an iq score above may have such severe adaptive behavior problems that the person actual functioning is comparable to that of individuals with a lower iq score the florida statute,as interpreted by its courts,misuses iq score on its own terms and this,in turn,bars consideration of evidence that must be considered in determining whether a defendant in a capital case has intellectual disability.florida rule is invalid under the constitution cruel and unusual punishments clause.
florida seeks to execute a man because he scored a instead of on an iq test.florida is one of just a few states to have this rigid rule.florida rule misconstrues the court statements in atkins that intellectually is characterized by an iq of approximately.at.florida rule is in direct opposition to the views of those who design,administer,and interpret the iq test.by failing to take into account the standard error of measurement,florida law not only contradicts the test own design but also bars an essential part of a sentencing court inquiry into adaptive functioning.freddie lee hall may or may not be intellectually,but the law requires that he have the opportunity to present evidence of his intellectual disability,including deficits in adaptive functioning over his lifetime.
the death penalty is the gravest sentence our society may impose.persons facing that most severe sanction must have a fair opportunity to show that the constitution prohibits their execution.florida law contravenes our nation commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world.the states are laboratories for experimentation,but those experiments may not deny the basic dignity the constitution protects.
the judgment of the florida supreme court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
so ordered.

in atkins virginia,the court held that the eighth amendment prohibits a death sentence for defendants who are intellectually disabled but does not mandate the use of a single method for identifying such defendants.today,the court overrules the latter holding based largely on the positions adopted by private professional associations.in taking this step,the court sharply departs from the framework prescribed in prior eighth amendment cases and adopts a uniform national rule that is both conceptually unsound and likely to result in confusion.i therefore respectfully dissent.
the court approach in this case marks a new and most unwise turn in our eighth amendment case law.in atkins and other cases,the court held that the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment embodies the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,and the court explained that those evolving standards should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.at internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,the court pinpointed that the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country legislatures.ibid.
in these prior cases,when the court referred to the evolving standards of a maturing society,the court meant the standards of american society as a whole.now,however,the court strikes down a state law based on the evolving standards of professional societies,most notably the american psychiatric association apa.the court begins its analysis with the views of those associations,see ante,at,and then,after briefly discussing the enactments of state legislatures,see ante,at,returns to the associations views in interpreting atkins and in exercising the court independent judgment on the constitutionality of florida law,see ante,at.this approach can not be reconciled with the framework prescribed by our eighth amendment cases.
under this court modern eighth amendment precedents,whether a punishment is cruel and unusual depends on currently prevailing societal norms,and the court has long held that laws enacted by state legislatures provide the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values,penry lynaugh.this is so because in a democratic society,legislatures,not courts,are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people,gregg georgia,joint opinion of stewart,powell,and stevens,jj.internal quotation marks omitted.under this approach,as originally conceived,the court first asked whether a challenged practice contravened a clear national consensus evidenced by state legislation,and only if such a consensus was found would the court go on and ask whether there is reason to disagree with the states judgment.atkins,at.
invoking this procedure,atkins held that the eighth amendment forbids the execution of defendants who are intellectually disabled.see,at.critical to the court analysis was the conclusion that today our society views mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.at.this consensus,the court continued,unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty.at.
while atkins identified a consensus against the execution of the intellectually disabled,the court observed that there was serious disagreement among the states with respect to the best method for determining which offenders are in fact retarded.ibid.the court therefore le ft to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to identify these defendants.ibid.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.as we noted just five years ago,atkins did not provide definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person is intellectually disabled.bobby bies.
consistent with the role that atkins left for the states,florida follows the procedure now at issue.as we explained in atkins,in order for a defendant to qualify as intellectually disabled,three separate requirements must be met it must be shown that a defendant has both significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and deficits in adaptive behavior,and that the onset of both factors occurred before the age of.see,at ante,at.in implementing this framework,has determined that the first requirement can not be satisfied if the defendant scores higher than on iq tests,the method of measuring intellectual functioning the court today holds that this scheme offends the eighth amendment.the court objects that florida approach treats iq test scores as conclusive and ignores the fact that an iq score might not reflect true iq because of errors in measurement.the court then concludes that a state must view a defendant iq as a range of potential scores calculated using a statistical concept known as the standard error of measurement or sem.see part,infra.the court holds that if this range includes an iq of or below the accepted level for intellectual disability,the defendant must be permitted to produce other evidence of intellectual disability in addition to iq scores.
i see no support for this holding in our traditional approach for identifying our society evolving standards of decency.under any fair analysis of current state laws,the same absence of a consensus that this court found in atkins persists today.it is telling that hall himself does not rely on a consensus among states.he candidly argues instead that the precise number of states that share florida approach is immaterial.reply brief.
the court analysis is more aggressive.according to the court,a significant majority of states reject florida strict cutoff and instead take the sem into account when deciding whether a defendant meets the first requirement of the test.ante,at.on the court count,at most nine states mandate a strict iq score cutoff at states allow defendants to present additional evidence when an individual test score is between and,ante,at and states have abolished the death penalty or have long suspended its operation.ante,at.from these numbers,the court concludes that in states a defendant with an iq score of would not be deemed automatically eligible for the death penalty.ibid this analysis is deeply flawed.
to begin,in addition to the other states that the court recognizes as having rules similar to florida,more,idaho,does not appear to require courts to take the sem into account in rejecting a claim of intellectual disability and of the remaining states with the death penalty,have either said nothing about the sem or have not clarified whether they require its use accordingly,of the states,including florida do not require that the sem be taken into account,consider the sem,and have not taken a definitive position on this question.these statistics can not be regarded as establishing a national consensus against florida approach.
attempting to circumvent these statistics,the court includes in its count the states that never impose the death penalty,but this maneuver can not be justified.it is true that the court has counted states in some prior eighth amendment cases,but those cases concerned the substantive question whether a class of individuals should be categorically ineligible for the death penalty.in roper simmons,for example,the court counted states as part of the consensus against the imposition of a capital sentence for a crime committed by a minor,at.the court reasoned that a state decision to abolish the death penalty necessarily demonstrates a judgment that the death penalty is inappropriate for all offenders,including juveniles.ibid.
no similar reasoning is possible here.the fact that a state has abolished the death penalty says nothing about how that state would resolve the evidentiary problem of identifying defendants who are intellectually disabled.as i explain below,a state may reasonably conclude that florida approach is fairer than and just as accurate as the approach that the court now requires,and therefore it can not be inferred that a state,if forced to choose between the two approaches,would necessarily select the court.for all these reasons,it is quite wrong for the court to proclaim that the vast majority of states have rejected florida approach.ante,at.
not only are the states divided on the question whether the sem should play a role in determining whether a capital defendant is intellectually disabled,but the states that require consideration of the sem do not agree on the role that the sem should play.those states differ,for example,on the sort of evidence that can be introduced when iq testing reveals an iq over.some require further evidence of intellectual deficits,while others permit the defendant to move on to the second prong of the test and submit evidence of deficits in adaptive behavior the fairest assessment of the current situation is that the states have adopted a multitude of approaches to a very difficult question.
in light of all this,the resolution of this case should be straightforward just as there was no methodological consensus among the states at the time of atkins,there is no such consensus today.and in the absence of such a consensus,we have no basis for holding that florida method contravenes our society standards of decency.
perhaps because it recognizes the weakness of its arguments about a true national consensus,the court places heavy reliance on the views some only recently announced of professional organizations,but the court attempts to downplay the degree to which its decision is dependent upon the views of these private groups.in a game attempt to shoehorn the views of these associations into the calculus,the court reasons as follows.the views of these associations,the court states,help in determining how iq scores relate to the holding in atkins t his in turn leads to a better understanding of how the legislative policies of various states,and the holdings of state courts,implement the atkins rule and t hat understanding informs our determination whether there is a consensus that instructs how to decide the specific issue presented here.ante,at.
i can not follow the court logic.under our modern eighth amendment cases,what counts are our society standards which is to say,the standards of the american people not the standards of professional associations,which at best represent the views of a small professional elite.
the court also mistakenly suggests that its is dictated by atkins.see ante,at.on the contrary,atkins expressly left to the states the task of defining intellectual disability.and although the atkins court perceived a professional consensus about the best procedure to be used in identifying the intellectually,the atkins court declined to import that view into the law,at.instead,the court made clear that this professional consensus was by no means dispositive.at,see,at,and.
the court reliance on the views of professional associations will also lead to serious practical problems.i will briefly note a few.
first,because the views of professional associations often change tying eighth amendment law to these views will lead to instability and continue to fuel litigation.this danger is dramatically illustrated by the most recent publication of the apa,on which the court relies.this publication fundamentally alters the first prong of the longstanding,definition of intellectual disability that was embraced by atkins and has been adopted by most states.in this new publication,the apa discards significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as an element of the test elevating the apa current views to constitutional significance therefore throws into question the basic approach that atkins approved and that most of the states have followed.
it is also noteworthy that changes adopted by professional associations are sometimes rescinded.for example,in the aaidd extended the baseline intellectual functioning cutoff from an iq of or below to a score of approximately to or below.aaidd ed.table boldface deleted see kaplan sadock comprehensive textbook of psychiatry sadock,sadock,ruiz,ed.hereinafter kaplan sadock.that change generated much controversy by,only states used the aaidd definition,with states continuing to use the definition.ibid.and in the aaidd,the baseline iq was changed back to approximately or less.ibid.
second,the court approach implicitly calls upon the judiciary either to follow every new change in the thinking of these professional organizations or to judge the validity of each new change.here,for example,the court tacitly makes the judgment that the diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability that prevailed at the time when atkins was decided are no longer legitimate.the publications that atkins cited differ markedly from more recent editions now endorsed by the court.see,at.
third,the court approach requires the judiciary to determine which professional organizations are entitled to special deference.and what if professional organizations disagree the court provides no guidance for deciding which organizations views should govern.
fourth,the court binds eighth amendment law to definitions of intellectual disability that are promulgated for use in making a variety of decisions that are quite different from the decision whether the imposition of a death sentence in a particular case would serve a valid penological end.in a case,intellectual functioning is important because of its correlation with the ability to understand the gravity of the crime and the purpose of the penalty,as well as the ability to resist a momentary impulse or the influence of others.see,at.by contrast,in determining eligibility for social services,adaptive functioning may be much more important,at xxxvii clinical considerations may not be relevant to legal judgments that turn on individual responsibility at similar.practical problems like these call for legislative judgments,not judicial resolution.
because i find no consensus among the states,i would not independently assess the method that florida has adopted for determining intellectual disability.but even if it were appropriate for us to look beyond the evidence of societal standards,i could not conclude that florida method is unconstitutional.the court faults florida for tak ing an iq score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant intellectual capacity and for failing to recognize that an iq score may be imprecise.ante,at.in my view,however,florida has adopted a sensible standard that comports with the longstanding belief that iq tests are the best measure of intellectual functioning.and although the court entirely ignores this part of the florida scheme,the state takes into account the inevitable risk of testing error by permitting defendants to introduce multiple scores.
in contrast,the court establishes a standard that conflates what have long been understood to be two independent requirements for proving intellectual disability significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and deficits in adaptive behavior.the court also mandates use of an alternative method of dealing with the risk of testing error without any hint that it is more accurate than florida approach.
the first supposed error that the court identifies is that florida takes an iq score as conclusive evidence of intellectual functioning.ante,at.as an initial matter,one would get the impression from reading the court opinion that hall introduced only one test score of.see ante,at.in truth,the florida courts considered multiple scores,all above,on the particular iq test that hall has dubbed the gold standard.see brief for petitioner app.florida statute imposes no limit on the number of iq scores that a defendant may introduce,so the court is simply wrong to analyze the florida system as one that views a single iq score above as final and conclusive evidence that a defendant does not suffer from subaverage intellectual functioning.see brief for respondent florida rule allows for multiple evaluations,and if hall believed a statistical error rate prevented any of his tests from reflecting his true score,he could have sought still more testing 
the proper question to ask,therefore,is whether actual approach falls outside the range of discretion allowed by atkins.the court offers no persuasive reason for concluding that it does.indeed,the court opinion never identifies what other evidence of intellectual functioning it would require florida to admit.as we recognized in atkins,the longstanding practices of the states,and at least the previous views of professional organizations,seem to reflect the understanding that iq scores are the best way to measure intellectual functioning.see,at until its most recent publication,the apa,for example,ranked the severity of intellectual disability exclusively by iq scores,necessarily pinpointing the onset of the disability according to iq.see,at.
we have been presented with no solid evidence that the longstanding reliance on multiple iq test scores as a measure of intellectual functioning is so unreasonable or outside the ordinary as to be unconstitutional.the court has certainly not supplied any such information.
if the court had merely held that florida must permit defendants to introduce additional evidence whatever that might be of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,its decision would be more limited in scope.but as i understand the court opinion,it also holds that when iq tests reveal an iq between and,defendants must be allowed to present evidence of deficits in adaptive behavior that is,the second prong of the test.see ante,at.that is a remarkable change in what we took to be a universal understanding of intellectual disability just years ago.
in atkins,we instructed that clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning,but also significant limitations in adaptive skills.at emphasis and alterations added.that is the approach taken by the vast majority of states as the court correctly recognizes,most states require concurrent deficits in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior,requiring defendants to prove both.ante,at emphasis added 
yet the court now holds that when a defendant iq score is as high as,a court must consider factors indicating whether the person has deficits in adaptive functioning.ante,at see ante,at.in other words,even when a defendant has failed to show that he meets the first prong of the standard for intellectual disability significantly subaverage functioning,evidence of the second prong deficits in adaptive behavior can establish intellectual disability.
the court offers little explanation for this sea change.it asserts vaguely that i t is not sound to view a single factor as dispositive of a conjunctive and interrelated assessment.ante,at.but the court ignores the fact that deficits in adaptive behavior can not be used to establish deficits in mental functioning because the two prongs are meant to show distinct components of intellectual disability.i ntellectual functions include reasoning,problem solving,planning,abstract thinking,judgment,academic learning,and learning from experience,while adaptive functioning refers to the ability to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility.at.strong evidence of a deficit in adaptive behavior does not necessarily demonstrate a deficit in intellectual functioning.and without the latter,a person simply can not be classified as intellectually disabled.
it is particularly troubling to relax the proof requirements for the prong because that is the prong that most directly relates to the concerns that led to our primary holding in atkins.there,we explained that the diminished ability to understand and process information,to learn from experience,to engage in logical reasoning,or to control impulses diminished intellectual functioning make it less likely that a defendant can process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and therefore be deterred from committing murders,at see also,at t hey often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan see also ante,at.a defendant who does not display significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is therefore not among the class of defendants we identified in atkins.
finally,relying primarily on proof of adaptive deficits will produce inequities in the administration of capital punishment.as far as i can tell,adaptive behavior is a malleable factor without firm theoretical and empirical roots.see kaplan sadock.no consensus exists among states or medical practitioners about what facts are most critical in analyzing that factor,and its measurement relies largely on subjective judgments.florida approach avoids the disparities that reliance on such a factor tends to produce.it thus promotes consistency in the application of the death penalty and confidence that it is not being administered haphazardly.
the court second interrelated objection to florida rule is that it fails to account for the risk of error inherent in iq testing.in order to diminish this risk,the court establishes a rule that if iq testing reveals an iq between and,a claim of intellectual disability can not be rejected on the basis of test scores alone.ante,at.the court both misunderstands
