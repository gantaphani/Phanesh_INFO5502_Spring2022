damiana ochoa worked for eight years in a physically demanding job for petitioner mclane,a services company.mclane requires employees in those positions both new employees and those returning from medical leave to take a physical evaluation.when ochoa returned from three months of maternity leave,she failed the evaluation three times and was fired.she then filed a sex discrimination charge under title vii of the civil rights act of.the equal employment opportunity eeoc began an investigation,but mclane declined its request for pedigree information names,social security numbers,addresses,and telephone numbers of employees asked to take the evaluation.after the eeoc expanded the investigation scope both geographically to cover mclane national operations and substantively to investigate possible age discrimination,it issued subpoenas,as authorized by,requesting pedigree information relating to its new investigation.when mclane refused to provide the information,the eeoc filed two actions in federal district court one arising out of ochoa charge and one arising out of the eeoc own charge seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.the district judge declined to enforce the subpoenas,finding that the pedigree information was not relevant to the charges,but the ninth circuit reversed.reviewing the district court decision to quash the subpoena de novo,the court concluded that the lower court erred in finding the pedigree information irrelevant.
held a district court decision whether to enforce or quash an eeoc subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion,not de novo.
a both factors that this court examines when considering whether such decision should be subject to searching or deferential appellate review point toward review.first,the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals is to review a district court decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena for abuse of discretion.title vii confers on the eeoc the same authority to issue subpoenas that the national labor relations act nlra confers on the national labor relations board nlrb.during the three decades between the nlra enactment and the incorporation of its provisions into title vii,every circuit to consider the question had held that a district court decision on enforcement of an nlrb subpoena is subject to review.congress amended title vii to authorize eeoc subpoenas against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review,and today,nearly every court of appeals reviews a district court decision whether to enforce an eeoc subpoena for abuse of discretion.this long history of appellate practice,pierce underwood,carries significant persuasive weight.
second,basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review.in most cases,the district court enforcement decision will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to the specific charge or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of the circumstances.both of these tasks are well suited to a district judge expertise.the first requires the district court to evaluate the relationship between the particular materials sought and the particular matter under investigation an analysis variable in relation to the nature,purposes and scope of the inquiry.oklahoma press publishing walling.and whether a subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the materials sought and the difficulty the employer will face in producing them close calls better suited to resolution by the district court than the court of appeals.cooter gell hartmarx.
other functional considerations also show the appropriateness of review.for one,the district courts considerable experience in making similar decisions in other contexts,see buford united states,gives them the institutional advantag e,at,that comes with greater experience.deferential review also streamline s the litigation process by freeing appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering facts already weighed and considered by the district court,cooter gell,at,something particularly important in a proceeding designed only to facilitate the eeoc investigation.
b amicus arguments in support of de novo review are not persuasive.amicus claims that the district court primary task is to test a subpoena legal sufficiency and thus requires no exercise of discretion.but that characterization is not inconsistent with review,which may be employed to insulate the trial judge decision from appellate review for the same kind of functional concerns that underpin the court conclusion that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard.
it is also unlikely that affording deferential review to a district court subpoena decision would clash with court of appeals decisions that instructed district courts to defer to the eeoc determination about the relevance of evidence to the charge at issue.such decisions are better read as resting on the established rule that the term relevant be understood generously to permit the eeoc access to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.eeoc shell oil.nor do the constitutional underpinnings of the shell oil standard require a different result.while this court has described a subpoena as a constructive search,oklahoma press,at,and implied that the fourth amendment is the source of the requirement that a subpoena not be too indefinite,united states morton salt,not every decision touching on the fourth amendment is subject to searching review.see,united states nixon.illinois gates,ornelas united states,distinguished.
c the case is remanded so that the court of appeals can review the district court decision under the appropriate standard in the first instance.in doing so,the court of appeals may consider,as and to the extent it deems appropriate,any of mclane arguments regarding the burdens imposed by the subpoena.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
title vii of the civil rights act of permits the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to issue a subpoena to obtain evidence from an employer that is relevant to a pending investigation.the statute authorizes a district court to issue an order enforcing such a subpoena.the question presented here is whether a court of appeals should review a district court decision to enforce or quash an eeoc subpoena de novo or for abuse of discretion.this decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a,stat,a.the statute entrusts the enforcement of that prohibition to the eeoc.see a eeoc shell oil.the eeoc responsibilities are triggered by the filing of a specific sworn charge of discrimination,university of eeoc,which can be filed either by the person alleging discrimination or by the eeoc itself,see b.when it receives a charge,the eeoc must first notify the employer,and must then investigate to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true,university of,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this case is about one of the tools the eeoc has at its disposal in conducting its investigation a subpoena.in order t o enable the eeoc to make informed decisions at each stage of the enforcement process,title vii confers a broad right of access to relevant evidence.at.it provides that the eeoc shall have access to,for the purposes of examination,any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by title vii and is relevant to the charge under investigation.a.and the statute enables the eeoc to obtain that evidence by authoriz ing it to issue a subpoena and to seek an order enforcing the subpoena.university of,at see under that authority,the eeoc may issue subp o enas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of any evidence.an employer may petition the eeoc to revoke the subpoena,see,but if the eeoc rejects the petition and the employer still refuse s to obey the subp o ena,the eeoc may ask a district court to issue an order enforcing it,see.
a district court role in an eeoc subpoena enforcement proceeding,we have twice explained,is a straightforward one.see university of,at shell oil,at.a district court is not to use an enforcement proceeding as an opportunity to test the strength of the underlying complaint.ibid.rather,a district court should satisfy itself that the charge is valid and that the material requested is relevant to the charge.university of,at.it should do so cognizant of the generou s construction that courts have given the term relevant.shell oil,at virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer if the charge is proper and the material requested is relevant,the district court should enforce the subpoena unless the employer establishes that the subpoena is too indefinite,has been issued for an illegitimate purpose,or is unduly burdensome,at.see united states morton salt,the gist of the protection is in the requirement that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable internal quotation marks omitted.
this case arises out of a title vii suit filed by a woman named damiana ochoa.ochoa worked for eight years as a cigarette selector for petitioner mclane,a services company.according to mclane,the job is a demanding one cigarette selectors work in distribution centers,where they are required to lift,pack,and move large bins containing products.mclane requires employees taking physically demanding jobs both new employees and employees returning from medical leave to take a physical evaluation.according to mclane,the evaluation tests range of motion,resistance,and speed and is designed,administered,and validated by a third party.brief for petitioner.in,ochoa took three months of maternity leave.when she attempted to return to work,mclane asked her to take the evaluation.ochoa attempted to pass the evaluation three times,but failed.mclane fired her.
ochoa filed a charge of discrimination,alleging among other things that she had been fired on the basis of her gender.the eeoc began an investigation,and at its request mclane provided it with basic information about the evaluation,as well as a list of anonymous employees that mclane had asked to take the evaluation.mclane list included each employee gender,role at the company,and evaluation score,as well as the reason each employee had been asked to take the evaluation.but the company refused to provide what the parties call pedigree information the names,social security numbers,last known addresses,and telephone numbers of the employees who had been asked to take the evaluation.upon learning that mclane used the evaluation nationwide,the eeoc expanded the scope of its investigation,both to focus on mclane nationwide operations and substantively to investigate whether mclane had discriminated against its employees on the basis of age.it issued subpoenas requesting pedigree information as it related to its new investigation.but mclane refused to provide the pedigree information,and so the eeoc filed two actions in federal district court one arising out of ochoa charge and one arising out of a separate charge the eeoc itself had filed seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.
the enforcement actions were assigned to the same district judge,who,after a hearing,declined to enforce the subpoenas to the extent that they sought the pedigree information.see eeoc mclane,wl,d,age discrimination charge civ.d,app.to pet.for cert.title vii charge in the district court view,the pedigree information was not relevant to the charges because an individual name,or even an interview he or she could provide if contacted,simply could not shed light on whether the evaluation represents a tool of discrimination.app.to pet.for cert.quoting wl,at some internal quotation marks omitted.
the ninth circuit reversed.see.consistent with circuit precedent,the panel reviewed the district court decision to quash the subpoena de novo,and concluded that the district court had erred in finding the pedigree information irrelevant,at.but the panel questioned in a footnote why de novo review applied,observing that its sister circuits appear ed to review issues related to enforcement of administrative subpoenas for abuse of discretion.at,see infra,at reviewing court of appeals authority.
this court granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement between the courts of appeals over the appropriate standard of review for the decision whether to enforce an eeoc subpoena.because the united states agrees with mclane that such a decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion,stephen kinnard was appointed as amicus curiae to defend the judgment below.he has ably discharged his duties.
when considering whether a district court decision should be subject to searching or deferential appellate review at least absent explicit statutory command we traditionally look to two factors.pierce underwood.first,we ask whether the history of appellate practice yields an answer.ibid.second,at least where neither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition exists,we ask whether,as a matter of the sound administration of justice,one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.at,quoting miller fenton.both factors point toward review here.
first,the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals in reviewing a district court decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena is to review that decision for abuse of discretion.that practice predates even title vii itself.as noted,title vii confers on the eeoc the same authority to issue subpoenas that the national labor relations act nlra confers on the national labor relations board nlrb.see,supra.during the three decades between the enactment of the nlra and the incorporation of the nlra provisions into title vii,every circuit to consider the question had held that a district court decision whether to enforce an nlrb subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.see nlrb consolidated vacuum,nlrb friedman,nlrb northern trust,goodyear tire rubber nlrb.by the time congress amended title vii to authorize eeoc subpoenas in,it did so against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review.
today,nearly as uniformly,the courts of appeals apply the same deferential review to a district court decision as to whether to enforce an eeoc subpoena.almost every court of appeals reviews such a decision for abuse of discretion.see,eeoc kronos,eeoc randstad,eeoc roadway express,eeoc united air lines,eeoc technocrest systems,eeoc dillon companies,eeoc royal caribbean cruises,per curiam.as judge watford writing for the panel below recognized,the ninth circuit alone applies a more searching form of review.see,at,why we review questions of relevance and undue burden de novo is unclear see also epa alyeska pipeline serv,holding that de novo review applies.to be sure,the inquiry into the appropriate standard of review can not be resolved by a exercise.but the long history of appellate practice here,pierce,at,carries significant persuasive weight.
second,basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review.the decision whether to enforce an eeoc subpoena is a one that turns not on a neat set of legal rules,illinois gates,but instead on the application of broad standards to multifarious,fleeting,special,narrow facts that utterly resist generalization,pierce,at internal quotation marks omitted.in the mine run of cases,the distr
