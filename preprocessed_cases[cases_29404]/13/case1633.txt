the defendants appeal from two orders of the district court for the southern district of new york robert carter,district judge one that had partially denied them qualified immunity from money damages in their personal capacity,see now ii,d at,and a second,following a bench trial,that awarded plaintiffs injunctive and declaratory relief and ordered defendants to formulate a joint remedial plan with plaintiffs to ameliorate the constitutional violations,see now iii,at.with respect to the district court interlocutory order partially denying defendants motion for qualified immunity,we have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.see,mitchell forsyth,d.our jurisdiction over the district court grant of declaratory and injunctive relief and order of submission of a remedial plan is pursuant to a.see spates manson,cir.
the propriety of both orders,as well as various issues raised by plaintiffs,turns on whether the plaintiffs have asserted cognizable fourteenth amendment procedural due process violations as a result of the division handling and processing of the class members claims of discrimination.because we find that no procedural due process violations are presented,we vacate the district court partial denial of qualified immunity and its award of injunctive and declaratory relief,and dismiss plaintiffs procedural due process claims.
background 
a.the human rights law and the division 
promulgated in,new york human rights law,exec,proscribes discrimination based on age,race,creed,color,national origin,sex,disability,genetic predisposition,carrier status,or marital status.see id.such discrimination is prohibited in employment,housing,licensing,public accommodations,and public services,among other areas.see id.
an individual who is aggrieved by instances of discrimination prohibited under the human rights law may elect to seek redress in either an administrative or a judicial forum.as a general rule,the remedies are intended to be mutually exclusive.legg eastman kodak,app.div.dep t.the division handles the administrative adjudication of claims.see exec.
until the law was changed in,a complainant was precluded from dismissing the administrative action in order to file a complaint in court once he or she elected to proceed with the administrative process.in,however,the new york legislature amended the human rights law to permit a complainant to annul his or her election of the administrative process prior to a hearing and then proceed to court.see id.at see also whidbee garzarelli food,cir legg,at regs.tit,e vi.if such an annulment is made,any judicial proceedings are subject to new york general statute of limitations,measured from the occurrence of the discrimination,with no tolling for the period in which the claim was pending in the administrative process.see exec.sprott city hous,wl,at.
upon a complainant election to proceed in the administrative forum,the division becomes responsible for the following serving the respondent employer or landlord,conducting an investigation,and making a probable cause determination.id.at regs.tit,investigations,probable cause review.if warranted,the division will then issue a notice requiring respondent to answer and appear at a hearing before an administrative law judge,who will conduct a hearing,render a decision,and issue an order.see exec.regs.tit,notice of hearing,orders after hearing.unless a claimant wishes to retain a private attorney,the division will assign one of its staff attorneys to present the case at the administrative hearing.see exec.a see also regs.tit,d.the human rights law sets out time constraints on the division actions,see exec.a,but these constraints have been deemed directory,not mandatory.hous.opportunities made equal,pataki,app.div.dep t.
b.the due process claims 
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege,in substance,two categories of purported procedural due process violations.the first category involves processing delays and the second involves defective notice.
processing delays 
in,the division began to experience substantial delays in its processing time for claims,and a sizeable backlog soon developed.plaintiffs statistician testified before the district court that of cases the division closed between october,and april,of that total took more than three years from filing to closing,with the mean time somewhat in excess of years.now iii,at.he also testified that of claims that received probable cause determinations,the mean measured in days for these claims to be finally resolved was days or years.id.
the plaintiffs attribute the division backlog to several causes including the failure of governors cuomo and pataki to maintain the division funding at parity with the overall state fund disbursement to government operations the failure of the two governors to provide additional resources to the division by temporarily redeploying state employees from other agencies the failure of commissioners rosa and mercado to exercise their statutory authority to request staffing assistance from other governmental departments and agencies,see exec.and the failure of the two commissioners to fill staff vacancies as they occurred.
the plaintiffs contend that the defendants acts and omissions prejudiced class members ability to succeed on their discrimination claims.as the plaintiffs brief states 
the passage of time increases the likelihood that witnesses and documents will be unavailable,complainants will die,and memories will fade,which undermines the credibility of victims of discrimination,and witnesses.thus,lengthy delays prejudiced complainants in their ability to prove their discrimination claims.
defective notice 
the second category of alleged procedural due process violations focuses on purported notice deficiencies related to certain claims the division dismissed for administrative convenience.according to the plaintiffs,the division,to remedy the inordinate case processing delays,dismissed cases between october,and april,for the division administrative convenience acd on the grounds that it was unable to locate failure to locate the complainant,or the agency determined that the complainant had failed to cooperate failure to cooperate.the plaintiffs contend that these acd dismissals violated due process because the division failed to reasonably attempt to locate claimants first,or to unambiguously notify claimants that their claims were at risk of dismissal before issuing acd for failure to cooperate.
c.the subclasses 
to address the plaintiffs claims of prejudicial delay and ineffective notice,the class was subdivided as follows 
subclass a a ll persons who have been,are,or will be subject to dismissal of their complaints because defendants rosa and mercado have taken longer than three years from the date the complaint was filed to render a final determination.
subclass b a ll persons who have been,are,or may be subject to a reduction in the monetary relief awarded,either by order of rosa,mercado,or by a court because defendants rosa and mercado have taken longer than three years from the date the complaint was filed to render a final administrative determination and,
subclass c a ll persons who have been,are,or may be subject to acd dismissals because the division was either unable to locate complainants or had determined that the complainants had failed to cooperate and that their complaints had been pending for more than one year.
now iii,at.
each subclass had different class representatives.subclass a was represented by individual plaintiffs jane doe,administratrix for the deceased john doe,dellie britt,bernadette thomas,and clarice seegars,who had experienced processing delays respectively of five,seven,seven,and nine years.subclass b was represented by plaintiff seegars alone.no individual plaintiff represented subclass c rather,as to subclass c,now proceeded as the class representative by mounting a facial challenge to the division published policies regarding the granting of acd for failure to locate or failure to cooperate.see,common cause fec,an organizational plaintiff may have standing to sue on its own behalf to vindicate whatever rights and immunities the association itself may enjoy or,under proper conditions,to sue on behalf of its members asserting the members individual rights.quoting warth seldin,d.
discussion 
we first consider the due process claims of subclasses a and b based on allegations of prejudicial delay,and then those of subclass c based on allegations of defective notice.we observe at the outset that the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process is fully applicable to adjudicative proceedings conducted by state and local government administrative agencies.see richardson perales,d.
the question we must resolve is were the members of subclasses a and b denied constitutionally adequate process as a result of the delays they experienced while prosecuting their discrimination claims before the division before this question may be answered in the affirmative,we must determine that the members of subclasses a and b possessed a constitutionally protected property interest,the deprivation of which resulted from government action without constitutionally adequate pre or process.see logan zimmerman brush,d.
property interest 
there is no dispute that a legal cause of action constitutes a species of property protected by the fourteenth amendment due process clause.see,mullane cent.hanover bank trust.polk kramarsky,cir.what the parties do dispute is whether this is the only property interest at issue in the instant case or whether,when a state affords alternative procedural forums for pursuing a cause of action as new york has here,individuals gain a constitutionally protected property interest not only in the cause of action,but also in the forum in which they elect to pursue that cause of action the district court held that the claimants here possessed a constitutionally protected property interest in pursuing their claims before the division.see now iii,at.we disagree.
the only property interest at issue in this case is the legal cause of action itself,independent of the various procedural options available for pursuing the action.see polk,at mcmenemy city of rochester,cir although new york state law clearly requires a competitive examination,the law does not create a cognizable property interest in a competitive examination.an examination is not an end in itself it has value only because it may lead to something valuable.citing bigby city of chicago,cir fusco connecticut,cir the opportunity granted abutting landowners and aggrieved persons to appeal decisions of planning and zoning commissions and zoning boards of appeal is purely procedural and does not give rise to an independent interest protected by the f ourteenth a mendment.
our conclusion follows from the fact that procedural due process protects only important and substantial expectations in life,liberty,and property.see ezekwo nyc health hosps,cir procedural due process does not protect trivial and insubstantial interest s.process is not an end in itself.its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to which the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.olim wakinekona,d emphasis added see montgomery carter county,tennessee,cir what the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments protect is life,liberty,and property,not the procedures designed to protect life,liberty,and property.internal citation omitted alterations in original.here,the only substantive expectation that warrants constitutional recognition is the entitlement under new york law to remedy injuries resulting from discrimination proscribed by the human rights law.see ezekwo,at while state law defines the underlying substantive interest,federal constitutional law determines whether that interest rises to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement protected by the due process clause.quoting memphis light,gas water div.craft,d.
indeed,the only distinct interest claimants appear to have in vindicating their rights before the division,rather than in state court,is that t he administrative forum offers a complainant remedies not available from a court.now iii,at quoting marine midland bank state div.of human rights,alterations in original.yet,recovery of these additional remedies in any particular case hinges on the division exercising its discretion to actually award one or more of these remedies.
the fourteenth amendment due process guarantee,however,only extends to property claims to which an individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.bd.of regents roth,d.where,as here,a purported property interest is contingent on the exercise of executive discretion,no legitimate claim of entitlement exists.a constitutionally protected interest can not arise from relief that the executive exercises unfettered discretion to award.sad ins,cir see also baldwin daniels,cir discretionary statutes do not give rise to constitutionally protectable interests.shaner united states,cir holding that loan contingent on agency broad discretion in determining whether to approve the application was too speculative to be considered a property right.thus,the claimants interest in the additional remedies afforded in the administrative process is not a property expectation as to which the constitution mandates due process.
accordingly,we hold that the class members only constitutionally protected property interest at issue here is the discrimination cause of action itself.
government deprivation 
having identified the protected property interest,we turn to whether the members of subclasses a and b suffered a deprivation.the parties appear to agree that if new york were to have flatly precluded a claimant from pursuing his or her discrimination claim in all available procedural forums and thereby extinguished the claim,a deprivation would have occurred.see,logan,at.tulsa prof l collection,pope,d due process implicated where proceedings completely extinguished appellant claim.the parties,however,are in sharp disagreement over whether government in this case does not finally extinguish a claim,but nonetheless prejudices it,can also constitute a government deprivation.
accepting the plaintiffs contention,the district court held that an administrative delay causing actual prejudice to a claimant claim is sufficient to show deprivation under the due process clause.now iii,at see also pepsico,rosa,app.div d dep t holding that almost delay alone,without showing of substantial prejudice,would not extinguish discrimination claim.indeed,the district court went so far as to hold that this formulation was already clearly established in our constitutional jurisprudence.now ii,d at.the district court further concluded that a ctual prejudice is shown when plaintiff s demonstrate that delay led to the loss of documentary evidence or a key witness.now iii,at.
below,we consider first the district court conclusion that it is clearly established that bureaucratic delay plus actual prejudice can constitute a deprivation,and,finding that it was not clearly established,we then consider whether this formulation is sufficient to establish a deprivation.
qualified immunity 
the district court holding,for purposes of qualified immunity,that it was clearly established that administrative delay followed by actual prejudice constitutes a government deprivation was considerably wide of the mark.see now ii,d at.
a government actor performing a discretionary task is entitled to immunity from suits if his or her action did not violate clearly established law.salim proulx,cir see warren keane,cir.a right is clearly established if t he contours of the right are sufficiently clear in the context of the alleged violation such that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.labounty coughlin,cir citing anderson creighton,d.
none of the cases relied on by the district court satisfy this standard.logan zimmerman brush,which the district court stated control led the denial of qualified immunity,now ii,d at,held only that the state may not finally destroy a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim of entitlement.logan,at.emphasis added see also post at meskill,concurring.the final destruction addressed in logan resulted from an illinois statute that flatly extinguished a plaintiff cause of action,not from government delay that prejudiced the claim.
the remaining cases relied on by the district court,which it characterized collectively as stand ing commandingly for the proposition that administrative delay leading to actual prejudice may violate the due process clause,now ii,d at,are inapposite to the situation at hand.see also post at meskill,concurring.those cases were concerned with the effect of delay on the adequacy of remedies,and,unlike the situation here,did not involve the issue of whether government delay,in and of itself,can constitute a deprivation.see,kraebel city dep t of hous,cir considering whether delay in affording relief violated due process isaacs bowen,cir same distribs.murphy,cir same,vacated remanded,d,and reaff by cir.
the formulation 
surround the district court formulation.see also post at meskill,concurring.without excusing new york gross bureaucratic delays,the fact remains that plaintiffs are generally the masters of their legal actions.as such,they bear the responsibility for preventing actual prejudice to their claims by investigating,memorializing testimony from potentially forgetful or absent witnesses,and preserving documents.
while the claimants here did not have resort to the full battery of discovery devices generally afforded litigants in courts of law,our review of the human rights division rules of practice indicates that claimants are afforded sufficient means to before any period of delay that might be considered constitutionally types of prejudice the district court identified as actionable,loss of documentary evidence and loss of key witnesses.claimants may engage an attorney,see regs.tit,b a,who in turn,prior to the hearing before the alj,may apply to have the division subpoena parties and witnesses for depositions and document production,see regs.tit,and,during the hearing,may directly subpoena parties and witnesses,see id.at c.see also state div.of human rights of rochester,app.div.dep t this power to issue subpoenas was designed to make evidence available at a hearing on the merits.before a determination of probable cause,the complainant may be represented by an attorney but the matter is to be investigated by the division.
moreover,due to the relaxed nature of the division evidentiary rules,claimants may introduce at the hearing before the alj subpoenaed materials in lieu of live testimony,thus ameliorating prejudice a claimant might otherwise experience due to absent witnesses,see,regs.tit,e hearsay evidence is fully admissible.e documentary evidence may be admitted without testamentary foundation,where reasonable.e information from witnesses may be introduced in the form of affidavits,without oral examination and cross examination.e written stipulations may be introduced in evidence if signed by the person sought to be bound thereby or by that person the entire record may be in the form of a stipulation,submitted to the chief administrative law judge without the convening of a hearing before an administrative law judge.e where reasonable and convenient,the administrative judge may permit the testimony of a witness to be taken by telephone.with these tools at hand,we have little doubt that claimants have it within their ability to ensure that their claims are not unduly prejudiced by any delay on the division part in affording a hearing.
compounding our doubts as to the district court conclusion that delay coupled with actual prejudice constitutes a due process deprivation is the fact that the only cases we have uncovered that adopted this formulation as part of a due process inquiry arose in a completely inapposite context see,consol coal borda,cir demichele greenburgh cent.sch,cir lane hollow coal,owcp,cir united states elsbery,cir.in each of these cases,the defendant,not the plaintiff,was alleged to have been prejudiced as a result of a delay,and the delays involved were in the receipt of notification that proceedings would be instigated,not delay in actually litigating the matter once both parties were on notice of the proceedings.thus,the delay in notifying the defendants in these cases denied them,throughout the entire period of the delay,an opportunity to preserve records,memorialize witness accounts,and maintain other materials necessary to advance a meaningful defense.here,by contrast,both the claimants and the respondents were always aware that they would,if only belatedly,be expected to present their case before the division.
because,as we discuss below in part i c,we hold that constitutionally adequate process was afforded the members of subclasses a and b,we need not finally resolve whether actual prejudice to a cause of action following a period of extreme government delay is sufficient to make out a property deprivation,or whether instead the government action must flatly extinguish the cause of action before a property deprivation can be made out.accord hous.opportunities made equal,at holding that complaints before the division must be extinguished to give rise to a due process violation.it suffices to say at this juncture that we have deep reservations.
adequate process 
regardless of whether a property deprivation occurred,it is plain that the members of subclasses a and b were afforded procedures that satisfied the fourteenth amendment due process requirement.in reaching this conclusion,we follow the now familiar analysis set forth by the supreme court in mathews eldridge,d.the mathews analysis requires us to weigh the private interest that will be affected by the official action the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.see also logan,at.holman hilton,cir.
after balancing these considerations,the district court concluded that the division processing delays were clearly unreasonable and the claimants were denied due process.now iii,at.while the processing delays were extensive and may well have been unreasonably so,we can not agree with the district court conclusion that due process was denied.
in carrying out the mathews analysis,the district court failed to consider the availability of other procedures that could have prevented the claimants from suffering prejudicial delay.more precisely,the district court erred in not considering article proceedings and how if utilized by the claimants these proceedings could have reduced claimants risk of experiencing prejudicial delay.see.
in an article proceeding,new york state courts are empowered to issue common law writs of certiorari to review,mandamus,and prohibition.hellenic am.neighborhood action comm.city of new york,cir see relief previously obtained by writs of certiorari to review,mandamus or prohibition shall be obtained in a proceeding under this article.see also hamptons hosp.med,moore,holding that an article proceeding may lie in the absence of a final determination where the relief sought is by way of prohibition or mandamus to compel performance by an administrative agency of a duty enjoined by law see generally david siegel,cplr provided escape from common law technicalities,january.once the delay in the processing of any claim of the members of subclasses a and b became unreasonable,each member could have brought an article proceeding to mandamus division officials to proceed expeditiously to resolve the discrimination claim.see,katz klehammer,cir to the extent that the housing law and state and city regulations compel the supervising and other city officials to perform certain acts,article may thus serve to enforce such requirements when officials fail to fulfill these obligations.hous.opportunities made equal,at noting that state courts may grant mandamus to compel hearings tall trees constr.zoning bd.of appeals,app.div d dep t article proceeding directing zoning board,which had relied on its tie vote to unduly delay taking any decisive action,to conduct a new hearing on petitioner zoning applications within days,lv.to appeal granted.by doing so,the members of subclasses a and b could have substantially reduced,if not eliminated,the risk of prejudice to their claims from further delay.
given the availability of article procedures,which can be invoked before actual prejudice arises unlike a damage claim,which presumably would arise only after actual prejudice had occurred,we find that the second mathews factor weighs dispositively in favor of the government.thus,we hold that new york has afforded the members of subclasses a and b all of the process they are due under the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution see,river park,city of highland park,cir holding availability of common law writ of certiorari adequate process for zoning board delay orange lake,kirkpatrick,cir stating that zoning board delay did not violate due process because,inter alia,article procedure constituted adequate process see also bello walker,cir a state provides adequate due process when it provides reasonable remedies to rectify a legal error by a local administrative body.internal quotation marks omitted.
two final points warrant mention.first,recognizing the state courts responsibility for preventing division delays through article proceedings is more consistent with the spirit of federalism than is unnecessarily subjecting state agencies to intrusive federal court intervention under the guise of.see,idaho coeur tribe,d kennedy,joined by rehnquist,it is a principal concern of the court system in any state to define and maintain a proper balance between the state courts on one hand,and its officials and administrative agencies on the other hand where,as here,the parties invoke federal principles to challenge state administrative action,the courts of the state have a strong interest in integrating those sources of law within their own system for the proper judicial control of state officials.albright oliver,d kennedy,concurring,joined by thomas,noting generally the importance of considering the delicate balance between state and federal courts in the design of causes of action.
second,by contemplating that claimants seek relief through article proceedings,we are not contravening the general rule that exhaustion is not required for claims.see patsy bd.of regents,d see generally erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed.e xhaustion simpliciter is analytically distinct from the requirement that the harm alleged has occurred.under the jurisprudence,a procedural due process violation can not have occurred when the governmental actor provides apparently adequate procedural remedies and the plaintiff has not availed himself of those remedies.alvin suzuki,cir.
now,as subclass c representative,asserts that the division failed to provide constitutionally adequate notice to the members of subclass c before it dismissed for administrative convenience acd their discrimination claims for failure to locate or failure to cooperate.the district court agreed with now,concluding that the division did not take all reasonable steps to locate and inform complainants that their claims were at risk for acd,and therefore deprived complainants of their claims without adequate predeprivation notice.now iii,at.for the reasons we discuss below,we disagree.
is notice required 
when a government agency terminates or impairs an individual constitutionally cognizable property interest through adjudicative proceedings,due process requires that the individual be given adequate notice for the proceedings to be accorded finality.craft,at.quoting mullane,at.see also sterling envtl.control,cir.
the new york attorney general,arguing on behalf of the defendants,contends that notice is not required prior to an acd for failure to locate or for failure to cooperate because the acd does not extinguish a claimant cause of action.rather,the attorney general argues,a claimant whose claims are acd becomes free to pursue his discrimination claim in new york state court and further that the statute of limitations for bringing suit is tolled during the entire pendency of the division proceedings.exec.a see also marine midland bank,at.notably,this differs from the situation in which the claimant annuls his or her election of remedies,where the statute of limitations for bringing suit in state court is expressly not tolled during the pendency of the administrative proceedings.see exec.
were we to find that the attorney general reading of section is correct,we would agree that the acds for failure to locate and for failure to cooperate did not deprive claimants of their discrimination claims and thus do not trigger due process scrutiny.this is because a complaint must be filed with the division within one year of the accrual of a cause of action,whereas a state court action must be commenced within three years.see exec.marine midland bank,at.thus,under the attorney general reading,a complainant would always have at least two years remaining following an acd in which to proceed with an action in state court.moreover,individualized notice to a claimant is not required for purposes of the running of the statute of limitations.see,united states locke,d texaco,short,d see generally ronald rotunda john nowak,treatise on constitutional law substance and procedure,at ed.when individual interests are adversely affected by legislative action such as a statute of limitations,there is no notice issue,because publication of a statute is normally considered to put all individuals on notice of a change in the law of a jurisdiction.kenneth culp davis richard pierce,administrative law treatise,at ed.
now,however,advances an equally persuasive rebuttal argument.now contends that the attorney general reading would vitiate the election of remedies mandate,see exec,because a claimant could compel an acd simply by refusing to cooperate with the division process,and then file in state court with the benefit of the statute of limitations having been tolled.see,regs.tit,e vi intimating legislative concern that administrative convenience dismissal s not contravene the election of remedies provisions legg,at same.
recognizing that resolution of this question has significant import to the administration of state judicial proceedings,we leave it for the new york state courts to decide the proper understanding of section in the first instance.doing so,however,does not affect our ability to dispose of this case because,as we discuss in part b below,we find that now has failed to establish that the notice afforded members of subclass c offends due process.
has now established inadequate notice 
in mounting a facial challenge,now asserts that the division published acd policy the policy is unconstitutional on its face see now iii,at.in so doing,it bear s the heavy burden of demonstrating that,as written,the policy could never be applied in a manner that would afford claimants constitutionally adequate notice.sanitation recycling,city of new york,cir quoting state club ass n,city of new york,d emphasis added.
as for those members of subclass c whose claims were acd for failure to locate,the district court agreed with now that the division published policy,as promulgated,did not afford them constitutionally adequate notice.see now iii,at.the policy requires that before such dismissals can be granted,staff members must attempt to contact the claimants by,among other means,mailing two letters,the second letter being certified.id.at.the district court found that the policy provision for the use of the mails to contact claimants who have moved violates due process because the postal service mail forwarding ceases after one year.id.at see also id.at ordering that the division use the internal revenue service mail forwarding service to locate persons whose claims are at risk for acd.we disagree.
due process does not require that parties actually receive notice of the pendency of the government deprivation.all that is required is that the method and form of the notice be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane,at.the means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.see pope,at.there is no rigid formula as to the kind of notice that must be given notice required will vary with circumstances and conditions.baker latham sparrowbush,cir quoting walker city of hutchinson,d.
in reaching its conclusion that the division reliance on mail forwarding was insufficient,the district court apparently gave no weight to the claimants responsibility to provide the division with updated contact information whenever they change addresses.upon filing a claim with the division,claimants are informed that they must notify the division of any change in their address,telephone number or place of employment and that failure to do so may jeopardize their rights,are provided with a form,and are informed again in a letter of their obligation to notify the division if they change their address.
simply put,we believe that when parties that are litigating claims before a government agency are obligated to notify the agency of a change of address,a requirement that the agency do more than rely on the latest information provided it by the litigants when sending out notice would demand a level of government paternalism that due process does not require.small united states,holding that when the government knows or can easily ascertain where a person may be found,it must direct its notice there,and not to some other address where the designee formerly resided.
accordingly,with respect to those members of subclass c whose claims were acd for failure to locate,we hold that the division use of the mails to send notice to the last address furnished to the division comports with due process.see grievance comm.polur,cir per curiam discussing adequacy of use of mails for notice.
next,we consider whether those members of subclass c whose claims were acd for failure to cooperate were provided with adequate notice that their claims were at risk of being dismissed.in its consideration of this issue,the district court relied exclusively on the division acd letters,which it found violated due process because,it believed,the letters did not unambiguously notify complainants that they should contact the division in order to avoid dismissal.see now iii,at.
even assuming the acd letters were question we do not find that the district court erred by exclusively focusing its due process inquiry on the sufficiency of the notice provided in these letters as we have already noted,to succeed on its facial challenge now must establish that under no set of circumstances would the division acd policy be constitutionally adequate.reno flores,d internal quotation marks omitted.that determination simply can not be made by looking to the acd letters alone because the policy also requires that a division staff member make two phone calls to attempt to contact the complainant,one during the day,and one after pm before the claim can be acd.the information the division staff communicated during those phone calls,taken alone,may have provided the claimants with constitutionally sufficient notice that their discrimination claims were at risk of being dismissed for failure to cooperate.what more,since this question is plainly fact specific to each claimant,it is not appropriately the subject of a facial challenge.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that now has failed to establish that the division provided constitutionally deficient notice before it acd the discrimination claims of the members of subclass 
conclusion 
because no constitutional violation has been shown,the plaintiffs procedural due process claims are dismissed with prejudice.as a consequence,the district court order denying the defendants qualified immunity and its award of injunctive and declaratory relief in favor of the plaintiffs are vacated.
we have carefully considered plaintiffs and find it without merit.
the present panel will retain jurisdiction over any further appeals that may arise in this case.
each side to bear its own costs of appeal.
i concur in the result reached and in chief judge walker treatment of all the issues in this case.i write separately to address plaintiffs prejudice equals deprivation theory,which was adopted and found clearly established by the district court and commented upon favorably by judge calabresi in his separate opinion.
chief judge walker expresses deep reservations about the theory.i agree and would go further.i would hold that the division delay in processing a plaintiff claim could not constitute a deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest under the due process clause.in support of the prejudice equals deprivation theory,the plaintiffs and the district court unreasonably stretch existing precedent,while advocating an impermissibly narrow reading of our holding in polk kramarsky,cir,a case that can and should dispose of this action.
logan and the unreasonable delay cases 
plaintiffs primarily rely on logan zimmerman brush,d,and two of this court prior decisions,kraebel city dep t of hous,cir,and isaacs bowen,cir,to support their argument that prejudice equals deprivation.
in logan,the supreme court framed the issue before it as whether a state may terminate a complainant cause of action because a state official,for reasons beyond the complainant control,failed to comply with a statutorily mandated procedure.at.emphasis added.the plaintiff had filed a cause of action with the illinois fair employment practices commission commission,which,under illinois law,had days to convene a factfinding conference.see id.the commission inadvertently scheduled the conference for five days after the statutory deadline.see id.at.logan employer thereafter challenged the commission jurisdiction to hear the claim.the illinois supreme court ultimately upheld that challenge,holding that the day period was a jurisdictional requirement.see id.at.this ruling effectively terminated logan cause of action without the benefit of a hearing.
the supreme court stated that the illinois statutory scheme,as interpreted and enforced by the state courts,destroyed logan ability to have his claim heard.see id.at.reasoning that any other conclusion would allow the state to destroy at will virtually any property interest emphasis added id.at.noting that the deprivation here is final emphasis added.the court concluded that the state may not finally destroy a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim of entitlement.id.emphasis added footnote omitted.in reaching its conclusion,the court relied on prior decisions where it had found that deprivations occurred when the state terminate d every right which beneficiaries would otherwise have,id.at.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted,cut off beneficiaries rights,id.quotation marks omitted,dismissed plaintiff claims,id.emphasis added,den ied potential litigants use of established adjudicatory procedures,id.emphasis added,or deprive d someone of access to the courts.id.at.emphasis added.the court opinion is replete with references to the total extinguishment or final destruction of an individual cause of action.there is nothing in the opinion that supports the view that a state delay in adjudicating an existing cause of action constitutes such an extinguishment or destruction.
further examination of other due process cases decided by the supreme court leads to a similar conclusion.see,tulsa prof l collection servs.pope,d tulsa the entire purpose and effect of the nonclaim statute is to forever bar untimely claims and the proceedings have completely extinguished appellant claim.emphasis added.while it is always possible to broader language from certain supreme court decisions,see,id.adversely affect mennonite bd.of missions adams,d mennonite drastically diminishes the value,when placed in context,those same cases reveal that the court found a deprivation only when faced with a discrete state action that either completely extinguished plaintiff property interest or drastically reduced the known or measurable value of that interest.see tulsa,at nonclaim statute extinguished and forever bar red untimely claims mennonite,at.tax sale immediately and drastically diminishe d the value of th e mortgagee interest mullane cent.hanover bank trust.the effect of this decree is that every right which beneficiaries would otherwise have is sealed and wholly terminated.in contrast,the plaintiffs theory would allow claimants to show a deprivation of their interests by the gradual the passage of time rather than by any affirmative state their ability to prove their claim.
the unreasonable delay cases 
the district court also relied heavily on the notion that delay can be so unreasonable as to deny due process,such as when it is inordinately long.isaacs,at see also,kraebel,at i mplicit in the conferral of an entitlement is a further entitlement,to receive the entitlement within a reasonable time.quoting schroeder city of chicago,cir.as the court opinion adequately points out,these cases dealt with the adequacy of process,not with whether a deprivation occurred in the first place.kraebel could not be more clear t he question of the timing of that processing and payment relate not to her property right,but to the adequacy of the process she is receiving.at emphasis added.
by way of illustration,assume in logan that the illinois statutory scheme provided that after a day dismissal the claimant was entitled to a hearing.assume further that the hearing would determine whether the failure to meet the deadline was the claimant fault or due to the state negligence,and where the latter was shown,the claimant action would be immediately reinstated.i have little doubt that the supreme court would have upheld such a scheme.if,however,illinois took five years to hold the hearing,plaintiff would claim successfully,i imagine that the delay was sufficiently egregious to violate the process rule in kraebel and isaacs.but that is not this case.we can not reach the question in kraebel and isaacs until the plaintiffs first demonstrate that they have been deprived of a property interest.
in his separate opinion,judge calabresi cites agins city of tiburon,d,for the suggestion that extraordinary delay in the process of governmental decisionmaking that impairs the use or value of property may be a taking in the constitutional sense.notwithstanding the infirmities of applying the supreme court takings clause jurisprudence in a due process case such as this one,the comparison reveals another fundamental misconception.in the typical takings clause case,the government delay in processing or granting,for example,a zoning permit impairs the owner use of property.the right to use one property has no inherent need for governmental interference and undue delay arising out of such interference is rightly actionable.the plaintiffs property interest here is a cause of action.state,federal or administrative procedures are needed to prosecute such a claim.stated differently,in the zoning context,the adjudication is a government imposed burden.in a cause of action,the adjudication is a government provided benefit,without which the claimant cause of action would be worthless.unfortunately,there are delays,sometimes excessive ones.neither the federal government,state governments nor local administrative agencies are immune from delays.in my view,remedying those inefficiencies falls within the state political,rather than the federal judicial,sphere.
in summary,all of the cases relied on by the plaintiffs and the district court and those cited by judge calabresi are inapposite to our determination of whether the state deprived the plaintiffs of a property interest.
polk kramarsky 
while the supreme court due process clause jurisprudence arguably leaves room for the plaintiffs theory,our decision in polk expressly forecloses any attempt to expand the definition of deprivation to encompass the instant claim.
in polk,we answered the question whether undue delay by a new york state agency in processing a discrimination claim gives rise to a violation of due process.at internal citation omitted.we held that it did not.polk based his due process claim on the assertion that the delay in processing his complaint substantially prejudiced the preparation and prosecution of his discrimination action and caused him financial as well as emotional injury.id.at.we distinguished logan because polk claim,irrespective of any prejudice,was not finally destroyed 
here,polk right of action has survived,albeit long delayed.logan is therefore distinguishable.as the logan court opined to put it as plainly as possible,the state may not finally destroy a property interest without first giving the putative owner an opportunity to present his claim of entitlement.
id.at citation and footnote omitted.we did not hold that prejudice to a claimant ability to prove a cause of action,if it could be shown,would constitute a deprivation.indeed,our express holding states the opposite.id.we specifically held in polk that the division delay violated both the spirit and the letter of its procedural provisions,a t no time was was proceeding pro se for most of this by the division that it could not or would not comply with the state own time requirements,polk was not informed of the interrelationship between the remedies and procedures under new york and federal law,and the division did not do its job.id.at.we still found no due process violation.in holding otherwise,the district court was considerably wide of the mark.see majority op.at.
accordingly,our decision in polk,in addition to a common sense reading of the supreme court due process clause cases,should deter us from expanding the definition of deprivation to include actual prejudice.
plaintiffs theory creates an unworkable rule of law 
even assuming we had carte blanche to fashion a rule akin to the plaintiffs theory,we should not.equating prejudice through delay with the final destruction or extinguishment required for a deprivation would create bad law.
in addition to the practical reasons advanced by chief judge walker,see majority op.at,i am particularly concerned that it would be impossible to set firm and clear guidelines for determining when prejudice rises to the level of deprivation.the point at which delay equals deprivation would inevitably vary from case to case,making it impossible for the state to set up a procedure for pre and hearings.further,such a rule would allow any plaintiff who testifies to actual prejudice to create an issue of fact for trial.as far as i can tell,judge calabresi,even only in passing,has thus far refined the plaintiffs theory into the formula.see concurring op.at.i shudder to think how district courts throughout the country would interpret such an amorphous concept.in all likelihood,those determinations will be highly inconsistent and
