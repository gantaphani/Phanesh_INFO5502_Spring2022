the five plaintiffs performed search,rescue and work at the world trade center site the site in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks.they allege that the defendants,all of them federal officials,issued knowingly about the air quality in lower manhattan that the plaintiffs therefore believed it was safe to work at the site without needed respiratory protection,and did and that the defendants conduct violated plaintiffs right to substantive due process.this is an appeal from a february,order entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,which dismissed the complaint.we affirm because the complaint allegations do not shock the conscience even if the defendants acted with deliberate indifference when agency officials decide how to reconcile competing governmental obligations in the face of disaster,only an intent to cause harm arbitrarily can shock the conscience in a way that justifies constitutional liability.
background 
the facts are drawn from the complaint,the documents referenced therein,and common knowledge of the events of september.
the collapse of the world trade center towers on that day generated a cloud of debris that coated the surrounding buildings and streets of lower manhattan with concrete dust,asbestos,lead,and other building materials.fires within the wreckage burned for months,emitting various metals and particulate matter in addition to such potentially harmful substances as dioxin,polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs,volatile organic compounds vocs,and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs.
the plaintiffs arrived at the site on september or in the days soon after john lombardi is a new york army national guard medic roberto ramos,is an emergency services officer in the new york city corrections department hasan muhammad is an emergency services captain in the new york city corrections department rafael garcia is a deputy marshal and thomas carlstrom is a paramedic in the new york city fire department.they participated in search,rescue,and work at the site,with little or no equipment to protect their lungs.they were not told by their employers or any government official about the health risks posed by the dangerous contaminants in the air,and they thought they could work at the site with little or no respiratory protection based on the information available to them,including statements of government officials indicating that lower manhattan air quality presented no significant health risks to the public.
the plaintiffs brought suit on november,in the southern district of new york,on their own behalf and on behalf of a purported class including all those who worked at or in the immediate vicinity of the site during the period september,to october,who did so without sufficient respiratory equipment in reliance on information supplied by government officials,and who as a result suffer or reasonably fear suffering illness or injury from their exposure to asbestos or other harmful substances.
the defendants,sued in their individual capacities,are current or former officials of the environmental protection agency epa,the white house council on environmental quality ceq,and the occupational safety and health administration osha.the claims against them are based on statements in epa press releases issued in the wake of the disaster,which according to the complaint were made to speed work at the site,with the knowledge they were false or misleading,and with deliberate indifference to the health risks the workers would incur by relying on them.
a.the allegedly misleading statements 
the complaint invokes a report issued by the epa office of the inspector general,which critiques the epa response to the september disaster.see epa office of the inspector general,epa response to the world trade center collapse challenges,successes,and areas for improvement,report,available at.gov oig reports wtc report.pdf last visited april,the oig report 
a september,epa press release,which is cited in the oig report,i indicated that initial environmental tests done at the site after the terrorist attacks were very reassuring about potential exposure of rescue crews and the public to environmental contaminants ii concluded that the results of a dditional sampling of both ambient air quality and dust particles in lower manhattan were uniformly acceptable and iii expressed the epa intent to work with other agencies and rescue workers to provide respiratory equipment and to make sure they observed appropriate safety that the plaintiffs allege to their knowledge never materialized.oig report at.
a september epa press release reported additional good news 
n ew samples confirm previous reports that ambient air quality meets osha standards and consequently is not a cause for public concern.new osha data also indicates that indoor air quality in downtown buildings will meet standards.epa has found variable asbestos levels in bulk debris and dust on the ground,but epa continues to believe that there is no significant health risk to the general public in the coming days.appropriate steps are being taken to clean up this dust and debris.our tests show that it is safe for new yorkers to go back to work in new york financial district,said john henshaw,assistant secretary of labor for osha.keeping the streets clean and being careful not to track dust into buildings will help protect workers from remaining debris.
a september press release reported that epa testing of the air and drinking water showed that these vital resources are safe and that the vast majority of air samples taken near the site measured harmful substances at below maximum acceptable levels.according to the release,the highest asbestos levels were close to the site itself,where rescue and cleanup workers were supposedly being supplied with adequate equipment.the same release quoted defendant whitman 
we are very encouraged that the results from our monitoring of air quality and drinking water conditions in both new york and near the pentagon show that the public in these areas is not being exposed to excessive levels of asbestos or other harmful substances,whitman said.given the scope of the tragedy from last week,i am glad to reassure the people of new york and washington,that their air is safe to breath sic and their water is safe to drink,she added.
id.at.in fact,according to the epa inspector general,percent of the bulk dust samples taken up to that point recorded asbestos at levels representing a significant health risk.see id.at.
press releases issued on september,october,and october well as a statement made by an epa spokesperson to the new york daily news on or about october reiterated the message that testing and sampling done near the site indicated no significant health risk to the public.see compl.
the oig report suggests that i the epa press releases conveyed the dominant message that there was no risk to public health without necessary qualifying statements about,for instance,the initial lack of monitoring data for many harmful substances besides asbestos,see oig report at ii the epa did not disclose publicly that it lacked adequate benchmarks for measuring the long term health effects of each substance or the combination of them in the unprecedented conditions created by the disaster,see id.at iii the epa reassuring statements were interpreted by some to apply to site workers as well as the public,see id.at iv the epa and other agencies sent mixed messages to workers about the need for respirators,see id.at and v the epa decisions as to what information to release were heavily influenced by suggestions from the ceq,see id.at.see compl.
as to the last point,a september internal epa email directed that all statements to the media were to be cleared by the national security council before release,and the oig report indicates that an official in the ceq was the conduit through which this clearance was granted,oig report at a comparison of draft press releases with their final counterparts reveals that the ceq suggested edits that removed cautionary wording for instance,in the september press release,a portion of the title was changed from epa testing terrorized sites for environmental hazards to epa reassures public about environmental hazards,id.at and in response to the ceq suggestions about the september press release,the epa i removed a reference to recent test samples that recorded higher asbestos levels than those in previous samples and ii added a quote from john henshaw of osha assuring that it was safe to go to work in lower manhattan,id.at.
the press releases were not without cautionary language they referred to the epa plan for continued monitoring efforts and early press releases warned of the need to take certain cautionary instance,to change air conditioning filters,sweep up debris,and wet down buildings covered in debris to avoid its becoming airborne.
b.the district court proceedings 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on march,and the district court granted the motion from the bench on february,holding that the defendants had not alleged the violation of a constitutional right and holding alternatively that the defendants in any event enjoyed qualified immunity because they had not violated a right that was clearly established at the time of their conduct.as to two plaintiffs,dismissal was granted on a further alternative ground that special factors counseled hesitation in the creation of a cause of action under bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d.specifically lombardi claim was dismissible because military personnel may not use a or bivens action to obtain redress for injuries suffered incident to military service,see united states stanley,d bivens action by military personnel jones state div.of military naval affairs,cir action by state national guardsman and garcia claim was dismissible because he already had the remedy afforded to marshals under the federal employees compensation act,see generally schweiker chilicky,d hudson valley black press irs,cir.
in assessing the due process claim,the district court emphasized that the administration had to deal with a situation of concern,of fear for safety,of a need to get on with the work of the community,to avoid an economic catastrophe as well as a physical catastrophe to the city of new york,and what was said was said.mot.to dismiss hr g tr,lombardi whitman.
discussion 
we review a dismissal for qualified immunity de novo,accepting as true the material facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.johnson newburgh enlarged school,cir.
the constitution itself does not explicitly provide a damages remedy to redress violations by individual federal officials.and sovereign immunity bars suit for damages against the federal government itself unless it has waived that immunity.but where an individual has been deprived of a constitutional right by a federal agent acting under color of federal authority,the individual may bring a bivens action for damages against that federal agent in an individual capacity,thomas ashcroft,cir,provided that congress has not forbidden such an action and that the situation presents no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress,hudson valley black press,at quoting bivens,at.
a federal executive official is entitled to invoke qualified immunity as a defense against a bivens action.see harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity analysis in bivens suits is the same analysis applied in suits against state actors.see wilson layne,d.first,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right saucier katz,d.second,was the right so clearly established that a reasonable government official would have known that her conduct violated a constitutional right in light of the specific context of the case,and not as a broad general proposition id.
the threshold inquiry is therefore whether the complaint alleges the violation of a constitutional right.
substantive due process 
under the due process clause of the fifth amendment of the constitution,n o person shall be deprived of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.v.this clause has been interpreted as a protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,county of sacramento lewis,d quoting wolff mcdonnell,d,which has both a procedural component protecting against the denial of fundamental procedural fairness,id.at,as well as a substantive component guarding the individual against the exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective,id.at.the substantive component of due process encompasses,among other things,an individual right to bodily integrity free from unjustifiable governmental interference.see washington glucksberg,d citing rochin california.the due process clause,however,does not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.government action resulting in bodily harm is not a substantive due process violation unless the government action was so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.pena deprisco,cir quoting lewis,at.
misrepresentation and state created danger 
only an affirmative act can amount to a violation of substantive due process,because the due process clause is phrased as a limitation on the state power to act,not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.deshaney,at.it is not enough to allege that a government actor failed to protect an individual from a known danger of bodily harm or failed to warn the individual of that danger.see collins city of harker heights,d no due process violation where plaintiff alleged the city failed to properly train or warn its employees of known dangers that resulted in sanitation worker asphyxiation.so,to the extent the plaintiffs here allege that the defendants had an affirmative duty to prevent them from suffering exposure to environmental contaminants,their claims must fail.they can not rely on the epa failure to instruct workers to wear particular equipment,its failure to explain the exact limitations of its knowledge of the health effects of the airborne substances that were present,or its failure to explain the limitations of its testing technologies.
but the complaint goes further it alleges that defendants affirmative assurances that the air in lower manhattan was safe to breathe created a false sense of security that induced site workers to forgo protective measures,thereby creating a danger where otherwise one would not have existed.i n exceptional circumstances a governmental entity may have a constitutional obligation to provide protection,either because of a special relationship with an individual,or because the governmental entity itself has created or increased the danger to the individual.ying jing gan city of new york,cir citing deshaney,at.the plaintiffs allege no special relationship between them and federal officials they plead that their reliance on the government misrepresentations induced them to forgo available safeguards,and thus characterize the harm as a state created danger.
where a government official takes an affirmative act that creates an opportunity for a third party to harm a victim or increases the risk of such harm,the government official can potentially be liable for damages.see,pena,at hemphill schott,cir dwares city of new york,cir.however,the danger alleged in this case is dissimilar from the state created dangers recognized in our precedents in each of those cases,a third party criminal behavior harmed the plaintiff after a government a law enforcement or created the opportunity for the criminal act through some interaction or relationship with the wrongdoer.see pena,at opining that special relationship liability arises from the relationship between the state and a particular victim,whereas state created danger liability arises from the relationship between the state and the private assailant.in dwares,the police allegedly gave the green light for skinheads to assault a group of in hemphill,the police allegedly gave back a robbery victim gun and took him along on a chase after the robber,who was shot by the robbery victim in pena,the police allegedly encouraged drinking and driving by a fellow officer who hit several pedestrians while under the influence.
in this case,the defendants acted only after the terrorists criminal acts were complete,plaintiffs claims are based neither on any alleged encouragement of the terrorists nor on any relationship between defendants and the terrorists.instead,plaintiffs appear to cast environmental conditions as the wrongdoer.they submit that the defendants,with knowledge of the serious health risks posed by these conditions,falsely represented to the public that it was safe from any such risks.
the closest analogy in other circuits substantive due process case it is not particularly to cases in which statements by law enforcement officials give an individual a false sense of security as to the necessity of.see,kennedy city of ridgefield,cir holding that a complaint adequately alleged state created danger where plaintiff reported to police that her neighbor was a child molester and the police violated promises to patrol the neighborhood and to warn her before they talked to the neighbor gazette city of pontiac,cir holding that causation was too attenuated to support a due process claim where daughter alleged she herself would have found evidence at the site of her mother had a chance of saving her for the police false claim that they had found nothing after a search 
depending on the circumstances,these cases furnish some support for the idea that a substantive due process violation can be made out when a private individual derives a false sense of security from an intentional misrepresentation by an executive official if foreseeable bodily harm directly results and if the official conduct shocks the conscience.taking the allegations of the complaint as true,as we must,we assume that a sufficient causal connection exists between the defendants optimistic statements and the plaintiffs exposure to toxic substances.however,the point is fairly debatable as the supreme court cautioned in evaluating a substantive due process claim based on legislative action,
a governmental decision that has an incremental impact on the probability that death will result in any given situation can not be characterized as state action depriving a person of life just because it may set in motion a chain of events that ultimately leads to the random death of an innocent bystander.
martinez california,d.see also bright,at a state created danger cause of action is only cognizable where the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct quoting kneipp tedder,cir.we put aside the vexed issue of causation instead,we decide the case on the ground that the conduct alleged,even assuming causation,does not shock the conscience.
in order to shock the conscience and trigger a violation of substantive due process,official conduct must be outrageous and egregious under the circumstances it must be truly brutal and offensive to human dignity smith half hollow hills cent.school,cir quoting johnson glick,cir internal quotation marks omitted.courts have always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and.collins,at.
in gauging the shock,negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold,while conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.county of sacramento lewis,d.in between,the supreme court has recognized that conduct exhibiting deliberate indifference to harm can support a substantive due process claim,with a potent qualification that has bearing here 
deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another,and our concern with preserving the constitutional proportions of substantive due process demands an exact analysis of circumstances before any abuse of power is condemned as.
id.at.the conscience recognizes the dilemma of conflicting obligations.in the apparent absence of harmless options at the time decisions must be made,an attempt to choose the least of evils is not itself shocking.
in lewis,the supreme court held that the deliberate indifference of police officers who risk the lives of suspects by engaging in high speed pursuit can not be deemed,because they have obligations that tend to tug against each other and because t hey are supposed to act decisively and to show restraint at the same moment,and their decisions have to be made in haste,under pressure,and frequently without the luxury of a second chance.id.at.quoting whitley albers,d.police conduct in such events does not shock the conscience unless there is intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight.id.at.by contrast,prison officials deliberate indifference to inmate welfare in situations can be because the officials have time to make unhurried judgments,upon the chance for repeated reflection,largely uncomplicated by the pulls of competing obligations.id.at.the duty of a prison official in such a situation does not ordinarily clash with other equally important governmental responsibilities,whitley,at,because no substantial countervailing interest excuse s the state from making provision for the decent care and protection of those it locks up lewis,at.
the plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants acted with an evil intent to harm but they argue that the defendants deliberate indifference shocks the conscience because the defendants made their decisions in an unhurried fashion with hours,days,weeks and even months to contemplate,deliberate,discuss and decide what to do and say about the health hazards posed to thousands of people who were coming onto and working at ground zero.appellants br.
the decisions alleged were made by the defendants over a period of time rather than in the rush of a car chase but the decisions can not on that account be fairly characterized as unhurried or leisured.the oig report relied upon by the complaint shows that the defendants were required to make decisions using rapidly changing information about the ramifications of unprecedented events in coordination with multiple federal agencies and local agencies and governments.see oig report at i responding to this crisis required organizations from all levels of government to coordinate their response efforts and to make critical public health and safety decisions quickly,and without all of the data that would normally desire.kaucher county of bucks,cir we note defendants were under some pressure to respond quickly to the spread of infection at the jail over a period of more than two years,and we question whether deliberately indifferent conduct is truly conscience shocking in this context.
hurried or unhurried,the defendants were subjected to the pull of competing obligations.the complaint concedes that the alleged wrongs to the plaintiffs were committed in aid of competing public goals that were not insubstantial 
defendants caused to be made the aforesaid misleading statements and omissions in order to insure that plaintiffs and class members immediately began to perform search,recovery,and other work at the ground zero site immediately after the september,attacks,and to create the overall impression that it was safe for people residing and working in areas near ground zero to return to their normal lives.
compl.the complaint thus recognizes what everyone knows that one essential government function in the wake of disaster is to put the affected community on a normal footing,to avoid panic,keep order,restore services,repair infrastructure,and preserve the economy.
in previous cases in which we recognized a state created danger,government officials were not subject to the pull of competing obligations.as to pena,there is certainly no countervailing public benefit to the encouragement of drunk driving.see pena deprisco,cir not condoning egregious drunk driving does not ordinarily clash with othe
