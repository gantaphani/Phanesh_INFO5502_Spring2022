petitioner david dutil appeals from a decision of the district court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.dutil,adjudged a sexually dangerous person sdp under massachusetts law,has long since completed the full term of his criminal sentence,and is now indefinitely confined to the massachusetts treatment center under the massachusetts sdp statute.laws ch.his appeal challenges the constitutionality of his ongoing civil commitment,arguing that by failing to ensure regular and expeditious review of his sexual dangerousness,the commonwealth sdp statute deprives him of his substantive due process rights and is therefore facially invalid.because we find that the text of the statute,as interpreted by massachusetts state courts,does not on its face violate the due process protections heretofore afforded sdps subject to civil commitment,we affirm.
background 
the relevant facts may be briefly summarized based on the findings of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.see in re dutil.the factual findings of the state court are presumed to be correct under e,gunter maloney,cir citing sanna dipaolo,cir.
in the late,dutil was sentenced for six criminal charges of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years.in,he was sentenced to two years of probation for the first two charges two years later,he pled guilty to the other four charges and received four concurrent prison terms.at the latter sentencing,the judge also determined dutil to be a sexually dangerous person pursuant to the massachusetts sdp statute and committed him to a treatment center indefinitely.dutil criminal sentence ended in.
pursuant to.laws ch,a provision allowing sdps to argue that their sexual dangerousness has ended,dutil filed petitions for discharge in,and a judge denied the petition in august after a hearing,finding that dutil remained an sdp.dutil withdrew the petition before the scheduled hearing.dutil petition included a request for a jury trial,and in early february,a jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that dutil remained sexually dangerous.
while the third petition was pending,dutil filed a state habeas corpus petition arguing,inter alia,that massachusetts sdp statute violated the requirements of kansas hendricks,d,by failing to require annual review of commitments.the massachusetts superior court denied the habeas petition,and in,the sjc affirmed the superior court denial.in re dutil,at.neither court appears to have directly addressed dutil claim that he is entitled to annual review as a matter of federal due process.
in,dutil filed the instant federal habeas petition pursuant to.the memorandum filed in support of his petition again alleged,inter alia,that he was entitled to annual review under hendricks.a magistrate judge report and recommendation found dutil argument without merit,concluding in a footnote that the statute provision for annual retrial through the filing of a petition comports with due process the district court adopted the magistrate report and dismissed the petition without commenting on this footnote.
dutil subsequently filed an application for a certificate of appealability with the district court requesting permission to appeal on five distinct grounds.after citing in re trimmer,for the proposition that the massachusetts sdp statute clearly does not set an express time limitation within which the court must hold a reexamination hearing,and after speculating that it might plausibly be thought that sdps are entitled to something more in the nature of a speedy trial rather than simply the right to file a petition on the anniversary of a civil commitment,the district court granted the certificate as to one issue whether due process is denied by the statute failure to provide an express outward time limit within which the responsible court must hold a reexamination hearing when requested by a person civilly committed as an sdp massachusetts argues that dutil failed to exhaust this claim in state court,and that in any event the statute comports with due process requirements.
ii.exhaustion of state remedies 
before seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus,a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies,b,thus giving the state the first opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights.josselyn dennehy,cir quoting duncan henry,d see also id.at where,as here,a state highest court offers discretionary review,a petitioner must present that court with the opportunity to review the federal claim to have exhausted available state remedies.citing baldwin reese,d.appellee argues that dutil has failed to meet this exhaustion requirement,taking the position that the sjc was never fairly presented with the question of whether the massachusetts sdp statute violates the due process clause by failing to set an express time limit within which the court must hold a reexamination hearing.we disagree.
the exhaustion requirement,while at times technical and arcane,is straightforward in this context.a claim for habeas corpus relief has been exhausted where the claim has been fairly presented to the state courts.id.quoting baldwin,at.internal quotation marks omitted.fair presentation means that the petitioner must show that he tendered his federal claim in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question.clements maloney,cir quoting casella clemons,cir.this does not mean,however,that the pleadings in the state and federal courts must be identical,but only that the legal theory articulated in the state and federal courts must be the same.id.quoting gagne fair,cir alteration in original,internal quotation marks omitted.
we have previously held that a habeas petitioner fairly presents a claim by doing any of the following citing a provision of the federal constitution presenting a federal constitutional claim in a manner that fairly alerts the state court to the federal nature of the claim citing federal constitutional precedents or claiming violation of a right specifically protected in the federal constitution.id.citing gagne,at.
finally,as a general rule,we are solicitous of the obstacles that pro se litigants face,and while such litigants are not exempt from procedural rules,we hold pro se pleadings to less demanding standards than those drafted by lawyers and endeavor,within reasonable limits,to guard against the loss of pro se claims due to technical defects.boivin black,cir citing haines kerner,d instituto de educacion universal dep t of,cir.
while we agree with the appellee that the precise issue before us as framed by the district court was not clearly presented to the sjc,we think that dutil due process arguments were sufficiently presented to that court for exhaustion purposes.dutil state habeas petition,which he filed pro se,specifically identified substantive due process as a ground for his complaint,and it made the claim that he is being confined absent a finding or requirement of mental illness and dangerousness.this broad statement was then sharpened in his brief to the sjc,again filed pro se.in that brief,under a heading on the first page reading,on its face,c violates the due process clause of the united states constitution,dutil wrote,chapter is not sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive scrutiny,for the following reasons the statute fails to require judicial review annually in order to determine whether the involuntarily confined individual requires further confinement.later,in a section entitled the statute fails to require judicial review annually in order to determine whether the involuntairlly sic committed individual requires further confinement,dutil quoted hendricks as support for his contention that w ithout annual judicial review,there is no assurance the commonwealth does not intend an individual committed under the act to remain confined any longer than he suffers from the mental abnormality rendering him dangerous second alteration in original.dutil concluded this section with a short paragraph that included the sentence,dutil inability to receive annual judicial review is a serious
