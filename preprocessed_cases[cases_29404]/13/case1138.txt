plaintiff patrick looney served as the building official for the town of marlborough,connecticut from until.he now sues marlborough as well as three members of marlborough board of selectmen,defendants appellants william black,riva clark,and joseph labella,under,alleging that he was deprived of his procedural due process and free speech rights when his position was reduced from full to part time after he made certain statements regarding the use of stoves,as well as when he subsequently was not reappointed as the town building official.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court erred in determining that defendant appellant black was not entitled to qualified immunity as to looney fourteenth amendment procedural due process claim,as looney has not adequately alleged that he had a constitutionally protected property right in employment.we hold also that the district court erred in determining that defendants appellants black,clark,and labella were not entitled to qualified immunity as to looney first amendment claim,as looney does not adequately allege that he spoke in his capacity as a private citizen.accordingly,we reverse the order of the district court,and remand the case with the direction that the district court enter judgment for defendants appellants.
background 
the following facts are drawn from the allegations in looney second amended complaint sac and are assumed true for purposes of this appeal.
the position of building official is established in the town of marlborough,connecticut town charter charter.the charter notes that the powers and duties of the position are prescribed by ordinance and the connecticut general statutes.the charter also gives marlborough board of selectmen the power to appoint all officers set forth therein,including the building official.
connecticut law provides that a building official is appointed to a term of four years and until his successor qualifies.a.a building official may be dismissed under the procedures set forth in connecticut general statutes b and c if and when he fails to perform the duties of his office.id.b,c.the charter notes that approval of the entire board of selectmen is needed to discharge or remove any appointed official or employee of the town,including the building official.
looney was appointed as marlborough building official on august.he learned of the position from a public notice that quoted a salary and stated that the position included a pension and benefits package,both of which are available only to employees.prior to his accepting the job,marlborough selectman howard dean told looney that he would be given,salaried employment at per year,along with a full benefits package.
subsequently,looney was reappointed as marlborough building official four times,in november,november,february,and april.at this last reappointment,marlborough board of selectmen decided to continue his appointment per a for an additional four years.ja.no other conditions or terms of this last reappointment were noted by the board of selectmen at that time.
throughout these appointments,and until february,looney was always a full time employee entitled to all benefits provided to employees according to section c of the town personnel rules and regulations.these benefits included,but were not limited to,group health and dental insurance,group life insurance,long term disability insurance,contributions to retirement,bereavement leave,personal days,leave of absence with pay for jury duty,reimbursement accumulated sick leave,holiday pay,and vacation pay.ja.a collective bargaining agreement cba entered into between the town and local of council afscme,afl cio union on july,recognized the position of building official as full time.
in october,looney filed a grievance relating to a purported infringement of his first amendment rights by his supervisor peter hughes,who served as marlborough planning development director.hughes allegedly attempted to limit looney communication of information to a town resident regarding wood burning and smoke discharge as public health concerns.ja.
after looney filed his grievance against hughes,matters escalated.hughes again requested that looney not engage in discussions of substantive matters outside his job duties concerning other town agenc ies or jurisdiction s.ja.looney continued to protest hughes attempts to limit his communication with the public and ultimately retained counsel.his counsel sent black a letter on december,advising him that hughes restriction was an illegal prior restraint on speech in violation of the first amendment.ja.marlborough announced a week later that it would not remove the restriction hughes had placed on looney speech,and threatened to discipline or discharge looney.on january,marlborough counsel informed the union that certain of its members would be laid off or have their hours reduced,and that the building official position would be reduced to hours a week.
looney then received a letter from black on january,confirming the reduction in his hours,and stating that he would be paid per hour with no additional compensation for loss of benefits.ja.on april,looney notified marlborough that he intended to file suit against the town for the events that had transpired.he then commenced this litigation on june,asserting claims pursuant to based on violations of the first amendment and the fourteenth amendment procedural due process guarantee.
after the lawsuit had commenced,black announced that he planned to post a notice seeking to fill the building official position.labella and clark,as selectmen,were included in the search committee that interviewed candidates for the position.looney applied to be reappointed during the application period,and during his interview labella noted that he had brought a lawsuit against marlborough.ja.clark also stated during the interview that she had serious issues recommending someone who is suing the town.ja.black,clark,and labella all voted for a candidate other than looney to fill the position.looney was not reappointed.
on september,black,clark,and labella moved to dismiss looney complaint on the grounds that,inter alia,all three individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to the applicable claims looney then sought leave to file the sac.the district court granted looney motion to file the sac,and denied defendants motion to dismiss in its entirety.
in rejecting the argument made by black that he was entitled to qualified immunity as to looney fourteenth amendment due process claim,the district court held that looney had adequately alleged a valid property interest in employment.looney town of marlborough,cv,wl,at.july.it based this determination on its understanding that while looney alleged right to employment with pension and benefits was not memorialized in a written contract,there was a sufficiently consistent course of conduct over a period of more than fifteen years,and looney had relied upon those benefits to secure medical coverage for himself and his disabled spouse.id.thus,the district court determined that looney had a constitutionally protected property right under the fourteenth amendment.id.
from this determination,the district court further concluded that the law was defined with reasonable clarity and that,based upon the allegations of the sac,black conduct in reducing looney hours was not objectively reasonable.id.at.accordingly,it denied the motion to dismiss to the extent that black argued he was entitled to qualified immunity as to looney procedural due process claims.
the district court then considered black,clark,and labella arguments that they were entitled to qualified immunity as to looney first amendment claim.the court denied the motion to dismiss on this ground as well,holding that defendants appear ed to concede that looney spoke as a citizen instead of pursuant to his official duties,and that looney allegations regarding the speech at issue adequately established that it touched on a matter of public concern.id.at.
based on this determination,the district court held that the sac adequately alleged both a violation of looney clearly established first amendment rights,and that black,clark,and labella had committed acts of retaliation against looney for his speech,such that they did not act in an objectively reasonable manner.id.at.accordingly,the district court held that the individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the litigation as to looney first amendment claims,and their motion to dismiss was denied on this ground as well.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
qualified immunity provides government officials immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.pearson callahan,d quoting mitchell forsyth,d.government officials who are performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.
t he driving force behind creation of the qualified immunity doctrine is a desire to ensure that insubstantial claims against government officials will be resolved prior to discovery.pearson,at quoting anderson creighton,d see also saucier katz,d a ruling on qualified immunity should be made early in the proceedings so that the cost and expenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive,overruled on other grounds by pearson,d.
we review a denial of qualified immunity de novo.clubside,valentin,cir velez levy,cir.in reviewing such a denial,f irst,we ask whether there was a constitutional violation.if the answer to this question is yes,we must then determine whether the right was clearly established at the time of the violation.clubside,at citing saucier,at.a right is clearly established if the law was defined with reasonable clarity,has been affirmed by the supreme court or the second circuit,and where the conduct at issue would have been understood by a reasonable defendant to be unlawful under the existing law.young cnty.of fulton,cir see also reichle howards,d to be clearly established,a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.in other words,existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.citations,modifications,and internal quotation marks omitted.finally,we must decide whether it was objectively reasonable for the defendants to believe that their acts did not violate these clearly established rights.young,at internal quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,defendants appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the complaint because black is entitled to qualified immunity as to looney procedural due process claim,and all three individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to looney first amendment claim.we address these arguments in turn.
procedural due process claim 
in determining whether looney complaint adequately alleges that there was a constitutional procedural due process violation,we inquire first as to whether he adequately alleged a property right protected under the constitution.see bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.such property interests can not be found on the face of the constitution,but rather are created,and their dimensions are defined by,existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits.id.at.a unilateral expectation is not sufficient to establish a constitutionally protected property right.id.rather,a plaintiff must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the alleged property interest.id.
where a valid property right is established,we consider whether a plaintiff was deprived of that right without due process.narumanchi bd.of trs.of.state,cir.in making this determination,we inquire into what process was due,and whether the government provided such minimum process.see mathews eldridge,d elaborating how to determine what process is due when a plaintiff has been deprived of a valid property interest.
to determine whether black is entitled to qualified immunity as to looney procedural due process claim,we must determine also whether the constitutionally protected property right was clearly established.reichle.at.this determination is a particularized inquiry based on the situation facing an individual defendant at the time of her alleged actions.a defendant alleged conduct must have violated plaintiff procedural due process rights in a manner that every reasonable official would have understood violate d that right.id.at citations,modifications,and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court holding that black was not entitled to qualified immunity as to looney procedural due process claim at this stage in the litigation was grounded in the determination that looney had a constitutionally protected property right in employment.in so deciding,the court relied on three primary sources identified in looney complaint.these were connecticut general statutes a c,which establishes both that the building official is appointed for a term,and the procedure for dismissing a building official who has failed to perform his duties,looney,wl,at marlborough employee handbook,section,which identifies full time employees as those working thirty hour weeks or more,and indicates that those employees are entitled to pension and healthcare benefits,and looney four reappointments as building official over the course of fifteen years,each time beginning his term with pension and benefits as a employee,id.at.
the district court,however,did not rely on the cba in making its determination that looney had a property interest in employment.indeed,looney argued in his that his property interest was protected by connecticut statute,not the cba,a statement that the district court credited.ja.
the district court based its holding on ezekwo new york city health and hosps,cir.there,plaintiff ezekwo was a doctor who had been accepted into a residency program at a hospital run by the defendant.she was notified at the outset of her residency that every resident would serve as chief resident for four months during his or her third year.id.at.shortly before her third year began,despite receiving negative performance reviews,she was again told that she would be serving as chief resident later that year.after filing certain allegations of race and gender discrimination against her supervisor,ezekwo was notified that she would not be able to serve as chief resident.id.at.we there found that the plaintiff had more than just a unilateral expectation of becoming chief resident because she had been consistently informed that she would rotate through the position of chief resident and receive a salary differential as a result of that designation.id.at.indeed,the practice of rotating residents through the chief resident position was expressly highlighted in hhc informational documents.id.at.accordingly,we determined that the written documents,the course of conduct,and ezekwo reasonable reliance thereon created a contractual right under new york state law that rose to the level of a significant property interest.id.
the district court relied on ezekwo to hold that both the connecticut general statutes and marlborough employee handbook,in conjunction with looney four consecutive reappointments to the building official position,gave rise to a sufficiently consistent course of conduct to entitle looney not only to a property interest in his employment,but to a property interest in employment in particular.looney,wl,at.the court emphasized that while looney interest was perhaps of lesser value than ezekwo opportunity to become a chief resident,employment was still very important to him.id.at.
two other cases,ciambrello county of nassau,cir and harhay town of ellington board of education,cir,were distinguished by the district court,which deemed them to be not directly on point.looney,wl,at.we,however,find them to be important precedents.
ciambrello concerned a civil service employee who was demoted back to his original position from a recent promotion because nassau county,his employer,determined he had been promoted in violation of his union collective bargaining agreement.ciambrello,at.we held that the applicable collective bargaining agreement,which expressly prohibited demotion or disciplinary proceedings absent incompetence misconduct,gave the plaintiff a property interest in his promotion,as he was demoted in direct violation of the collective bargaining agreement terms.id.at.
harhay similarly involved a property right that we held was established under the terms of the applicable cba.see harhay,at.based on the text of the collective bargaining agreement at issue in that case,which provided the plaintiff a contractual right to be reappointed to any vacant position for which she was qualified,we determined that it was clear that the plaintiff,a tenured school teacher,had a constitutionally protected property right in being reappointed.id.
ezekwo,ciambrello,and harhay therefore all involved a plaintiff who had been promised something explicitly either verbally,or in the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement about specific conditions during the future term of their employment.ezekwo was told both in writing and in person that she could expect to be chief resident during her third year of residency.ezekwo,at.ciambrello was working pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that stated he would not be demoted without engaging in incompetence or misconduct.ciambrello,at.harhay was contractually promised that she would be reappointed to an available position.harhay,at.
in this case,however,looney does not allege that any writing or verbal communication he was a party to indicated that his position as building official necessarily was to continue full time,or even that he was guaranteed reappointment to the position.he alleges,instead,simply that it always had been so.
in doing so,he relies on a conglomeration of sources that he argues create a sufficient course of conduct,including the relevant connecticut general statutes sections a discussion he had in with selectman dean regarding the terms of his initial appointment as building official the job advertisement for the position of building official,which indicated that it came with a package the marlborough employee handbook,which defines a full time employee as one who works thirty hours or more per week,and indicates that such employees are entitled to pension and benefits and the fact that he was reappointed four separate times over a fifteen year span,and that during the entirety of each appointment until the last he worked as a employee,receiving pension and benefits.
nothing in any of these documents or interactions,however,indicates that marlborough or any other party provided a written guarantee or an explicit indication that looney should expect to be employed full time from appointment to appointment,or throughout the duration of a single appointment.while looney alleges that the discussion he had and advertisement he saw regarding the position in,before he was first appointed,indicated that he could expect the job to be full time and to come with pension and benefits,those statements were made more than fifteen years ago,and indicated,at best,only the terms and conditions of looney initial appointment.
furthermore,connecticut general statutes states only that the building official is to be appointed for four years,and provides a mechanism for removing the building official from his or her position if and when certain conditions are met.it is silent as to any guarantee or procedural requirement for reducing a building official hours from full to part time.
all of the other documents identified in looney complaint the employee handbook,the town charter,and the cba merely define what was or was not considered full time employment,and accordingly whether an employee could expect to receive,inter alia,pension and health care benefits.none of these items affirmatively indicated that looney could expect to continue being a employee.in fact,the sac alleges only that the board notified looney of his final term of reappointment in april by stating that it had decided to continue plaintiff appointment per a,for an additional four years effective august.ja,ja.but the board said,and therefore guaranteed,nothing about the terms of that appointment when it so notified him.
the complaint allegations,without any written or spoken guarantee as to the terms of his employment,leave looney with nothing more than a unilateral expectation that he would continue to be reappointed to his position,and that such reappointment would be full time.such a unilateral expectation does not qualify as a constitutionally protected property right.see roth,at stating that an abstract concern in being rehired without more is insufficient to create a property interest.indeed,while none of the documents or interactions on which looney relies can rightly be said to create an affirmative expectation that he would continue to be a employee,the cba,which provides in article that the town may determine that layoffs or reductions in hours are necessary ja,and provides also a hierarchy by which such layoffs and reductions should take place,affirmatively indicates that he should have been prepared for the possibility that his hours would be reduced.
we do not doubt that looney interest in his continued employment was important,or that he has felt the negative effects of being deprived of his pension and health care benefits.unfortunately,however,looney interest in these items does not suffice to guarantee them constitutional protection as property rights to which he has any procedural entitlement we therefore conclude that looney has not adequately alleged a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment.accordingly,the district court erred in determining that black was not entitled to qualified immunity as to looney procedural due process claim.
ii.first amendment claim 
as with looney fourteenth amendment claim,the individual defendants moved to dismiss looney first amendment claim,and so the allegations must be read in the light most favorable to looney,and we construe the complaint liberally.gregory daly,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we are bound to make our determination based only on the contents of the complaint.see mckenna wright,cir stating that the court can only consider the face of the complaint in deciding whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity on a motion to dismiss.
in determining whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity as to a plaintiff first amendment claims,we must first determine whether the plaintiff constitutional right to free speech was impinged.generally,government employees are entitled to first amendment protection when they speak as a private citizen addressing matters of public concern.garcetti ceballos,d see also sousa roque,cir.a matter of public concern is one that relates to a matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick myers,d.
public employees speaking pursuant to their official duties,however,are not afforded protections under the first amendment.ross breslin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is the case even when the subject of an employee speech is a matter of public concern.id.it is also true,however,that a public employee does not relinquish first amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest simply by virtue of government employment.connick,at.rather,where the speech at issue owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities,garcetti,at,it can properly be said to have been made pursuant to that party official duties.see also ross,at holding the speech at issue was not protected because it owed its existence to plaintiff job duties weintraub bd.of,cir noting that the speech alleged was of the plaintiff employment responsibilities internal quotation marks omitted.
to defeat an assertion of qualified immunity,an employee constitutional right to free speech must also be clearly established under the law.reichle.at.further,even where a plaintiff has shown that the defendant actions violated a clearly established constitutional right,the defendant may still be entitled to qualified immunity if she is alleged to have acted in an objectively reasonable way.see amore,at.
on appeal,defendants argue that they did not,as the district court determined,concede that looney was not acting in his official capacity,and thus must have been speaking as a private citizen.it is true that defendants failed to cite garcetti or weintraub,or to otherwise make any arguments directly addressing this issue in their motion to dismiss or reply papers below but it is also true that both the plaintiff and the district court cited and relied on garcetti.looney briefed the issue of whether or not he spoke pursuant to his official duties in his opposition to defendants motion to dismiss.the district court also noted that public employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes when they make statements pursuant to their official duties.looney,wl,at quoting garcetti,at.
thus,the argument is preserved for appeal.see higgins stock,cir considering an argument that was raised below because the argument,although different in emphasis from the point pressed on appeal,at least introduced the notion in the district court.furthermore,even if the argument had been waived below,we may exercise our discretion and consider it now.see allianz ins.lerner,cir stating that because rule that appellate court will not consider argument not raised below is prudential,not jurisdictional,we have discretion to consider waived arguments internal quotation marks omitted.
we therefore turn to the question of whether looney complaint adequately alleges that his speech was made as a private citizen,rather than in the course of his official duties 
the inquiry into whether a public employee is speaking pursuant to her official duties is not susceptible to a brightline rule.courts must examine the nature of the plaintiff job responsibilities,the nature of the speech,and the relationship between the two.other contextual factors,such as whether the complaint was also conveyed to the public,may properly influence a court decision.
ross,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the proper inquiry here is a practical one.garcetti,at.
looney allegations regarding the content and scope of what he said to the town resident,as well as the capacity in which he said it,are vague.the vast majority,if not the totality,of the allegations regarding looney allegedly protected speech made to a town resident appear in paragraphs through of his complaint.they are as follows 
on or about october,plaintiff filed a grievance claiming harassment relative to his freedom of speech rights based on the attempt by plaintiff supervisor,peter hughes,planning and development director,to limit the communication of information to a town resident regarding wood burning and smoke discharge as public health concerns.
on october,peter hughes responded,looney has been requested to restrict his actions in the office to that of his duties and not to make determinations or engage in discussions of substantive matters outside his job duties concerning other town agenc ies or jurisdiction s.
on november,in a memorandum to first selectman black,plaintiff continued to protest limits placed on his ability to communicate information to the public relative to the outdoor burning boilers issue whereby plaintiff was voicing his opinion regarding an outside agency enforcing a cease and desist order against town residents.
looney alleges that he communicat ed information to a town resident regarding wood burning and smoke discharge as public health concerns.ja.similarly,he alleges that he communicate d information to the public relative to the outdoor wood burning boilers issue by voicing his opinion regarding an outside agency enforcing a cease and desist order against town residents.ja.
as to the scope of his duties as building official,looney alleges generally that a t all times relevant to the complaint,he was employed as the building official of the town of marlborough,ja,and as such was responsible for the administration and enforcement of the state building code at the municipal level,including the organization and conduct of the building advisory,inspection and enforcement program ja.he further alleges that throughout his employment he kept uppermost in mind his obligation to enforce the state building code to ensure the safety of the townspeople.ja.
beyond this,the complaint does not allege specifics as to what looney said,or the context in which he said it.the job falls to us to so infer,reading all available allegations in the light most favorable to looney.daly,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in the absence of anything more specific,looney vague allegations force us to conclude that,as the town employee who oversaw the entire organization and conduct of the building advisory,inspection and enforcement programs,particularly in light of his obligation to enforce the state building code,the alleged speech set forth in the complaint was closely related to his work as building official.ja.this understanding is furthered by looney dual allegations that it was a part of his job to ensure the safety of the townspeople by enforcing the relevant building codes,and the smoke discharge that was causing the issue discussed regarding the wood burning stoves or boilers was a public health concern.ja.the only sensible way to interpret looney allegations is that he spoke on these issues because he was in an official position that required,or at least allowed,him to do so.it follows that these statements owed their existence to his position as the building official.as a consequence,looney has not adequately alleged that he spoke as a private citizen.
it is true that looney alleges that his supervisor,in admonishing him for this alleged speech,requested that he refrain from discussing matters outside looney job duties.ja,emphasis added.it is also alleged that his speech regarded an outside agency enforcing a cease and desist order against town residents.ja,emphasis added.but f ormal job descriptions often bear little resemblance to the duties an employee actually is expected to perform,and the listing of a given task in an employee written job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee professional duties for first amendment purposes.garcetti,at.similarly,whether speech was unprotected does not rest on the fact that the speech was made in the workplace as opposed to elsewhere.ross,at.
the face of looney complaint alleges nothing more than a vague set of circumstances regarding speech which necessarily owed its existence to looney role as building official.id.at.because the speech at issue is alleged to have been made in the course of looney official duties,he has not adequately alleged that such speech is entitled to first amendment protection 
the district court therefore erred in holding that black,clark,and labella were not entitled to qualified immunity as to looney first amendment claim.
conclusion 
for the aforementioned reasons,the order of the district court denying black,riva,and labella qualified immunity is reversed,and the case is remanded with the direction to enter judgment for the defendants appellants.
i respectfully dissent from the majority resolution of both the due process and first amendment claims.i can not conclude that the allegations in looney complaint call for qualified immunity and warrant dismissal at this juncture.as to looney procedural due process claim,the allegations of the representations and conduct by defendant first selectman black and the other town officials,and the importance of the salary and benefits to looney,are sufficient to show that he had a property right to employment protected by procedural due process during his statutory term as a building official.as to looney first amendment retaliation claim,the allegations in the complaint sufficiently demonstrate that looney speech was made as a private citizen and on a matter of public concern.although discovery may uncover facts to the contrary,it would be premature to conclude otherwise on a motion to dismiss.accordingly,i would affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity.
procedural due process claim 
qualified immunity may only be granted if an official has met his burden in demonstrating that no rational jury could conclude that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.ashcroft,d internal quotation marks omitted.a government official conduct violates clearly established law when,at the time of the challenged conduct,the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.id.at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.the question is not what a lawyer would learn or intuit from researching case law,but what a reasonable person in the defendant position should know about the constitutionality of the conduct w e use an objective standard for judging the actions of state and federal officials.coollick hughes,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.under this standard,looney factual allegations,if accepted as true,would have led the defendants to conclude that reducing looney compensation and eliminating his benefits without a hearing violated his right to due process.
looney has sufficiently alleged in his complaint that he had a protected property interest in his status as a employee during the period of his appointment as building official under this court prior holdings in ezekwo nyc health hospitals,cir,ciambriello county of nassau,cir,and harhay town of ellington board of education,cir.looney alleged that in,when he was appointed to his first statutory term as the marlborough building official,the job advertisement set forth a salary and package that were only available to fulltime employees of the town.he also alleged that the selectman specifically told looney at the time he accepted the position that the building official role was a position with the benefits of other employees,such as pension,healthcare,sick leave,and vacation time.in addition,looney alleged that the town personnel rules and regulations designated him as a employee entitled to all benefits provided to employees.
looney alleged that he was reappointed four more times by the board of selectmen as a full time building official,and he enjoyed salary and benefits during his entire sixteen years as the building official without any indication that he could be reduced from his status.during this period,he received a salary and the same benefits as all other marlborough employees.the complaint also alleged that in,a collective bargaining agreement entered into by the town recognized the building official position as it was only in after looney spoke out against the actions of town officials that he was reduced to status and his benefits were terminated.our prior decisions require due process protection for looney so that he was at least entitled to a hearing before this reduction in his pay and benefits.
in ezekwo,we considered whether the plaintiff had a property interest in serving as chief ophthalmology resident at the defendant harlem hospital center,which was operated by new york city.the hospital had historically awarded the position to all ophthalmology residents in the last year of their residencies.ezekwo,at.however,after the plaintiff began writing letters to the hospital complaining about various working conditions,the hospital decided to change the policy for selecting chief ophthalmology residents to what it claimed was a program and denied the plaintiff the chief resident status.id.at.in concluding that the plaintiff enjoyed a property interest in the position of chief resident,we focused on two factors.first,we observed a course of conduct in which the hospital had consistently offered explicit reassurances to the plaintiff,including verbal statements from supervisors and written informational documents,that she would rotate into the chief resident position.see id.at.second,we highlighted the importance to the holder of the right.id.quoting brown brienen,cir.we found that the plaintiff interest in serving as chief resident was sufficiently important because her interest was more than merely financial and because the position,due in large part to the very nature of medical training itself,was of significant professional value.id.accordingly,we found that the plaintiff expectation of performing the duties of chief resident was reasonable and well founded and rose to the level of a property interest entitled to the protections afforded by the due process clause.id.
in ciambriello,we concluded that a civil service employee enjoyed a protected property interest in his position as a maintenance mechanic and thus was entitled to a hearing when his employer sought to demote him back to his former position as equipment operator.at.as in ezekwo,we focused on the course of conduct toward the plaintiff and concluded that he had a reasonable expectation that he would retain his position in that case,based on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.also,as in ezekwo,we emphasized that the plaintiff interest in his position,while not a opportunity,is still significant.at.after working for the county for nearly five years,the plaintiff was promoted to a position that entailed higher pay and greater benefits.the plaintiff served in the higher position for well over two years,only to be returned to his original position and salary.id.we therefore had no trouble concluding that this right was a property right of suficient importance to the plaintiff to warrant constitutional protection.id.emphasis added.
in harhay,we concluded that a previously terminated public school teacher possessed a property interest in her position on a reappointment list for purposes of determining whether she would be rehired when a vacancy occurred.at.although we also concluded that the plaintiff had been afforded adequate process through the grievance procedure in her collective bargaining agreement,in determining whether she had a due process right in the possibility of reappointment we emphasized the importance to the plaintiff of the reappointment protection.see id.at.as in ezekwo and ciambriello,we underscored that the plaintiff position on the reappointment list can and should be characterized as an important interest as opposed to a trivial and insubstantial interest as it directly affects her right to be employed at all.id.quoting ezekwo,at.
these decisions emphasize the importance of a course of conduct on which a plaintiff might reasonably rely to establish a property right in the interest in question.however,they do not require,as the majority concludes,that this course of conduct be established through a written or spoken guarantee as to the terms of the plaintiff employment.as we held in ezekwo,a dditional contractual provisions may be implied into a contract as a result of a course of dealing between the parties.the parties through their conduct and practice can create additional rights and duties.at citing perry sindermann,d.the allegations here of the initial representations to looney for his first appointment,the advertisement for the position,the town personnel rules and regulations,and the collective bargaining agreement,as well as looney reappointment each time over the course of sixteen years to the position of a building official without any diminutions of his hours or compensation,are sufficient to allege a course of conduct that implicates a property interest in employment even if the majority is correct that the bar for such a property interest is set so high as to require a written guarantee or explicit indication,i also believe that the allegations in the complaint reach it 
as to the importance to the holder of the right,ezekwo,at internal quotation marks omitted,looney lost all his health and retirement benefits as well as a significant amount of salary due to the reduction in his hours.if the suspension of a university professor for two weeks without pay implicates a protected property interest,see narumanchi bd.of,cir,then surely such a reduction
