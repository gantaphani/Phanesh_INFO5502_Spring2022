overview of abrams and the van 
abrams,a black male,joined dps in.in,he was made a detective in the eastern district major crimes unit edmcu,a division that houses more than thirty detectives working on major crimes but not homicides.homicides,at least in part,are handled by the edmcu crime van the van.
the van is a specialized unit comprised of five to six edmcu detectives who investigate serious crimes,suspicious deaths,and homicides.van detectives have the same pay and benefits as other detectives and no change in title,but assignment to the van is considered an elite position occupied by the best of the best of troopers.matthews dep.van duty is a demanding job assigned detectives must be on call hours a day,seven days a week.there is no formal application process for assignment to the van.when an opening becomes available,interested detectives simply submit their names and resumes.defendants sergeant john turner and captain patrick,under the supervision of lieutenant colonel steven fields,then select a detective for the van.seniority is a factor in selecting among applicants a college degree is not a prerequisite.
abrams performance reports 
abrams has unsuccessfully sought to join the van since.he has received various reasons for his continued,including that he had a history of poor performance evaluations with regard to written reports.while at the state police training academy in,abrams underperformed in areas including report writing,knowledge of the penal code,and criminal investigations.when placed in his first assignment out of the academy,however,performance reports indicated that abrams had made a concerted effort and overcame these problems.ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for through.in,abrams was transferred to the edmcu,where his report writing met with differing reviews he received occasional criticism from some supervisors,while others either noted improvement or offered positive evaluations.ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to ex.h,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to.
perhaps the most salient of these performance evaluations were those given by sergeant thomas wakely,who supervised abrams from to prior to and during much of the period relevant to this case.although wakely rated abrams communication skills which include report writing as unsatisfactory in his spring evaluation,he noted in a late evaluation that abrams skills were improving.compare ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for april to june,with ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to.the improving evaluations continued in early spring,when wakely again noted improvement and rated abrams report writing as satisfactory.ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to.notwithstanding a late spring evaluation in which wakely noted that abrams needed improvement in his report writing,abrams upward trend continued through when wakely was replaced by sergeant sean cox as abrams supervisor.ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for april to may ex,trooper perf.eval.and observ.for to.
applicants selected to the van over abrams,to 
during his tenure at edmcu,abrams was one of no more than three black detectives and was the only one to ever express interest in joining the van.from through,the time period relevant to abrams claims,all eight detectives selected for and assigned to the van were white.although some of these detectives had a college degree,which abrams lacked,abrams had more training and seniority than each of the detectives selected above him.the detectives respective qualifications are summarized briefly 
detective leitkowski,assigned in,possessed special forensic drawing and crime scene diagramming skills.
detective mcfadden,assigned in,possessed strong investigatory skills and excellent report writing according to turner,who recommended him.
detective payette,assigned in,had strong technical investigatory and electronic equipment skills,and a college degree.when wakely spoke to about payette selection over abrams,whom wakely had recommended,noted that payette would fit in better and noted his college degree.
detective vining,assigned in,was the only woman in the van,had skills related to crimes on children and forensic interviewing of children,and had a college degree in psychology.
detective lamoureux,also assigned in,had strong investigatory and interviewing skills and a college degree in criminal justice and law enforcement administration.
detective hoyt,the last detective assigned to the van in,had expertise working with other agencies and handling cases involving children and sexual assault.hoyt also had a college degree in justice and law administration.
detective cargill,assigned in,was an emergency medical technician and had strong investigatory and report writing skills.
detective kasperowski,assigned in late,held bachelor and master degrees.according to defendant cox,he also had excellent interviewing skills and success solving sexual assaults.
the fit in statements 
when a spot opened in the van in,wakely personally recommended abrams to the selection committee wakely rated abrams superior in every category and noted in a march meeting about his recommendation of abrams that abrams reports were greatly improved and fantastic.wakely dep.wakely reported that notwithstanding his recommendation of abrams,found detective payette a different applicant to be a better fit for the van than abrams.in communicating this to wakely,apparently also noted that payette had a college degree.wakely dep.during his deposition,wakely stated that it crossed his mind that better fit statement could relate to race.wakely dep.
this was not the first time such words were used by those charged with selecting van applicants to explain abrams continued rejection.for instance,at some point between and during a discussion concerning the selection committee continued decision not to assign abrams to the van,detective contre,himself a member of the van consulted during the selection process,told detective andrew matthews that abrams did not fit in.matthews dep.
abrams reports of discriminatory and retaliatory behavior 
at some point between and,abrams spoke with dps affirmative action officer barbara lynch about his concern that the selection committee was passing him over because of race.there is some dispute as to what lynch told abrams,but at the very least he felt that she would not take action.as a result,he never filed a complaint with her.instead,in april,abrams filed a complaint with the connecticut commission on human rights and opportunities chro,alleging that dps discriminated and retaliated against him by assigning detective mcfadden and another white detective to the van instead of him.at some point shortly thereafter,fields ordered and turner to allow abrams to ride with the van abrams was called several times,but he was either in class or on vacation and did not ride until the morning of june.that morning,the van members went to breakfast together after leaving a crime scene.in his deposition,abrams stated that the other detectives on the van made him feel like he did not belong.abrams dep.he was not called to ride again.
on september,abrams filed another chro complaint alleging retaliation and a hostile work environment.he specifically mentioned the june incident,stating that his fellow detectives gave him the feeling that he did belong at the crime scene,and that they had to tolerate him which gave him the feeling that this was a hostile environment.ex,comm.human rights and opportunities work environment complaint.after abrams filed this chro complaint,legal affairs and fields instructed turner that he had to keep his distance basically,that he should not have contact with the abrams.turner dep.because turner ceased speaking with abrams,he did not receive information about abrams continued interest in being on the van,and he would not have reach ed out to abrams to ask him to join the van had he known of abrams interest.turner dep.turner stopped considering abrams for vacancies on the van turner dep.at,including the vacancy ultimately filled by detective cargill,whom abrams matched in skill set emergency medical technician and education,and exceeded in seniority and training.turner dep.
abrams filed several more complaints.a november chro complaint alleged discrimination and retaliation on the basis that abrams was not being assigned to participate in investigations.in march,abrams sent a letter to the commissioner of the state police alleging discrimination and a hostile work environment.in december,abrams filed a chro complaint alleging discrimination and harassment.
as mentioned before,cox replaced wakely as abrams supervisor in and.abrams felt that that cox his reports,made unnecessary corrections,and inappropriately talked with other detectives about abrams cases instead of discussing them with abrams directly.because of this,in,abrams filed a complaint against cox with the dps affirmative action office,which was found to be unsubstantiated a chro complaint was never filed against cox 
abrams reassignment to casino unit 
in may,detectives in abrams troop complained to cox that abrams made them feel uncomfortable at work.cox forwarded emails from those detectives to his superiors.later that month,approximately five months after abrams last chro complaint,fields held a meeting with dps lawyers,departmental supervisors,and human resources personnel.at the end of the meeting,fields decided to reassign abrams to the casino unit,pending an investigation of the complaints against him.at the casino unit,abrams retained his title,his status as a member of the edmcu,and his salary,but he no longer participated in major crime investigations his casino unit work largely consisted of background checks and his commute doubled.
in december,abrams was transferred back to major crimes,but assigned to troop c in tolland instead of troop k in colchester,where he had worked before his transfer.he remains in tolland.
the instant action 
on april,abrams filed suit under title vii and,asserting that defendants discriminated against him based on his race and retaliated against him by continuing to reject his applications to the van and by sending him to the casino unit.on march,the district court chatigny,granted defendants motions for summary judgment as to the title vii discrimination claim and the claims.the district court also granted defendants summary judgment as to abrams title vii retaliation claim regarding his assignment to the casino unit.only one claim survived for trial abrams title vii retaliation claim against dps for denial of assignment to the van after his chro complaints.following a three day trial kornmann,a jury found for dps.abrams now challenges both the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants and the judgment in favor of defendant dps after trial.we affirm in part and deny in part the district court order of summary judgment,affirm the jury verdict,and remand for further consideration in keeping with this opinion.
discussion 
title vii discrimination claim against dps and equal protection clause claim against individual 
courts analyze title vii discrimination claims under the framework set forth by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green.under mcdonnell douglas,a plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination it is then the defendant burden to proffer a legitimate reason for its actions the final and ultimate burden is on the plaintiff to establish that the defendant reason is in fact pretext for unlawful discrimination.bickerstaff vassar,cir.
a plaintiff presents a prima facie case when he establishes that he belonged to a protected class that he was qualified for the position he sought that he suffered an adverse employment action and that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.holcomb iona,cir.it is undisputed that abrams has successfully shown elements,and as an africanamerican he is a member of a protected class he was qualified to be in the van and because all the detectives assigned to the van were white,the circumstances permit an inference of discrimination.
thus,to make out a prima facie case,the only remaining issue is the third element that is,whether abrams suffered a materially adverse change in employment.the district court called this element a close case and avoided resolving the matter conclusively because it determined that even had abrams made out a prima facie case,he could not establish pretext at the final step of the mcdonnell douglas analysis.abrams,d at.neither party has argued in their briefs before us that,on the record before the district court,we should decide that which the district court assumed that denying abrams an appointment to the van constituted an adverse employment action.see appellant br.appellee br.we too assume arguendo that abrams has made out a prima facie case 
defendants put forth legitimate reasons that abrams was not selected for the van he unlike five of the eight others selected did not have a college education all members were selected for their specific skills or talent in investigation,report writing,or strong evaluations,and abrams was not similarly situated to those selected and abrams had ongoing problems with report writing.
this brings us to the final part of the mcdonnell douglas analysis,the point where abrams case failed on summary judgment.the district court found,in relevant part,that abrams had failed to produce sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a reasonable inference of discrimination.abrams,d at.central to this finding,however,was the court exclusion of two statements proffered by abrams contre comment to matthews that abrams did not fit in with the other van members contre statement and comment to wakely that payette would fit in better than abrams statement collectively the fit in statements.id.at.the court excluded these statements on the basis that they were inadmissible hearsay and further stated that there is insufficient evidence to permit a finding that fitting in referred to plaintiff race.id.both of these conclusions were erroneous.
as to the hearsay issue,neither statement is presented for the truth of the matter contained therein the issue before the court was emphatically not whether abrams was or was not a good fit,but whether those statements were made,and whether they concerned abrams.see.c.as neither of those factors is disputed,the statements are not hearsay and are admissible 
the second question is whether these statements support a reasonable inference of discrimination.this question is crucial to abrams case as none of the other evidence proffered by passes muster.it strikes us as somewhat ironic,that while the court correctly excluded wakely sense of what the statement he heard implied,the court did not consider that wakely impression itself bespeaks of an inference that a jury could reasonably make.in fact,the court seemed to struggle with the conflicting inferences wakely and matthews drew from these comments and discussed in their depositions while matthews did not believe contre was referring to race,it did cross wakely mind that could be referring to race.abrams,d at indeed,the court acknowledgement of the differing opinions of matthews and wakely belies the court ultimate finding that no question of fact could exist in the mind of a reasonable juror on the issue of pretext.
wakely and matthews impressions,while illustrative here,are not isolated.the fifth circuit expressed similar concerns with fit in phrasing when it was proffered by an employer at the second stage of mcdonnell douglas analysis 
in fact,the explanation given by the employer,that employee was not sufficiently suited for the position even including supervisor belief that she would not fit in does not necessarily qualify as a nondiscriminatory reason.after all,a hiring official subjective belief that an individual would not fit in or was not sufficiently suited for a job is at least as consistent with discriminatory intent as it is with nondiscriminatory intent the employer just might have found the candidate not sufficiently suited because of a protected trait such as age,race,or engaging in a protected activity.we hold as a matter of law that justifying an adverse employment decision by offering a and nonspecific statement,such as that a candidate is not sufficiently suited for the position,is not specific enough to meet a defendant employer burden of production under mcdonnell douglas.it is,at bottom,a.
patrick ridge,cir.
while in this case we apply the rationale to the third mcdonnell douglas factor of pretext,the underlying reasoning holds the phrasing better fit or fitting in just might have been about race and when construing the facts in a light most favorable to the party,those phrases,even when isolated,could be enough to create a reasonable question of fact for a jury.it is enough of an ambiguity to create a reasonable question of fact.
moreover,the district court erred in relying on byrnie town of cromwell,board of education in excluding the fit in statements,cir t he plaintiff credentials would have to be so superior to the credentials of the person selected for the job that no reasonable person,in the exercise of impartial judgment,could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job in question.internal quotation marks omitted.abrams to the van as well as the fit in statements make this a case about more than mere discrepancy in qualifications as was the case in byrnie.the fit in statements raise a genuine dispute as to whether the proffered reasons for abrams to the van were pretextual.
finally it is worth noting that defendants reasons for not selecting abrams particularly their citation to his poor writing reviews and lack of a college education are questionable the poor writing reviews,for example,are largely from his time in police training many years earlier,and varied considerably after that and more than of persons selected for the van did not have a college education.
balancing all of these factors,we see this as a very close case,and one,when considered in the light most favorable for the party as it must be that is simply too close to call and should be a question for a jury.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to defendants on abrams title vii discrimination claim against dps and because the analysis is parallel under abrams equal protection clause claim,we vacate this decision as well and reinstate the relevant individual defendants.
title vii retaliation for casino unit assignment claim 
retaliation under title vii is also measured under the mcdonnell douglas analysis.hicks baines,cir.the district court found that although abrams had made out a prima facie case of retaliation for his reassignment to the casino unit by dps,he could not provide sufficient evidence of temporal proximity to prove pretext.abrams,d at.
the timing is this within five months of abrams filing his fourth and final chro complaint in november,he was reassigned to the casino unit by fields,in or about may of.upon being transferred,abrams was no longer able to do any major crime investigations,but instead was relegated to performing ministerial tasks such as background checks.not only was abrams doubled from his prior work assignment,but he was no longer eligible for overtime.while temporal proximity must be very close,clarkcounty sch.dist.breeden,per curiam internal quotation marks omitted,there is no bright line to define the outer limits beyond which a temporal relationship is too attenuated to establish a causal relationship between the exercise of a federal constitutional right and an allegedly retaliatory action,gormanbakos cornell coop.extension of schenectady county,cir.though five months might be enough to establish a prima facie case,temporal proximity alone is not enough to establish pretext in this circuit.see el sayed hilton hotels,cir the temporal proximity of events may give rise to an inference of retaliation for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation under title vii,but without more,such temporal proximity is insufficient to satisfy appellant burden to bring forward some evidence of pretext.indeed,a plaintiff must come forward with some evidence of pretext in order to raise a triable issue of fact.internal citations omitted.abrams has alleged nothing beyond temporal proximity to establish pretext.accordingly,we affirm the district court decision to find for defendants on the title vii retaliation related to abrams transfer to the casino unit.
qualified immunity defenses as to individual defendants 
a decision dismissing a claim based on qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage may only be granted when a court finds that an official has met his or her burden to demonstrate that no rational jury could conclude that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.ashcroft alkidd,internal quotation marks omitted.under prong two,a g overnment official conduct violates clearly established law when,at the time of the challenged conduct,the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.id.at internal alterations and quotation marks omitted.the question is not what a lawyer would learn or intuit from researching case law,but what a reasonable person in the defendant position should know about the constitutionality of the conduct.young.county of fulton,cir.finally,we do not consider the subjective intent,motives,or beliefs of the officials.ex rel.blumenthal crotty,cir citation omitted.instead,we use an objective standard for judging the actions of state and federal officials.coollick hughes,cir.
because the district court granted defendants summary judgment on the equal protection clause claim,it did not reach the issue of whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on that claim.in light of our decision today,which vacates the district court dismissal of the equal protection
