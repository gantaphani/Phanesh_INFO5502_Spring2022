this case is before us on appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of el día,el día,against,puerto rico department of consumer affairs and the secretary of consumer affairs in his official capacity collectively,daco.the judgment declares that article of daco regulation is unconstitutional insofar as it impermissibly restricts commercial speech entitled to first amendment protection.el día,dep t of consumer affairs,d.
background 
el día is a puerto rico corporation that publishes el nuevo día,a newspaper of general circulation in puerto rico.daco is an administrative agency of the commonwealth of puerto rico whose stated mission is to defend and implement the rights of the consumer,to restrain the inflationary trends as well as to establish and inspect price control s over goods and services laws ann.
on october,daco adopted regulation the regulation,entitled regulations governing misleading practices and advertising,for the stated purpose of protecting consumers from fraudulent or deceptive advertisement of goods and services offered in commerce in puerto rico,and to proscribe certain misleading practices connected therewith.see daco reg.the regulation applies to all persons dedicated to offering goods and services to consumers,on their own or through a representative,agent,intermediary or as a representative agent in puerto rico,including all persons engaged in the business of advertising or in similar activity.id.certified translation.various specific advertising and merchandising practices are proscribed as deceptive or misleading to the consumer,id,and thus the regulation attempts to establish a comprehensive set of rules as to the manner and content of commercial advertisements,id.
as part of this regulatory scheme,article requires that 
any advertiser in puerto rico,who is interested in broadcasting one or more advertisements in puerto rico,must previously deposit with daco a thousand dollar bond to cover the imposition of fines for any noncompliance with the provisions,orders and resolutions of these regulations,as well as any pertinent legal remedy in favor of the consumers.
the posting of the required bond entails voluntarily surrendering to the jurisdiction of daco and of the general court of justice of the commonwealth of puerto rico.
this provision is intended to provide daco with an enforcement mechanism for fines imposed against nonresident advertisers who violate the substantive requirements of the regulation.see defendant statement of uncontested material facts para,el día.
article goes on to require a ny resident intermediary in puerto rico to make sure,before broadcasting an advertisement in puerto rico,that the advertiser has posted the required bond,daco reg.art.b,and allows resident intermediaries,like el día,to comply with their responsibility under this regulation by assuming the advertiser responsibility with respect to the posting of the required bond,id.art.c.one bond suffices to cover all of the advertisements that an intermediary publishes for an unlimited number of nonresident advertisers.id.
violation of the regulation can result in the imposition of civil penalties up to,and may lead to the filing of a criminal action by daco id.although the regulation appears to have been enforced with sporadic vigor,there are several instances in which daco imposed,or sought to impose,civil fines upon el día for alleged infractions of article.daco sent notices of infraction to el día for failure to determine whether a nonresident advertiser had secured the required bond in may,imposing a fine on august,imposing a fine and on october,imposing a fine.see defendant statement of uncontested material facts paras.el día was also fined for failing to respond to daco inquiry about whether a bond had been secured by the nonresident purchaser of an advertisement el día published on september.see id.para.
proceedings 
following the october,notice of infraction,el día filed an action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico challenging article bond requirement for nonresident advertisers and its requirement that resident intermediaries act as guarantors of the bonds el día sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the declaratory judgment act,and the civil rights act of,arguing that article violated the first and fourteenth amendments,the privileges and immunities clause,and the commerce clause of the constitution of the united states.after various procedural skirmishes between the parties and extensive discovery,cross motions for summary judgment were filed.the district court referred these to a magistrate judge,and ultimately adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its opinion and order granting summary judgment in favor of el día.
the district court concluded,and we agree,that no material issues of fact were in dispute,and that only legal questions remained to be resolved.thus,a classic case for disposition by summary judgment was presented.see.in adopting the substance of the magistrate judge reasoning,the district court concluded that the regulation violates the first amendment because it fails the test for commercial speech restrictions established in central hudson gas electric public service commission,d in that case,the supreme court stated that when commercial speech is entitled to first amendment is,when it concerns lawful activity and is not can only be limited if the restriction is in support of a substantial government interest,directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.id.at.
echoing the conclusions of the magistrate judge,the district court found that,although the first central hudson prong was met,article bond requirement failed to meet the second prong.the district court found that daco had failed to provide evidence that the harms it sought to avoid with article are real.moreover,article provided ineffective and remote support to the asserted governmental interest of protecting consumers.el día,d at.because it found that the second central hudson prong was not met,the district court determined that it was unnecessary to decide whether article complied with the third prong.id.we focus our attention,as the parties did on appeal,on the second and third prongs.
ii.discussion 
this is a case of first impression,as we are unaware of any other federal or state regulation in the united states that restricts the exercise of first amendment rights in the manner utilized by article of the regulation nonetheless,the unique nature of a restriction on expression will not cause it to run afoul of the first amendment.in the instant case,the regulation fails because it does not meet the requirements set out in central hudson for valid restrictions on commercial speech.
we note at the outset that the instant case challenges the bond requirement on first amendment grounds.accordingly,daco reliance on hawes club ecuestre el comandante,cir,is misplaced.in hawes,we upheld the united states district court for the district of puerto rico local rule requiring nonresident plaintiffs to post a bond as security against the assessment of costs,expenses,and attorney fees against equal protection and privileges and immunities clause challenges.id.at.the bond requirement in hawes was not a restriction of the right of expression,and was not challenged on first amendment grounds.it was therefore not evaluated under the standards required for commercial speech restrictions after central hudson.instead,because the right of access to the courts was not deemed a fundamental right that could be abridged only in support of a compelling government interest,the rule discrimination between residents and nonresidents was evaluated for a rational basis.id.at.the reasoning of hawes is accordingly inapplicable in the first amendment context.
in addition,the balance of interests involved with the district of puerto rico bond requirement,and similar rules in other jurisdictions,see,id.at,is dramatically different from the instant case.the bond in hawes was not required of nonresidents wishing to engage in commercial expression,but rather of nonresidents wishing to hale puerto rico residents into the federal courts of that district,forcing the latter to incur significant expenses.where the resident defendant prevailed,the costs of litigation would ordinarily have been taxed against the nonresident plaintiff.see.d.because of the likelihood that funds would need to be collected from a nonresident plaintiff,the risk of harm from unenforceability was,accordingly,higher in hawes.conversely,the nature of the restriction was more narrowly tailored,insofar as the rule permitted the district court to waive the bond requirement when it would be so excessive as to preclude a plaintiff right to sue.no such waiver is available under article to nonresident advertisers or their resident intermediaries.
central hudson test 
the parties agree that this case involves commercial speech,which is defined as expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.central hudson,at.although commercial speech is generally entitled to less protection under the first amendment than other forms of speech,it nonetheless has a claim to safekeeping from unwarranted government intrusion.see.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d.article of the regulation clearly represents such an intrusion as to el día,and,as we will explain,as to its nonresident because it fails to meet the second and third prongs of the central hudson test.
advancing governmental interest 
in order to satisfy the second prong of central hudson,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restrictions will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.edenfield fane,d.m ere speculation or conjecture is insufficient to fulfill these requirements.id.at.
we agree with the district court that daco fails to meet this standard the record lacks evidence that support the allegations that the harms article is intended to remedy are real,and the bond requirement provides only ineffective and remote support for daco asserted purpose of enforcing the consumer protections contained in the regulation.el día,d at.
demonstration of harms 
daco alleges that the harm article prevents is difficulty enforcing the regulation consumer protections against nonresident advertisers.article addresses this harm,according to daco,by providing a mechanism for in personam jurisdiction over,and funds for the payment of fines or damages charged to,advertisers who often lack assets in puerto rico.but daco has failed to provide any evidence,other than conclusory assertions,that nonresident advertisers pose a greater enforcement problem than resident advertisers,who are not subject to the bond requirement.neither has it justified the distinction drawn in article b between resident intermediaries,who must act as guarantors of their advertisers compliance with the bond requirement,and nonresident intermediaries,who are not obliged to act as guarantors 
daco argues that it need not provide empirical data to meet the second prong of central hudson,but rather that speech restrictions can be justified solely on history,consensus,and simple common sense.florida bar went for it,d quoting burson freeman,d.the supreme court recognized in florida bar,however,that the government burden is not met when a state offer s no evidence or anecdotes in support of its restriction id.emphasis in original explaining finding of first amendment violation in edenfield.that is exactly the case here.
the only available evidence concerning the regulation enforcement directly contradicts daco assertion that it might have difficulty enforcing the regulation against nonresident advertisers.daco estimates that it imposed approximately fines against resident advertisers for violations of the regulation between march and july,although it was able to collect on only.see defendant answers to plaintiff supplementary set of interrogatories at,el día.in contrast,there was no evidence of difficulty enforcing fines levied against nonresident advertisers.daco has no record of any resolution or adjudication requiring execution of a bond posted by a nonresident advertiser or a resident intermediary.see defendant answers to plaintiff first set of interrogatories at,el día.plainly,daco has failed to demonstrate that the harm it seeks to avoid with article is real.
evidence of material effect 
a regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.central hudson,at.thus,even if there were a documented enforcement problem with regard to nonresident advertisers,daco would still have to demonstrate that article has a material effect thereon.
aside from article,the regulation is facially applicable to both resident and nonresident advertisers it is aimed at protecting puerto rico consumers from false advertisements and illicit merchandising practices regardless of who engages in such actions or where they originate.nevertheless,it is mostly unenforced against a large segment of the nonresident advertising trade,and the resident intermediaries therefor.daco was able to produce records of only seven entities having obtained bonds in compliance with article,see defendant answers to plaintiff first set of interrogatories,exhibits,and it has not alleged that any additional,unrecorded bonds exist.countless other nonresident advertisers reach puerto rico residents every day,without having posted a bond,through media ranging from newspapers to satellite television to direct mail.daco,however,could identify records of only three fines having been imposed for violations of article,two of which were against el día see defendant answers to plaintiff supplementary set of interrogatories at.
there is no evidence that daco has attempted to enforce the regulation,including the provisions of article,against the vast majority of newspapers,magazines,television broadcasts,internet announcements,satellite communications,and other varieties of information media with access to consumers in puerto rico.from all of these sources,the puerto rican consumer is subjected to,and in many cases is the intended target of,commercial messages directly from nonresident advertisers.many of these messages are broadcast within puerto rico via nonresident intermediaries to whom article b resident intermediary requirements do not apply and against whom article d prohibition on broadcasting has not been enforced.meanwhile,daco issued well over three hundred fines for violating the regulation to resident advertisers in a single period of.
thus,article imposes no restraint on the resident advertisers who are the principal violators of the regulation,nor does it improve daco apparently limited ability to enforce the fines levied against resident violators.neither has article restrained nonresident intermediaries,through which myriad advertisements reach puerto rico residents every day.finally,the bulk of incoming advertising traffic remains de facto unsupervised due to daco failure to enforce compliance with article bond requirement.article,therefore,has no material effect on daco ability to enforce the other provisions of the regulation.
narrow tailoring 
although we are dealing with commercial speech,the first amendment mandates that speech restrictions be narrowly drawn.central hudson,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the regulatory technique may extend only as far as the interest it serves.id.the bond requirement has a direct discriminatory effect against nonresident advertisers,who must have the resources to obtain a bond before they can engage in commercial speech in puerto rico.in effect,it penalizes protected commercial speech preemptively,on the possibility that some commercial speech may be subject to proscription under the regulation.moreover,article places a heavy burden on resident intermediaries,who must either post a bond or forego advertising revenue from those nonresidents unwilling or unable to supply the bond.resident intermediaries like el día are forced,thereby,to serve as guarantors of their nonresident advertisers compliance
