discussion 
appellate jurisdiction and standard of review 
we first must address our jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal of the district court denial of cresciullo,morriss,and villareal motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.
although the denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally not appealable,an exception applies where,as here,the challenged denial is based on the rejection of qualified immunity.distiso cook,cir.however,s uch a denial is appealable only to the extent that resolution of the qualified immunity defense turns on issues of law.id.accordingly,a defendant who raises a qualified immunity defense may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.johnson jones,accord distiso,at.that is to say,determinations of evidentiary sufficiency at summary judgment are not immediately appealable if what is at issue in the sufficiency determination is nothing more than whether the evidence could support a finding that particular conduct occurred.salim proulx,cir alteration omitted ellipsis in alim quoting behrens pelletier.

in this case,the district court denied the individual defendants motion for summary judgment based on the existence of genuine disputes of fact.with respect to royal crown first amendment retaliation claim,the district court concluded that there is an issue of fact as to whether defendants retaliated against plaintiff by suspending and then revoking plaintiff day care permit because of the letter plaintiff wrote to senator golden.special app x at see also royal crown i,wl,at as the court held at the july argument,plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that defendants suspension of their day care permit was motivated by retaliatory animus.with regard to royal crown substantive due process claim,the court decided that a jury could reasonably find that defendants decision to suspend royal crown permit was motivated by retaliatory animus and was therefore irrational.royal crown i,wl,at.
on this interlocutory appeal,we do not have jurisdiction to review those portions of the district court decisions in which it concluded that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that defendants acted based on retaliatory animus.see johnson,at,distiso,at salim,at.however,the individual defendants argue on appeal that,even accepting as true royal crown allegations concerning defendants retaliatory motivation,they are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of la
