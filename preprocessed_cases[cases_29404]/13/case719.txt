shah mckenney pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.he was sentenced under the armed career criminal act acca,id.e,to the minimum sentence of fifteen years.his sentencing appeal raises two issues.the first is whether a state conviction for conspiracy to violate a state controlled substances law by agreeing to possess with intent to deliver cocaine is a conviction for an offense under state law,involving manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance and is therefore a serious drug offense within the meaning of the acca,id.e a ii.this question is a novel one in this circuit,but ultimately not a difficult one,and we answer it in the affirmative.mckenney other challenge is based on a constitutional argument that this court has already rejected.we affirm.
mckenney was federally indicted in january under g on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.a month later,the government filed an information under the acca alleging that mckenney previously had been convicted in rhode island of three serious drug offenses.the first and third convictions,one in and one in,were for the manufacture and delivery of a controlled substance.the second,in,was for conspiracy to violate the state controlled substances act the government alleged that each offense was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding ten years,and that mckenney sentence for each had been at least ten years mostly suspended.mckenney challenges only the use of the second offense as a predicate offense under the acca we describe that offense briefly.mckenney was convicted under laws,which makes it a crime to conspire to violate any provision of the state controlled substances act.a person who conspires to violate that act is subject to the same punishment as that prescribed for the substantive offense he or she conspired to commit.id.here,that substantive offense was possess ion with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.id.a.at the state court plea hearing at which mckenney pled nolo contendere to,inter alia,the conspiracy offense,the prosecutor stated with respect to the conspiracy count that mckenney,along with two others did unlawfully conspire to violate the rhode island uniform controlled substance act by agreeing to possess,with intent to deliver,an amount of cocaine.the transcript shows that mckenney admitted that those facts,as stated by the prosecutor,were true.this offense was punishable by a maximum term exceeding ten years 
mckenney argument is based on the fact that under rhode island law,a defendant may be guilty under without having committed an overt act from this,mckenney appears to argue two positions,somewhat at odds with each other.the first is that unless the drug conspiracy conviction itself requires an overt act,the acca definition is not met.the second is that any old overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy will not do it must be an overt act of manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute the drugs.we reject both arguments as inconsistent with the text and structure of the acca definition of a serious drug offense,e a ii.
mckenney argues that his conspiracy conviction does not constitute a serious drug offense under the acca,because he did not admit,and the rhode island court did not find,that he actually possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it and that the mere fact that he agreed to possess with intent to deliver cocaine is not enough to make his offense one involving possession with intent to distribute mckenney preserved his argument,which is a legal one we review it de novo.united states moore,cir.we conclude that mckenney interpretation is too narrow.the conspiracy,as indicted and admitted,was enough under the acca 
drug conspiracy conviction as an acca predicate offense 
the acca provides that a person who violates g and has three prior convictions for serious drug offenses committed on separate occasions shall be imprisoned not less than fifteen years.e.the definition of serious drug offense has two for offenses under federal law,id.e a i,and one for offenses under state law,id.e a ii the latter of which is relevant here t he term serious drug offense means an offense under state law,involving manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance,for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law id.
the starting point is,of course,the text of the statute.congress used the term involving the manufacture,distribution,or possession of,with intent to distribute,a controlled substance.by using involving,congress captured more offenses than just those that are in fact the manufacture,distribution,or possession of,with intent to distribute,a controlled substance.
mckenney argument effectively amounts to defining the statutory term involv es as meaning has as an element.mckenney first resort is to the dictionary and to what he says is the common meaning of the word involve to include or to contain as a part.this narrow definition of involve is certainly one found in dictionaries.see,the american heritage dictionary ed to contain as a part include webster third new international dictionary to have within or as part of itself,contain,or include.
that is not,however,the only definition.to involve also means to relate closely,webster,supra,at,or to connect closely,american heritage,supra,at.this broader definition is more consistent with the natural reading of the text.dodd united states,d see also id.citing webster.mckenney argument requires,to say the least,an awkward and unusual construction of the text to mean that a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute does not involve possession with intent to distribute.conspiracies involve their objects,as that term is used in common parlance.
the government argues that the acca structure reflects congress intent that,in e a ii,involv es mean something other than is or has as an element.in particular,the government observes,congress defined the violent felony category of acca predicate offenses using language that distinguishes between involves and is or has as an element.see id.e a violent felony is a predicate offense id.e b defining violent felony as any crime carrying certain penalties which has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another emphases added see also taylor united states,d distinguishing between a crime that has as an element a given characteristic and one that,in a particular case,involves that characteristic.the government argues that this indicates that congress likewise intended the word involv es in the serious drug offense category,which is codified in the very same statutory subsection,to mean something broader than is or has as an element.see bennett city of holyoke,cir reading statute as a whole and noting that subsection overall structure indicates the drafters intent.indeed,the fourth circuit in united states brandon,cir,declined to interpret involving in the serious drug offense provision as meaning has as an element,and instead noted that the statutory subsection should be read expansively.id.at.we agree.
three of our sister circuits have reached,in the closely analogous context of the inchoate crime of attempt,the same conclusion as we do.in each case,the circuit court held that attempted possession with intent to distribute does involve possession with intent to distribute and therefore qualifies as a serious drug offense under the acca.see united states winbush,cir united states alexander,united states king,cir.
we agree with the second circuit analysis that t he word involving has expansive connotations,and it must be construed as extending the focus of e beyond the precise offenses of distributing,manufacturing,or possessing,and as encompassing as well offenses that are related to or connected with such conduct.ki
