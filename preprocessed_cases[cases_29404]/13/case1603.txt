the word kosher has been part of the vernacular for some time as a synonym for correct,genuine,or legitimate.see oxford english dictionary.its original meaning,however,lies in the jewish law of kashrut,the hebrew noun from which kosher is derived.kashrut encompasses the entire body of rules relating to foods that may be consumed as well as to the preparation of such foods.the hebrew national company,a purveyor of kosher hot dogs and other kosher food products,has long marketed its goods with the slogan,w e answer to a higher authority.hebrew national.in new york,the principal authority to which it answers is the state department of agriculture and markets,which is charged with the enforcement of the new york statutes prohibiting intentional fraud in the sale of kosher food.whether those statutes are violative of the first amendment command that the states shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,is the question before us on this appeal.
rabbi luzer weiss,director of the kosher law enforcement division of the new york state department of agriculture and markets the department,and appeal from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gershon,declaring that new york agriculture markets law sections,and,and the challenged laws on their face violate the establishment clause of the first amendment,and enjoining the department from enforcing those provisions.the challenged laws are some of new york statutory provisions aimed at preventing fraud in the kosher food industry.are commack kosher meats,commack kosher,an entity in commack,long island engaged in the meat business,and its owners,brian and jeffrey yarmeisch collectively,the yarmeisches.over the last sixteen years,the yarmeisches have been cited for violations of new york kosher fraud laws on at least four occasions.
in january,the yarmeisches brought this action,claiming that the challenged laws violate the establishment clause of the first amendment by defining kosher to mean food that is prepared in accordance with the orthodox hebrew religious requirements.see,agric.mkts.law,mckinney.the yarmeisches also asserted a free exercise claim in which they contended that the challenged laws deprive jewish consumers of kosher food products of their first amendment right to the free exercise of religion.additionally,the yarmeisches claimed that the challenged laws are unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process,and that,by reason of their irregular and arbitrary enforcement,they violate due process as applied.lastly,the yarmeisches sought to enjoin the department from disseminating information concerning future violations of the challenged laws until after an alleged offender is prosecuted and found guilty.after both sides moved for summary judgment,the district court granted the yarmeisches motion,holding that the challenged laws on their face violate the establishment clause.the court found that the challenged laws excessively entangle the state and religion because,in order to be enforced,the laws require the department to refer to orthodox hebrew religious requirements,and the laws have the impermissible effect of advancing orthodox judaism by requiring vendors of food products labeled kosher to conform to orthodox kosher standards and thereby cause consumers of such products to purchase only products that are kosher under the orthodox definition.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
i.the facts 
the yarmeisches received their first civil citation for transgressing new york kosher fraud laws following an inspection of their store by the department on july.the department inspector,max goldgrab,seized for testing a package of veal spareribs that was labeled soaked and salted.the department analysis revealed that selected surface tissues of the spareribs do not contain added salt and thus that commack kosher was in violation of new york kosher fraud laws.in a letter responding to the citation,the yarmeisches claimed that commack kosher has always soaked and salted all the meats that state that they are soaked and salted.if this does not meet with the hebrew orthodox religious requirements we need to know what the analysis was and what the standards should be.despite this assertion,the yarmeisches did not formally challenge the violation and paid a civil penalty fine in the amount of.
the department inspected commack kosher again on january,and found another violation of new york kosher fraud laws.this time the department seized two packages of beef chuck side steaks,each of which was marked soaked and salted.the department laboratory analysis did not reveal a significantly greater salt content in the outside surface of the steak than in the inside.the department asserted that h ad the steak been properly soaked and salted,the analysis would have indicated that the outside surface of the steak had a measurably higher salt content than the inner part of the meat.the department therefore concluded that t he defendant steak was not soaked and salted according to orthodox hebrew religious requirements and was improperly offered for sale and represented as such.accordingly,the department alleged violations of new york agriculture and markets law section,which prohibits the sale of any food product represented to be kosher that has not been prepared in accordance with the orthodox hebrew religious requirements,as well as section,which contains a similar prohibition.agric.mkts.law.the yarmeisches responded to the claimed violations in a letter dated april,which contained the following explanation of their soaking and salting method 
we take the side steak with the top and bottom fat left on the meat and soak it in water for one half hour,salt for one hour,and then rinse thoroughly.we then proceed to remove the fat and then face the meat remove dark meat before packaging.
this is the procedure for all meat that is labeled soaked and salted,all of which is done under the direction of rabbi berman who has been supervising this establishment for approximately five years.
rabbi berman is a rabbi who adheres to the teachings of the conservative branch of judaism.the yarmeisches letter further explained that they believed their procedures for soaking and salting were in accordance with kosher requirements and requested that the department explain how any problem with their procedures can be rectified.the department did not directly respond to their inquiry,but instead filed a verified civil complaint against the yarmeisches.ultimately,the yarmeisches paid a civil penalty fine as punishment for the violation.
after a third inspection of commack kosher in april,the department quarantined lamb tongues on the ground that the tongues had not been properly soaked and salted.the specific allegation of wrongdoing was that the tongues were found soaking in a solution of salt water,which is improper preparation that render ed the tongues irreversibly non kosher.the yarmeisches challenged the department decision,stating that the tongues were properly soaked and salted as certified by their supervising rabbi.the department countered with a letter to the yarmeisches claiming that,in any event,the tongues had not been properly deveined in accordance with orthodox hebrew requirements.the yarmeisches state that this charge is still pending,while the department says that it considers the case closed and,if any charges are still pending,it will have them dismissed.
the department inspected commack kosher again on february.a month later,the department informed the yarmeisches that by offering for sale poultry as kosher without the required markings on labels soaked and salted or not soaked and salted,the yarmeisches had violated new york agriculture and markets law section.the department letter directed the yarmeisches to submit payment of a civil penalty in the amount of within fifteen days to avoid the initiation of court proceedings against them.the yarmeisches disputed the department allegations and claimed that,at the time of inspection,the poultry at issue had not been offered to the public for sale.the department eventually withdrew the assessed violation.
ii.procedural history 
on january,about three years after their last assessed violation,the yarmeisches brought this action against the department in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.they amended their complaint on april.the yarmeisches claimed that by defining kosher to mean food that is prepared in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements,new york kosher fraud laws violate the establishment clause.the yarmeisches also brought free exercise and equal protection claims based on the allegation that the challenged laws equate kosher with orthodox hebrew religious requirements.additionally,the yarmeisches claimed that the challenged laws are unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process because they fail to define orthodox hebrew religious requirements.arguing that the challenged laws fail to provide for proper training of state inspectors with respect to koshering,therefore leading to irregular,arbitrary and capricious inspection of kosher facilities by the kosher law enforcement division,the yarmeisches claimed that,as applied,the challenged laws violate their due process rights.finally,the yarmeisches sought to enjoin the department from disseminating information concerning future violations of the challenged laws to the public until after an alleged offender is prosecuted and found guilty,because to do otherwise violates due process and causes irreparable harm.
on october,the department sought by motion to have the district court abstain from resolving the yarmeisches claims pursuant to railroad commission of texas pullman.in its motion,the department,in a contention abandoned on appeal,claimed that the meaning of kosher under the challenged laws was an unresolved issue of new york law,and thus that the court should refrain from ruling on the laws constitutionality.in an opinion and order dated december,the district court denied the motion because t he statutory provisions at issue in this case have been interpreted for decades as equating kosher with prepared in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements.commack kosher meats rubin.the court based its finding on numerous decisions of new york courts dating as far back as.see id.citing people atlas,dep t,aff,mem.noting that kosher in the kosher fraud laws was used evidently in the ordinary sense in which it is used in the trade,which is to designate meat as having been prepared under the orthodox hebrew requirements,and state glassman,misc d,county the issue in this case is whether the defendants with intent to defraud represented that their frankfurters and salami were kosher when in fact they were not because they were not prepared in accordance with the orthodox hebrew religious requirements.
the yarmeisches moved for preliminary injunctive relief on june.on june,the district court denied the motion,but the parties agreed on the record that the yarmeisches would be notified of any alleged violations of the challenged laws prior to the release of that information to the public.after the completion of discovery,on march,the intervenors moved for summary judgment on the first six claims in the yarmeisches complaint,each of which attacked the challenged laws on their face.the department moved for summary judgment on all the claims on june.also on june,the yarmeisches filed a for summary judgment on all claims.
in an opinion and order dated july,the district court granted the yarmeisches motion and declared that agric.mkts.law,a and,and,on their face violate the establishment clause and are therefore unconstitutional.commack kosher meats,rubin,d.the court began its analysis by explaining that new york kosher fraud laws equate kosher with prepared in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements,rejecting for a second time the department contention that the laws are merely registration statutes that impose no definition of kosher.id.at.the court then turned to an evaluation of the challenged laws under the test outlined in lemon kurtzman,d.the court held the challenged laws unconstitutional because they create an excessive entanglement between the state and religion and impermissibly advance religion.
in the district court view,the challenged laws create an excessive entanglement because enforcement of the laws requires reference to religious tenets not contained in the statute.see commack,d at.the court did not find an excessive entanglement simply because the challenged laws use a word of religious significance,but rather because they require the sponsorship,financial support and active involvement of new york state in the daily monitoring of the compliance of vendors of kosher products with a set of religious dietary laws,which are incorporated by reference into the challenged laws.id.at.moreover,the court explained that e ven where the challenged laws describe some specific procedures that must be followed before a product may properly be called kosher,the procedures refer back to orthodox hebrew religious requirements for example,meat shall be washed in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements by a duly ordained orthodox rabbi or by a person authorized by him.agric.mkts.id.at.
additionally,the district court held that the challenged laws represent an impermissible state advancement of religion because they require state officials to enforc e a set of religious laws,id.at,and the incorporation of orthodox kosher standards creates an impermissible symbolic union of church and state,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court therefore held that the challenged laws on their face violate the establishment clause and,accordingly,did not address the yarmeisches other claims.the district court judgment was entered on july,declaring the challenged laws unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the department from enforcing them.this appeal followed.
discussion 
new york kosher fraud statutes 
in,the new york legislature added to a penal statute prohibiting false labeling,a provision that was designed to prevent and punish fraud in the sale of kosher meats or kosher meat preparation.atlas,at.new york kosher fraud statutes presently are contained in article of the state agriculture and markets law entitled adulteration,packing,and branding of food and food products.article includes a number of provisions relating to various food items.section of article generally prohibits the sale of any article of food which is adulterated or misbranded.this case involves a constitutional challenge to the provisions of new york kosher fraud laws that define kosher as prepared in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements,mandate adherence to those requirements,or are integral to the state enforcement of such requirements.those provisions are sections,and,and.
section provides that 
a person who,with intent to defraud,sells any article of food and falsely represents the same to be kosher or kosher for passover or as having been prepared under the orthodox hebrew religious requirements is guilty of a class a misdemeanor,except that provided said meat or meat preparations in violation has a retail value in excess of five thousand dollars,a person is guilty of a class e felony

every person who sells or exposes for sale,at wholesale or retail,any kosher meat or poultry shall retain all records with respect to the origin of such kosher meat or poultry 
agric.mkts.law.
section is identical to section except that it applies to the sale of food products in hotels and restaurants.section,entitled fraudulent identification of food and food products,provides that no person shall w ilfully mark as kosher,or as,or as having been prepared in accordance with the hebrew orthodox religious requirements food or food products not kosher or not so prepared.id.section prohibits the defacement or alteration of labels affixed to food products to indicate that they are kosher or have been prepared in accordance with the hebrew orthodox religious requirements.id.section forbids the sale,possession,or disposal of any food product without its original slaughterhouse label,or any food product to which such label has been fraudulently affixed.id.
section a provides that i n the event that fresh meat or poultry is sold and delivered as kosher the meat or poultry and the bill of sale,if any,rendered at the time of delivery shall have affixed to them a label or the printed words not soaked and salted or soaked and salted as the case may be.id.section requires slaughterhouses that sell kosher food products to maintain records regarding the time,place,date,person or organization supervising the slaughter of an animal and the number of animals slaughtered in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements.id.c.
section,captioned kosher meat or poultry,provides that

lastly,section establishes a advisory board on kosher law enforcement within the department.the advisory board members are appointed by the commissioner of the department.the advisory board role under the statute is 
to advise,counsel and confer with the commissioner on matters of policy in connection with the administration and enforcement of the kosher fraud laws,to consider all matters submitted to it by the commissioner,and on its own initiative to recommend to the commissioner such changes in the kosher fraud laws as may be deemed advisable and,with the consent of the commissioner,to submit for enactment by the legislature such draft or drafts of legislation imposing such further restrictions on the possession,sale and exposure for sale of kosher meats,meat preparations and food products,as may be deemed necessary.
the provisions outlined here are not all of new york kosher fraud laws,but only those challenged by the yarmeisches and held unconstitutional by the district court 
ii.the lemon test 
as the supreme court has recently reiterated,in cases involving facial challenges on establishment clause grounds,we assess the constitutionality of an enactment by reference to the three factors first articulated in lemon kurtzman,d.santa fe.sch.dist.doe,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the lemon factors require that a challenged law have a valid secular purpose have a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion and not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.at.we treat the excessive entanglement prong as a part of our inquiry into a statute effect.agostini felton,d.we find the challenged laws do not pass constitutional muster under the lemon test because they have a primary effect that both advances and inhibits religion 
a.the entanglement factor 
here the entanglement of the state and religious authorities is extensive and contributes to a primarily religious effect.the supreme court has explained that the framers understood the first amendment prohibition on laws respecting an establishment of religion to preclude government sponsorship of religion,financial support for religion,or the active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,walz tax commission,d.like the establishment clause generally,the prohibition on excessive government entanglement with religion rests upon the premise that both religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within its respective sphere.illinois ex rel.mccollum bd.of.
it appears to us that the challenged laws excessively entangle government and religion because they take sides in a religious matter,effectively discriminating in favor of the orthodox hebrew view of dietary requirements require the state to take an official position on religious doctrine and create an impermissible fusion of governmental and religious functions by delegating civic authority to individuals apparently chosen according to religious criteria.
the department argues that the challenged laws do not excessively entangle the government with religion because no one disputes the meaning of the term kosher.there is ample evidence in the record to support the opposite conclusion.in a guide to observance of jewish dietary law,published by the united synagogue commission on jewish education,author samuel dresner notes that 
o ver the years and in varying locales,rabbinic authorities differed in their interpretations of specific laws of kashrut to cite a famous example sephardic jews eat rice and legumes on passover,ashkenazic jews do not.ashkenazic jews,by and large,do not eat the hindquarters of beef sephardic jews do.
some of the decisions regarding the laws of kashrut recorded in this book are not accepted by all authorities on jewish law,notably decisions about wine,cheese,gelatin,swordfish and sturgeon.this is not a novel situation in the history of jewish law.there have always been disagreements on various points.
samuel dresner,the jewish dietary laws.
the new jersey supreme court,in striking down its state kosher fraud laws as violative of the establishment clause,also rejected the state of new jersey claim that there is a consensus among the branches of judaism regarding the proper standards for the preparation and sale of kosher food products t here is considerable disagreement over what precepts or tenets truly represent the laws of kashrut.there are differences of opinion concerning the application and interpretation of the laws of kashrut both within orthodox judaism and between orthodox judaism and other branches of judaism.county kosher new jersey,citing herman wouk,this is my god,reprinted in the life of torah jacob neusner ed rabbi hayim halevy donin,to be a jew,rabbi david bleich,contemporary halakic problems.for example,orthodox jews of the sephardic sect adhere to glatt kosher standards that are more stringent than those followed by other orthodox jews.raphael poliakoff,what is glatt kosher,kashrus newsletter,vol.as between different branches of judaism,conservative and orthodox rabbis differ sharply on many issues such as the kosher status of wine,cheese,sturgeon,and swordfish.mark berman,kosher fraud statutes and the establishment clause are they kosher,soc.probls.it is also widely recognized that the strain between all three denominations orthodox,conservative,and reform has increased in recent years.id.
we find it indisputable that there are differences of opinion within judaism regarding the dietary requirements of kashrut.as a result,because the challenged laws interpret kosher as synonymous with the views of one branch,those of orthodox judaism,the state has effectively aligned itself with one side of an internal debate within judaism.this it may not do.as the supreme court has stated whatever else the establishment clause may mean,it certainly means at the very least that government may not demonstrate a preference for one particular sect or creed.county of allegheny aclu greater pittsburgh chapter,d.see also larson,at.the clearest command of the establishment clause is that one religious denomination can not be officially preferred over another.epperson arkansas,d government may not aid,foster,or promote one religion or religious theory against another.everson bd.of.noting that the establishment clause prohibits passage of laws that aid one religion,aid all religions,or prefer one religion over another.thus,we find that the challenged laws preference for the views of one branch of judaism excessively entangles the state with religion in violation of the establishment clause.
the challenged laws also excessively entangle the state with religion because they require new york to adopt an official state position on a point of religious doctrine.the department argues that this is not so for two reasons.first,the department claims that the challenged laws merely incorporate established trade standards that require the state to verify objective physical characteristics of food and whether food has been prepared or handled in certain ways.second,the department asserts that the intent to defraud requirement of the challenged laws eliminates the possibility that it will need to refer to religious authorities in enforcement proceedings.because the department focuses primarily on ascertaining a vendor basis for his or her good faith belief that the product being offered for sale is kosher,there is no need for the department to independently determine whether a product complies with kosher trade standards.we are unpersuaded by these contentions.
in order to assert that a food article does not conform to kosher requirements,new york must take an official position as to what are the kosher requirements.in doing so,the department must either interpret religious doctrine or defer to the interpretations of religious officials in reaching its official position.the state thus impermissibly weigh s the significance and the meaning of disputed religious doctrine,presbyterian church in the mary elizabeth blue hull mem l presbyterian church,d harlan,concurring,or employ s religious organizations as an arm of the civil government to perform the function of interpreting and applying state standards,id.at.
to illustrate,in response to their third citation,the yarmeisches filed a demand for a bill of particulars,requesting that the state set forth in detail certain orthodox hebrew religious requirements for kosher food preparation.in order to respond to this demand,state officials corresponded with various department officials seeking information regarding the proper koshering requirements.for example,a letter sent by earl roberts,assistant attorney general,to michael mccormick,assistant counsel for the department,requested assistance in responding to the yarmeisches demand and instructed mccormick that t he b ill of particulars should describe briefly each requirement of the kosherizing,deveining,soaking,salting,and rinsing and identify the code of jewish law shulhan aruch by the tractate and sections which set forth these requirements in full detail.
another letter,from aaron levine,a kosher food inspector with the department,to joan kehoe,counsel for the department,set forth the relevant sections and chapters of yoreh deah,a book of jewish laws,corresponding to the yarmeisches requests for more information regarding the kosher violations alleged against them in the verified complaint.additionally,there are letters from rabbi rubin,an orthodox rabbi who was then director of the division of kosher law enforcement,clarifying various points raised by the yarmeisches demand.for example,one letter from rabbi rubin to kehoe explains that i f members of the legal community,whether in agriculture or the attorney general office,want us to trace the origin of halacha jewish law,they should their question and ask where in the century codes of jewish law is a particular law found,rather than earlier biblical or talmudic sources.
the draft bill of particulars prepared by new york state in response to the yarmeisches request contains the following 
veins that contain forbidden blood have to be removed as indicated in section,chapter through,referred to as laws for removing veins of forbidden blood yore dayah located in shulhan aruch.
law of soaking and salting are in shulhan aruch yore dayah chapter through.
one blood vein on either side of a tongue has to be removed and the tip of a tongue has to be removed.
the yarmeisches demand for a bill of particulars merely made more obvious a fact that would have been true even without the demand for a bill of particulars.the state authorities could not make a determination that the yarmeisches meat did not conform to kosher requirements without first having arrived at an official position on what the kosher requirements are.to do so excessively entangles the state with religion.see presbyterian church,at.
we also find that the challenged laws fail the excessive entanglement inquiry because they run afoul of the core rationale underlying the establishment clause,which is preventing a fusion of governmental and religious functions.larkin,at.quoting school district of abington township schempp,d.this prohibition is violated not only by the requirement that the state adopt an official position on a matter of religious doctrine,but also by the existence and activities of the advisory board.
section of the agriculture and markets law establishes an advisory board on kosher law enforcement that is required by statute to advise,counsel and confer with the department commissioner on matters of policy in connection with the administration and enforcement of the kosher fraud laws,and on its own initiative to recommend to the commissioner such changes in the kosher fraud laws or rules,and with the consent of the commissioner,to submit for enactment by the legislature such legislation as may be deemed necessary.agric.mkts.law.
the department argues that the existence and activities of the advisory board do not conflict with the establishment clause because there is a complete absence of any board involvement in enforcement activities.the board is granted extremely broad powers to advise,counsel,and confer with the department commissioner on policy matters related to enforcement issues and even to draft and submit proposed legislation.we therefore do not find to be wholly accurate the department contention that there is a complete absence of board involvement with enforcement of the challenged laws.although members of the board do not directly participate in enforcement activities such as the actual inspection of kosher food establishments,issuance of citations,or pursuit of court action against alleged violators,we decline to take such a narrow view of the board involvement with enforcement of the challenged laws.to conclude otherwise,would be to exalt form over substance in light of the broad powers granted to the board that substantially affect enforcement of the challenged laws.
while we acknowledge that some limited and incidental entanglement between church and state authority is inevitable in a complex modern society,larkin,at,w here fusion of governmental and religious authority is an issue,the difference lies in the distinction between a government purposeful delegation on the basis of religion and a delegation on principles neutral to religion,to individuals whose religious identities are incidental to t
