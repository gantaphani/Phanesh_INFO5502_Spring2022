background 
i.the misbehavior charges 
on january,rubin sira,then incarcerated at green haven correctional facility,was served with a written misbehavior report drafted by lieutenant schneider charging him with violations of prison disciplinary rules and.rule states inmates shall not,under any circumstances make any threat,spoken,in writing,or by gesture rule provides inmates shall not lead,organize,participate,or urge other inmates to participate,in,or other actions which may be detrimental to the order of facility.b.
the report described the incident giving rise to these charges as follows 
during the course of an investigation into a planned inmate demonstration at this facility in which inmates would conduct a stoppage on or about january,inmate sira has been identified through confidential sources as having urged other inmates to participate,organized inmates to participate and threatened inmates to participate.
sira misbehavior report at.in response to specific inquiries on the report form,schneider indicated that the date of the charged incident was january,the incident time was the incident location was green haven correctional facility and no persons other than sira were involved in the incident.
the work stoppage described in sira misbehavior report was commonly referred to at green haven as the strike,a reference to its scheduled new year date.to avert the strike,prison officials had ordered an inmate lockdown beginning on december,and lasting through january.in fact,once the lockdown ended,a prison strike did occur,with many inmates refusing to follow the schedules established by correction authorities.
ii.the disciplinary hearing 
proceedings in sira presence 
to address sira charged role in the strike,a tier iii disciplinary hearing commenced on january,presided over by captain robert morton.see.at the hearing,sira pleaded not guilty to the charged offenses and moved for their dismissal on the ground that the misbehavior report did not provide him with adequate notice of the conduct at issue.specifically,he complained that the report failed to identify any person whom he had threatened or organized to indicate where in green haven the alleged misconduct had occurred and to provide clear notice of the date of his alleged misconduct,since the incident date on the report was marked january,while the body of the report suggested that the strike had occurred sometime earlier,possibly before january.sira denied urging or threatening anyone to participate in the strike and noted that he had no history of discipline problems in prison and had not missed his work assignments during the strike.further,he cited prison records showing that he was in the health services unit on the morning of january.
morton denied sira request to dismiss the charges.while acknowledging that the report was very vague with respect to the incident date that actually could mean that on january you were identified or it could mean that the investigation was conducted on the or it was concluded on the,hearing,at that green haven is a large facility housing approximately inmates,morton nevertheless concluded that the report provided sira with adequate notice of the date,time,and place of the charged conduct this misbehavior report indicates the date as january,time of incident,and place of incident,green haven correctional facility,id.at.morton stated that he would call complaining officer schneider to testify in support of the charges and to answer approved questions posed by sira.morton further advised that at some point in the proceedings,he would hear evidence outside sira presence to make a personal assessment of the credibility of the confidential sources whose information supported the disciplinary charges.id.at.
on january,schneider testified in sira presence that from shortly before the december,lock down through the month of january,prison officials had investigated the strike.from various confidential sources,the officers had learned that sira had assumed leadership of a group of dominican inmates,that he was the captain of c block,and that he had endeavored to enforce participation in the strike by threatening inmates.hearing,at.schneider stated that no source had indicated that sira had threatened any particular inmate rather,the sources disclosed that sira had made open threats to any one who would go against the strike.id.at.she did not detail the nature of these threats,nor did she indicate any dates on or about when threats or other charged conduct occurred.schneider did,however,clarify that the report reference to january at alluded to the date and time she filed the disciplinary charges,not the date and time of any misconduct.
in light of schneider testimony,sira reiterated his objection to the written notice,arguing that the january incident date on the misbehavior report was plainly inaccurate,and the reported location,green haven correctional facility,was unnecessarily general.morton again rejected sira challenge.he observed that schneider had satisfactorily explained why january,at was mistakenly noted in the report as the incident date and time.morton further concluded that the report reference to january,as the planned strike date provided sira with sufficient notice of the approximate date and time of his alleged misconduct.he also concluded that the report identification of green haven as the site of the misconduct was adequate.
confidential proceedings 
beginning on february,and continuing through february,morton heard testimony out of sira presence from schneider,kaiser,and corrections officer williams about information received from five confidential sources referred to herein as informants,each of whom implicated sira in the strike 
schneider identified informant by name as an inmate who had provided reliable information in the past that had helped prison authorities prevent the death of another inmate.informant told schneider that sometime after prison officials lifted the first december lockdown,informant had attended a strike organization meeting in building run by an inmate named codorel who discussed with those present the chaos that was to be caused during the strike and the inmates who would be in charge of strike activities in each housing block.hearing,at.codorel identified sira as the person who would enforce c block.id.at.informant did not place sira at the building meeting,nor did he report ever seeing sira participate in any activities.schneider explained that she credited informant account of the meeting because his statements with respect to other participants were consistent with information already obtained by officers in their strike investigation.
schneider identified informant as an honor block inmate who had volunteered to gather intelligence for prison authorities in order to avert the harm that would attend a strike.informant reported that sira,who was housed in block c,was one of the strike coordinators and that he met with other gang leaders at night in building and in the morning in the center to organize strike activities.informant did not have personal knowledge of these facts,nor had he ever personally witnessed sira engaging in any activities.he disclosed only what he had learned from asking around.hearing,at.apparently,morton did not ask schneider to ascertain from informant the circumstances under which or the persons from whom he had learned the facts reported to determine whether such factors supported or undermined the reliability of the hearsay disclosures.
schneider and kaiser identified informant as an inmate who had sent kaiser an unsigned letter dated december,which was received in evidence but not shared with sira.therein the author revealed,among other things,that he had overheard one unidentified prisoner telling another that he and ruben were going to take over the dominicans,letter at.ruben was described as the guy in who works with father fernando on sunday id.apparently,this sufficed to permit kaiser and schneider to identify ruben as rubin sira,although neither witness specifically testified on this point.kaiser did testify that from the use of smiley faces in the letter,he determined that the author was an inmate who had previously provided him with reliable information percent of the time.hearing,at.further,prison officials credited the letter because much of the information it disclosed with respect to anticipated conduct by other persons proved true.
schneider identified informant as an inmate who had sent a letter to superintendent artuz,which reported a meeting occurring that morning in connection with the held in.undated letter to superintendent at.the letter,which was also admitted into evidence but not disclosed to sira,identified a dozen strike organizers by name,including ruben cira of.id.in passing on the letter to subordinate officers,artuz did not disclose his source name,but he did reveal that the source had often given him reliable information in the past.schneider testified that she deemed the source credible because his letter accurately described the planning of events that thereafter transpired.here again,morton did not ask schneider to inquire how informant learned the information disclosed or even if it was based on direct knowledge or hearsay.
schneider and officer williams identified informant by name as an inmate whom williams had used in the past,with ninety percent accuracy and without any specific gains on the inmate part.hearing,at.sometime in the period december through january,informant told williams that he had personally observed sira basically coerce inmates through strong arm tactics and threats of violence to participate in certain stages of the demonstration that we witnessed here at green haven during the last months of.id.at.informant identified sira as an inmate housed on the west side of green haven,who was involved in the prison program and who was a leader of a faction of dominican inmates at the prison.williams explained that informant had provided this information to avoid the violence that he thought would result from a prison strike.apparently no effort was made to identify the inmates purportedly threatened by sira.nor were officers asked to have informant detail what he heard or saw that led him to characterize sira conduct as coercive or threatening.
morton did specifically inquire of schneider,kaiser,and officer williams whether any of the five confidential sources would agree to appear before him to testify to the information supplied.uniformly,the officers stated that the informants would not so agree because any appearance would inevitably become known throughout the prison,jeopardizing the informants safety and exposing them to reprisals.
c.the remaining open proceedings and the disciplinary ruling 
on february,the disciplinary hearing continued with sira present.once again,he protested the inadequate notice afforded by the misbehavior report.further,while conceding that he had no right to know the identity of the confidential sources who had provided information against him,sira asserted that he was entitled to know the substance of their allegations.morton adhered to his earlier ruling rejecting sira notice challenge he also refused to disclose the confidential information revealed at the ex parte hearing.
in his written disposition of the charges issued the same day,capt morton stated that based upon the initial misbehavior report,schneider testimony,and the confidential evidence,he found sira guilty of organizing inmates to participate in the charged prison demonstration,see b,rule,but not guilty of making threats,see,rule.morton sentenced sira to six months confinement in a special housing unit,effective immediately,during which time he would lose certain prison privileges relating to receipt of mail,telephone use,and commissary visits.further,morton recommended that sira lose six months credit toward his release date.
iii.administrative appeal of the disciplinary ruling 
proceeding pro se,sira appealed morton disciplinary ruling to commissioner goord,see,citing five grounds for reversal the hearing officer failure to complete the hearing within the time required by new york law the failure to provide sira with adequate notice as to the date,time,and place of the alleged misconduct the hearing officer failure to disclose information supplied by confidential sources his failure to make adequate fact findings with respect to misconduct and the insufficiency of the evidence of misconduct.acting on behalf of commissioner goord,director selsky initially affirmed the disciplinary decision in a summary ruling dated april.with the assistance of counsel,sira sought reconsideration.on september,selsky reversed the disciplinary ruling,concluding simply that the confidential evidence failed to support the charge.by that time,sira had already served his sentence in the special housing unit nevertheless,the reversal prevented him from losing credits.
iv.the federal lawsuit 
on february,sira filed this action,alleging that defendants violated his right to due process by finding him guilty based upon insufficient evidence,without providing him adequate notice of the charges,without affording him access to confidential evidence relevant to his defense,without assessing the reliability of various confidential sources of incriminating information,and without disclosing the confidential documentary evidence against him.defendants filed an answer denying the relevant allegations and moved for judgment on the pleadings based on qualified immunity,see.c.the district court converted the motion to one for summary judgment and denied it,ruling that sira had established a due process violation and that no reasonable officer could have thought otherwise.see sira morton,wl,at.defendants filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
it is settled law that a denial of summary judgment is ordinarily not a final judgment from which an appeal will lie.an exception exists,however,when government officials seek summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity,and the court denies the motion as a matter of law.see bernard county of suffolk,cir luna pico,cir kinzer jackson,cir.such an order is collateral to the merits of the underlying action and is,therefore,considered final for appellate purposes.see mitchell forsyth,d african trade info,abromaitis,cir.here,defendants appeal the district court ruling that the evidence,when viewed most favorably to sira,does not,as a matter of law,support their claim of qualified immunity.we therefore have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
ii.conversion of the motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment 
before addressing the merits of defendants qualified immunity claim,we consider their challenge to the district court order converting their motion for judgment on the pleadings,see.c,to a motion for summary judgment,see.
a.the need to convert defendants motion 
a district court must convert a motion for judgment on the pleadings to one for summary judgment if the motion includes material outside the pleadings and that material is not excluded by the court.c.in this case,defendants attached to their motion sira misbehavior report,the full transcript of the portion of his disciplinary hearing,the full transcript of the confidential portion of the hearing,the disposition ruling by morton,and director selsky reversal order.although none of these documents was attached to sira complaint or to defendants answer,defendants maintain that all were fairly incorporated into the complaint and,therefore,not outside the pleadings.
a complaint is deemed to include any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit,see.c goldman belden,cir,materials incorporated in it by reference,see cortec,sum holding,cir,and documents that,although not incorporated by reference,are integral to the complaint,chambers time warner,cir see cortec,at.here,sira complaint explicitly refers to and relies upon two of the documents at issue,the misbehavior report and the disposition sheet,see complaint,to show that sira was deprived of liberty without adequate notice of the charges against him.these documents are thus incorporated by reference into the complaint.
although the complaint does not expressly cite the reversal order,this document is also incorporated into the pleading because reversal was integral to sira ability to pursue a challenge to procedures that caused him to lose credits.see edwards balisok,d holding that prisoner who files a action challenging discipline procedures resulting in loss of credits must show that the conviction has been overturned see also heck humphrey,d explaining that reversal rule does not simply engraft an exhaustion requirement upon,but rather den ies the existence of a cause of action absent reversal.in muhammad close,d per curiam,the supreme court recently clarified that a action challenging the validity of a disciplinary sanction that does not affect the overall length of the prisoner confinement may be brought regardless of whether the sanction was overturned.but that is not this case.absent the reversal order,sira procedural challenges would necessarily have implicated the invalidity of the loss of his credits.see heck humphrey,at.accordingly,the reversal order is fairly deemed incorporated.
the hearing transcripts,however,are another matter,being neither expressly cited in the complaint nor integral to the claims raised.defendants nevertheless assert that sira paraphrasing of certain events occurring during parts of the disciplinary hearing and his single quotation of one excerpt from schneider testimony,see complaint,incorporate the whole of these transcripts by reference into the complaint.we disagree.limited quotation from or reference to documents that may constitute relevant evidence in a case is not enough to incorporate those documents,wholesale,into the complaint.see cosmas hassett,cir rejecting argument that short quotations from an annual report and statement incorporated those documents into the complaint.because the hearing transcripts were not incorporated into the complaint and because the district court did not exclude those documents from its consideration of defendants motion,we conclude that the district court was required to convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.see.c.
prejudice from the conversion 
rule c provides that when a court converts a motion for judgment on the pleadings into one for summary judgment,it shall provide all parties a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion.here,the district court did not notify the parties prior to converting the motion.defendants assert that this failure requires reversal because they were prejudicially denied an opportunity to present all pertinent material as required by rule c.here again,we disagree.
a party is deemed to have notice that a motion may be converted into one for summary judgment if that party should reasonably have recognized the possibility that such a conversion would occur.gurary winehouse,cir.by attaching to their motion extensive materials that were not included in the pleadings,defendants plainly should have been aware of the likelihood of such a conversion.see id.under such circumstances,they can not complain that they were deprived of an adequate opportunity to provide the materials they deemed necessary to support their motion.see exhibitors,stern in re books,cir.
in any event,defendants can not demonstrate prejudice.their complaint is not,after all,that judgment was entered in favor of sira without affording them a full opportunity to be heard.their complaint is that judgment was not entered in their favor.but if defendants could not establish their entitlement to qualified immunity on a presentation that supplemented the pleadings,they would certainly not have fared better had the district court ignored their attachments and treated their motion as one to dismiss.to the extent defendants submit that sua sponte conversion deprived them of the opportunity to submit affidavits or to discover evidence that might have strengthened a summary judgment motion,we note that district courts enjoy considerable discretion in entertaining successive dispositive motions.see kovacevich kent state,cir district courts may in their discretion permit renewed or successive motions for summary judgment enlow tishomingo county,cir see also wright,et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the district court has not here precluded the defendants from filing a further motion for summary judgment at the conclusion of discovery thus,we discern no prejudice from the challenged conversion warranting reversal.
iii.defendants qualified immunity claim 
a.the legal framework for qualified immunity analysis 
we review de novo the district court denial of summary judgment on defendants claim of qualified immunity.luna pico,at.summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence offered,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see cowan ex rel.estate of cooper breen,cir see also.c.
in evaluating a summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity,we perform a test.we ask first whether the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,establish a constitutional violation.see saucier katz,d.if they do not,the plaintiff may not recover because he has suffered no wrong cognizable under.see id.if the facts do establish a constitutional violation,however,we proceed to a second inquiry,asking whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.if a reasonable officer could have believed that the challenged conduct was lawful at the time of the violation,then qualified immunity bars the claim.see luna pico,at.
inmate due process claims 
the fourteenth amendment to the constitution provides that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.although prison inmates necessarily have their liberty severely curtailed while incarcerated,they are nevertheless entitled to certain procedural protections when disciplinary actions subject them to further liberty deprivations such as loss of credit or special confinement that imposes an atypical hardship.see wolff mcdonnell,d describing rights that must be afforded before revocation of credits kalwasinski morse,cir per curiam concluding atypical confinement may not be imposed without providing procedures enumerated in wolff see also luna pico,at same.given the procedural posture of this case,we assume,without deciding,that sira confinement in the special housing unit imposed an atypical hardship entitling him to due process.see generally kalwasinski morse,at discussing factors relevant to deciding if confinement in special housing unit constitutes an atypical hardship.
the due process protections afforded a prison inmate do not equate to the full panoply of rights due to a defendant in a criminal prosecution.wolff mcdonnell,at.notably,there is no right to counsel or to confrontation at prison disciplinary hearings.see id.at.nevertheless,an inmate is entitled to advance written notice of the charges against him a hearing affording him a reasonable opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence a fair and impartial hearing officer and a written statement of the disposition,including the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary actions taken.see id.at.accord luna pico,at kalwasinski morse,at.since wolff,the supreme court has clarified that judicial review of the written findings required by due process is limited to determining whether the disposition is supported by some evidence.superintendent hill,d.this standard is extremely tolerant and is satisfied if there is any evidence in the record that supports the disciplinary ruling.friedl city of new york,cir.nevertheless,as this court recently explained,the some evidence standard requires some reliable evidence.luna pico,at see taylor rodriguez,cir.
sira due process claim 
sira due process claim points to three procedural deprivations inadequate notice,of confidential evidence relied on to support the disciplinary ruling,and insufficient evidence of misconduct.we address defendants qualified immunity defense as it pertains to each of these issues.
inadequate notice of the charges 
a.the due process violation 
due process requires that prison officials give an accused inmate written notice of the charges against him hours prior to conducting a disciplinary hearing.see wolff mcdonnell,at.kalwasinski morse,at.sira acknowledges that he received the challenged misbehavior report within the prescribed time his complaint is that the report charge was too general to provide meaningful notice of the misconduct at issue and in fact misleading as to the incident date.
the notice required by due process is no empty formality.see taylor rodriguez,at benitez wolff,cir.rather,notice serves to compel the charging officer to be sufficiently specific as to the misconduct with which the inmate is charged to inform the inmate of what he is accused of doing so that he can prepare a defense to those charges and not be made to explain away vague charges set out in a misbehavior report.taylor rodriguez,at quoting mckinnon patterson,cir see benitez wolff,at.toward this end,due process requires more than a conclusory charge an inmate must receive notice of at least some specific facts underlying the accusation.taylor rodriguez,at.such notice is especially important where,as in this case,large parts of the disciplinary hearing are conducted outside the inmate presence.the law recognizes that legitimate concerns for inmate safety may sometimes require confidential proceedings,see wolff mcdonnell,at,but,in such circumstances,there is a particular due process interest in requiring some factual specificity in the misconduct notice.see henry friendly,some kind of hearing,the more forthcoming the notice,the stronger should be an agency position in asking curtailment of other procedures associated with due process.
in taylor rodriguez,this court rejected as vague or conclusory a notice that informed an inmate that he was being considered for special confinement based on past acknowledged membership in the latin kings gang,recent tension in involving gang activity,and unspecified statements by independent confidential informants.at see also powell ward,cir affirming district court conclusion that charging inmate without disclosing what rule was broken violated due process.sira notice is similarly devoid of specific facts to support the otherwise conclusory allegation that he had urged,organized,and threatened inmates to participate in the strike.sira misbehavior report at.certainly,the report identifies no inmates toward whom sira alleged misconduct was directed.it describes no words,actions,or means employed by sira to further the strike.it mentions no sites within the prison where sira allegedly engaged in the charged conduct.instead,by identifying the incident site as the whole of green haven,the report essentially provided sira with no notice of where within his universe his misconduct was alleged to have occurred.moreover,to the extent the report identifies the date and time of the incident as january,at,the document is affirmatively misleading.as schneider testified,that date and time correspond to her filing of the disciplinary charges,not to any particular misconduct by sira.
defendants assert that the latter error is of no import because sira was served with the misbehavior report approximately ten minutes after its january filing and could not reasonably have thought he was being charged with misconduct at that date and time.a review of the evidence in the light most favorable to sira does not compel such a conclusion.a reasonable person might well have interpreted the report to charge sira with misconduct on january in attempting to rekindle the strike.so far as the record reveals,sira thought it was conduct on january that he had to defend on the first day of the disciplinary hearing,he sought to document his whereabouts on the morning of that date.
alternatively,defendants insist that the report reference to january,provided sira with adequate notice that his misconduct was alleged to have occurred on or about that date.in fact,the report states only that the strike was to occur on january which it apparently did not because of the lockdown.nowhere does the report give notice as to whether his charged conduct allegedly occurred before or after january,or whether his actions spanned a day,week,month,or longer.
in urging us to ignore any incongruity in the dates cited in the misbehavior report,defendants point to kalwasinski morse,a case in which an inmate was charged with threatening to kill three corrections officers but where hearing evidence revealed only threats.at.in rejecting a due process challenge,the court explained that t he discrepancy as to the precise nature of the threatened harm did not represent a failure of specificity that would impair kalwasinski ability to prepare his defense.id.but kalwasinski conclusion can not be divorced from the facts of that case.the noted variance between charge and proof arose in the context of an otherwise detailed misbehavior report.kalwasinski was given written notice that his charged conduct occurred on a specific and correct date october,at a specific site his jail cell under specific circumstances kalwasinski disobeyed an order to remove a blanket obstructing the view of his cell.further,the report advised kalwasinski that,in defying the order,he engaged in two specific acts he lewdly exposed himself to three corrections officers,while simultaneously directing threatening words and gestures toward them.the three officers were,moreover,identified by name and rank.see id.at.
sira situation is not at all comparable.his misbehavior report does not simply misidentify the incident date and time.it provides no notice as to the specific site or sites of his misconduct it does not indicate the words or actions he employed in purportedly urging,organizing,or threatening inmates to participate in the strike and it identifies no inmates toward whom his actions were directed.thus,unlike kalwasinski,this is not a case where one discrepancy in a misbehavior report can be excused because other details provided adequate notice of the conduct at issue.see generally quinones ricks,dep t noting that failure to include specific date in misbehavior report may be excused if the report otherwise provides sufficient details to permit the inmate to fashion a defense.from the notice he was given,sira could only guess whether he was being charged with making a single objectionable statement to one inmate or a host of statements to groups of inmates whether his conduct allegedly occurred on a specific day in january or over the course of several weeks and whether he had to defend against misconduct in the mess,the prison yard,his cell block,or some other location.
this is not to suggest that the constitution demands notice that painstakingly details all facts relevant to the date,place,and manner of charged inmate misconduct but there must be sufficient factual specificity to permit a reasonable person to understand what conduct is at issue so that he may identify relevant evidence and present a defense.see wolff mcdonnell,at.taylor rodriguez,at.we recognize that,in some cases,prison officials may lack precise information about the date,place,and manner of an inmate misconduct.in such circumstances,due process can not demand that authorities provide notice of specific facts that are beyond their knowledge.but an inmate can at least be given any general information regarding the relevant time and place that is known to the authorities,accompanied by an explanation that the exact date or site of the alleged misconduct is unknown,or that the precise identities of persons toward whom the alleged act was directed are unknown.such notice informs an inmate that he will not have to defend with respect to any particular date,place,or person,and permits him to focus his defense on challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.but where,as in this case,a defendant is provided with no specific facts relating to conclusory charges that he violated prison rules prohibiting inmates from urging or threatening others to cause prison disruptions,he has no more ability to identify the conduct at issue and to muster a defense than if he had been given no notice at all.
defendants submit that any notice defects in the misbehavior report were rendered harmless by schneider january,testimony,which alerted sira to statements made by confidential informants in the period from shortly before the december,lockdown through january,identifying him as the leader of a group of dominican inmates and the captain of and reporting that sira had used threats to enforce participation in the strike.preliminarily,we are doubtful that inadequate written notice can be cured merely through oral disclosures at the disciplinary hearing.certainly such curative disclosures would be insufficient unless the inmate was also afforded the meaningful opportunity to prepare a response to the new information.see wolff mcdonnell,at.rejecting practice of giving inmates notice of charges at the time of disciplinary hearing and requiring advance written notice.in any event,schneider testimony alerted sira only to the role confidential informants ascribed to him within the inmate culture,not to the particular actions he allegedly took to encourage participation in the strike.the dates she mentioned referred to when confidential sources disclosed information to prison officials.nothing in her testimony indicated whether sira actions were contemporaneous with those disclosures or whether they occurred weeks earlier.in sum,she provided no more specific facts than the initial misbehavior report with respect to when,where,or how sira urged,organized,or threatened participation in the strike.
accordingly,we conclude that when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to sira,he has presented a viable due process claim of inadequate notice.
qualified immunity 
defendants submit that even if sira did not receive constitutionally adequate notice of the disciplinary charges against him,they are,nevertheless,entitled to qualified immunity because under law,reasonable corrections officials could have believed that the notice given comported with due process.we disagree.
as the preceding discussion makes plain,for more than two decades before the filing of sira misbehavior report,the law has recognized an inmate due process right to receive advance written notice of the disciplinary charges against him sufficient to permit him to marshal the facts in his defense.wolff mcdonnell,at.opinions of this court,in reiterating the importance of adequate notice,have emphasized that vague,conclusory allegations are inadequate to this purpose due process requires a modicum of factual specificity.see benitez wolff,at observing that notice must inform the inmate of what he allegedly has done so that he can prepare a defense,if he chooses,to the specific charges set forth quoting mckinnon patterson,at.
defendants acknowledge these precedents but argue that a reasonable corrections officer could have believed that a misbehavior report,like a criminal indictment,satisfies due process if it simply tracks the language of the law or rule violated.this argument misstates the law with respect to indictments.we have frequently upheld indictments that do little more than track the language of the statute charged,but only when they also state,at least approximately,the time and place of the alleged crime.united states tramunti,cir,quoted in united states walsh,cir crimes involving threats,moreover,are rarely charged in so a manner.see,united states palmiotti,cir rejecting generality challenge to extortion charge where indictment specified dates of threats,corporate victim,and specific amounts sought indeed,we have not upheld indictments that merely tracked statutory language prohibiting threats when more specific pleading was necessary to permit the accused to prepare his defense and defend against double jeopardy.see united states davidoff,cir reversing racketeering conviction where a defendant was not given notice of discrete extortion schemes that the prosecution intended to prove see also united states tomasetta,cir finding indictment insufficient for failing to name the victim of an extortion count,the location of the alleged threat,and the means by which the threat was made united states kalevas,weinfeld,rejecting request for particulars because government letter had already disclosed the names of the persons allegedly threatened by defendant and the approximate dates of those threats.similarly,courts have not hesitated to order the government to give a defendant notice of the specific parts of a lengthy conversation on which it would rely to prove a threat charge.see united states sabri.
in sira case,the misbehavior report provided no notice as to the purported victims of the charged misconduct,not even notice that the specific victims were unknown the report similarly failed to describe the words or actions by which defendant purportedly urged,organized,or threatened any person.as already noted,it did not provide even minimal notice of the time or place of the charged conduct.no reasonable officer could have thought that such a misbehavior report,devoid of any factual detail and containing an inaccurate incident date,was adequate to permit sira to identify and marshal the facts pertinent to a defense.indeed,such a conclusion is particularly warranted in this case because sira persistently challenged the adequacy of the notice he received with respect to place,date,and victims.morton acknowledged the report vagueness as to place and error as to date nevertheless,he refused to dismiss the report or to order that it be supplemented with some specific facts.under these circumstances,we conclude that the district court correctly denied qualified immunity.see wilson layne,d.
failure to disclose evidence relied on to support the disciplinary ruling 
compounding the problem of inadequate notice,defendants also failed to disclose to sira much of the evidence supporting his disciplinary ruling,specifically,the identities of the confidential informants who inculpated him in the strike and the substance of their statements an inmate due process right to know the evidence upon which a discipline ruling is based is well established.see wolff mcdonnell,at.francis coughlin,cir.such disclosure affords the inmate a reasonable opportunity to explain his actions and to alert officials to possible defects in the evidence.
courts have long recognized,however,that the right to know evidence supporting prison disciplinary rulings is not absolute.see wolff mcdonnell,at.as the supreme court has observed,prison disciplinary proceedings take place in tightly controlled environments peopled by those who have been unable to conduct themselves properly in a free society.ponte real,d.the risks of violence or intimidation directed at either other inmates or staff are real.id.at.thus,when the disclosure of evidence presents such risks,hearing officers may properly decline to inform an inmate of the adverse evidence.see wolff mcdonnell,at.francis coughlin,at.
courts will not readily second guess the judgment of prison officials with respect to such matters,see wolff mcdonnell,at.nevertheless,the discretion to withhold evidence is not unreviewable,see ponte real,at.the touchstone of due process,after all,is freedom from arbitrary governmental action.id.at.thus,prison officials who decide to circumscribe inmates procedural rights at disciplinary proceedings must offer a reasonable justification for their actions,if not contemporaneously,then when challenged in a court action.see id.at.
in this case,the sole contemporaneous reason stated by morton to justify of the confidential evidence was as follows inmate sira was not present during the confidential testimony because it was confidential,and would have put another inmate life in danger.hearing disposition form at.certainly,testimony adduced at the confidential hearing indicates that the informants lives might have been placed at risk if they had appeared before morton or if their identities had been disclosed to sira.but neither morton statement nor any evidence in the present record suggests that disclosure of the substance of the informants statements to sira would have presented safety risks.
for example,informant attribution of threatening conduct to sira was conclusory,without any indication of the time,place or circumstances at issue thus,it is not obvious from the record that its disclosure would have identified and,therefore,jeopardized the source.similarly,although informant letter provided specific information as to strike leaders and a strike meeting site,it provided no context that identified the author.informant likewise reported only the overheard conversation of two other inmates,while informant disclosed information obtained simply from asking around.the record provides us with no basis to conclude that sira could have divined the informants identities from disclosure of the substance of these hearsay reports.
most significantly,nothing in the record explains why sira could not have been informed of the substance of informant disclosure that at a strike meeting held in building sometime after the lockdown ended,inmate codorel had identified sira to a whole group of persons as the individual who would enforce the work action in c block.codorel statement is significant because it is akin to a declaration and,if deemed credible,might,by itself,have supported sira discipline.see infra at discussing minimal requirement of some reliable evidence to support prison discipline.withholding this information from sira,however,deprived him of any opportunity to explain or challenge this inculpatory evidence,whether by demonstrating some motive for codorel falsely to inculpate him in the strike,or by proffering a statement from codorel himself denying the informant report,or by adducing any other facts or circumstances relevant to reliability.
it is possible that on further development of the record defendants will be able to justify withholding the substance of the informants disclosures from sira.see ponte real,at.but because no reasons are now before the court and because we review the record in the light most favorable to sira,we must conclude that he presents a viable due process claim based on of evidence and that there is no basis to hold that any reasonable officer could have thought otherwise.accordingly,defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on this part of sira due process claim.
insufficiency of the evidence 
a.the due process violation 
in considering whether sira presents a viable due process challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we address the following issues the evidence required by law to support prison discipline,a hearing officer obligation independently to assess the reliability of evidence supplied by confidential informants,and the need to evaluate reliability by reference to the totality of circumstances.with respect to totality review,we further discuss how this applies to a hearsay evidence supplied by confidential informants and b conclusory assertions by informants.
the requirement of some reliable evidence to support prison discipline 
in superintendent hill,the supreme court ruled that prison discipline decisions affecting an inmate liberty interest can not be imposed arbitrarily but must be supported by some evidence in the record.at.judicial review of this some evidence standard is narrowly focused.as the supreme court has explained,it does not require examination of the entire record,independent assessment of the credibility of witnesses,or weighing of the evidence.instead,the relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.id.at.however narrow this sufficiency question,it presents an issue of law subject to our plenary review.united states henry,cir holding that sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction is reviewed de novo machadio apfel,cir reviewing sufficiency of substantial evidence determinations de novo heard united states,per curiam observing that the question whether the evidence in a particular case constitutes some evidence of insanity is a question of law for the court 
in a recent discussion of the some evidence standard,this court observed that only reliable evidence can constitute some evidence.luna pico,at.the principle is not new.a reliability inquiry has long been required when confidential source information is relied on to satisfy the some evidence standard.as we explained in giakoumelos coughlin,an informant testimony implicating an accused inmate in charged misconduct can support a finding as long as there has been some examination of indicia relevant to an informant credibility.at quoting russell scully,cir accord taylor rodriguez,at.
the need for an independent assessment of informant credibility to determine reliability 
in this case,all the evidence supporting the misconduct charge against sira derived from confidential informants.there has been some ambiguity in our case law whether a hearing officer must make an independent assessment of informant credibility to ensure that disclosures qualify as some reliable evidence,or whether he can simply rely on the opinions of prison officials who have dealt with the informants.see gaston coughlin,cir describing question as not yet resolved in this circuit in gaston,it was unnecessary to choose between the two standards because the record clearly demonstrated that the hearing officer had conducted a satisfactory independent assessment of informant credibility.id.at.
we note,however,that in taylor rodriguez,at,this court endorsed an independent credibility assessment when confidential information is used to establish the some evidence necessary to afford due process in prison disciplinary proceedings.the record in taylor failed to evidence any credibility assessment,independent or otherwise,by the hearing officer nevertheless,the court expressly discussed only the former standard in reversing an award of summary judgment in favor of prison authorities requiring an independent credibility assessment ensures not only a fair hearing and discipline based on reliable evidence,but also places a minimal burden on prison officials conducting such hearings,with the assurance that judicial review is available.id.because this conclusion was instrumental to taylor ruling,it binds us notwithstanding gaston dicta.see generally cohens virginia,wheat.united states bell,cir wright kane,the law of federal courts,at ed.if the court believes it is deliberately deciding a constitutional question,it is wise to suppose that the constitutional question has been decided,unless and until some later court suggests a different answer.
in any event,we think taylor holding is constitutionally sound.due process requires not simply that an inmate facing a loss of liberty receive a hearing,but that he receive a fair hearing.see,grillo coughlin,cir.see generally joint refugee committee mcgrath.frankfurter,concurring fairness of procedure is due process in the primary sense.internal quotation marks omitted.fairness can not be achieved without some assessment of the reliability of the evidence offered against the accused.in our adversarial system,confrontation and are the usual tools used to test credibility.see chambers mississippi,d cotto herbert,cir see also crawford washington,d united states burr,cas,marshall,noting that nothing endanger s the right to life,liberty and property more than precluding confrontation.but in light of the substantial risks for violence and retaliation in connection with prison disciplinary actions,due process does not mandate these procedures in that prison officials retain discretion to afford them.see wolff mcdonnell,at.nevertheless,when sound discretion forecloses confrontation and,the need for the hearing officer to conduct an independent assessment of informant credibility to ensure fairness to the accused inmate is heightened.
the record in this case demonstrates,and sira does not dispute,that morton independently assessed the credibility of these informants by inquiring as to their record for reliability.see russell scully,at.in the case of informants,however,the evidence supplied was not based on the informants personal knowledge but on communications from third parties.sira asserts that such information could not be deemed reliable without further inquiry into the credibility of the underlying sources.as to evidence supplied by informant,because the record is unclear as to whether it was based on direct knowledge or hearsay,sira submits that it could not be considered reliable without further similar inquiry.finally,as to informant,the only source who purported to provide direct evidence,sira asserts that his information was too conclusory to be deemed reliable without some inquiry into its basis.
totality review of the reliability of confidential evidence 
a hearsay disclosures by credible informants 
we agree that when confidential information presented at a prison disciplinary proceeding involves multiple levels of hearsay,a hearing officer can not determine the reliability of that information simply by reference to the informant past record for credibility.credible informants may,after all,unwittingly pass along suspect information from unreliable sources.for this reason,the officer must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine if the hearsay information is,in fact,reliable.
any number of factors may inform a totality assessment of reliability.see illinois gates,d holding that reliability assessments generally depend on the totality of circumstances.for example,a hearing officer may consider the identity and reputation of the original declarant,his motive for making the statements at issue,whether he is willing to testify and,if not,the reasons informing that decision,and the consequences he faces if his disclosures prove false.where the original declarant identity is unknown or not disclosed,the hearing officer may nevertheless consider such factors as the specificity of the information,the circumstances under which it was disclosed,and the degree to which it is corroborated by other evidence.see alabama white,d united states wagner,cir.see generally chambers mississippi,at.finding hearsay statements reliable because they were made spontaneously,were corroborated by some other evidence in the case,and were against the declarant interest dutton evans,d further discussing factors relevant to reliability.the officer may also consider any challenges to reliability raised by the accused inmate.where good reasons justify withholding confidential evidence from the inmate,the hearing officer,of course,has the singular responsibility for ensuring that he has been provided with all the facts and circumstances necessary to make an informed assessment of reliability.
in this case,where sira appears to have been unjustifiably deprived of adequate notice and the substance of the evidence against him,morton failure to probe and assess the totality of the circumstances in assessing the reliability of hearsay information disclosed by confidential informants makes it impossible for us to conclude as a matter of law at this stage of the case that sira can present no viable sufficiency claim.while this is obviously the case with respect to the general accusations reported by informants and,the conclusion pertains even as to informant.as we have already noted,his report that codorel had announced to a group of striking inmates that sira would enforce discipline in might have sufficed,by itself,to support sira discipline if the statement reliability had been assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances.but codorel reliability could not be determined by reference only to the credibility record of informant.it may be that on further development of the record,morton might satisfactorily demonstrate that he did base his reliability finding with respect to all the hearsay declarants on more than a credibility assessment of the informants,but on this appeal,we must assume otherwise and,therefore,conclude that plaintiff has stated a viable constitutional claim.
defendants,however,submit that further factual development is unnecessary to their motion.they argue that the reliability of the hearsay evidence is so plainly established by the internal consistency of the information disclosed that sira can not,as a matter of law,establish that he was disciplined without some reliable evidence.in appropriate cases,consistency among hearsay statements may support a finding of reliability.see united states int l of teamsters,cir accord united states int l of teamsters,cir.but such a finding is not compelled as a matter of law in every case,and certainly not in this one.
for example,defendants highlight that several declarants placed sira in building at night and in the center in the morning.at oral argument,however,sira counsel explained that his client was assigned to these locations.presumably,sira himself could have made this point at the discipline hearing had he known the substance of the confidential evidence.corroboration of facts generally known or easily obtained do not necessarily establish a source reliability with respect to other incriminating matters.see alabama white,at.see also united states mendonsa,cir mere confirmation of innocent static details is insufficient to support an anonymous tip united states rasor,cir holding that corroboration of information that was readily available to many persons does not demonstrate reliability.the consistency among the declarants on this point therefore bears little,if any,weight on a motion for summary judgment.
the more significant consistency among certain of the hearsay statements is the description of sira as a person responsible for enforcing strike participation.the statements,however,also bear certain example,some of the declarants reported that sira enforced where he was housed,while others said where he apparently worked.further,except in the case of declarant codorel,the statements reveal almost nothing about the circumstances under which they were made.on this record,we can not conclude as a matter of law that morton necessarily found that the consistencies in the hearsay established their reliability.nothing in the record indicates that he considered the issue,nor any other circumstances relevant to the reliability of the hearsay accounts other than the confidential informants credibility records.as we have already stated,this last factor is insufficient,by itself,to establish the reliability of the hearsay information communicated by informants.
