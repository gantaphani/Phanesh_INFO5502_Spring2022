this appeal presents due process challenges to the preclusive effect of a state court judgment approving a class action settlement.the challenges concern lack of adequate representation and deficiencies in notice of the settlement.marc wolfert as executor of the estate of elinor wolfert wolfert appeals from the september,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york charles brieant,judge dismissing her complaint as barred by res judicata.the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the reverse mortgage entered into between wolfert and transamerica home first,transamerica was unenforceable and return of all payments made to the lender.wolfert claimed that two provisions of the reverse mortgage,the contingent interest and the maturity fee were unlawful under new york law.transamerica argued,successfully,that her claims were barred by a settlement in a class action in a california state court.
we conclude that wolfert was adequately represented in the california class action,that her challenges to the settlement notice lack merit,and that the california class action judgment therefore bars her current lawsuit.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
the reverse mortgage.in february,at the age of,wolfert entered into a reverse mortgage with transamerica.as explained by the district court,
a reverse mortgage loan is a means by which an individual,usually an elderly person,may borrow on the equity of his or her home,and the lender pays out so much of the loan proceeds as necessary,in agreed periodic installments over the individual lifetime.the mortgage debt becomes due when the borrower either sells the property or dies,whichever occurs first.
transamerica lent wolfert an initial amount of.it also agreed to loan her per month for the next months,or until march,as long as she remained alive and did not default on any of the other terms.the maximum total principal amount,as stated in the loan agreement,was.the loan provided for a fixed interest rate of percent,compounded monthly.the reverse mortgage contract required wolfert to use part of the initial loan amount,to purchase a life annuity with metropolitan life insurance company,which would begin monthly payments after the monthly advances under the loan agreement ended.
two provisions of the reverse mortgage are especially pertinent to the pending litigation.the most controversial provision obligates the borrower to pay transamerica a contingent interest upon various maturity events,including the sale of the property the amount of the contingent interest is percent of the difference between the appraised value of the property as of the date of the loan agreement and the time of the triggering event.wolfert home was valued at at the time of the loan and at the time she tried to sell it in.thus,the amount of the contingent interest she would have to pay if she sold the home would be half the difference,or.
the second controversial provision obligates the borrower to pay transamerica a maturity fee of two percent of the value of the home at the time of sale.
the california class action.the transamerica reverse mortgages were challenged in a class action in the superior court of san mateo county,california.that action began as several separate actions in that challenged various aspects of transamerica reverse mortgages.these separate lawsuits were consolidated as the reverse mortgage cases.in february,the class representatives filed a third consolidated amended complaint,which stated three causes of action unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business practices in violation of california business professions code et and negligent misrepresentation.in september,the california superior court granted a motion to certify a nationwide class only as to the first cause of action.the class comprised those who,prior to january,had entered into a reverse mortgage loan with transamerica that charged identified fees concerning a percent contingent interest,a deferred annuity premium,a percent maturity fee the class included legal and heirs of deceased borrowers.transamerica sold of these reverse mortgages,of which had been sold in california.in december,the class representatives and the defendants reached a settlement and sought court approval of the settlement and the class notice.after a hearing,the trial court gave preliminary approval to the settlement.
the settlement agreement provided for the defendants to pay a total of million.after legal fees,incentive payments to named plaintiffs,and administrative costs,approximately million was available for distribution to class members.the agreement allocated this amount among the borrowers or their according to whether the loan was open or closed,the number of payments made with respect to closed loans,and the date the loan started with respect to open loans.wolfert expected to receive in the settlement.
class counsel mailed notice of the settlement in february the notice comprises pages of text.on the first page,it identifies the borrower by name and loan number.on pages,it describes how each borrower settlement share was calculated.on page,it describes the release each class member will provide to the defendants 
in particular,each class member will be completely releasing all claims,of any kind,he or she has now or may have in the future relating to the facts and claims alleged in the action,including without limitation the fairness of any of the terms or features of the loan its accompanying annuity,the disclosure or concealment of the loan features,including its charges and fees and the cost of the annuity,and the marketing of the loan,including its annuity 
it should be noted that the claims which class members will be releasing as a condition of the settlement include,but are not limited to,the claims that the named plaintiffs have asserted in the action and those that the court has determined are suitable for treatment.the released claims also are not limited to claims arising under california law.the released claims include any claims of the described sort,even if the claim has not been asserted in the action or is too individualized in its facts or relevant law to be suitable for class certification or uniquely arises under the laws of the borrower home state.
proposed notice of class action and settlement at emphasis in original.the notice stated that the full settlement agreement was available for inspection during regular business hours at the office of the clerk of the superior court,san mateo,california.the notice also refers the reader to an internet address,at which the settlement agreement was to have appeared.in addition,the claims administrator published an advertisement once a week for four consecutive weeks in the business section of usa today.
the settlement agreement is a,document.the release clause uses similar,but not identical,language to that appearing in the notice 
effective as of the final effective date,the class members hereby forever completely release and discharge each of the defendants from any and all causes of action arising now or in the future out of or in connection with or related to the facts and claims alleged or asserted in any of the complaints filed in the litigation under federal law or the law of any state or locality,including consumer protection laws the released claims.the released claims include without limitation any claim that any of the terms of the reverse mortgage loans or annuities were unfair or unlawful 
settlement agreement and release at emphasis added.the settlement agreement states that the defendants will pay million in total to settle the claims.the agreement also provides that the defendants would not oppose class counsels request for an attorney fee award of percent of the settlement amount.the agreement also provides for incentive awards for each of the named plaintiffs in the amount of for all but one,who received.the agreement refers to a plan of allocation for the award as exhibit b to the agreement,but this plan does not appear in the record or on the internet.
the trial court held a fairness hearing in may.one class member filed an objection,and opted out.wolfert neither objected nor opted out.the trial court rejected all the objections and gave final approval to the settlement in june.in march,the california court of appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court,and the california supreme court denied review in july.
the pending litigation.upon learning that before closing on a proposed sale of her house,wolfert would be obligated to pay one of transamerica affiliated companies approximately to discharge her loan,she filed a suit in the new york supreme court orange county in march,seeking an injunction requiring transamerica to file a satisfaction of mortgage.transamerica removed the case to the district court for the southern district of new york.wolfert then filed an complaint in the district court in april,seeking damages and return of the payment required to discharge her loan upon the sale of her home.the eight counts alleged that the contingent interest provision violated new york law because it exceeded allowable future appreciation interest that may be charged to someone of wolfert age,the maturity fee provision violated new york law because it was an unlawful form of equity participation,the maturity fee violated new york law because it did not represent actual fees and costs,the initial appraisal fraudulently undervalued wolfert property,the defendants failed to meet their obligations under the agreement,the reverse mortgage was unconscionable,wolfert was physically and mentally infirm at the time of making the contract,and the defendants had engaged in fraud and deception entitling wolfert to rescission of the contract.
transamerica responded with a motion to dismiss,or in the alternative to stay pending arbitration.transamerica contended that wolfert claims are barred by res judicata,the new york statutes governing reverse mortgages are preempted by federal law,the reverse mortgage complied with new york law,and any action must be stayed pending arbitration.
in july,the district court ruled that res judicata,based on the judgment in the california state court class action,barred most of wolfert claims.judge brieant noted that class notice was sent by first class mail and that wolfert received the notice the district court then observed that wolfert had failed to opt out and concluded that she was bound by the judgment of the california court.judge brieant dismissed six of the eight claims as barred by claim preclusion arising out of the california judgment.he did not dismiss the two remaining breach of contract for failure to make monthly payments,and incapacity of wolfert to enter into a they did not fall within the scope of the class action release.he also declined to stay the matter pending arbitration,noting that the validity of the arbitration clause depended upon contested factual issues 
in september,the district court dismissed wolfert two remaining claims with prejudice,pursuant to a stipulation by both parties,and then dismissed the entire action.
discussion 
the appellant contends that the district court erred in giving the california judgment preclusive effect because,she claims,the class representatives did not adequately represent her and the notice was deficient in several respects.
claim of inadequate representation 
judge brieant does not appear to have given explicit consideration to whether wolfert was adequately represented.he noted that her transaction clearly brings her within the class as defined,that her first,second,third,fourth,sixth,and eighth claims allege conduct that falls within the scope of the released claims,that she received notice,and that she failed to opt out.t hus,he concluded,her claims in this lawsuit are precluded.
in,the supreme court first considered whether giving preclusive effect to a judgment in a class action against an absent class member violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see hansberry lee.the court initially stated that its task was to assure that the absent class member has been afforded such notice and opportunity to be heard as are requisite to the due process which the constitution prescribes.id.at.had the court stopped there,an absent class member might have been precluded simply by a judgment rendered after a class action court had given class members adequate notice of settlement terms and afforded them an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the settlement however,relying on early equity jurisprudence,see id.at,the court further stated that the class action judgment would have preclusive effect on absent class members only if those present are of the same class as those absent and the litigation is so conducted as to insure the full and fair consideration of the common issue.id.at.the court also referred to the familiar doctrine of the federal courts that members of a class not present as parties to the litigation may be bound by the judgment where they are in fact adequately represented by parties who are present id.at.the court concluded that the class action judgment in hansberry would not have preclusive effect because the interests of the representatives in that suit we re not necessarily or even probably the same as those whom they we re deemed to represent,and therefore d id not afford that protection to absent parties which due process requires.id.at.
by,the court could state emphatically,t he due process clause of course requires that the named plaintiff in a class action at all times adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.phillips petroleum shutts,d accord nevada united states,d citing hansberry for the proposition that absent class members could not be bound where the class representatives had interests that impermissibly conflicted with those of persons represented.
hansberry decided not only that due process requires fair representation of absent parties ultimately called adequate representation,but also that an absent party denied such representation could collaterally attack the class action judgment.that proposition remains fully effective.final judgments remain vulnerable to collateral attack for failure to satisfy the adequate representation requirement.matsushita electric industrial epstein,d ginsburg,concurring in part and dissenting in part.this circuit,and many others,have allowed such collateral attacks in recent years.see stephenson dow chemical,cir,aff in part by an equally divided court and vacated in part,d in re agent orange product liability litigation,cir in re real estate title and settlement services antitrust litigation,cir gonzales cassidy,cir see generally patrick woolley,the availability of collateral attack for inadequate representation in class suits.thus,wolfert due process challenge to the preclusive effect of the california judgment depends on whether she was adequately represented by the class representatives.
in considering wolfert claim of inadequate representation,we face an initial issue of the degree of deference we owe the ruling of the class action court that the class representatives provided adequate representation to the class.conflicting views on that issue have been forcefully set forth in the majority and dissenting opinions in epstein mca,cir,on remand from the supreme court,see matsushita,d.judge,for the majority,appeared to state broadly that the class action court decision on adequacy of representation precluded a subsequent collateral attack.epstein,at simply put,the absent class members due process right to adequate representation is protected not by collateral review,but by the delaware certifying court initially,and thereafter by appeal within the state system and by direct review in the united states supreme court.in dissent,judge thomas maintained that collateral attack was available because the collaterally attacking plaintiffs seek to raise claims that received neither determination nor review in the delaware courts.id.at.
as with most issues arising under the due process clause,the ultimate test of whether an ruling by a class action court precludes a collateral attack turns on whether fundamental fairness was lacking.in the class action context,if the class action court ruled only in general terms that representation was adequate,without any adversarial consideration of the claim now advanced by wolfert that new york law affords her substantial rights beyond those afforded by california law,it would be manifestly unfair to preclude her collateral attack.on the other hand,if,in the class action,a defendant opposing class certification or an objector to the settlement had made a serious argument that a was required because of claims substantially similar to hers,and that argument had been considered and rejected by the class action court,it would not be unfair to preclude collateral review of that ruling and relegate wolfert to her direct review remedies it would not be a denial of due process to give full faith and credit to the class action court ruling on adequacy of representation unless that ruling was made in the absence of an adversarial presentation of the claim that interests substantially similar to those of wolfert required the designation of a.however,no such adversarial presentation occurred with respect to her claim that new york law affords her materially more rights than those available under california law.although the class action court considered and rejected,at the class certification stage,transamerica contention that the contract choice of law provision specifying new york law should be followed no one made any claim concerning the content of new york law 
of course,not every variation between the interests of an absent class member and those of the class generally will render the class representatives inadequate.the determination turns on whether the interests of the class were compatible with those of the party attempting to attack the class action judgment collaterally.see stores,visa,cir see also in re joint eastern and southern district asbestos litigation,cir explaining that for representation to be adequate pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,class counsel must satisfy certain criteria and the class members must not have interests that are antagonistic to one another quoting in re drexel burnham lambert group,cir.in assessing compatibility,we look at alignment of interests of class members walmart,at see amchem products,windsor,d stephenson,at.there is no litmus test for determining when interests of one or more absent class members are sufficiently distinct from those of the class representatives to render those representatives inadequate.in hansberry,the interests of the absent class members and those of the class representatives were diametrically opposed.hansberry,at.in seeking to enforce the agreement the plaintiffs in the class suit were not representing the collaterally attacking parties whose substantial interest is in resisting performance.without attempting to delineate the degree of divergence of interests that would render class representatives inadequate,it suffices to note in this case that if wolfert is correct that new york law affords her significant protection not available under california law,she was not adequately represented.
wolfert asserts that under new york law the contingent interest clause was capped at a percent interest,rather than the percent in her loan.in contrast,the class representatives relied upon the general california unfair business practice statute,notwithstanding a provision for new york state borrowers,which provided that new york law governed disputes,and acknowledged in their settlement notice that one of the difficulties they would face at trial was in proving that this clause was not fair.
determining whether new york law provides wolfert with greater protection than the class representatives were claiming under california law requires examination of new york statutes governing reverse mortgages.
in,new york revised its reverse mortgage statute,creating two separate sections,each covering different types of reverse mortgages.see real prop,mckinney supp.section applies to reverse mortgages for all persons or older section applies to reverse mortgage only for those aged or older.section loans require several additional protections for the borrowers,such as guaranteeing lifetime occupancy.see id.a.pertinent to wolfert claim,section sets a percent cap on the lender interest in the future appreciation in the home.see id.d.section does not contain such a cap.
although wolfert had a section mortgage and does not claim that new york law gives more rights to the borrower with a section mortgage than are available under california law,she nonetheless contends that new york law affords her a basis,not found in california law,to declare her section mortgage void and thereby avoid the contingent interest payment and maturity fee payment for which she became liable upon the sale of her home.the premise of her argument is that transamerica failed to comply with a statutory provision requiring a lender to offer section reverse mortgages in equal number to section reverse mortgages.see id.wolfert alleges,and transamerica does not dispute,that it did not offer any section loans at the relevant time.
we agree with transamerica that failure to comply with the requirement does not afford wolfert a basis to challenge her section mortgage as either void ab initio or voidable because the provision imposing the requirement does not create a private right of action.the provision does not explicitly authorize a private right of action,and can not be considered to imply one because the requirement is not realistically amenable to enforcement by a borrower lawsuit.when a lender fails to abide by the requirement,which borrowers with section mortgages would be entitled to relief for example,if,at the end of a calendar year a lender has issued section mortgages and only section mortgages,of the section mortgages should have been mortgages,but which ones allowing all borrowers with section mortgages to invalidate their mortgage loans would give borrowers relief to which they are not entitled.the statute provides no basis for determining which section borrowers could sue to enforce the requirement.if a lender fails to comply with the requirement,the remedy lies with administrative action in the discretion of the superintendent of banks see regs.see also brian hoxie painting central school district,statutory creation of enforcement scheme suggests absence of private right of action.
wolfert also contends that her reverse mortgage is voidable because it violates new york usury statute.see oblig.mckinney.the premise of this argument is that a lender offering only one reverse mortgage program must meet the requirements of a section loan for all loans and that the percent contingent interest of her section loan exceeded the maximum percent contingent interest of a section loan she then argues that determining whether transamerica charged more than the maximum interest rate set by the usury statute requires incorporating this excess into a calculation of the interest rate charged.in effect,she contends,the interest charged her was in excess of per annum.br.for appellant at.
we agree with transamerica that,insofar as wolfert claims that these charges effectively violate new york usury statute,the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of didmca,a,preempts her claim.that section provides,in relevant part
