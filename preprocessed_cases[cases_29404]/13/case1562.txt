richard breeden is trustee of the bennett funding group,hereinafter bfg,a defunct company that was used as the vehicle for a ponzi scheme.breeden sued,inter alia,the company lawyers and an accounting firm on the theory that they should have detected the fraud.the trustee alleges that arthur anderson hereinafter aa was negligent in issuing clean opinions for bfg and audit years and failing to notify appropriate authorities at bfg or law enforcement authorities when it a discovered problems with bfg statements and its compliance with securities laws and regulations in,b refused to issue a statement for,and c withdrew its statement for.the trustee complaint against the law firms alleges that they submitted a letter to the securities and exchange commission sec which was false and designed to delay or hinder the sec investigation of bfg.on august,the united states district court for the southern district of new york sprizzo,granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint breeden kirkpatrick lockhart llp,on the ground that the trustee lacked standing to sue third parties where the fraud was perpetrated by the debtor itself.see shearson lehman hutton,wagoner,cir.by then,the remaining defendants were kirkpatrick lockhart llp kirkpatrick,robinson,st john wayne llp robinson and storch brenner llp storch collectively the law firm defendants and the accountants.
the court had previously denied a motion to dismiss on standing grounds,but a year later entertained the motions presently under review on the papers as supplemented by a evidentiary hearing at which the court heard witnesses and received in evidence a number of documents and deposition transcripts.thus,the trustee was afforded the further opportunity to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.on august,the court granted summary judgment.see breeden,at.
the trustee appeals on the grounds i that the rule of wagoner applies only if all the company were implicated,a circumstance shown to be lacking here and ii that conducting an evidentiary hearing in the context of a summary judgment motion deprived him of the constitutional right to a jury trial.
factual background 
this case involves what at the time it was uncovered was characterized as the greatest ponzi scheme on record and resulted from the sale and resale of the same office equipment leases.bfg,a family business,raised capital for its operations from private investors and institutions.it is undisputed that bud and kathleen bennett were the sole shareholders of bfg that one son,patrick bennett,was cfo and another son,michael,deputy ceo.together they had control over every decision made at bfg.although bfg is only one of several bennett entities collectively referred to as the bennett companies,each such entity was held,directly or indirectly,by members of the bennet family,who treated the entities as alter egos.aff.of stewart weissman,in supp.of trustee mot.for an ord.substantively consolidating the debtors estates.the record is replete with references such as,t he bennett family treated its complex network of companies as a single empire.every bennett family member was on the bfg board,more specifically,bud bennett was bfg chairman and ceo,and kathleen bennett was bfg president.the trustee concedes that bfg was a bennett family dictatorship.in a report submitted pursuant to,the trustee admitted patrick bennett control of the finances of the bennett companies was complete.according to appellees,the bennetts fraudulent activities must be imputed to,by extension,to the than to the professionals who were alleged to be complicit in the fraud.appellees brief at.the trustee,not surprisingly,disagrees.
the board of directors plays an integral part in this elaborate scheme.while the bennett family always held at least of the seats on the board,there were other directors.it is undisputed,however,that each director was handpicked by bud and each was a bfg employee there were no outside directors.the board meetings were scripted in advance and each board member was provided with his speaking parts in advance of the meeting.the hearing also brought to light the following facts.
first,it became clear that t he bennett family,in particular bud and patrick bennett,did no t tolerate any questioning that could have uncovered the fraud.for instance,at least one employee,keith braudrick,bfg comptroller from to,was fired because he sought additional information and documentation with respect to certain transactions that he was directed to record on the books of the company.
second,when confronted with clear evidence of fraud in late,bud and kathleen sought to guarantee control over bfg and its finances in perpetuity and placed all of bfg stock in a trust,the language of which expressly assured that patrick was to be appointed chairman of the board and ceo of bfg.
third,as far back as,the auditor report found that t he unassigned inventory list from the computer system is not correct and contains both leases which have not been sold and leases that have been sold.according to appellees,the outside audit clearly demonstrated how assignment of the same leases was made to multiple buyers and lenders and yet nothing was done to correct the problem.
fourth,bud and kathleen were on notice of the ponzi scheme when in october,two groups of employees discovered that bfg had pledged more than million in leases that had already been sold to investors.once again the bennetts did nothing and patrick remained in control.further,the trustee concedes that the bennetts diverted funds to themselves or to entities that they funds to maintain bud and kathleen yacht,the lady kathleen.at.
fifth,in,bfg finally hired arkin,schaeffer kaplan,a new york law firm arkin law firm,to investigate the double pledging.the arkin law firm was retained after several bfg employees threatened to resign over the discrepancies that had come to light.thereafter,bud and patrick agreed to an oversight committee.the trustee maintains that the fact that bud and kathleen bennett retained an outside law firm to investigate the allegations of strongly suggests that they themselves were unaware of the fraud that was being perpetrated.in its report dated march,the arkin law firm concluded that w hether the double pledging was intentional or the result of an innocent error is inconclusive however,at a minimum bfg was grossly negligent in allowing the double pledging to occur.
when aa refused to issue a clean opinion in,bud personally fired aa without ever even a mention to the board.consequently,the board neither discussed nor investigated the reasons behind aa discharge.the oversight committee that was created in by the bennetts after the came to light was without power according to one of its members to fire patrick or to carry out the recommendations it might have made.
the trustee contends that there were innocent insiders at william lester,richard macpherson,kevin kuppel,and paul would have tried to put an end to the fraud had they been privy to it.however,appellees maintain that it is clear that the trustee purportedly innocent might have had the best of without any power to do anything anyway.for instance,kevin kuppel,bfg treasurer,testified at the hearing that he had no responsibility for the cash flow,no authority or responsibility regarding bank accounts,and did even know what the cash disbursement process was at the bennett funding group.similarly,richard macpherson,formerly head football coach at syracuse university,was given a large office,a seat on the board and the title senior vice president of corporate communications,but admitted that he was a mere public relations figurehead.indeed,joseph rocco,the comptroller until the,testified that as early as march,he knew that the company financial statements failed to reflect truthfully the financial condition of the company and had written a memo to bud expressing this view.see memo of,ex.the trustee adverts to the testimony of lester,macpherson,kuppel,and of whom testified that he was unaware that a fraud had been committed.indeed,testimony at the hearing could be read to suggest that,if the innocent board members had clearly
