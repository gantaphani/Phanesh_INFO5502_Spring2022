alfred caronia appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york eric vitaliano,on november,following a jury trial at which caronia was found guilty of conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce,a misdemeanor violation of a and a.specifically,caronia,a pharmaceutical sales representative,promoted the drug xyrem for use,that is,for a purpose not approved by the food and drug administration the fda.caronia argues that he was convicted for his speech for promoting an drug for use in violation of his right of free speech under the first amendment.we agree.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the district court.
statement of the case 
the regulatory scheme 
under the federal food,drug and cosmetic act the fdca,before drugs are distributed into interstate commerce,they must be approved by the fda for specific uses.a.to obtain fda approval,drug manufacturers are required to demonstrate,through clinical trials,the safety and efficacy of a new drug for each intended use or indication.d see weinberger hynson,
once,prescription drugs can be prescribed by doctors for both and unapproved uses the fda generally does not regulate how physicians use approved drugs.see buckman plaintiffs legal,weaver reagen,cir john osborn,can i tell you the truth a comparative perspective on regulating off label scientific and medical information,yale health pol y ethics,physicians may prescribe drugs for any therapeutic use that is appropriate in their medical judgment.randall stafford,regulating off label drug use rethinking the role of the fda,engl.med,discussing study of common drugs where use accounted for approximately percent of prescriptions.
indeed,courts and the fda have recognized the propriety and potential public value of unapproved or drug use.see buckman,at use is an accepted and necessary corollary of the fda mission to regulate in this area without directly interfering with the practice of medicine.weaver,at fda approved indications were not intended to limit or interfere with the practice of medicine nor to preclude physicians from using their best judgment in the interest of the patient.internal quotation marks omitted food and drug administration,draft guidance,good reprint practices for the distribution of medical journal articles and medical or scientific reference publications on unapproved new uses of approved drugs and approved or cleared medical devices o uses or treatment regimens may be important and may even constitute a medically recognized standard of care.the fda itself has observed 
once a drug has been approved for marketing,a physician may prescribe it for uses or in treatment regimens or patient populations that are not included in approved labeling.such unapproved or,more precisely,unlabeled uses may be appropriate and rational in certain circumstances,and may,in fact,reflect approaches to drug therapy that have been extensively reported in medical literature.
food and drug administration,fda drug bulletin,fda drug bull.
the fdca prohibits misbranding,or t he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is misbranded.a.a drug is misbranded if,inter alia,its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use,f,which fda regulations define as directions under which the lay person can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended,fda regulations define intended use by reference to the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for the labeling of drugs,which may be demonstrated by,among other evidence,oral or written statements by such persons or their representatives and the circumstances that the article is,with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives,offered and used for a purpose for which it is neither labeled nor advertised.
the consequences for misbranding are criminal.a i f any person commits such a violation such persons shall be imprisoned for not more than three years or fined not more than,or both.pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives can face misdemeanor charges for misbranding or felony charges for fraudulent misbranding.a see osborn,can i tell you the truth,supra,at collecting cases.the government has repeatedly prosecuted and obtained convictions against pharmaceutical companies and their representatives for misbranding based on their promotion.see,judgment,united states glaxosmithkline,llc,cr rwz,ecf doc.july,information,glaxosmithkline,cr rwz,ecf doc.july,judgment,united states merck sharp dohme,cr pbs,ecf doc.may,information,merck,cr pbs,ecf doc,agreed order of forfeiture,united states abbott,cr sgw,ecf doc.may,as a result of the guilty plea to the information information,abbott,cr sgw,ecf doc.may,judgment,united states allergan,cr ode,ecf doc,information,allergan,cr ode,ecf doc,see sentencing transcript,merck,cr pbs,ecf doc.april,i want to emphasize that marketing has been a big problem i hope in a way that the fact that all these cases are being pressed by the federal and state governments,the state attorney generals,will be a signal that it is acceptable conduct.see also press release,department of justice,glaxosmithkline to plead guilty and pay billion to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data,largest health care fraud settlement in history july,osborn,can i tell you the truth,supra,at.
the fdca and its accompanying regulations do not expressly prohibit the promotion or marketing of drugs for use.the regulations do recognize that promotional statements by a pharmaceutical company or its representatives can serve as proof of a drug intended use.see.promotional statements could thus presumably constitute evidence of an intended use of a drug that the fda has not approved.see id.the fda,however,has concluded that a n approved drug that is marketed for an unapproved use whether in labeling or not is misbranded because the labeling of such drug does not include adequate directions for use.see fda,draft guidance,supra,at quoting f accord united states caronia,d,see also gov t br.contending no set of directions can constitute adequate labeling for drug use.thus,the government has treated promotional speech as more than merely evidence of a drug intended use it has construed the fdca to prohibit promotional speech as misbranding itself.
orphan medical and xyrem 
orphan medical,orphan,now known as jazz pharmaceutical,was a pharmaceutical company that primarily developed drugs to treat pain,sleep disorders,and central nervous system disorders.orphan manufactured the drug xyrem,a powerful central nervous system depressant.in,after jazz pharmaceuticals acquired orphan,jazz continued to manufacture and sell xyrem,grossing million in combined xyrem sales in.
xyrem can cause serious side effects,including difficulty breathing while asleep,confusion,abnormal thinking,depression,nausea,vomiting,dizziness,headache,bedwetting,and sleepwalking.if abused,xyrem can cause additional medical problems,including seizures,dependence,severe withdrawal,coma,and death.
xyrem active ingredient is ghb.ghb has been federally classified as the date rape drug for its use in the commission of sexual assaults.
b.the fda regulation of xyrem 
despite the risks associated with xyrem and ghb,the fda approved xyrem for two medical indications.in july,the fda approved xyrem to treat narcolepsy patients who experience cataplexy,a condition associated with weak or paralyzed muscles.in november,the fda approved xyrem to treat narcolepsy patients with excessive daytime sleepiness eds,a neurological disorder caused by the brain inability to regulate cycles.
to protect against its serious safety concerns,in,the fda required a black box warning to accompany xyrem.the black box warning is the most serious warning placed on prescription medication labels.xyrem black box labeling stated,among other things,that the drug safety and efficacy were not established in patients under years of age,and the drug had very limited experience among elderly patients.
to identify patients suffering side effects from the drug,the fda also regulated xyrem distribution,allowing only one centralized missouri pharmacy to distribute xyrem nationally.
caronia employment with orphan 
in march,orphan hired caronia as a specialty sales consultant to promote xyrem.caronia primarily worked in queens,nassau,and suffolk counties.caronia salary was based on his individual sales.
in july,caronia started orphan speaker programs for xyrem.speaker programs enlist physicians,for pay,to speak to other physicians about drug use.orphan speaker programs for xyrem presented the benefits of the drug among patients with cataplexy and narcolepsy.orphan hired peter gleason to promote xyrem through its speaker programs.
under orphan procedures,if caronia,as a sales consultant for xyrem,was asked about the use of xyrem,he was not permitted to answer instead,when such questions were posed,orphan sales consultants would fill out medical information request forms and send them to orphan,and orphan would send information to the inquiring physician in contrast,physicians employed by orphan as promotional speakers for xyrem were permitted to answer use questions their responses were often informed by their own experiences with xyrem.
caronia participation in the conspiracy 
in the spring of,the federal government launched an investigation of orphan and gleason.the investigation focused on the promotion of xyrem.caronia and gleason were on two occasions as they promoted xyrem for unapproved uses,including unapproved indications and unapproved subpopulations.the first conversation was recorded on october,between caronia and stephen charno,a physician who,as a government cooperator,posed as a prospective xyrem customer.the second conversation was recorded on november,it taped a meeting arranged by caronia to introduce charno to gleason.
on october,caronia plainly promoted the use of xyrem in unapproved indications with charno 
caronia and right now the indication is for narcolepsy with cataplexy excessive daytime and fragmented sleep,but because of the properties that it has it going to insomnia,fibromyalgia,periodic leg movement,restless leg,ahh also looking at ahh parkinson and other sleep disorders are underway such as 
charno okay,so then so then it could be used for muscle disorders and chronic pain and 
caronia right.
charno and daytime fatigue and excessive sleepiness and stuff like that 
caronia absolutely.absolutely.ahh with the fibromyalgia.
october,recording tr.i at.caronia further directed charno to list different diagnosis codes when prescribing xyrem,for insurance purposes,including fibromyalgia,chronic fatigue,or chronic pain.
on separate occasions,caronia and gleason each explained to prospective that xyrem could be used with patients under age sixteen,an unapproved xyrem subpopulation 
caronia um,the youngest patients we have are sixteen in the studies as old as.ahh there have been reports of patients as young as fourteen using it and obviously greater than.it a very safe drug.
october,recording tr.i at.
gleason well,it actually approved for sixteen and above um,i had people under thirteen and i certainly talked to neurologists that have narcoleptics between eight and ten but i start at the dose,but if they real frail i only start with the dose.
november,recording tr.ii at.
proceedings below 
a.the charges 
on july,a grand jury returned its first indictment against caronia.the charging document at issue on this appeal,however,is the superseding information filed by the government on august,which charged caronia with the following two misdemeanor offenses 
count one conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce in violation of a and a and 
count two introducing a misbranded drug,xyrem,into interstate commerce,in violation of a and a.
with respect to count one,the information alleged a conspiracy.the first prong charged that between approximately march and march,caronia,together with others,did knowingly and intentionally conspire to introduce xyrem and cause the introduction of xyrem into interstate commerce when xyrem was misbranded within the meaning of the fdca.inf.the second prong alleged that i t was part of the conspiracy that caronia,together with others,marketed xyrem for medical indications that were not approved by the fda when,as they well knew and believed,xyrem labeling lacked adequate directions for and warnings against such uses,where such uses could be dangerous to the user health.inf.
the information alleged,in count one,that caronia,together with others,committed and caused to be committed,the following two overt acts.inf.
on or about october,caronia promoted xyrem to charno,a physician,so as to cause charno to prescribe xyrem for fibromyalgia,excessive daytime sleepiness,muscle disorders,chronic pain and fatigue,which were indications.
on or about november,caronia introduced charno to gleason,a physician,who was paid by orphan and whom orphan used to promote xyrem for indications,including fibromyalgia,excessive daytime sleepiness,weight loss and chronic fatigue.
with respect to count two,the information alleged that between approximately march and march,caronia was marketing xyrem for medical indications that were not approved by the fda when,as the defendant then and there well knew and believed,xyrem labeling lacked adequate directions for such uses and adequate warnings against such uses where uses could be dangerous to the user health.inf.
additionally,the information alleged a drug that was marketed to the public for an indication or use did not contain adequate directions for use because such an indication or use and related information were not included in the labeling for the drug.inf.the information further stated xyrem labeling lacked adequate directions for such uses and adequate warnings against such uses where such uses could be dangerous to the user health.inf.
orphan and gleason were also charged under the misbranding provisions of the fdca both pled guilty.united states caronia.at.
caronia pre trial motion to dismiss 
on october,before trial,caronia moved to dismiss the charges against him.in part,caronia argued that the application of the fdca misbranding provisions to his promotional statements unconstitutionally restricted his right to free speech under the first amendment and that the provisions were unconstitutionally vague and broad.
on september,the district court denied caronia motion,including his first amendment challenge,which it recognized as raising constitutional issues very much unsettled,not only in this circuit but nationwide.id.at.although ruling for the government,the district court rejected the government argument that caronia was being prosecuted for the unlawful conduct of misbranding and conspiring to misbrand a drug and not for his promotional speech,the latter of which the government contended only constituted proof of xyrem intended use.see id.at.the court observed that the criminal information allege d caronia promotion of uses of an drug,and concluded that caronia stood charged with a crime the actus reus of which was first amendment speech.id.at.nevertheless,the district court held that,to the extent the fdca criminalizes speech,the law passed constitutional muster under the commercial speech doctrine because the fdca was not more extensive than necessary to achieve the fda objectives.id.at.
c.the trial 
the case was tried before a jury from october to october.
the record makes clear that the government prosecuted caronia for his promotion,in violation of the fdca.the government,in its summation and rebuttal,repeatedly asserted that caronia was guilty because he,with others,conspired to promote and market xyrem for use.for example,the government argued 
caronia is promoting,he marketing a dangerous drug for use not approved by the fda id.at 
he knew the rules you ca promote and market xyrem for uses that have not been approved by the fda.he admits it id.at 
caronia conspired through some act of misbranding,and that act of misbranding was the promotion on october and november,marketing a drug for unapproved uses id.at 
that misbranding.that promoting and marketing a drug by a pharmaceutical company representative for muscle disorders,chronic pain,daytime fatigue,excessive sleepiness id.at and 
caronia was promoting,promoting,selling,selling,trying to get charno to prescribe xyrem.he tried on the.he tried with gleason on the id.at 
thus,the government theory of prosecution identified caronia speech alone as the proscribed conduct.
the district court,in its jury charge,reinforced the idea that caronia promotional speech was enough to support a guilty verdict 
a misbranded drug may be shown by a promotion of the drug by a distributor for an intended use different from the use for which the drug was approved by the fda.
the manufacturer,its agents,representatives and employees,are not permitted to promote uses for a drug that have not been cleared by the united states food and drug administration.these uses are commonly referred to as uses because they are not included in the drug labeling.
prior to jury deliberation,the district court provided a proposed verdict sheet to the parties.with respect to count one,the verdict sheet read as follows 
how do you find defendant,alfred caronia,on count one of the information 
a conspiracy to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a drug,xyrem,that was misbranded 
b conspiracy to do an act with respect to a drug,xyrem,when such drug was held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce when such act would result in xyrem being misbranded 
verdict sheet,ecf doc,united states caronia,cr.the district court overruled caronia objection that the verdict sheet was erroneous and therefore permitted the jury to reach an inconsistent verdict.
on october,the jury found caronia guilty as to the first prong of count one of the information question a conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce under a and a.as to the second marketing prong of count one question b,the jury found caronia not guilty.the jury also found caronia not guilty of count two of the information.
caronia post trial motion for acquittal 
after the jury verdict and before judgment was entered,caronia renewed his rule motion for acquittal.see.on december,after briefing,the district court denied the motion.
caronia sentence 
on november,the district court sentenced caronia to one year of probation,hours of community service,and a special assessment.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,caronia principally argues that the misbranding provisions of the fdca prohibit promotion,and therefore,unconstitutionally restrict speech caronia argues that the first amendment does not permit the government to prohibit and criminalize a pharmaceutical manufacturer truthful and promotion of an drug to physicians for use where such use is not itself illegal and others are permitted to engage in such speech.
we review caronia first amendment challenge to his conspiracy conviction de novo.see.bar ass united states,f d,cir we review constitutional challenges to a federal statute de novo.see also united states dhafir,cir same.we agree that caronia conviction must be vacated,but for narrower reasons than he urges.
while the fdca makes it a crime to misbrand or conspire to misbrand a drug,the statute and its accompanying regulations do not expressly prohibit or criminalize promotion.see supra.rather,the fdca and fda regulations reference promotion only as evidence of a drug intended use.see discussing how drug intended use can be demonstrated.thus,under the principle of constitutional avoidance,explained infra,we construe the fdca as not criminalizing the simple promotion of a drug use because such a construction would raise first amendment concerns.because we conclude from the record in this case that the government prosecuted caronia for mere promotion and the district court instructed the jury that it could convict on that theory,we vacate the judgment of conviction.
we begin by addressing the government contention that caronia promotion was used only as evidence of intent in this case.finding the government argument unpersuasive,we turn to the principal question on appeal whether the government prosecution of caronia under the fdca only for promoting an drug for use was constitutionally permissible.
speech versus evidence of intent 
the government contends and the dissent agrees that the first amendment is not implicated in this case.specifically,the government argues that p romoting an approved drug for uses is not itself a prohibited act under the fdca and the promotion of uses plays an evidentiary role in determining whether a drug is misbranded under f.gov t br.citing.the government contends that caronia was not prosecuted for his speech,but that caronia promotion of xyrem for use served merely as evidence of intent,or evidence that the uses were intended ones for which xyrem labeling failed to provide any directions.gov t br.
even assuming the government can offer evidence of a defendant promotion to prove a drug intended use and,thus,mislabeling for that intended use that is not what happened in this case.
first,the government contention that it did not prosecute caronia for promoting the use of an drug is belied by its conduct and arguments at trial.the excerpts quoted above demonstrate that the government repeatedly argued that caronia engaged in criminal conduct by promoting and marketing the use of xyrem,an drug.see supra.the district court record thus confirms overwhelmingly that caronia was,in fact,prosecuted and convicted for promoting xyrem.see supra.indeed,in the government summation and rebuttal at trial,caronia promotion of xyrem is highlighted over forty times.see trial tr.
second,the government assertion now that it used caronia efforts to promote xyrem for use only as evidence of intent is simply not true.even if the government could have used caronia speech as evidence of intent,the district court record clearly shows that the government did not so limit its use of that evidence.see mitchell,at instructing that,when speech is introduced as evidence of intent,s uch testimony is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the statements are not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion with our own government quoting haupt.united states.the government never argued in summation or rebuttal that the promotion was evidence of intent.see trial tr.the government never suggested that caronia engaged in any form of misbranding other than the promotion of the use of an drug.the government never suggested,for example,that caronia conspired to place false or deficient labeling on a drug.see a n.rather,the record makes clear that the government prosecuted caronia for his promotion and marketing efforts.
third,the government summation and the district court instruction left the jury to understand that caronia speech was itself the proscribed conduct.see supra.indeed,the district court flatly stated to the jury that pharmaceutical representatives are prohibited from engaging in promotion.see id.although the district court explained the remaining elements of misbranding and conspiring to misbrand to the jury,this specific instruction together with the government summation would have led the jury to believe that caronia promotional speech was,by itself,determinative of his guilt.see generally united states dyer,cir stating specific jury instruction may be reviewed in isolation if it is so far removed from the standards set by the law that the appellate court is convinced that the jury might have been misled internal quotation marks omitted.
fourth,the government clearly prosecuted caronia for his words for his speech.a pharmaceutical representative promotion of an drug use is speech.as the supreme court has held speech in aid of pharmaceutical marketing is a form of expression protected by the free speech clause of the first amendment.sorrell ims health.here,the proscribed conduct for which caronia was prosecuted was precisely his speech in aid of pharmaceutical marketing.
accordingly,we conclude that the government did prosecute caronia for his speech,and we turn to whether the prosecution was permissible.
ii.the prosecution of caronia speech 
while the government and the fda have construed the fdca misbranding provisions to prohibit promotion by pharmaceutical manufacturers,see supra see fda,draft guidance,supra,at,as we have observed,the fdca itself does not expressly prohibit or criminalize offlabel promotion.see supra.the fdca defines misbranding in terms of whether a drug labeling is adequate for its intended use,and permits the government to prove intended use by reference to promotional statements made by drug manufacturers or their representatives.see id.assuming that this approach to the use of evidence of speech is permissible it affords little support to the government on this appeal because caronia was not prosecuted on this basis.rather,the government theory of prosecution identified caronia speech alone as the proscribed conduct.the district court accepted this theory.
to the extent there is any ambiguity as to whether promotion is tantamount to illegal misbranding,we construe the fdca narrowly to avoid a serious constitutional question.see skilling united states,instructing courts to avoid constitutional difficulties by adopting a limiting interpretation if such a construction is fairly possible internal quotation marks and brackets omitted edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,allstate ins.serio,cir thus,the courts will take pains to give a statute a limiting construction in order to avoid a constitutional difficulty.
as we now explain,we decline the government invitation to construe the fdca misbranding provisions to criminalize the simple promotion of a drug use by pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives because such a construction and a conviction obtained under the government application of the fdca would run afoul of the first amendment.
applicable first amendment doctrine 
the first amendment protects against government regulation and suppression of speech on account of its content.turner broad.system,see ward.rock against racism,city of paul.speech restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny that is,the government must show that the regulation at issue is narrowly tailored to serve or promote a compelling government interest.see brown entm t merchs.ass n,citing,at.government regulations are presumptively invalid,at.meanwhile,regulation and regulation of commercial speech expression solely related to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience are subject to intermediate scrutiny.see turner,at cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm of.criminal regulatory schemes,moreover,warrant even more careful scrutiny.see holder humanitarian law project,applying more rigorous scrutiny id.at breyer,dissenting it is not surprising that the majority,in determining the constitutionality of criminally prohibiting the plaintiffs proposed activities,would apply a more demanding standard.indeed,where,as here,a statute applies criminal penalties i should think we would scrutinize the statute and justifications strictly.internal quotation marks and citations omitted citing cases see also city of houston hill,criminal statutes must be scrutinized with particular care.internal citations omitted.
in applying these principles,we have a benefit not available to the district court the supreme court decision in sorrell ims health,a case involving speech restrictions on pharmaceutical marketing.in sorrell,the vermont prescription confidentiality law the vpcl prohibited pharmaceutical companies and similar entities from using information for marketing purposes it was challenged on first amendment grounds.id.at see also.stat,tit.e.
the sorrell court held that s peech in aid of pharmaceutical marketing is a form of expression protected by the first amendment the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the constitution.id.at.the court held that the vermont statute set forth content and restrictions,and that the statute was therefore subject to heightened scrutiny.id.at.because the vpcl disfavored speech with a particular content marketing when expressed by certain disfavored speakers pharmaceutical manufacturers,the court held that it unconstitutionally restricted speech.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,sorrell engaged in a inquiry.first,the court considered whether the government regulation restricting speech was content and.see id.at.the court held that it was the regulation was therefore subject to heightened scrutiny and was presumptively invalid.see id.second,the court considered whether the government had shown that the restriction on speech was consistent with the first amendment under the applicable level of heightened scrutiny.id.at.the court did not decide the level of heightened scrutiny to be applied,that is,strict,intermediate,or some other form of heightened scrutiny.id.rather,after observing that i n the ordinary case,it is all but dispositive to conclude that a law is,the court concluded that the vermont statute was unconstitutional even under the lesser intermediate standard set forth in central hudson.id.at see cent.hudson,at.the court further observed that the outcome is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied.sorrell.at.
in considering whether the government had shown that the restriction on speech was consistent with the first amendment,the sorrell court turned to central hudson.see id.at.central hudson sets forth a test to determine whether commercial speech is protected by the first amendment.cent.hudson,at.first,as a threshold matter,to warrant first amendment protection,the speech in question must not be misleading and must concern lawful activity.id see infra note and accompanying text.second,to justify regulations restricting speech,the asserted government interest must be substantial.id.third,the regulation must directly advance the governmental interest asserted,to a material degree,liquormart,rhode island,quoting edenfield fane.a commercial speech regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.liquormart,at quoting,at.fourth,the regulation must be narrowly drawn,and may not be more extensive than necessary to serve the interest,cent.hudson,at see also sorrell.at citing bd.of tr.of state of fox,thompson states med,u.the government can not completely suppress information when narrower restrictions on expression would serve its interests as well.cent.hudson,at.under the commercial speech inquiry,it is the government burden to justify its law as consistent with the first amendment.sorrell.at citing thompson,at.
application 
in prosecuting caronia,the government construed the fdca misbranding provisions to prohibit and criminalize the promotion of drug use.we review the government theory of prosecution under the sorrell court analysis to determine whether it runs afoul of the first amendment.first,we conclude that the government construction of the fdca misbranding provisions imposes content and restrictions on speech subject to heightened scrutiny.second,we conclude the government can not justify a criminal prohibition of promotion even under central hudson less rigorous intermediate test.
heightened scrutiny 
the government construction of the fdca misbranding provisions to prohibit and criminalize the promotion of drug use by pharmaceutical manufacturers is content and,and,therefore,subject to heightened scrutiny.see id.
first,the government interpretation of the fdca misbranding provisions to prohibit promotion is because it distinguishes between favored speech and disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed.see turner,at accord sorrell.at.under this construction,speech about the use of drugs is permitted,while certain speech about the use of drugs that is,uses not approved by the government is prohibited,even though the use itself is not.see a,a.indeed,the content of the regulated speech drives this construction of the fdca as in sorrell,the express purpose and practical effect of the government ban on promotion is to diminish the effectiveness of drug marketing by manufacturers.see sorrell.at.
second,this construction is because it targets one kind of speaker pharmaceutical manufacturers while allowing others to speak without restriction.see id.at.in sorrell,pharmaceutical companies were barred from obtaining and using information for marketing purposes,but a wide range of other speakers,including private and academic researchers,could acquire and use the information.id.similarly,here,because prescriptions and drug use are legal,the government application of the fdca permits physicians and academics,for example,to speak about use without consequence,while the same speech is prohibited when delivered by pharmaceutical manufacturers.see a,a.this construction thus has the effect of preventing pharmaceutical manufacturers and only pharmaceutical manufacturers from communicating with physicians in an effective and informative manner.sorrell.at.
additionally,a claim to first amendment protection here is more compelling than in sorrell because this case involves a criminal regulatory scheme subject to more careful scrutiny.see a humanitarian law project.at.
accordingly,the government construction of the fdca misbranding provisions to prohibit and criminalize promotion is content and,and subject to heightened scrutiny under sorrell.
central hudson 
the first two prongs of central hudson are easily satisfied here.first,promoting drug use concerns lawful activity drug use,and the promotion of drug use is not in and of itself false or misleading see cent.hudson,at.second,the government asserted interests in drug safety and public health are substantial.see id.specifically,the government asserts an interest in preserving the effectiveness and integrity of the fdca drug approval process,and an interest in reducing patient exposure to unsafe and ineffective drugs.see fda brown williamson tobacco,o ne of the fdca core objectives is to ensure that any product regulated by the fda is safe and effective for its intended use.
the third and fourth prongs of central hudson require that the regulation directly advance the government interests and be narrowly drawn.see cent.hudson,at.we turn to the third and fourth prongs below.
direct advancement 
the government construction of the fdca as prohibiting promotion does not,by itself,withstand scrutiny under central hudson third prong.first,drug usage is not unlawful,and the fda drug approval process generally contemplates that approved drugs will be used in ways.in effect,even if pharmaceutical manufacturers are barred from promotion,physicians can prescribe,and patients can use,drugs for purposes.see supra.as drug use itself is not prohibited,it does not follow that prohibiting the truthful promotion of drug usage by a particular class of speakers would directly further the government goals of preserving the efficacy and integrity of the fda drug approval process and reducing patient exposure to unsafe and ineffective drugs.see sorrell.at holding government interest in protecting physician privacy not directly served when law made information available to all but a narrow class of disfavored speakers.
second,prohibiting promotion by a pharmaceutical manufacturer while simultaneously allowing use paternalistically interferes with the ability of physicians and patients to receive potentially relevant treatment information such barriers to information about use could inhibit,to the public detriment,informed and intelligent treatment decisions.see.bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,discussing highly paternalistic approach of government prohibitions on free flow of information see also sorrell.at the fear that physicians,sophisticated and experienced customers,would make bad decisions if given truthful information can not justify burdens on speech.citing sources liquormart,at b ans against truthful,nonmisleading commercial speech usually rest solely on the offensive assumption that the public will respond irrationally to the truth the first amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good.in fact,in granting safe harbor to manufacturers by permitting the dissemination of information through scientific journals,the fda itself recognizes that public health can be served when health care professionals receive truthful and scientific and medical information on unapproved uses of approved drugs.dep t of health and human,good reprint practices,supra,at iii,v see.legal found.henney,discussing fda safe harbor,where certain forums for discussion,such as continuing medical education programs and scientific publications,would not be used against manufacturers in misbranding enforcement actions.
here,as the fda recognizes,it is the physician role to consider multiple factors,including a drug status,to determine the best course of action for her patient.see fda drug,supra,at buckman,at weaver,at see also thompson,at discussing the general rule that the speaker and the audience,not the government,assess the value of the information presented quoting edenfield,at see also.bd.of pharmacy,at t he choice is not ours to make or the legislature.while some information could certainly be misleading or unhelpful,this case does not involve false or misleading promotion.see supra note.moreover,in the fields of medicine and public health,where information can save lives,it only furthers the public interest to ensure that decisions about the use of prescription drugs,including usage,are intelligent and.see sorrell.at,thompson,at quoting.bd.of pharmacy,at.
the government construction of the fdca essentially legalizes the outcome use but prohibits the free flow of information that would inform that outcome.if the government objective is to shepherd physicians to prescribe drugs only,criminalizing manufacturer promotion of use while permitting others to promote such use to physicians is an indirect and questionably effective means to achieve that goal.thus,the government construction of the fdca misbranding provisions does not directly advance its interest in reducing patient exposure to drugs or in preserving the efficacy of the fda drug approval process because the use of such drugs continues to be generally lawful.accordingly,the government prohibition of promotion by pharmaceutical manufacturers provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.see liquormart,at quoting cent.hudson,at.
narrowly drawn 
the last prong of central hudson requires the government regulation to be narrowly drawn to further the interests served.cent.hudson,at.here,the government construction of the fdca to impose a complete and criminal ban on promotion by pharmaceutical manufacturers is more extensive than necessary to achieve the government substantial interests.see id.numerous,less alternatives are available,as are penalties.see thompson,at.
to advance the integrity of the fda drug approval process and increase the safety of drug use,the government could pursue several alternatives without excessive first amendment restrictions.see cent.hudson,at.for example,if the government is concerned about the use of drugs,it could more directly address the issue.if the government is concerned that promotion may mislead physicians,it could guide physicians and patients in differentiating between misleading and false promotion,exaggerations and embellishments,and truthful or information.see osborn,can i tell you the truth,supra,at.the government could develop its warning or disclaimer systems,or develop safety tiers within the market,to distinguish between drugs.see coleen klasmeier and martin redish,off label prescription advertising,the fda and the first amendment a study in the values of commercial speech protection,am.med.the government could require pharmaceutical manufacturers to list all applicable or intended indications when they first apply for fda approval,enabling physicians,the government,and patients to track a drug development.to minimize use,or manufacturer evasion of the approval process for such use,the government could create other limits,including ceilings or caps on prescriptions.the fda could further remind physicians and manufacturers of,and even perhaps further regulate,the legal liability surrounding promotion and treatment decisions finally,where drug use is exceptionally concerning,the government could prohibit the use altogether.see,bader,at citing e prohibiting use of human growth hormone.the possibilities are numerous indeed.
if the first amendment means anything,it means that regulating speech must be a last not first resort.thompson,at.the government has not established a reasonable fit among its interests in drug safety and public health,the lawfulness of use,and its construction of the fdca to prohibit promotion.see fox,at.the government interests could be served equally well by more limited and targeted restrictions on speech.see cent.hudson,at.the government contends that these alternative means of reducing patient exposure to unsafe,untested drugs and maintaining the integrity of the process are indefensible gov t br,because they are not administrable,feasible,or otherwise effective.in the absence of any support,such conclusory assertions are insufficient to sustain the government burden of demonstrating that the proposed alternatives are less effective than its proposed construction of the fdca in furthering the government interests identified.see ashcroft aclu.
accordingly,even if speech can be used as evidence of a drug intended use,we decline to adopt the government construction of the fdca misbranding provisions to prohibit manufacturer promotion alone as it would unconstitutionally restrict free speech.we construe the misbranding provisions of the fdca as not prohibiting and criminalizing the truthful promotion of prescription drugs.our conclusion is limited to drugs for which use is not prohibited,and we do not hold,of course,that the fda can not regulate the marketing of prescription drugs.we conclude simply that the government can not prosecute pharmaceutical manufacturers and their representatives under the fdca for speech promoting the lawful,use of an drug.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the district court.
alfred caronia was convicted of conspiring to introduce a prescription drug into interstate commerce with the intent that it be used in ways its labeling neither disclosed nor described.this intent was revealed,inter alia,through his speech.because the first amendment has never prohibited the government from using speech as evidence of motive or intent,see wisconsin mitchell,i would affirm caronia conviction.by holding,instead,that caronia conviction must be vacated and on the theory that whatever the elements of the crime for which he was duly tried,he was in fact convicted for promoting a drug for unapproved uses,in supposed violation of the first amendment the majority calls into question the very foundations of our system of drug regulation.i do not believe that the supreme court precedents compel such a result.i therefore respectfully dissent.
intended uses 
alfred caronia was convicted of conspiring to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.see a.under the federal food,drug and cosmetic act fdca,one way in which a drug is misbranded is if its labeling lacks adequate directions for layperson use.see f.whether a drug directions are adequate for use depends on the drug intended uses.this is because the food and drug administration fda defines adequate directions for use as directions under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended.emphasis added.directions are adequate only if they include,for example,s tatements of all uses for which such drug is intended,and usual quantities of dose for each of the uses for which it is intended.a,b.this labeling provision is in part merely a disclosure requirement for the benefit of a drug lay users.but some uses of drugs are never safe,at least for a layperson because it is impossible to provide adequate directions for such uses,this provision also effectively prohibits introducing drugs into interstate commerce with the intent that the drugs be used in ways that are unsafe for laypersons 
the labeling on the drug at issue in this case,xyrem,stated that it was indicated for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.at all relevant times,the fda had not approved xyrem for any other uses.xyrem labeling did not state any other intended uses for the drug,nor provide directions for any other intended uses.unsurprisingly,then,caronia did not argue before the jury that xyrem labeling included adequate directions for the uses that he was alleged to have promoted.rather,his trial focused on whether caronia agreed with his employer,orphan medical,orphan,and with others associated with orphan,that xyrem would be distributed for use.
determining a product intended uses has long been a central concern of food and drug law.the concept originated in the pure food and drugs act of,stat,which prohibited introducing any adulterated or misbranded drug into interstate commerce,id,stat.at,and which defined drug to include any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used for the cure,mitigation,or prevention of disease,id,stat.at emphasis added.courts found violations of that statute where,as in this case,a manufacturer speech demonstrated an intended use that brought it within the scope of the statute such that its label was required affirmatively to disclose certain information.see,united states eleven cartons of drug labeled in part vapex,holding that vapex was intended to be used for the cure,mitigation or prevention of disease,and was thus a drug,because its label stated that it was effective to relieve a head cold instantly,id.at and further holding that the drug was misbranded,even assum ing that the inhalation of vapex is innocuous,because it was required to contain a declaration on the label of the alcoholic content yet failed to do so,id.at.
when congress expanded the law three decades later in the food,drug,and cosmetic act of,stat,its revisions remained anchored to the concept of intended uses.the definition of drug was broadened to also include articles intended to affect the structure or any function of the body,id.g,stat.at emphasis added,and the parallel category of devices was created and similarly defined in terms of intended uses,see id.h,stat.at.at the same time,congress broadened the definition of a misbranded drug to include any drug with labeling not bearing adequate directions for use.id.f,stat.at.under the act,courts upheld convictions for introducing drugs into interstate commerce that lacked adequate labeling for their intended uses,and routinely relied on oral representations made by authorized sales distributors to determine a product intended uses.irons,united states,cir upholding a conviction for introducing into interstate commerce articles of drug that were misbranded in that their labeling failed to bear adequate directions for use for the various diseases and conditions for which they were intended,and relying on both graphic materials distributed and testimony of oral representations to users and prospective users show ing that the products shipped were to be used as drugs.
the modern fdca continues to define drugs and devices on the basis of an article intended uses.see g b,c h.the concept of intended uses therefore largely defines the scope of the fda regulatory authority.see fda brown williamson tobacco.to put the matter in practical terms it is because of the intended uses principle that hardware stores are generally free to sell bottles of turpentine,but may not label those bottles,hamlin wizard oil there is no sore it will not heal,no pain it will not subdue.
according to regulations that have remained essentially unchanged for sixty years,see,codified at o,the fda defines a drug intended uses on an objective,rather than subjective,basis 
the words intended uses or words of similar import refer to the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for the labeling of drugs.the intent is determined by such persons expressions or may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the article.this objective intent may,for example,be shown by labeling claims,advertising matter,or oral or written statements by such persons or their representatives.it may be shown by the circumstances that the article is,with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives,offered and used for a purpose for which it is neither labeled nor advertised i f a manufacturer knows,or has knowledge of facts that would give him notice,that a drug introduced into interstate commerce by him is to be used for conditions,purposes,or uses other than the ones for which he offers it,he is required to provide adequate labeling for such a drug which accords with such other uses to which the article is to be put.
as previously noted,caronia did not contend at trial that xyrem label which provided dosage and other instructions for xyrem use in the treatment of narcolepsy patients who experience cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness provided adequate instructions for any other use.in this case,then,xyrem was misbranded and caronia could be guilty of conspiring with others to introduce it into interstate commerce in such a state if the conduct and statements of the persons legally responsible for labeling the drug or the conduct and statements of their representatives demonstrated an objective intent that xyrem be used for purposes.
ii.the first amendment and speech as evidence of intent 
it is well settled that t he first amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.wisconsin mitchell.to demonstrate that xyrem was intended for uses and thus that it was misbranded the prosecution in this case relied,inter alia,upon caronia statements that xyrem could be used to treat insomnia,f ibromyalgia,periodic leg movement,restless leg,parkinson and because caronia speech was used simply as evidence of xyrem intended uses,i agree with the government that caronia conviction does not run afoul of the first amendment.
the majority unsurprisingly agrees that speech may be used as evidence of intent.it even leaves open the possibility that speech may serve as evidence of intent to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.see op.at.the majority nonetheless concludes that in this particular case the government clearly prosecuted caronia for his words for his speech and not for conspiring to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.op.at.i disagree that the government prosecuted caronia for his speech.i also fail to see how the majority reasoning would ever allow such speech to support a conviction under a.for this reason,i conclude the majority opinion is fundamentally at odds both with mitchell and with the underlying premises behind much of the fdca regulatory scheme.
i do not agree with the majority that caronia was prosecuted and convicted for promoting xyrem.op.at.the district court correctly instructed the jury as to all the elements necessary to prove a conspiracy,as well as the additional elements,derived from a,to prove the conspiracy unlawful purpose 
to sustain the charge of conspiracy to introduce into interstate commerce a misbranded drug,the government must prove the element s of conspiracy as i previously described them for you and must also prove the following elements of misbranding through the introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce.
first,the government must prove that the defendant conspired to introduce or conspired to cause to be introduced a drug into interstate commerce or conspired to deliver a drug for introduction into interstate commerce or conspired to cause a drug to be delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.
second,the government must prove that the drug was misbranded,as i previously defined that term.
if you find that the government has satisfied its burden with respect to each of these elements,along with satisfying the elements of conspiracy as i have previously explained them to you,then you should find the defendant guilty of that prong of the conspiracy count charging him with conspiracy to misbrand in violation of section a.
the majority makes much of the fact that the district court also instructed the jury that a misbranded drug may be shown by a promotion of the drug by a distributor for an intended use different from the use for which the drug was approved by the food and drug administration.but this wholly appropriate charge was but part of the district court explanation of the objective intent standard with respect to intended uses 
the intended use of a drug can be determined from its label,accompanying labels,promotional material,advertising or any other relevant source that reveals the manner in which the drug distributors expect the product to be used.a misbranded drug may be shown by a promotion of the drug by a distributor for an intended use different from the use for which the drug was approved by the food and drug administration,the government agency charged with the responsibility for approving a drug use.under code of federal regulations,section,intended use or words of a similar import refer to the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for the labeling of drugs.the intent is determined by such persons expressions or may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the drug.this objective intent may,for example,be shown by labeling claims,advertising matter or oral or written statements by such persons or their representatives.it may be shown by the circumstances that the drug is,with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives,offered and used for a purpose for which it is neither labeled,nor advertised.
granted,in a single sentence at the conclusion of this instruction the district court stated that drug manufacturers are not permitted to promote uses for a drug that have not been cleared by the united states food and drug administration.in context,however,the district court was simply instructing the jury that promotion of an use may demonstrate an objective intent that a drug be used for purposes and thus that it is being placed into interstate commerce without proper labeling.and this,contrary to the majority suggestion,was not error see united states sabhnani,cir admonishing that jury instructions are not to be read in isolation,but in their entirety,to determine whether they communicate the essential ideas to the jury accord united states tran,cir see also cupp naughten,u,a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation,but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.
the majority also focuses on the prosecution summations,arguing that the government did not use caronia promotion of xyrem as evidence of misbranding,but rather prosecuted caronia for his promotion.op.at emphasis added.suffice it to say,however,that any claim that caronia was convicted for his speech,as opposed to his conspiracy,is belied by the fact that,as the majority rightly concedes,the district court explained the elements of conspiracy and misbranding to the jury and instructed that each element must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt.we presume that juries follow their instructions.united states williams,cir.caronia,moreover,objected not at all to the prosecution references to his promotion of xyrem and unsurprisingly,since read in context,the government properly referred to this promotion to prove caronia participation in a conspiracy to distribute xyrem for uses that its labeling neither described nor explained.
at bottom,the majority is troubled that the simple promotion of a drug use can lead to criminal liability under the fdca.op.at.that is,where all that a drug manufacturer or its representative does is sell a prescription drug and promote it for an purpose,the majority concludes that prosecution raises serious first amendment concerns and regardless whether the promotion is presented as mere evidence or as the proscribed conduct itself.the majority conclusion,clearly stated,is that while speech might serve as evidence of other types of mislabeling,such as false or deficient labeling,see op.at,a mislabeling charge simply may not rest on promotion.
this is a departure from precedent.my conclusion here that promotion of a use may demonstrate an objective intent that the drug be used for that purpose has long been endorsed by this circuit.see united states writers research,cir we agree with the district court that,as a matter of law,if was promoted as a treatment or cure for cancer,aids,or other diseases,it is subject to the requirements of the fdca united states v.an article consisting of individually cartoned bottles,cir it is well settled that the intended use of a product may be determined from its label,accompanying labeling,promotional material,advertising,and any other relevant source thus,congress has made a judgment that a product is subject to regulation as a drug if certain promotional claims are made for it.such use of speech,moreover,has never been prohibited by the first amendment.see sorrell ims health,t he first amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech.that is why a ban on hiring may require employers to remove white applicants only signs why an ordinance against outdoor fires might forbid burning a flag and why antitrust laws can prohibit agreements in restraint of trade.citations and some internal quotation marks omitted.
it is true that the introduction of xyrem into interstate commerce by caronia employer was generally legal so long as the drug was not intended to be used for purposes that lacked adequate directions on its labeling.it is also true that,absent caronia speech and speech by other orphan representatives,the jury likely would not have found that xyrem was intended for such uses.consistent with the first amendment,however,otherwise permissible conduct may become impermissible if undertaken with a prohibited motive,and speech may be used as evidence of such a motive.an employer,for example,is generally free to refuse to promote an employee simply because he does not like the employee attitude,but he may not refuse to promote the employee because of her sex.see wisconsin mitchell,at in hishon king spalding,we rejected the argument that title vii infringed employers first amendment rights.the first amendment does not bar using the employer speech to demonstrate his discriminatory motive.see wisconsin mitchell,at citing price waterhouse hopkins,plurality opinion.indeed,as the crimes of attempt,conspiracy,and inducement demonstrate,w ords alone may constitute a criminal offense,even if they spring from the anterior motive to effect political or social change.united states freeman,cir kennedy.see generally kent greenawalt,speech,crime,and the uses of language enumerating crimes that critically involve communication,id.at.simply put,that caronia was otherwise free to introduce xyrem into interstate commerce does not give him a first amendment right to introduce it into interstate commerce for any intended purpose he wished.
caronia attempts to distinguish this line of authority by arguing that he merely discussed a perfectly lawful practice the use of a lawful drug,xyrem,for purposes.appellant reply br.at.but the fact that a physician or a patient could legally use xyrem for an purpose is not enough to make out caronia first amendment claim.there might be no law forbidding the consumption of arsenic.but this would not endow abby and martha with a first amendment right to offer wine to lonely old bachelors with the intent that they drink it.see arsenic and old lace warner.pictures.and any statements abby or martha made suggesting their intent even if all of the statements were truthful and not misleading would not be barred from evidence by the first amendment simply because arsenic might legally be consumed 
although caronia relies heavily on the supreme court decision in thompson western states medical center,that case did not discuss the use of speech as evidence of intent.the statute at issue in western states,as the government conceded before the supreme court,regulated speech directly rather than as evidence of intent.see id.at t he pharmacy,licensed pharmacist,or licensed physician compounding the drug may not advertise or promote the compounding of any particular drug,class of drug,or type of drug quoting c western states,at the government argues that advertising is a fair proxy for actual or intended manufacturing emphasis added.the statute at issue in sorrell ims health,also targeted speech directly.see id.at pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers shall not use information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents quoting.stat,tit,d supp.by contrast,caronia conviction required a finding that xyrem was intended by those responsible for its labeling for an use a finding which may be shown by the circumstances that the article is,with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives,offered and used for a purpose for which it is neither labeled nor advertised.see generally krista hessler carver,a global view of the first amendment constraints on fda,food drug.
put another way,if the jury had concluded there was a reasonable doubt as to whether caronia and orphan actually intended to sell xyrem to caronia customers to introduce it into interstate commerce then caronia could not have been convicted under a,no matter what he said.by contrast,a pharmacy would violate the statute in western states as soon as it advertised the compounding of particular drugs.see at citing c.similarly,a vermont pharmacy would violate the statute in sorrell as soon as it disseminated information for marketing purposes.see.at.speech alone was sufficient to trigger punishment under the challenged statutes in those cases.speech alone is not,however,sufficient to sustain a conviction under u.a.
my analysis here is not original.the circuit reached the same conclusion in whitaker thompson,in which a plaintiff argued that he had a first amendment right to label his product with a drug claim despite its lack of fda approval.the whitaker court disagreed,reasoning that 
assuming that the government may condition the sale of drugs on passage through the elaborate testing that the statute requires,the key step is the fdca principle that classification of a substance as a drug turns on the nature of the claims advanced on its behalf.that principle,in turn,rests on the idea that claims about a product by its manufacturer and vendors,including product labeling,serve as evidence of the sellers intent that consumers will purchase and use the product for a particular purpose and,therefore,as evidence whether the product is or is not a drug.the question is whether this use of speech to infer intent,which in turn renders an otherwise permissible act unlawful,is constitutionally valid.in fact,the first amendment allows the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.thus it is constitutionally permissible for the fda to use speech,in the form of labeling,to infer intent for purposes of determining that the plaintiff proposed sale of saw palmetto extract would constitute the forbidden sale of an unapproved drug.
id.citations and paragraph breaks omitted.caronia attempts to distinguish whitaker by arguing that the drug itself in whitaker could not be sold lawfully,and so there were no lawful uses to promote.appellant reply br.at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.but the product in whitaker saw palmetto,an extract from the pulp and seed of the dwarf american palm,whitaker,at could be sold lawfully so long as it was not a drug,and whether it was a drug depended entirely upon the plaintiff speech,as evidence of his intent,when he offered it for sale.that case is therefore indistinguishable from this case indeed,even if the fda had not approved xyrem for any medical uses at all,caronia could presumably have sold xyrem as an industrial solvent if it happened to be excellent at removing grease and grime.
not every prohibition on conduct undertaken with a certain intent is necessarily constitutional the problem posed by a ban on sending any leaflet with the intent to influence another vote suggests the limits on the analysis here.it remains the case,however,that the simple fact that one is generally allowed to sell something does not imbue one with a constitutional right to sell it for any intended purpose.and the prohibition here on distributing drugs with the intent that they be used for purposes not supported by their labeling is entirely consistent with the broader purposes of the fdca namely,minimizing those occasions on which patients use drugs that have not been shown to be safe and effective.
iii.applying central hudson and sorrell 
finally,even if using caronia speech as evidence of his intent was not necessarily constitutionally permissible in other words,even if the protection afforded to commercial speech requires an analysis of this question where the customers of a product like xyrem may lawfully use it for purposes not addressed in the label,and where the fda does not purport to regulate the claims made by unrelated third parties about the efficacy of such uses,see george evans arnold friede,the food and drug administration regulation of prescription drug manufacturer speech a first amendment analysis,food drug,i believe the correct application of commercial speech principles requires us to uphold caronia conviction.i agree with the majority that our analysis is guided by central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,and sorrell ims health.i conclude,however,that the fdca misbranding provision survives the scrutiny required by those cases because it directly advances a substantial government interest and is narrowly drawn to further that interest.
o ne of the fdca core objectives is to ensure that any product regulated by the fda is safe and effective for its intended use.brown williamson,at internal quotation marks omitted.the fdca is meant to achieve this objective through a rigorous premarket approval process.see.under this process,a manufacturer may not sell a drug without first providing proof to the fda that the drug is safe for use and effective in use.see id.b.there must be substantial evidence,including evidence from clinical investigations,that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have.id.d.
this process is a central,if not the central,feature of the fdca.prior to the passage of the fdca,the government could combat misleading drug claims only through enforcement actions.the act most substantial innovation was to require approval of a drug safety before it could enter the market.wyeth,at.this innovation became even more important after congress amended the fdca in to also require premarket approval of a drug effectiveness for its stated uses.see drug amendments of,stat.behind the amendments were concerns that doctors could not adequately evaluate frequently misleading claims by drug manufacturers without a body of objective,reliable information.see,henry waxman,a history of adverse drug experiences congress had ample evidence to support restrictions on the promotion of prescription drugs,food drug,alan kaplan,fifty years of drug amendments revisited,food drug.
the supreme court has accordingly stated that p reserving the effectiveness and integrity of the fdca new drug approval process is clearly an important governmental interest.western states,at.given the benefits of premarket approval,the government has every reason to want as many drugs as possible to be subject to that approval process.id.
the fdca prohibition on marketing directly advances this interest.if drug manufacturers were allowed to promote drugs for uses,they would have little incentive to seek fda approval for those uses.prohibiting such promotion is thus one of the few mechanisms available to encourage participation in the approval process.washington legal foundation friedman,d,vacated in part,washington legal foundation henney.and premarket approval improves drug safety and effectiveness only to the extent that drugs are not sold without such approval.
in concluding that prohibiting promotion does not directly advance the government interests,the majority places great weight on the fact that physicians can prescribe,and patients can use,drugs for purposes.op.at.but this is also true for substances that have not been approved by the fda for any medical use at all.the law generally permits a hardware store to sell turpentine,and though such conduct may not be advisable,the law generally permits a consumer to purchase that turpentine and use it as a pain reliever.under the majority reasoning,then,any substance that may be legally sold for some purpose may be promoted by its manufacturer for any purpose so long as the manufacturer statements are merely unsubstantiated,rather than demonstrably false or misleading.but this reasoning would invalidate the very definitions of drug and device that undergird the entire fdca.
the majority also emphasizes that the prohibition on promotion applies only to a particular class of speakers namely,drug manufacturers.op.at.but drug manufacturers are the precise group that the government must encourage to participate in the new drug approval process.indeed,if the prohibition applied to any broader class of speakers,it would likely fail central hudson fourth requirement that a regulation be narrowly drawn.the supreme court decision in sorrell is thus inapposite in the present circumstances.the statute there did not directly advance vermont interest in protecting patient privacy because it applied to only a small subset of those groups that could possibly compromise patient privacy.see.at.drug manufacturers,in contrast,form the entirety of those speakers that could possibly undermine the new drug approval process by not participating in it.
furthermore,allowing drug manufacturers to promote uses would undermine the fda approval process for not only new uses of drugs,but also for entirely new drugs.as explained above,when determining whether a drug should be approved,the fdca requires consideration not only of the drug safety,but also its effectiveness.see united states rutherford,t he fda commissioner generally considers a drug safe when the expected therapeutic gain justifies the risk entailed by its use.if a drug manufacturer must be allowed to distribute a drug for any use so long as it is approved for one use,the government balancing of a drug benefits against its risks becomes very difficult or even impossible.drugs viewed as safe for certain uses might be considered unsafe overall if the benefits and risks being weighed are not for a specific intended use but rather for any use at all,whether supported by evidence or not.
the prohibition of promotion is thus not simply a paternalistic attempt to shield physicians and patients from truthful information.see op.at.rather,it is a necessary tool for the effective functioning of a regulatory system that the supreme court has endorsed as legitimate.the majority implies that prohibiting promotion is unconstitutionally paternalistic regardless whether the drug manufacturer claims are addressed to a physician or to a patient.see,op.at p rohibiting promotion by a pharmaceutical manufacturer while simultaneously allowing use paternalistically interferes with the ability of physicians and patients to receive potentially relevant treatment information emphasis added.but if drug manufacturers have a first amendment right to distribute drugs for any use to physicians or even directly to patients,then the entire fdca may well be unconstitutional.
prohibiting promotion by drug manufacturers is also the least restrictive way of advancing the government interests.although the majority asserts various alternatives,none would be similarly effective.a disclaimer system or required listing of intended uses would provide manufacturers much less incentive to submit their drugs for fda approval,and in turn encourage promotion based on data much less reliable than the clinical investigations required under d a ceiling on prescriptions would require collecting data from countless numbers of doctors and patients and,given the medical uncertainties involved,could needlessly and simultaneously result in the denial of some effective treatments and the overprescription of ineffective and even dangerous ones.finally,a ban on prescriptions would be no better.indeed,it would constitute an unprecedented intrusion into the practice of medicine,and would result in perhaps an even greater restriction on speech.see central hudson,at government free to ban commercial speech related to illegal activity.and again,because a product very definition as a drug depends upon its intended use which is often established by the manufacturer speech,it is unclear why the majority analysis is not equally applicable to the fdca entire scheme of drug regulation.
that the fdca is both content and within the meaning of sorrell.at,does not alter the foregoing analysis.every commercial speech case,by its very nature,involves both content and speech restrictions.see.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,if there is a kind of commercial speech it must be distinguished by its content.yet the supreme court has long acknowledged and acknowledged again in sorrell that the government legitimate interest in protecting consumers from commercial harms explains why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech.sorrell.at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the supreme court struck down the ban on energy advertising in central hudson because a alternative existed.see cent.hudson,at t he commission could attempt to restrict the format and content of central hudson advertising.it might,for example,require that the advertisements include information about the relative efficiency and expense of the offered service,both under the current conditions and for the foreseeable future.sorrell did not purport to overrule the central hudson test,which has guided first amendment doctrine in this area for thirty years.
moreover,in sorrell the court noted that vermont did not argue that its challenged statute will prevent false or misleading speech.at.rather,vermont interest in burdening the speech of detailers instead turn ed on nothing more than a difference of opinion.id.in contrast,congress intended the fda approval process to prevent dangerous products with false or misleading labels from entering the market,and also to provide a base of reliable,objective information about prescription drugs that could help physicians and patients identify potentially misleading claims.clearly this is the type of statute to which sorrell intended that central hudson would still apply 
it is certainly true that the fear that people would make bad decisions if given truthful information can not justify burdens on speech.sorrell.at quoting thompson,at.but this does not mean that conveying false information to consumers must take precedence over all competing government interests.our system of drug regulation developed to protect consumers from misleading and unsubstantiated claims about drugs safety and efficacy,and the prohibition on promotion by drug manufacturers is essential to maintaining the effectiveness of that system.therefore,even if such a prohibition is considered a direct regulation of speech,it is a regulation that directly advances a substantial government interest in a manner not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.i would thus find it constitutional under central hudson and sorrell.
iv.the verdict sheet and the jury verdict 
because i believe that the fdca misbranding provision may constitutionally be applied to caronia conduct,i next address caronia remaining arguments that the district court erred in breaking down the conspiracy charge on the verdict sheet into two subissues and that the jury rendered an inconsistent verdict by convicting caronia of conspiring to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded drug while finding him not guilty of conspiring to do an act to a drug that would result in it being misbranded.
the first count of a information charged caronia with conspiring both to introduce into interstate commerce a drug that was misbranded and to do an act with respect to a drug that would result in that drug being misbranded with respect to that count,the district court submitted a verdict sheet to the jury which asked 
how do you find the defendant,alfred caronia,on count one of the information 
a conspiracy to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a drug,xyrem,that was misbranded 
a conspiracy to do an act with respect to a drug,xyrem,when such drug was held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce when such act would result in xyrem being misbranded 
the jury concluded that caronia was guilty with respect to question a and not guilty with respect to question b.
caronia argues that the district court erred by subdividing the conspiracy charge on the verdict sheet because,he claims,the district court essentially split the charge into two separate counts.but we have held that a conspiracy charge may allege an agreement to commit more than one offense,see united states coriaty,cir we have upheld convictions for conspiracies charged in the conjunctive even when there was insufficient evidence to support one of the objects of the conspiracy,and that a district court does not impermissibly constructively amend a charge by subdividing an offense into parts,see united states mccourty,cir no constructive amendment resulted when the district court broke the single offense into two parts to be addressed by the jury.i therefore find no error in the verdict sheet.
caronia further argues that the jury rendered an inconsistent verdict by finding him not guilty of conspiring to do an act to a drug that would result in it being misbranded while finding him guilty of conspiring to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded drug.but these verdicts were not example,the jury may have concluded that the drug was not being held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce.and even assuming the verdicts were inconsistent,the convicted defendant protection against an irrational verdict is his ability to have the courts review the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction,united states acosta,cir.there was ample evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that caronia conspired to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded drug.indeed,caronia was caught on tape with gleeson suggesting uses of xyrem to doctors.i therefore see no error in the verdict sheet and no inconsistency requiring reversal or vacatur in the jury verdict.
the majority has chosen to apply heightened scrutiny to this case,though we have not done so in other cases involving the use of speech as evidence of intent for example,in antidiscrimination actions or prosecutions for criminal inducement,attempt,and conspiracy cases i can not meaningfully distinguish from this one.the majority decision today extends heightened scrutiny further than the supreme court ever has,and calls into question a fundamental regime of federal regulation that has existed for more than a century.i respectfully dissent.
