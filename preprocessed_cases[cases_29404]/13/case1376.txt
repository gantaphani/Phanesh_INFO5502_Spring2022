background 
the relevant facts of this case are straightforward and not in dispute.
jugobanka and beogradska banka collectively banks or foreign banks are two banks of the former yugoslavia.in the,the banks received a license from new york banking authorities to operate,through a domestic branch,a banking business in new york.as foreign banks operating a business in new york,they became subject to the state banking regulations,including its insolvency regime.thus in when civil and ethnic unrest broke out in yugoslavia,the superintendent demanded that the banks increase their available assets in new york to ensure coverage of any domestic liabilities,in case the banks should fail as a result of their home country deteriorating political condition.
in president george bush issued executive orders freezing the assets of firms organized or located in yugoslavia.acting on those orders,the treasury department closed the foreign banks offices and arranged to have their liquid assets frozen in several private new york banks,while the banks other property,including their books and records,were stored in warehouses in new york.this property remained undisturbed for a decade.
in the government of the former yugoslavia brought insolvency proceedings against the banks and appointed the agency as the bankruptcy administrator.the superintendent responded by commencing parallel state insolvency proceedings and ordering the seizure and delivery of all the foreign banks property located in new york.although the superintendent has not provided details,at least million of the banks cash was seized.these funds have been frozen since by executive order and controlled by the treasury department office of foreign assets control.permission for the seizure was obtained from the treasury department.according to appellant,these events operated to vest title to the property immediately in the superintendent.see banking law a.
in june the agency filed in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york blackshear,petitions to recover the banks assets under of the bankruptcy code.that section permits a case ancillary to a foreign proceeding to be commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition under this section by a foreign representative.id.we have said that the purpose of is to allow foreign bankruptcy administrators to prevent the piecemeal distribution of assets in the united states by means of legal proceedings initiated in domestic courts by local creditors.in re koreag,controle et revision,cir.by filing the petitions,the agency sought to prevent the superintendent,in her capacity as liquidator of the failed banks new york branches,from giving special preferences to new york creditors.
on august,the bankruptcy court dismissed the agency petitions.agreeing with counsel for the superintendent,the court found that of the code,evinced congress plan to limit the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over foreign banks where some alternate regulatory scheme exists for the liquidation of a foreign bank assets.that section excludes foreign banks engaged in business in the united states from its definition of a debtor under chapter of the code.b b.the court refused to exercise its jurisdiction over the b anks simply because the debtors filed petitions pursuant to,and not pursuant to chapter or chapter.
the agency appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court.the district court,disagreeing with the bankruptcy court reading of the relevant provisions,vacated and remanded.it found completely irrelevant to the interpretation of,observing that requires only that a petitioner be an authorized foreign representative filing pursuant to a proper foreign proceeding,which undisputably is the case here.
counsel for the superintendent urged the district court to reconsider its decision,asking the court to address specifically the contention that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the superintendent because,as an arm of the state of new york,she is immune from federal jurisdiction under the eleventh amendment.the district court rejected this argument in an order dated august,on the ground that jurisdiction may be had notwithstanding the eleventh amendment pursuant to the doctrine of ex parte young.moreover,the district court denied the superintendent request that the statutory issue concerning and be certified for immediate appeal to this court rather than await review upon final judgment.see b.
the superintendent then appealed to this court the district court denial of her claim of eleventh amendment immunity under the collateral order doctrine,which permits immediate appellate review of a small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.puerto rico aqueduct,at.quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan.
after this appeal had been briefed and submitted,in january the supreme court handed down central virginia community college katz,d,concerning the reach of the eleventh amendment in bankruptcy proceedings.because of its potential pertinence to our pending decision,we requested counsel to submit additional briefing addressing the effect of the supreme court ruling on this appeal.having considered now the parties papers,including the various amicus and supplemental briefs,we affirm the district court.
discussion 
i state sovereign immunity 
the eleventh amendment prohibits the judicial power of the united states from extending to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.this jurisdictional bar also immunizes a state entity that is an arm of the state,see northern ins.of chatham county,d,including,in appropriate circumstances,a state official acting in his or her official capacity,see edelman jordan,d.for purposes of this appeal,we assume,and no party disputes,that the agency is a citizen or subject of a foreign state and that the superintendent is an arm of the state of new york and thus entitled to whatever immunity the eleventh amendment may bestow.
state sovereign immunity is not absolute.congress by statute may abrogate state immunity and subject the states to suit,provided that,first,its intention to do so is unequivocally expressed in the statutory language and,second,the legislation is enacted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.tennessee lane,d kimel.bd.of regents,d.a state also may waive its eleventh amendment example,by voluntarily invoking federal jurisdiction,as when the state itself brings a federal suit or removes a case from state to federal court.see lapides bd.of regents,d in re charter oak,cir.moreover,under the venerable doctrine of ex parte young,a plaintiff may sue a state official acting in his official the eleventh prospective injunctive relief from violations of federal law.see edelman,at.henrietta bloomberg,cir.
the supreme court has considered the scope of state sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings in two recent cases,tennessee student assistance hood,d,and central virginia community college katz,d.in katz,the supreme court held that sovereign immunity does not prevent a bankruptcy trustee from setting aside preferential transfers by the debtor to state agencies.katz.at.we do not reach the question of whether katz provides an alternate basis for our holding today because we think this case squarely resolved by the doctrine set out in ex parte young.
ii ex parte young 
we assume,without deciding,that the eleventh amendment bars this suit.despite that bar,however,relief is available under the doctrine of ex parte young.see verizon,pub.serv.comm of,d id.at.souter,concurring concurring because the court opinion rests on the ground that,on the assumption of an eleventh amendment bar,relief is available under the doctrine of ex parte young puerto rico aqueduct,at.rather than defining the nature of eleventh amendment immunity,young and its progeny render the amendment wholly inapplicable to a certain class of suits.
a.the doctrine of ex parte young and its application 
the theory and controversy behind the doctrine of ex parte young has been discussed at length in cases from both this and the supreme court,not to mention in the academic literature,and does not require further explication.see,idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d opinion of kennedy,id.at,concurring green mansour,d edelman,at.in re dairy mart convenience stores,cir.see generally charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.supp.suffice it to say that the doctrine remains a landmark of american constitutional jurisprudence that operates to end ongoing violations of federal law and vindicate the overriding federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law.green,at.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.
in contrast to its theoretical underpinnings,application of the young doctrine is straightforward a plaintiff may avoid the eleventh amendment bar to suit and proceed against individual state officers,as opposed to the state,in their official capacities,provided that his complaint a alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and b seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.verizon,at.dairy mart,at.
here,application of the straightforward inquiry suggests that the eleventh amendment does not prevent suit against the superintendent.the gravamen of the agency petition is that the superintendent is committing an ongoing violation of federal law by taking possession of and retaining assets b c empowering a bankruptcy court to enjoin such proceedings and order turnover of the assets,and outlining the legal standards pursuant to which this relief may be granted must be released to the agency,the foreign representative of the banks,for foreign insolvency proceedings.this allegation is plainly neither insubstantial nor frivolous as a legal claim,and thus satisfies the first requirement of the ex parte young doctrine.see dairy mart,at.moreover,it is undisputed that the injunctive relief of the assets and enjoinment of any state insolvency prospective in nature,satisfying the second prong of the inquiry.the superintendent does not argue that the relief is retrospective or designed to compensate for a past violation of federal law,nor does she contend that any turnover of the assets would even minimally deplete new york public fisc.see aff.of muccia,first deputy superintendent,verizon,at.relief sought was prospective where it did not impose upon the state a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials citing edelman,at.city health hosp.perales,cir.in short,a prima facie case for permitting suit under ex parte young is here established.
appellant objections to application of ex parte young 
appellant superintendent raises two objections to the application of ex parte young,which we discuss and ultimately reject below.
the quiet title objection 
the first of these is that the assets belong to the state by operation of new york law,thus transforming the petition into the functional equivalent of an action to quiet title implicating special state sovereignty interests.see coeur tribe,at.the superintendent avers that when she took possession of the assets pursuant to new york banking law a,that statute also automatically vested title of the same in the state of new york.she argues that because a federal court is generally prohibited by the eleventh amendment from adjudicating a state claim of title,ex parte young notwithstanding,the eleventh amendment presents a bar to this action that the doctrine can not overcome.see coeur tribe,at.
the argument is misconceived.in the first place,new york banking law a vests title not in the state,but in the superintendent.further,the superintendent does not claim that either the she on its the right to beneficial ownership in these assets.regardless of a use of the word title,the superintendent claim is in fact of a right to custody of the assets for purposes of administration during insolvency proceedings.there may well be,as the superintendent contends,strong arguments that the eleventh amendment precludes a quiet title suit in federal court against a state,absent state consent,based on the fact that such an action would adjudicate the state beneficial ownership of property,regardless of whether it is nominally asserted against a state official.see restatement second of judgments cmt.a ray andrews brown,the law of personal property ed see also cancer hosp.of am.webster,cir.
however,arguments of this nature have never prevented a federal court from providing relief from governmental officials taking illegal possession of property in violation of federal law.see larson domestic foreign commerce.s pecific relief in connection with property held or injured by officers acting in the name of the sovereign has been granted where there was a claim that the taking of the property was not the action of the sovereign because unconstitutional or beyond the officer statutory powers.fitts mcghee.tindal wesley.united states peters,cranch.marshall,united states lee.allowing an action in ejectment to proceed against two federal officers.as justice has explained,there is a difference between possession of property and title to property.coeur tribe,at,concurring.a court may find that an official has no legal right to remain in possession of property,thus conveying all the incidents of ownership to the plaintiff,but without formally divesting the state of its title.id.that is the teaching of tindal and lee,in which the court made clear that the suits could proceed against the officials because no judgment would bind the state.tindal,at.lee,at see.dep t of state treasure salvors,d plurality opinion.
applying these principles to the case at hand,it is apparent that this bankruptcy petition,which seeks turnover of assets allegedly held in violation of,is not a quiet title action against the state but rather a prayer for relief to dispossess a state official of assets and some of the incidents of ownership thereof under authority of controlling federal law.granting an injunction against the superintendent might require her to turn over the assets,but it would not decree any claim of title against the state.the petition proceeds,in other words,on a classic application of ex parte young.
coeur tribe is not to the contrary.in that case,the supreme court held that a suit,ostensibly seeking prospective injunctive relief under young,could not invoke the doctrine to bring what amounted to the functional equivalent of a quiet title action and thereby extinguish idaho right to regulate submerged lands,lands with a unique status in the law.at.see mohegan tribe and nation orange county,cir per curiam.more was at stake than simple possession or other incidents of ownership.the indian tribe sought relief that would bar the state principal officers from exercising their governmental powers an
