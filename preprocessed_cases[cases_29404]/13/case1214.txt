in this appeal,patrick tracy challenges the decisions of the united states district court for the northern district of new york granting the motion for summary judgment filed by on the ground of qualified immunity munson,and denying tracy motion for reconsideration mccurn.tracy primarily argues that the district court erred in concluding that he had not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether,in the course of arresting him,parker freshwater,a deputy sheriff in the tompkins county sheriff department,used unreasonable force in violation of the fourth amendment.we conclude that the majority of tracy claims fail as a matter of law and that summary judgment was properly granted on them.however,because we find that issues of material fact remain in dispute with respect to one excessive force claim based on freshwater use of pepper that freshwater is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to that claim as stated by appellant,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this conclusion.
tracy separately asserts that the district court acted improperly when it endorsed a general withdrawal from him of the special solicitude that federal courts ordinarily afford to pro se litigants.in sledge kooi,cir per curiam,we suggested that while it is appropriate to charge an experienced pro se litigant with knowledge of,and therefore to withdraw special status in relation to,particular requirements of the legal system with which he is familiar,a general withdrawal of the solicitude ordinarily afforded pro se litigants is inappropriate absent a showing that the particular litigant has acquired the experience necessary to deal generally with all aspects of his case.we conclude that the district court general withdrawal of solicitude here amounted to an abuse of discretion,even though a more limited withdrawal of solicitude in relation to the requirements of opposing a motion for summary judgment may well have been warranted.
background 
the following facts are drawn from the record on appeal and,unless otherwise noted,are construed in the light most favorable to tracy.on the evening of april,tracy was driving through the town of danby,new york,located in tompkins county.the weather was had fallen,it was snowing,and the wind was gusting.officer freshwater,observing traffic from a public parking lot,saw tracy car,noticed that the windows were covered with snow which likely impaired the driver ability to see,and pulled tracy over officer freshwater asked tracy for his license and registration and tracy told him that he did not have them in his possession.officer freshwater asked tracy to exit the car and clean off the windows while he ran a check on the car license plate number.after running this check,which revealed that the car was registered to beverly ruggles,officer freshwater approached the car and began to question tracy,who,having finished cleaning the windows,was once again seated inside the vehicle.
officer freshwater first asked whether the car was registered in the name of ruggles,to which tracy responded affirmatively.he next asked tracy for his name,receiving the answer seth ruggles.after some further questioning regarding his date of birth,tracy admitted that he was not,in fact,seth ruggles.officer freshwater then asked tracy for his real name.tracy professes not to have understood this question,but admits that after hearing something about a name,he stated jeff kerns.following this exchange,officer freshwater ordered tracy to exit his car,and tracy did so.
officer freshwater affirms that by this time he strongly suspected that tracy might be wanted in connection with a criminal offense.as tracy stood outside his car,officer freshwater,intending to pat him down for weapons and then to arrest him,ordered tracy to place his hands on top of his head.according to tracy,he obeyed this order.officer freshwater then demanded that tracy,who at that point was facing him,turn around.tracy alleges that he began to do so but,before he could fully comply,he slipped on a patch of ice and thereafter grabbed the car to prevent himself from falling.according to tracy,officer freshwater then struck him twice with a metal flashlight.tracy contends that he then ran in the direction of officer freshwater patrol car,officer freshwater grabbed him,and the two struggled.although tracy did not attempt to strike officer freshwater,he asserts officer freshwater hit him twice more with the flashlight.officer freshwater alleges,to the contrary,that after he directed tracy to turn around and place his hands on the top of his head,tracy began to run toward him and the roadway.officer freshwater grabbed tracy and hit him with the flashlight,he says,only after tracy had attempted to punch him.
both parties agree that tracy eventually broke free and began to run from officer freshwater.before tracy could get far,however,he slipped and fell to the ground,after which officer freshwater jumped on him.tracy immediately felt severe pain.according to tracy,while lying on top of tracy,officer freshwater screamed at him and immediately placed one of tracy hands in handcuffs.tracy other hand,however,was pinned beneath his body.despite this difficulty,officer freshwater demanded repeatedly and stridently that tracy present this hand so that it might also be placed in handcuffs.eventually,tracy was able to work his hand free,at which point officer freshwater placed it in handcuffs as well.while he was attempting to extract his hand from under his body,tracy contends that he expressly told officer freshwater that he was not resisting.he asserts,moreover,that after he was fully handcuffed,officer freshwater,while continuing to yell at him,sprayed his face with pepper spray from a distance of only a few inches and then pushed it into the muddy ground.officer freshwater alleges,to the contrary,that he tracy while tracy was actively continuing to resist.
while officer freshwater was lying on top of tracy,freshwater attempted to call for help on his portable radio.the radio,however,malfunctioned and officer freshwater received no response he then attempted to move tracy.tracy contends that officer freshwater angrily ordered him to get up and persisted in that demand after being told that tracy was in pain.tracy alleges that when he continued to protest that he was injured,officer freshwater grabbed him by his arms and hauled him to his feet.officer freshwater asserts,in contrast,that he assisted tracy by picking him up under his arms from behind.both parties agree that as tracy was made to stand,his body made a distinct popping noise.tracy states that he immediately felt excruciating pain.according to tracy,although he again indicated that he was injured and needed medical attention,officer freshwater held him up by his hands and forced him to walk the roughly twenty feet to the patrol car.once they reached the patrol car,officer freshwater put tracy in the back seat and used the car radio to call for backup and medical personnel.shortly afterwards,an ambulance arrived and took tracy to a nearby hospital,where he received medical treatment,primarily for a fracture dislocation of his hip.tracy was subsequently transferred to a larger hospital,where he underwent at least one extensive surgical procedure as the result of the hip injury.
an examination of tracy fingerprints revealed his true identity,along with the fact that he had a criminal history and,indeed,was then the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for federal drug charges.tracy was then charged with several additional state law offenses stemming from his altercation with officer freshwater,and,after a jury trial,was convicted of resisting arrest in violation of new york penal law and criminal impersonation in the second degree in violation of new york penal law tracy has also since been convicted of the federal drug charges for which he was sentenced principally to months imprisonment.
tracy thereafter initiated the instant case,asserting,inter alia,a claim against officer freshwater pursuant to for the use of excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment after extended motion practice,which included some motions filed by tracy,proceeding pro se,the magistrate judge assigned to the case issued a report and recommendation urging that a motion for summary judgment with regard to all of tracy claims filed by be granted in full.the magistrate judge,after noting that tracy had participated in at least ten previous federal and state actions,had engaged in substantial motion practice in this action,and had demonstrated substantial competence in the course of that motion practice,first recommended that tracy should be denied the solicitude ordinarily afforded by federal courts to pro se litigants.turning then to tracy substantive claims,the magistrate judge concluded with regard to the excessive force claims at issue in this appeal that,even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to tracy,officer freshwater was entitled to qualified immunity as his actions were objectively reasonable and,accordingly,did not amount to a constitutional violation.over tracy objection,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in full and judgment was entered in favor of.tracy subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied on the ground that it merely sought to relitigate the same issues already decided in the previous order.this appeal followed.
discussion 
excessive force 
tracy first challenges the district court conclusion that freshwater was entitled to summary judgment on all of tracy excessive force claims.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,and in so doing,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see okin vill.of police dep t,cir russo city of bridgeport,cir.summary judgment is warranted only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see cordiano metacon gun club,cir.a fact is material when it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.mccarthy dun bradstreet,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.kelsey county of schoharie,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.accordingly,when a defendant official invokes qualified immunity as a defense in order to support a motion for summary judgment,a court must consider two questions whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,makes out a violation of a statutory or constitutional right,and whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.see gilles repicky,cir see also saucier katz,d,modified by pearson callahan,d.while the supreme court has recently made clear that we may exercise our sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first,pearson.at,we begin,as the district court did,with the first.id.suggesting that the traditional sequence is appropriate where discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law may make it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all.
the fourth amendment prohibits the use of unreasonable and therefore excessive force by a police officer in the course of effecting an arrest.see graham connor,d.because t he fourth amendment test of reasonableness is one of objective reasonableness,bryant city of new york,cir quoting graham,at,the inquiry is necessarily case and fact specific and requires balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion on the plaintiff fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.amnesty am.town of hartford,cir.in conducting that balancing,we are guided by consideration of at least three factors the nature and severity of the crime leading to the arrest,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others,and whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at jones parmley,cir.
however,in doing so,we are careful to evaluate the record from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.jones,at quoting graham,at.morever,we are required to make allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.id.quoting graham,at.not every push or shove,even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge chambers,violates the fourth amendment.graham,at internal quotations and citation omitted.
tracy complaint can be read to allege that officer freshwater exceeded fourth amendment constraints in four different ways first,by striking tracy with a flashlight several times second,by jumping on tracy as tracy,by his own admission,attempted to flee from freshwater third,by spraying tracy with pepper spray after tracy had already been placed in handcuffs and fourth,by forcibly moving tracy from the ground to the police car despite the fact that tracy had told freshwater that he was in pain and could not move.as noted above,freshwater disputes tracy account of the facts underlying at least some of those claims.however,the district court concluded that none of the four claims survived the motion for summary judgment because,even if any factual disputes were resolved in tracy favor,none of the alleged conduct constituted unreasonable thus a constitutional violation for purposes of the qualified immunity a matter of law.we agree with respect to claims one,two,and four.
with respect to the first claim,which centers on freshwater use of his flashlight,we agree with the reasoning of the magistrate judge and conclude that even if tracy account is credited,officer freshwater use of force was reasonable.from freshwater perspective,a suspect he to be a fugitive from the law,made a quick and sudden movement as freshwater attempted to effect an arrest without the assistance of other officers.his decision to use his flashlight to protect himself and subdue an arrestee he perceived to be actively resisting was therefore a reasonable response.consideration of the three graham factors only further supports that finding.first,the scope of crime in question was not simply driving without a license or criminal impersonation but was unknown and potentially far more serious.as noted,freshwater had ample basis to presume that tracy was at that time a fugitive seeking to evade capture.second,the risk posed to officer safety appeared to be both real and imminent.it is uncontested that freshwater was operating without back up on the side of a road at night and in bad weather.accordingly,what appeared to be tracy attempt to flee or fight back posed a potentially serious and imminent risk to freshwater safety.third,from freshwater perspective,tracy appeared to fail to comply with a direct order and to instead actively resist arrest,thus necessitating a forceful response.
tracy contends that he merely slipped on the ice,and,as such,freshwater use of force was both unnecessary and unreasonable.we reject that argument,because our focus is not on tracy motivations but instead on the sequence of events from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene.in finding that such an officer would reasonably have construed tracy conduct as intentional and threatening,we emphasize that the events in question took place at night and during inclement weather which undoubtedly reduced visibility and made all the more reasonable freshwater judgment that tracy sudden movement constituted and threatening behavior.graham,at.moreover,we note that tracy own account of the incident describes a,struggle at night and in bad weather,which further supports the reasonableness of freshwater view of the events.finally,tracy description of the injuries he small laceration or abrasion to the bolsters our conclusion that freshwater use of force was a reasonable and proportionate response under the circumstances.accordingly,we agree with the district court that tracy first claim fails,as a matter of law,to allege a constitutional violation,and,consequently,freshwater is entitled to summary judgment on that claim.
with respect to the second freshwater jumped on tracy as he attempted to also find that,as a matter of law,the use of force was reasonable under the circumstances.by tracy own account,he had managed to struggle free and was attempting to escape when he slipped and fell.given that he was clearly resisting arrest at that point,it was not unreasonable for freshwater to respond by diving on top of tracy and pinning him down so that he could not get back up and continue to flee.turning again to the graham analysis,we note,first,that the crime in question was now arguably more serious because tracy was unquestionably resisting arrest which,in turn,only further bolstered freshwater presumption that tracy was a fugitive seeking to evade potentially serious charges.second,the risk to officer safety and the public persisted.third,as noted,tracy was,by his own admission,actively resisting arrest at this point.in finding freshwater decision to tackle tracy to be reasonable,we note again that freshwater was proceeding on his own without the assistance of other officers.while the injury sustained by tracy was more serious here,we note that,as a result of the encounter,freshwater was also injured,giving further credence to our conclusion that his use of force was both necessary and reasonable under the circumstances.tracy provides no factual issue or legal argument that would discredit any of the above,and,accordingly,we have no difficulty concluding,as the district court did,that freshwater use of force was reasonable.
finally,with respect to tracy fourth freshwater forcibly moved him to the patrol car despite tracy protestations that he could not walk due to similarly find the use of force to be reasonable.while it is certainly possible that,under different circumstances,the forcible movement of an injured arrestee might amount to the employment of excessive force,here,the undisputed evidence indicates that officer freshwater attempted to request assistance using his portable radio,but was frustrated in this attempt by equipment failure.moreover,in light of tracy previous conduct,attempting to flee arrest and the cold and wet weather conditions,it was not objectively unreasonable for officer freshwater to have declined to leave tracy unattended while he returned to his patrol car to summon aid.summary judgment here too was appropriate.
however,with respect to tracy third claim of excessive force,which centers on freshwater use of pepper spray,we conclude that material issues of fact remain in dispute and preclude a grant of summary judgment.specifically,the parties dispute whether freshwater used pepper spray before or after placing tracy in handcuffs and from what distance freshwater deployed the spray.tracy further contends that,before he was sprayed,he told freshwater that he was not resisting.without passing on whether the use of pepper spray as described by freshwater was are,of course,compelled at this stage to credit tracy version of the conclude that a reasonable juror could find that the use of pepper spray deployed mere inches away from the face of a defendant already in handcuffs and offering no further active resistence constituted an unreasonable use of force.summary judgment,thus,is inappropriate with respect to this claim.
unquestionably,infliction of pepper spray on an arrestee has a variety of incapacitating and painful effects,see,park shiflett,cir,and,as such,its use constitutes a significant degree of force.accordingly,a number of our sister circuits have made clear that it should not be used lightly or gratuitously against an arrestee who is complying with police commands or otherwise poses no immediate threat to the arresting officer.see,henderson munn,cir vinyard wilson,cir headwaters forest def.county of humboldt,cir adams metiva,cir.here,if a jury credited tracy version of the events and determined that freshwater applied pepper spray after tracy had already been handcuffed and was offering no physical resistence of police commands,it might well conclude that the use of that pepper spray was unreasonable under the circumstances.the district court thus erred in taking that issue away from a jury at the summary judgment stage 
freshwater seeks refuge in an alternate theory.he contends that all of tracy claims,including his pepper spray claim,should be foreclosed because of his state court conviction for resisting arrest.specifically,freshwater argues that the doctrine of collateral estoppel should preclude tracy from relitigating those claims here.on this record,we disagree.collateral estoppel precludes a party from relitigating in a subsequent action or proceeding an issue clearly raised in a prior action or proceeding and decided against that party.sullivan gagnier,cir quoting ryan new york,see also ali mukasey,cir describing the doctrine of collateral estoppel as establishing that an issue of law or fact actually litigated and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in a prior action may not be relitigated in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies emphasis omitted quoting united states alcan aluminum,cir.the party seeking to invoke the doctrine bears the burden of establishing its applicability.evans ottimo,cir.
as we have previously explained,a prior conviction for resisting arrest may preclude a subsequent excessive force claim where facts actually determined in the criminal conviction that were necessary to the judgment of conviction are incompatible with the claim of excessive force being raised in the civil suit.sullivan,at.however,because resistance to arrest does not give the officer license to use force without limit in response,there is no inherent conflict between a conviction for resisting arrest and a finding that the police officers used excessive force in effectuating that arrest.id.in other words,a lawful arrest for resisting arrest may be accompanied by excessive force,and therefore the jury return of a guilty verdict in state court for resisting arrest does not necessarily preclude a subsequent claim of excessive force in federal court.id.at.
here,the fact that tracy was convicted of resisting arrest does not appear to present an inherent conflict with his claim that freshwater exerted unreasonable force in effecting that arrest by deploying pepper spray after tracy had already been handcuffed.under new york law,an individual commits the offense of resisting arrest when he intentionally prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer or peace officer from effecting an authorized arrest of himself or another person.penal law.accordingly,to convict tracy,the jury needed only to find that the defendant intentionally engaged in some conduct by which he either prevented or attempted to prevent an arrest,and the arrest was lawful in that it was supported by either a warrant or probable cause.see curry city of syracuse,cir.
while we are not presented with the full record from tracy criminal proceedings and are thus constrained in our efforts to determine what facts were fairly litigated and necessarily decided in that action,see sullivan,at,we see no basis in the record that is before us to conclude that either the timing of freshwater use of pepper spray or the reasonableness of that use of force was actually litigated and necessarily decided by the criminal jury.as such,we can not conclude on this record that tracy previous conviction bars his remaining excessive force claim.
however,as noted,no party has favored this court with the full record developed in tracy criminal proceeding,nor does the issue of estoppel appear to have been directly raised with the district court.as a result,on remand,freshwater remains free to present that court with a basis,consistent with our guidance in sullivan,for using the criminal conviction
