for the following reasons,we agree with the district court that section is preempted by the clean air act,and we therefore decline to review the district court conclusion that section violates the commerce clause of the constitution.
background 
we assume familiarity with the relevant facts,which have been set forth in detail by the district court.see clean air markets group pataki camg,d.accordingly,for purposes of this appeal we restate only the facts necessary to our disposition,viewing them in the light most favorable to the defendants,see,anderson liberty lobby,d.
in,congress amended the clean air act of,et.title iv of the clean air act amendments of has the express purpose of reduc ing the adverse effects of acid deposition through reductions in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide.b.according to title iv statement of purpose,it is the intent of title iv to effectuate such reductions through an emission allocation and transfer system.id.in other words,the purpose of title iv is to implement a system in order to reduce sulfur dioxide emission,which is a leading cause of acid rain and other forms of acid deposition that are harmful to the environment.under the system created by title iv,utilities utilities are each allocated a certain number of emission allowances per year,see,and each allowance authorizes the utility to emit one ton of,see.every successive year,the total cap on allowable emissions is reduced,and fewer allowances are allocated.see.pursuant to the system created by title iv,allowances may be transferred to any other person who holds such allowances.b emphasis added.by permitting the sale of unneeded allowances,the system creates a financial incentive for utilities to reduce their emissions.
title iv system seeks to minimize acid deposition,the most common form of which is acid rain.acid deposition has been a particular problem in the adirondack region of new york state.the thin,soils and igneous rocks in this area make it highly susceptible to acidification.acid deposition in this region has caused substantial harm to aquatic life and other natural resources.
because emissions can travel hundreds of miles in the wind,much of the acid deposition in the adirondacks results not from emissions in new york,but,rather,from emissions in fourteen upwind states.these states include new jersey,pennsylvania,maryland,delaware,virginia,north carolina,tennessee,west virginia,ohio,michigan,illinois,kentucky,indiana,and wisconsin.
in,the new york legislature sought to address this problem by passing the air pollution mitigation law,pub.serv.section.pursuant to this statute,the new york state public service commission psc is required to assess an air pollution mitigation offset upon any new york utility whose allowances are sold or traded to one of the fourteen upwind states.pub.serv.the amount assessed is equal to the amount of money received by the new york utility in exchange for the allowances.id.moreover,the assessment is made regardless of whether the allowances are sold directly to a utility in an upwind state or are subsequently transferred there.id.accordingly,in order to avoid the assessment,new york utilities must attach a restrictive covenant to any allowances they sell that prohibits their subsequent transfer to any of the fourteen upwind states.see pub.serv.
camg is an association of electricity generation companies,emissions allowance brokers,mining companies,and trade associations.on november,camg filed the instant action against governor pataki and the commissioners of the new york public service commission.the complaint sought to enjoin the enforcement of section on the grounds that it is preempted by title iv of the clean air act amendments of and violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution.on january,the defendants each moved for summary judgment.camg filed a for summary judgment on march.
in an opinion and order filed on april,the district court granted camg motion for summary judgment,denied the defendants summary judgment motions,and permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing section.see camg,d at.as an initial matter,the court held that camg has standing to sue because at least one of its members had suffered an caused by section that could be redressed by the injunction,the interests at issue in the lawsuit are germane to camg organizational purpose,and the participation of camg individual members in the lawsuit is not necessary.id.at citing hunt washington state apple adver.comm n,d.
with respect to preemption,the court first determined that section is not expressly preempted by title iv.id.at.next,it held that title iv is not sufficiently comprehensive to preempt all state law in the field of air pollution control.id.nevertheless,the district court concluded that section was preempted because it actually conflicts with title iv by creating an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress in passing the act.id.at quoting hillsborough county,florida automated med,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court reasoned that new york restrictions on transferring allowances to utilities in the upwind states is contrary to the federal provision that allowances be tradeable to any other person.id.it also noted that congress considered geographically restrict ing allowance transfers and rejected it,and that t he epa,in setting regulations to implement title iv,also considered geographically restricted allowance trading and rejected it over new york state objections.id.citations omitted.the district court concluded that t he rejections of a regionally restricted allowance trading system illustrates the congressional objective of having a nationwide trading market for allowances and new york regional restrictions on allowance trading by new york utilities is an obstacle to the execution of that objective.id.
the district court also rejected the defendants argument that section is expressly permissible under two other provisions of the clean air act.first,the court determined that,which reserves for the states the power to impose on their own utilities more stringent requirements for air pollution control or abatement than mandated by federal law,was not applicable.the court reasoned that section sets no requirements for air pollution control or abatement,but,rather,is a restriction on the nationwide trading system for which the clean air act provides.id.it added that the clean air act does not permit one state to control emissions in another state and the inevitable result of laws such as section would be the indirect regulation of allowance trading and emissions in other states,which could not be done directly.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court also rejected the defendants reliance on f,which provides in relevant part that n othing in title iv shall be construed as requiring a change of any kind in any state law regulating electric utility rates.the court explained that section does not regulate utility rates and therefore is not saved by.camg,d at.
having concluded that section creates an obstacle to the execution of title iv objectives and is not expressly permissible under any provision of title iv,the district court held that section was preempted by title iv and,therefore,that its enforcement would violate the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.
the district court next considered camg alternative argument that section violates the commerce clause of the constitution.the court concluded that section is a constitution
