this is the first of two opinions in which we consider a constitutional challenge to certain provisions of connecticut campaign finance reform act cfra.
the cfra,enacted in,represents a comprehensive effort by the connecticut general assembly to change the way that campaigns for state office in connecticut are financed.we consider here a challenge to the citizens election program cep,a part of the cfra that provides public money to candidates running for state office.in our second opinion,which we file separately,we consider a constitutional challenge to restrictions imposed by the cfra on campaign contributions and the solicitation of campaign contributions by state contractors,lobbyists,and their families.see green party of garfield,l,cir.july.
after a bench trial,the united states district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,judge ruled,in part,that the cep violated the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by invidiously discriminating against minor political parties and their candidates.see green party of garfield,d green party ii.we reverse that part of the district court judgment and hold that the cep does not,on this record,invidiously discriminate against minor parties and their candidates.
the district court also ruled that certain discrete components of the trigger provisions,which include the cep excess expenditure provision and independent expenditure provision violate the first amendment by impermissibly restricting the right of candidates and other individuals and organizations to spend their own funds on campaign speech.we affirm that part of the district court judgment because we agree that the cep trigger provisions violate the first amendment.
background 
we first describe the history of the cep.we then outline its provisions and briefly recount the procedural history of this action.
i.the history of the cep 
the includes the passed in response to several corruption scandals in connecticut.id.at.the most widely publicized of the scandals involved connecticut former governor,john rowland.in,rowland was accused of accepting over worth of gifts and services from state contractors,including vacations,flights on a private jet,and renovations to his lake cottage.rowland accepted the gifts,it was alleged,in exchange for assisting the contractors in securing lucrative state contracts.rowland resigned amidst the allegations,and in pleaded with two aides and several federal charges in connection with the scandal.rowland was fined and sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison.see id.at.
sadly,the ignominy of public corruption was not limited to rowland.as the district court discussed in detail,the rowland scandal was but one of the many corruption scandals involving elected officials in state and local government that helped earn the state the nickname corrupticut.see id.at cataloging the scandals see also id.at discussing the decline of the reputation of connecticut state government.
it was in the wake of those scandals that connecticut lawmakers resolved to enact expansive campaign finance reforms.id.at.in the summer of,governor jodi rell established the campaign finance reform working group the working group,a collection of six state representatives and six state senators who were charged with drafting a new campaign finance reform law.after holding televised hearings for three months,the working group proposed an expansive bill,much of which would be incorporated into the final version of the cfra.see id.at.
in the fall of,governor rell called a special session of the general assembly for the sole purpose of considering the working group proposed bill.after a month of debate,the general assembly passed the cfra,and governor rell signed it into law.see id.at.as the district court set forth in detail,several contemporaneous statements from general assembly members,as well as governor rell,explain that the cfra was passed to combat actual and perceived corruption in state government.id.at.
much of the cfra went into effect on january,but marked the first election cycle with candidates participating in the cep public financing scheme.id.at see also.a providing that the cep becomes effective for the legislative elections in and for the statewide elections in.before it went into effect,the cep was twice amended.see green party ii,d at.
ii.the provisions of the cep 
the cep is a complicated statutory scheme,see.et,and the district court took great care in explaining each of its provisions.see green party ii,at.we describe only those provisions of the cep that are relevant to our decision here.
qualification criteria 
candidates qualify for cep funding by satisfying one of two types of qualifying type for major party candidates and one type with two subtypes for minor party candidates.under what we will refer to as the cep statewide qualifying criteria,candidates qualify for cep funding if they are running on the ticket of a major party.see.a.a major party is defined by the cep as a party that either a had a candidate for governor in the last election who received at least of the vote,or b has as members at least of the registered voters in the state.see id.there are,and have been for some time,only two parties that have achieved major party status in connecticut the republican party and the democratic party.green party ii,d at.
for candidates who are not running on the ticket of a major is,for candidates who are running on the ticket of a minor party or who have no party are alternative ways of qualifying for cep funding.under what we will refer to as the cep qualifying criteria,a candidate can qualify for funding in a specific race if a member of his or her party achieved a certain threshold percentage of the vote in the same race in the last election.see.c,g.a candidate can qualify for a full grant of cep funding if a member of his or her party received of the vote in the same race in the last election a candidate can qualify for of the full amount if a member of his or her party received of the vote in the same race in the last election and a candidate can qualify for of the full amount if a member of his or her party received of the vote in the same race in the last election.see id.
under what we will refer to as the petitioning criteria,candidates can also qualify for cep funding by collecting a certain number of signatures of those eligible to vote in the race in which they are running.a candidate can receive a full cep grant if he or she collects a number of eligible signatures equal to of the votes cast in the same race in the last election the candidate can receive of the full amount if he or she collects a number of eligible signatures equal to of the votes cast in the same race in the last election and the candidate can receive of the full amount if he or she collects a number of eligible signatures equal to of the votes cast in the same race in the last election.see id.c,g.
finally,all they qualify under the statewide criteria,the criteria,or the petitioning raise a specified amount of money through small qualifying contributions of or less.see id.the required amount that candidates must raise varies depending on the office sought candidates for governor,for instance,must raise in qualifying contributions,whereas candidates for state representative must raise in qualifying contributions.id.a.candidates do not receive cep funding until they have raised the required qualifying contributions.
distribution formulae 
once a candidate qualifies for public funds under the cep,the amount of public money that he or she receives is determined by the cep distribution formulae.
primary election grants 
candidates seeking the endorsement of a major party must run in primary elections that are governed by state law.those candidates receive cep funding for the primary election in the following amounts candidates for governor receive million candidates for other statewide offices receive candidates for the state senate receive and candidates for the state house of representatives receive.id.a,b,e,f.like all cep grants,those amounts will,in the future,be adjusted for inflation.id.d,h.
a candidate running for the general assembly receives more money for the primary election if the election takes place in a district that is considered dominant and the candidate is a member of the dominant party.as discussed in greater detail below,we will also refer to dominant districts as safe districts.a dominant district is defined as a district in which there is a difference of twenty percentage points or more between the number of registered voters for the two major parties.for example,if of the voters in a district were registered democrats and of the voters were registered republicans with unaffiliated or registered with a minor party,there would be a difference in the number of democratic and republican voters,and the candidates running in the democratic primary would receive extra money the grant for the democratic candidate for the state senate would increase to,and the grant for the democratic candidate for the state house of representatives would increase to.see id.e a,f a.
currently,no minor party in connecticut selects its candidates by means of primary elections,but defendants contend that,if a minor party were to hold primary elections,that party candidates would be eligible for cep funding.see green party ii,d at.
general election grants 
for the general election,the cep provides the following full grants candidates for governor receive million candidates for other statewide offices receive candidates for the connecticut senate receive and candidates for the connecticut house of representatives receive.see.a,b,e,f.
those full grants may be reduced in certain circumstances.for instance,if a candidate is running unopposed,the cep grant is reduced to of the full amount.see id.j.if a candidate has no competitor but is running against a candidate who has not qualified for or accepted cep funding,the candidate receives of the full amount.see id.j.if a candidate is running against a candidate who has,in fact,qualified for cep funding or if the candidate has raised or spent funds equal to the amount of funding the candidate would have received under the cep,the candidate receives the full grant.see id.
expenditure limits 
by participating in the cep and accepting public funds,candidates agree to accept certain limits on the total amount of money they may spend on their campaigns.in essence,candidates that participate in the cep may spend only the amount they receive in public funds,plus the amount they raise through the required qualifying contributions.see.c.participating candidates are also permitted to spend a small amount of their own personal funds in certain circumstances.see id.c,c.
trigger provisions 
finally,under the cep trigger provisions,candidates receive additional funding when certain conditions are triggered.there are two trigger provisions the excess expenditure provision and the independent expenditure provision.
the district court concisely explained the excess expenditure provision 
the cep provides matching funds for participating candidates who are outspent by a is not bound by any expenditure the primary or the general election excess expenditure trigger.if a candidate receives contributions or spends more than an amount equal to the participating candidate expenditure limit,then the participating candidate is eligible to receive up to four additional grants,each worth of the full grant.id.the excess expenditure grants are distributed whenever the candidate receives contributions or makes expenditures exceeding,and of the expenditure limit for that particular office.
green party ii,d at.
the independent expenditure provision is similar to the excess expenditure provision,but it applies to private individuals and organizations who make independent expenditures in support of a candidate for office.again,the district court concisely explained this provision 
the cep also contains a trigger provision tied to independent expenditures made by individuals and political advocacy groups.a qualifying independent expenditure is an expenditure that is made without the consent,knowing participation,or consultation of,a candidate or agent of the candidate committee and is not a coordinated expenditure,id,and that is made with the intent to promote the defeat of a participating candidate.id.a.matching funds under this provision are triggered when individuals or groups make independent expenditures advocating the defeat of a participating candidate,that in the aggregate,and when combined with the spending of the opposing candidates in that race,exceed the cep grant amount.id.c.funds are distributed to the participating candidate on a basis to match the amount of the independent expenditure s in excess of the full grant amount.id.a.
notably,independent expenditures made in support of a candidate without expressly advocating the defeat of an opponent do not count towards the independent expenditure trigger,meaning individuals and groups are entitled to make unlimited independent expenditures in support of a candidate without triggering cep matching funds for that candidate opponents.see generally id.
iii.this action 
plaintiffs brought this action in claiming that certain provisions of the cfra including the cep violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
a.the parties 
plaintiffs include two minor parties operating in connecticut the green party of connecticut and the libertarian party of connecticut.plaintiffs also include several lobbyists and state contractors,as well as michael derosa,a member of the green party who has run,in the past,for the state senate and for secretary of the state on the green party ticket.see green party ii,d at compl.
defendants include jeffrey garfield,who is named in his official capacity as the executive director and general counsel of the state elections enforcement commission,and richard blumenthal,who is named in his official capacity as the attorney general of the state of connecticut.see green party ii,d at compl.
the parties in this action also include several individuals and entities who successfully moved to intervene as defendants.the include three former candidates for state office and two advocacy groups connecticut common cause and connecticut citizens action group.see green party ii,d at.the defend the constitutionality of the cep.
b.the claims 
plaintiffs have organized their claims into five counts in count one,plaintiffs claim that the cep qualification criteria and distribution formulae.b,violate the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by invidiously discriminat ing against minor parties and their candidates.see compl.in counts two and three,plaintiffs assert first amendment challenges to the cep excess expenditure provision.count two,and the cep independent expenditure provision,id.count three.see compl.
in counts four and five,plaintiffs assert first amendment challenges to aspects of the cfra that do not involve the cep.in count four,plaintiffs challenge the cfra bans on contributions and the solicitation of contributions by state contractors,lobbyists,and their families.g h,g.in count five,plaintiffs challenge disclosure requirements imposed by the cfra on state contractors.id.h see compl.
this opinion addresses counts one,two,and three.our second,separately filed opinion addresses count four.plaintiffs have not pursued count five in these appeals thus we do not address it.
proceedings in the district court 
the district court disposed of plaintiffs claims by means of two separate judgments.the district court first granted summary judgment for defendants on count four,holding that the cfra contribution and solicitation bans did not violate the first amendment.see green party of garfield,d green party i.on february,the district court entered a partial final judgment for defendants with respect to count four.see.b.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal of that partial final judgment cir.docket l,which we address in our separately filed opinion.
the district court then held a bench trial and,at the end of the trial,granted judgment to plaintiffs on the remaining one,two,and three.see green party ii,d.with respect to count one,the district court determined that the cep impose d an unconstitutional,discriminatory burden on minor party candidates first right to political opportunity.id.at.with respect to counts two and three,the district court conclude d that the cep excess expenditure and independent expenditure provisions unconstitutionally burden ed the plaintiffs exercise of their first amendment rights.id.at.accordingly,in a september,final judgment,the district court declared the cep unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from enforcing each of the cep provisions.see id.at.the district court then stayed the injunction pending this appeal.see green party of garfield,docket entry.
defendants filed a timely appeal of the district court september,judgment on counts one,two,and three,and we address that appeal in this opinion.
discussion 
we review the district court findings of fact after a bench trial for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.arch ins.precision stone,cir quotation marks omitted.there were,in this case,very few factual disputes for the district court to resolve at trial.instead,much of the record in this case consisted of undisputed facts,and in any event,nearly all of the district court assessment of plaintiffs claims involved either pure issues of law or the application of facts to draw conclusions of law.scribner summers,cir.we therefore review much of the district court analysis de novo.see id.the district court application of facts to draw conclusions of law is subject to de novo appellate review.citing travellers int l,trans world airlines,cir see also bose.consumers union,in re complaint of messina,cir davis city hous,cir.
count one whether the cep unconstitutionally discriminates against candidates 
in count one,plaintiffs claim that the cep violates the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by invidiously discriminat ing against candidates.see compl.plaintiffs challenge is focused on the cep qualification criteria,which are the criteria by which candidates qualify to receive cep funding,as well as the cep distribution formulae,which are the formulae that establish the amount of money that the cep provides to participating candidates.see id.according to plaintiffs,the cep qualifying criteria and distribution formulae violate the constitution because they impermissibly burden the political opportunity of candidates.see buckley valeo,holding that a public financing system may violate equal protection if it unfairly or unnecessarily burden s the political opportunity of any party or candidate.
the district court granted judgment for plaintiffs on count one.the court determined that the cep imposed a severe,discriminatory burden on the political opportunity of minor party candidates,and it held that despite presenting compelling government interests,the state ha d failed to demonstrate how the cep was narrowly tailored to advance those government interests.green party ii,d at.
in our view,the district court erred in its judgment for plaintiffs on count one.we conclude that the connecticut general assembly enacted the cep in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests,and we hold that the cep qualification criteria and distribution formulae do not,on this record,unfairly or unnecessarily burden the political opportunity of any party or candidate.buckley,at.we therefore reverse the district court on count one and grant judgment for defendants.
i.the legal standard for plaintiffs claim of unconstitutional discrimination 
in determining the legal standard to apply to count one,we hew to the supreme court analysis in buckley valeo,which is the principal binding precedent addressing whether a system of public financing for elections unconstitutionally discriminates against candidates.
buckley considered,in part,a federal statute that created a system of public financing for presidential election campaigns.see buckley,at.several individuals and entities,including minor parties and prospective candidates,see id.at,challenged the law.they claimed,among other things,that it violated the first amendment and the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth by discriminating against candidates.see id.at.
as we set forth in greater detail below,the cep differs in some ways from the financing system at issue in buckley,and our analysis must account for those differences.we are,nonetheless,compelled to apply the legal standard articulated in buckley,as that case addressed exactly the type of claim raised in count one a challenge to a public financing system on the ground that it unconstitutionally discriminates against candidates.
we acknowledge that another supreme court decision,issued after buckley,ruled on a similar challenge to a public financing system.see bang chase,summarily aff sub.that ruling,however,was a summary affirmance of a district court judgment and therefore provides little guidance.as the supreme court clarified a year before issuing its summary affirmance in bang,an unexplicated summary affirmance settles the issues for the parties,and is not to be read as a renunciation by th e court of doctrines previously announced in its opinions after full argument.mandel bradley,quotation marks omitted.we therefore heed the court warning that a scertaining the reach and content of summary actions may itself present issues of real substance,id.quoting hicks miranda,and we do not attempt to divine whether the supreme court adopted the district court reasoning in bang or whether the court affirmed on an entirely different rationale.see,bush vera,kennedy,concurring we do not endorse the reasoning of the district court when we order summary affirmance of the judgment.emphasis added mandel,at because a summary affirmance is an affirmance of the judgment only,the rationale of the affirmance may not be gleaned solely from the opinion below.emphasis added see also morse republican party,we note that a summary affirmance by this court is a rather slender reed on which to rest future decisions.quoting anderson celebrezze,
we also decline plaintiffs invitation to look for guidance from davis federal election commission,in deciding plaintiffs discrimination claim in count one davis involved an entirely different claim the davis plaintiffs challenged the millionaire amendment,which imposed a penalty in the form of a disadvantageous asymmetrical regulatory scheme on candidates for congress who spent large amounts of their own money on their campaigns.id.at.davis accordingly addressed a law that burdened the fundamental first amendment right to spend one own money on one own campaign.see id.at w e agree with davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his first amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.see also id.recognizing the fundamental nature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech.putting aside the cep trigger provisions,which we address below in connection with counts two and three,the cep does not impose a penalty on a candidate who spends his or her own money on a campaign,for in every race candidates can decline to participate in the cep see id.at t he choice involved in buckley was quite different from the choice imposed by the millionaire amendment.in buckley,a candidate,by forgoing public financing,could retain the unfettered right to make unlimited personal expenditures the choice imposed by the millionaire amendment is not remotely parallel to that in buckley.davis,therefore,is inapposite.
in any event,davis in no way suggested that it was overruling buckley.yet if davis analysis were applied here,it could not be reconciled with buckley.as we discuss in greater detail below,buckley placed the burden on the plaintiffs to show that the election funding plan disadvantage d nonmajor parties by operating to reduce their strength below that attained without any public financing.at emphasis added.davis,on the other hand,put the burden on the government to defend the statute in question.see.at.buckley,moreover,required that the financing system be justified by a sufficiently important state interest,at see note,post whereas davis applied a more searching standard and required that the millionaire amendment be justified by a compelling state interest.at quotation marks omitted.because buckley,not davis,addressed the same type of claim as the one raised here,and because there is no indication that davis was meant to overrule buckley analysis of the financing system even sub silentio,we look to buckley for the legal standard by which to assess plaintiffs claim of unconstitutional discrimination in count one.
we therefore closely examine the legal standards applied in buckley,and we describe how the district court did those standards correctly.
a.the standard set forth in buckley valeo 
buckley first determined that the public financing system was a congressional effort,not to abridge,restrict,or censor speech,but rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process,goals vital to a people.at.accordingly,buckley rejected the plaintiffs first amendment challenge out of hand,holding that the financing system only further ed,and did not abridge,the pertinent first amendment values.id.
turning to the discrimination is,the claim that the financing system violated the requirement of equal protection of the laws in its differential treatment of candidates and initially questioned whether the exacting scrutiny standard should apply to the system.id.at.buckley cited several precedents and observed that,at the time,a principle ha d been developed that restrictions on access to the electoral process must survive exacting scrutiny.id.yet buckley distinguished those precedents,finding them inapplicable because they dealt primarily with state laws requiring a candidate to satisfy certain requirements in order to have his name appear on the ballot.id.at.such laws,buckley reasoned,were direct burdens not only on the candidate ability to run for office but also on the voter ability to voice preferences regarding representative government and contemporary issues.id.a public financing system,in contrast,was not restrictive of voters rights and less restrictive of candidates rights,because the system did not prevent any candidate from getting on the ballot or any voter from casting a vote for the candidate of his choice.id.as a result,buckley determined that public financing is generally less restrictive of access to the electoral process than the regulations dealt with in prior cases.id.at emphasis added.
buckley did not,however,complete that line of reasoning and establish a less searching standard for equal protection challenges to public financing systems.instead,buckley determined that the financing system could be upheld even assuming,for the sake of analysis,that the correct standard was exacting scrutiny.after distinguishing the precedents that had applied the exacting scrutiny standard,buckley held in any event,congress enacted the financing system in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests and has not unfairly or unnecessarily burdened the political opportunity of any party or candidate.id.at emphasis added.
following buckley,therefore,the starting point for a court in determining whether a public financing system unconstitutionally discriminates against minor parties is to assume,for the sake of analysis,that the correct standard is the version of exacting scrutiny articulated in buckley.under that standard,a court must first examine whether the system was enacted in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests.id.at the court must then determine whether the system burden s the political opportunity of any party or candidate in a way that is unfair or unnecessar y.id.at.if the public financing system fares favorably under that two pronged test,the inquiry is system does not violate the constitution.
if,however,the public financing system fails under buckley version of the exacting scrutiny is,if the system furthers insufficiently important governmental interests,or if the system does,in fact,burden the political opportunity of a party or candidate in a way that is unnecessary or the court must proceed to a second step of the inquiry the court must finish the line of reasoning that buckley left unresolved and determine whether a less searching standard applies.
here,in resolving plaintiffs claim in count one,we are not required to perform that second step of the inquiry because,as we set forth in greater detail below,we,like the supreme court in buckley,reject plaintiffs claim of unconstitutional discrimination even applying buckley version of exacting scrutiny.nonetheless,we conclude that if,in another case,a court determines that a public financing system can not withstand buckley version of exacting scrutiny,the court must proceed to the second step of the inquiry,finish the line of reasoning that buckley left unresolved,and determine whether a less searching standard applies 
in sum,when a plaintiff claims that a public financing system violates the first amendment and the equal protection clause in its differential treatment of candidates and candidates,a court should employ the following analysis the court should first assume that buckley version of exacting scrutiny applies and determine a whether the system was enacted in furtherance of a sufficiently important governmental interest and b whether the system burdens the political opportunity of a party or candidate in a way that is unfair or unnecessary.if the system fails under buckley version of the exacting scrutiny standard,the court should then complete buckley unresolved line of reasoning and determine whether a less searching standard applies.if the court determines that a less searching standard applies,the court should then evaluate the public financing system under that less searching standard.
b.the district court erroneous application of strict scrutiny 
before proceeding to the merits of plaintiffs discrimination claim,we must clarify that the district court erred in applying strict scrutiny to evaluate plaintiffs claim.
the district court began its analysis by applying the correct legal standard,as it first examined,at length,whether the cep unfairly or unnecessarily burden ed the political opportunity of any party or candidate that,of course,is one part of buckley version of the exacting scrutiny standard.green party ii,d at quoting buckley,at.ultimately,the district court concluded that the cep did,in fact,impermissibly burden the political opportunity of candidates.that is a legal conclusion that we reverse,as set forth below.
nonetheless,assuming,for the sake of analysis,that the district court was correct to hold that the cep impermissibly burdened the political opportunity of candidates,the court was,at that point,required to proceed to a second step of the determine whether a less searching standard applied in evaluating plaintiffs discrimination claim.yet the district court did exactly the opposite it held that strict scrutiny a more searching in evaluating plaintiffs discrimination claim 
in applying strict scrutiny,the district court relied on two cases from our sister circuits,daggett commission on governmental ethics election practices,cir,and rosenstiel rodriguez,cir.in those cases,candidates claimed that a state public financing system violated the first amendment because it was overly coercive,effectively requiring that every candidate accept public money.the courts applied strict scrutiny because they concluded that the right to decline public to raise and spend one own money in an election a fundamental right protected by the first amendment.
we have no occasion to address whether strict scrutiny was the correct standard to evaluate the claims raised in daggett and rosenstiel.we note only that the claims raised in those cases were far different from the claim raised by plaintiffs in count one the plaintiffs in daggett and rosenstiel claimed that a public financing system was overly coercive and thereby violated the first amendment,whereas plaintiffs here claim that a public financing system unconstitutionally discriminates in its differential treatment of candidates and candidates.the district court reliance on daggett and rosenstiel was,therefore,misplaced.
it is,instead,buckley that provides the best guidance in this context,as buckley addressed the same type of claim that plaintiffs raise in count one.again,as we have explained,in no event does buckley suggest that strict scrutiny a standard that is more demanding than exacting scrutiny applies to the type of claim raised in count one.
in sum,the district court erred in applying strict scrutiny.
ii.the merits of plaintiffs claim of unconstitutional discrimination 
having clarified the legal standard with which to evaluate plaintiffs claim of unconstitutional discrimination in count one,we now turn to the merits of that claim.as explained above,we will follow buckley example and assume for the sake of analysis that buckley version of exacting scrutiny applies.thus we ask a whether the cep was enacted in furtherance of a sufficiently important governmental interest and b whether the cep burdens the political opportunity of a party or candidate in a way that is unfair or unnecessary.see buckley,at.
the answer to the first the cep furthers a sufficiently important governmental straightforward.as buckley held,public financing as a means of eliminating improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.id.at.the district court found that the cep was enacted in furtherance of several goals,including to eliminate improper influence on elected officials.see green party ii,d at explaining that the cep was s purred in large part by the from the corruption scandals that culminated in the resignation of governor rowland and his subsequent indictment and conviction.accordingly,the district court held that the cep was enacted to further a sufficiently important governmental interest.see id.at.we agree with that holding.
the answer to the second the system burdens the political opportunity of a candidate in a way that is unfair or more complicated.plaintiffs claim,primarily,that three aspects of the cep impermissibly burden their political opportunity the cep qualification criteria,the cep statewide qualification criteria,and the cep distribution formulae.we address each aspect of the cep in turn.
a.the qualification criteria 
the district court determined that the cep qualification criteria,see generally,impermissibly burdened the political opportunity of candidates because the criteria ma de it extremely difficult for minor party candidates to become eligible for even partial public funding,green party ii,d at.we can not agree with that application of law to fact.
the cep may condition public funds on a showing of popular support in the previous election 
as an initial matter,buckley held that a public financing system may condition a grant of public money on a showing that the candidate already enjoys a certain threshold level of popular support.the reason is twofold first,the government has an interest in not funding hopeless candidacies with large sums of public money,and that interest necessarily justifies the withholding of public assistance from candidates without significant public support.buckley,at citation omitted.thus the constitution does not require the government to finance the efforts of every nascent political group,for s ometimes the grossest discrimination can lie in treating things that are different as though they were exactly alike.id.at quotation marks omitted see also id.at t he constitution does not require congress to treat all declared candidates the same for public financing purposes as there are obvious differences in kind between the needs and potentials of a political party with historically established broad support,on the one hand,and a new or small political organization on the other.citation and quotation marks omitted.in other words,buckley recognized that if the constitution were to require the financing system to fund every candidate,the constitution would provide the means for candidates to raid the united states treasury.id.at quotation marks omitted.
the second reason that a public financing system may condition public money on a showing of popular support is that limiting an election to a small number of strong candidates serves the important public interest against providing artificial incentives to splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism.id.at quotation marks omitted.that is,to fund every candidate would risk a fractured and chaotic election,artificially foster ing the proliferation of splinter parties.id.at quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,the cep may,consistent with the first amendment and the equal protection clause,distinguish between candidates who can,and who can not,make a preliminary showing of public support,providing funds to those who can and withholding funds from those who can not.in addition,popular vote totals in the last election are a proper measure of public support.id.at citing jenness fortson.the cep use of vote totals from the previous election,therefore,is a permissible way to distinguish between candidates who do and do not enjoy the required threshold level of popularity.
we draw from buckley four principles to evaluate whether the cep qualification criteria impose a burden on political opportunity that is unfair or unnecessary 
having established that it is permissible for the cep to condition public funding on a preliminary showing of public that the cep may use prior vote totals to measure that now ask whether the cep single election qualification criteria of,and of the vote in the past election are set so high as to burden the political opportunity of a party or candidate in a way that is unfair or unnecessary.although buckley did not expressly define unfair or unnecessary,we draw from buckley analysis four principles that illuminate what buckley meant by those terms.
i a public financing system may condition public funds on a threshold level of public support that is relatively high,as buckley held that a public financing system may require some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support as an eligibility requirement for public funds.buckley,at quoting jenness fortson,at emphasis added,citation omitted see also buckley,at concluding that the government interest in not funding hopeless candidacies necessarily justifies the withholding of public assistance from candidates without significant public support emphasis added id.noting that the government has been held to have important interests in limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who demonstrate substantial popular support emphasis added.in other words,a public financing system need not provide funding to every candidate who can demonstrate some public support the system may,instead,condition public money on a preliminary showing of significant public support.
that is not to say,of course,that any threshold would pass constitutional muster.buckley established an important role for courts in evaluating whether public financing systems unconstitutionally discriminate against a candidate or party,instructing courts to determine whether a public financing system is appropriately to avoid a burden on political opportunity that is unfair or unnecessary.
ii yet buckley also cautioned that there was,w ithout any doubt,a range of formulations of public financing systems that would sufficiently protect the public fisc and not foster factionalism,and would also recognize the public interest in the fluidity of our political affairs.id.at.buckley made clear,moreover,that in establishing the required threshold level of public support,the choice of the percentage requirement that best accommodate d the competing interests involved was for congress to make.id.at.accordingly,although courts play an important role in assessing whether a public financing system is properly tailored,buckley warned that a court constitutional review should be circumscribed by deference to the legislative branch in its choice from among the permissible range of qualification criteria.see id.at.
iii we also note with care that buckley placed the evidentiary burden of demonstrating unconstitutional discrimination squarely on the plaintiffs.buckley approval of the financing system rested largely on the fact that the plaintiffs had made no showing that the election funding plan disadvantage d nonmajor parties by operating to reduce their strength below that attained without any public financing.id.at emphasis added.in other words,in this context,the evidentiary burden is not on the government to show that a public financing system comports with the constitution it is on the plaintiffs to show that the system does not.to determine whether the plaintiffs have succeeded,moreover,the central question a court must ask is whether the plaintiffs have shown that the system has operat ed to reduce their strength below that attained without any public financing.id.
iv finally,in upholding the financing system,buckley instructed that courts should avoid reasoning based on speculation and should,instead,require tangible evidence of the practical effects of the public financing system.see id.at upholding the system in part because a ny risk of harm to minority interests is speculative due to a general lack of knowledge of the practical effects of public financing see also id.at declining to rule out the possibility of concluding in some future case,upon an appropriate factual demonstration,that the public financing system invidiously discriminates against nonmajor parties emphasis added.thus,when a court evaluates a claim like the one presented here by asking whether the public financing system has operat ed to reduce the strength of minor parties below that attained without any public financing,id.at,the court should avoid speculative reasoning and focus instead on the evidence,if any,of the system practical effects.
in sum,although buckley did not expressly define unfair or unnecessary,we draw from buckley four principles that clarify the meaning of those terms 
i a public financing system may establish qualification criteria that condition public funds on a showing of significant public support.see buckley,at.
ii there is a range of permissible qualification criteria,and although a public financing system must be tailored to avoid an unfair or unnecessary burden on the political opportunity of a party or candidate,a court must defer to a legislature choice of criteria so long as those criteria are drawn from the permissible range.see id.at.
iii in assessing whether a burden is unfair or unnecessary,the central question is whether the plaintiffs have shown that the system has reduced the strength of minor parties below that attained before the system was put in place.id.at.
iv to determine whether the strength of minor parties has been reduced,a court should avoid speculative reasoning and instead focus on the evidence,if any,of the system practical effects.id.at.
we bear those principles in mind as we assess the cep qualification criteria.
under buckley four principles,the cep qualification criteria are,on this record,constitutional 
acknowledging that the cep may condition public funds on a significant showing of public support in the previous election,buckley,at,our intuition suggests that the cep qualification of the vote for full funding,for funding,and for close to the outer edge of the constitutionally permissible range.a public financing system must account for the potential fluidity of american political life,id.at quotation marks omitted,including the fact that candidates do,occasionally,defeat opponents.conditioning public funds on too high of a showing in the previous election risks entrenching the major parties and shutting out the rare candidate who is able to garner enough public support to win an election.
nevertheless,following buckley example,we must look beyond our intuition to the concrete evidence of the cep practical effects.in so doing,we find that data from the election contradict our intuition and show that a substantial number of candidates will be eligible for public funding in under the qualification criteria.indeed,over one third of the candidates fifteen out of forty who ran in the general assembly elections received at least of the vote,thereby qualifying themselves or another member of their party to receive partial funding in the same race in the election.green party ii,d at.five of those fifteen fully one eighth of all over of the vote and qualified for full funding in.id.those record facts show that,although the cep qualification criteria are high,they are not,as our intuition suggested,set so high as to candidates who enjoy public support 
furthermore,even if the cep qualification criteria impose some burden on the political opportunity of candidates,to evaluate whether the burden is unfair or unnecessary we must examine principally whether plaintiffs have shown that the cep has operat ed to reduce their strength below that attained without any public financing.buckley,at.searching the record,we find insufficient evidence in support of that claim.to the contrary,uncontroverted facts in the record show that candidates as a whole are arguably certainly not the cep.
in,the election immediately before the cep went into effect,zero candidates received between and of the vote and one candidate received more than of the vote in legislative races.green party ii,d at.yet in,after the cep went into effect for legislative elections,candidates achieved more success at the polls four candidates received between and of the vote and five candidates received more than of the vote in legislative races.id.at.this shows that,insofar as particular candidates are failing to qualify for public financing because of the cep high qualification criteria,candidates as a whole are nonetheless just as not they were before the cep went into effect their political opportunity,therefore,does not appear to have been burdened in a way that is unfair or unnecessary 
we recognize that in reaching this conclusion,we have relied on data from only one election.once the cep has been in place for additional election cycles,there may develop a more complete picture of its effect on candidates.following buckley,therefore,we of course do not rule out the possibility of concluding in some future case,upon an appropriate factual demonstration,that the cep qualification criteria have,in fact,operat ed to reduce the strength of minor parties below that attained without any public financing.at.at present,however,and on the record before us,there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the cep has burdened the political opportunity of candidates in a way that is unfair or unnecessary 
in sum,although our intuition might suggest,as an abstract principle,that the cep qualification of the vote for full funding,for funding,and for close to the outer edge of the constitutionally permissible range,the facts of record most importantly,the election data show that the qualification criteria are not so onerous as to deny funding to a sizeable number of candidates who enjoy substantial public support.moreover,insofar as the cep qualification criteria may impose some burden on the political opportunity of candidates,the election shows that candidates as a whole are arguably certainly not the cep.there is,therefore,little reason to think that the cep has burdened the political opportunity of candidates in a way that is unfair or unnecessary.giving proper deference to the connecticut general assembly to choose qualification criteria that best accommodate the competing interests involved,we can not say that the general assembly choice falls without the permissible range.id.at.
accordingly,we hold that plaintiffs have presented insufficient evidence on this record to establish that the cep qualification criteria violate the first amendment or the equal protection clause.we therefore hold that the district court erred in concluding that the qualification criteria unconstitutionally discriminate against minor parties and their candidates.
b.the statewide qualification criteria 
plaintiffs also claim that the cep statewide qualification criteria,see,impose an unfair or unnecessary burden on the political opportunity of candidates.the district court agreed with plaintiffs,determining the statewide qualification criteria substantially enhance d the relative strength of major party candidates compared to minor party candidates by encourag ing major parties to field candidates for historically uncompetitive seats,without regard to their likelihood of success.green party ii,d at.
the district court analysis focused on the effect of the statewide criteria in safe or uncompetitive legislative districts,which are districts in which the candidate of one of the major parties is essentially assured of winning.in the state senate district encompassing new haven,for example,less than of all registered voters are republican.see id.at.thus the new haven state senate district is considered a safe district for the democratic party,since the democratic candidate is almost certain to win the race for that seat.
the district court observed that in safe districts,one of the candidates,the republican candidate in new haven often fails to achieve of the vote in an election and therefore would not qualify for cep funding under the qualification criteria.under the statewide qualification criteria,however,that candidate would,nevertheless,qualify for cep funding,as the candidate would be on a ticket of a major party whose gubernatorial candidate achieved at least of the vote in the last election.see.the district court concluded,as a result,that the statewide qualification criteria unfairly favor ed competition between major party candidates over competition from minor party candidates and thereby burden ed the political opportunity of minor party candidates.green party ii,d at.
once again,we can not agree with the district court application of law to fact.
there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the statewide qualification criteria have imposed an unfair or unnecessary burden on candidates in safe districts 
we acknowledge that buckley did not address the unique circumstances created by safe districts,as safe districts are not a feature of nationwide presidential elections.we do not,however,think that this is reason to abandon buckley basic standard or analytical framework in assessing a burden on political opportunity.
examining,then,the record evidence of how the cep has affected candidates,we find insufficient evidence in the record to conclude that the cep statewide eligibility criteria has reduce d the strength of candidates in safe districts below that attained without any public financing.buckley,at.to the contrary,as we set forth above,the record here reveals that candidates as a whole,many of them running in safe districts,appear to have done better in,and certainly no worse.see green party ii,d at.thus we can not conclude,on this record,that the statewide eligibility criteria impose an unfair or unnecessary burden on candidates in safe districts 
even if we were to speculate about the effect of the statewide qualification criteria,our speculation would be inconclusive 
even if we were to ignore buckley guidance and engage in speculation which we do not think is proper,we would lack confidence in any of our guesses about how the statewide eligibility criteria will affect the political opportunity of candidates in safe districts.
it is quite likely,for instance,that the statewide eligibility criteria will have no effect at all on the political opportunity of candidates in safe districts.the record shows that in the election,each major party appears to have been reluctant to field candidates in its opponent safe districts.indeed,although candidates from both major parties were eligible for full cep funding in every district there were general assembly districts out of a total of in which one major party declined to field a candidate.green party ii,d at.the statewide qualification criteria can hardly be said to harm the political opportunity of candidates in safe districts if the major parties are not taking advantage of the statewide eligibility criteria to field publically financed candidates in those districts.
it is not at all certain,moreover,that providing public funds to a second candidate will in any way affect the candidate success at the polls.it may be that candidates have a core group of supporters that can not be convinced to vote for a candidate no matter how much money the candidate spends.
it is also possible that the statewide eligibility criteria could actually increase the political opportunity of some candidates.consider a safe democratic district,such as the district encompassing new haven.funding a republican challenger in that district may force the democratic candidate to moderate her views and campaign closer to the center of the ideological spectrum.that could cause voters on the far left of the ideological spectrum to become disenchanted with the democratic candidate and switch their votes to the green party candidate.there are,therefore,some situations in which providing cep funding to a second candidate may actually help a candidate at the polls.
indeed,it is possible that the cep statewide eligibility criteria could dramatically improve the political opportunity of a minor party and thereby cause exactly the kind of political sea change that characterizes what buckley called the potential fluidity of american political life.at quotation marks omitted.the only time in recent memory that a candidate has won an election in connecticut was the election of governor lowell weicker on the a connecticut party line in.see green party ii,d at.if a candidate were able to match that achievement,then under the cep his or her party would be deemed a major party and would,in the next election,be able to field candidates and receive full cep funding in every legislative and statewide election such an outcome could transform the,party into a statewide political force,catalyzing the party efforts to secure a permanent place as a third major party or,alternatively,providing the means for the party to supplant one of the two existing major parties.
what is more,in order to secure full funding in every legislative and statewide election under the cep,a minor party need not field a winning candidate in the governor race the party need only field a candidate who earns twenty percent of the vote in that race.see.thus,the cep statewide qualification criteria provide a path to viability by which minor parties can bypass the difficult process of building political support in each individual area of the state.if a minor party can field a single gubernatorial candidate who earns twenty percent of the vote,the party will immediately have access to millions of public dollars to field candidates for each state office in the next election.in that situation,the cep statewide eligibility criteria operate not as a burden but as a boon to minor parties that are able to achieve a small but significant measure of statewide support.
of course,our analysis in this section has been speculation.it is possible that under the cep no candidate will ever achieve of the vote in the gubernatorial election.as the district court reasoned,moreover,it is possible that,with the benefit of full cep funding,a second candidate in a safe district will significantly reduce the political opportunity of the candidates in that district.but as we have explained,it is also possible that the statewide qualification criteria will increase the political opportunity of candidates,possibly in dramatic fashion.thus,even if we were to ignore buckley guidance and speculate about the potential effect of the cep statewide qualification criteria on candidates,our speculation would yield no clear prediction.
in sum,we are presented with insufficient evidence that the cep statewide qualification criteria have,in practice,operated to reduce the strength of candidates in safe districts below that attained by such candidates before the system was put in place.even if we were to speculate about the criteria effects in safe districts,we would reach inconclusive criteria may harm candidates,they may have no effect at all on candidates,and they may even help candidates.it is even possible that the cep statewide qualification criteria will dramatically increase the political opportunity of a minor party who gains a small but significant percentage of the vote in a gubernatorial election.
as buckley made clear,when the general assembly designed the cep,it was able to choose from a range of formulations of qualification criteria that would protect the public fisc and not foster factionalism and yet also recognize the public interest in the fluidity of our political affairs.at.because the cep statewide qualification criteria require a substantial showing of public support in a gubernatorial election,yet also provide for a dramatic expansion of a political opportunity if it achieves that because there is insufficient evidence that the statewide qualification criteria impose an unfair or unnecessary burden on candidates in safe can not say,on this record,that the general assembly choice of statewide qualification criteria falls without the permissible range.id.at.we therefore hold that the district court erred in concluding that the cep statewide qualification criteria unconstitutionally discriminate against minor parties and their candidates.
c.the distribution formulae 
plaintiffs also challenge the cep distribution formulae,which are the formulae that establish the amount of money that participating candidates receive under the cep.as discussed above,the cep provides,for general elections,full grant amounts of to candidates for the connecticut senate and to candidates for the connecticut house.see.e,f.those amounts are reduced in several circumstances,such as when a participating candidate is unopposed or is opposed by only a candidate.see id.j.
the district court found that the cep grant corresponding expenditure the connecticut senate and house races were based on the average expenditures in the most competitive races.green party ii,d at.the district court concluded that p egging the cep grant levels to the most competitive races has burdened minor party candidates political opportunity because,by providing major party candidates financing in amounts much higher than typical expenditure levels,it slants the political playing field in favor of major party candidates.id.
it is true that the cep grant amounts and expenditure limits were based on historic expenditures in competitive districts,but we disagree with the district court conclusion that the grant amounts and expenditure limits impose a burden on candidates that is unfair or unnecessary.
again following buckley,we examine whether there is evidence that the cep distribution formulae have operated to reduce the strength of minor parties below that attained before the cep was put in place.see at,see also count one,subsection,ante.and once again,examining the record,we can find no such evidence.based on data from the election,the one election in which the cep was operative,candidates as a whole are arguably certainly no the cep.see count one,subsection ii,ante.there is,therefore,insufficient evidence in this record to conclude that any part of the the distribution a burden on candidates that is unfair or unnecessary.
the district court was troubled by the fact that the cep distribution formulae provided candidates in uncompetitive districts with more money in public funds than they were able to raise on their own prior to the enactment of the cep.green party ii,d at.as a result,the district court determined that the cep grants amounted to a subsidy for candidates,rather than merely a substitution for private funds,and the district court concluded that the cep expenditure limits did not represent a true expenditure ceiling,at least for candidates in uncompetitive districts.id.at.
the problem with that reasoning is that it assumes that because a candidate did not raise a certain amount of money prior to the cep that candidate was unable to raise that amount of money.it is far more likely that,before the cep,candidates in safe those favored to declined to raise every dollar possible,given that the outcome of the election was virtually certain.it is equally possible that donors were simply not interested in giving their money to a candidate who lacked any real competition at the polls.indeed,if an election in a historically uncompetitive district were to become suddenly,for example,a incumbent were to face a strong challenge from a popular is certainly possible that the incumbent would be able to raise far more money than he or she had raised in the previous,uncompetitive elections in that district.we can not conclude with any certainty,therefore,that the cep distribution formulae provide a substantial number of candidates with more money then they were able to raise before the cep was enacted.
furthermore,in determining that the cep slants the political playing field in favor of major party candidates,id.at,it seems that the district court was referring only to the political playing field in uncompetitive districts.after all,in competitive districts,the cep distribution formulae provide a level of funding that is comparable to historic levels.it is,instead,only in uncompetitive districts that the cep provid es major party candidates financing in amounts much higher than typical expenditure levels.id.
yet if a district is uncompetitive,it is,by definition,a race in which candidates have no realistic chance of winning.thus it is difficult to see how the political opportunity of a candidate in such a district could be unfairly or unnecessarily burdened by providing his or her opponent with additional funds.put differently,if a district is truly uncompetitive,a candidate has no chance of winning,and he or she has very little political opportunity to be burdened if,however,a district is competitive in the sense that the candidate has some chance of winning,the cep funding levels are accurately calibrated.
in any event,the general assembly choice in setting the distribution formulae by reference to the historic expenditures in competitive districts strikes us as a reasonable approach.it is undoubtedly difficult to predict when a historically uncompetitive district will unexpectedly become,for example,an incumbent will die or decline to seek reelection when a popular challenger will enter a race to unseat an incumbent or when the demographic characteristics of a district will change,making it no longer safe for one party.if the cep were to make more of an attempt to differentiate between more money in competitive districts and less money in uncompetitive cep would risk providing too little funding to candidates in historically uncompetitive districts that had only recently become competitive.that could undermine public confidence in the outcome of elections,as a candidate who loses in an unexpectedly competitive election could plausibly blame the insufficient cep funding for his defeat.it could also discourage candidates from participating in the cep.rather than accept a diminished cep grant with the accompanying expenditure limit,candidates could prefer to avoid participation in the cep and retain the flexibility of raising competitive amounts of money,lest they be left without sufficient funds if a popular challenger unexpectedly enters the race.
in sum,we acknowledge that,by providing funding comparable to competitive races in every legislative race,the general assembly painted with a broad brush.but because the fine adjustments based on a district historic or expected fraught with danger,and because there is insufficient evidence that the cep distribution formulae have reduced the strength of minor parties below that attained before the cep became effective,we can not conclude that the general assembly violated the first or fourteenth amendments when it chose to treat every district as if it could,in any given election,involve a competitive race.we therefore hold that the district court erred in concluding that the distribution formulae unconstitutionally discriminate against minor parties and their candidates.
counts two three whether the cep trigger provisions violate the first amendment 
in counts two and three,plaintiffs challenge the cep trigger provisions.as discussed above,the trigger provisions provide additional public funding to candidates when certain conditions are triggered.the trigger provisions include the excess expenditure provision count two and the independent expenditure provision count three.
the district court struck down the trigger provisions,concluding that they imposed a substantial burden on the exercise of first amendment rights and that the state ha d failed to advance a compelling state interest that would otherwise justify that burden.green party ii,d at.we agree with those conclusions and affirm the district court judgment in favor of plaintiffs on counts two and three.
plaintiffs standing to challenge the trigger provisions 
as a threshold matter,defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the trigger provisions.we agree with the district court,however,that plaintiffs do have standing on counts two and three.see green party ii,d at.
to qualify for standing,a claimant must present an injury that is concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent fairly traceable to the defendant challenged behavior and likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.davis.at citing lujan defenders of wildlife.defendants primary claim is that plaintiffs have failed to allege an injury that is concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent.id.
with respect to the excess expenditure provision,plaintiffs have submitted very little evidence to suggest that any member of the green party or the libertarian party will ever raise enough money or spend enough of his or her own money to trigger the excess expenditure provisions.as discussed above,see count one,section i,ante,davis addressed the millionaire amendment,which imposed a penalty in the form of a disadvantageous asymmetrical regulatory scheme on candidates for congress who spent large amounts of their own money on their campaigns.id.at.davis recognized that a potential candidate had standing to challenge the millionaire amendment where the candidate had declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than of personal funds in the general election campaign.id.at.there,however,it was undisputed that the candidate personal wealth was sufficient to enable him to spend more than on his campaign.here,by contrast,no plaintiff or member of one of the plaintiff minor parties has declared an intention to spend enough personal wealth to trigger the excess expenditure provision,and there is very little evidence to suggest that any candidate in connecticut could plausibly raise enough money through private contributions to trigger the excess expenditure provision.
nonetheless,the record shows that the green party does,on occasion,choose to endorse a candidate for a particular office rather than run a candidate of its own this is referred to as.insofar as the green party a candidate who declines to participate in the cep,the green party members may choose to make contributions to that candidate,and those with the candidate other fundraising cause the candidate to trigger the excess expenditure provision.therefore,the existence of the excess expenditure provision could have the effect of chilling plaintiffs contributions to candidates.see green party ii,d at.we conclude that this injury is sufficiently concrete,particularized,and imminent to provide plaintiffs with standing to assert count two.
the analysis is similar with respect to the independent expenditure provision.if the green party chooses to a candidate,any independent expenditures made by the green party advocating for the defeat of the candidate opponent could trigger the independent expenditure provision.we conclude,therefore,that the potential chilling effect on plaintiffs independent expenditures,see,is sufficient to provide plaintiffs with standing to assert count three.
ii.the merits of plaintiffs challenge to the trigger provisions 
turning to the merits of plaintiffs challenge,we agree with the district court that the cep trigger provisions violate the first amendment because they operate in a manner similar to the law that the supreme court struck down in davis federal election commission.
federal law establishes certain restrictions on financial contributions given to candidates for congress.for example,c ontributions from individual donors during a election cycle are subject to a cap,which is currently set at.davis.at citing a a,c.the millionaire amendment at issue in davis eased some of those restrictions for candidates whose opponents have spent more than of their the opponents own personal funds in an election.
consider,for instance,a race for congress between candidate a and candidate b.the millionaire amendment would apply if candidate a were to spend or more of her own money on her campaign.the amendment at that point would ease certain restrictions for candidate most notably,candidate b would be allowed to accept contributions from individual donors at three times the ordinary cap instead of.the restrictions would not,however,be eased for candidate a,who would still be limited to accepting contributions at the limit.
davis emphasized,as an initial matter,that the supreme court had upheld contribution limits on individual donors.see.at this court has previously sustained the facial constitutionality of limits on discrete and aggregate individual contributions and on coordinated party expenditures.citing buckley,at,fed.election comm.republican fed.campaign.thus davis observed that if the millionaire amendment had simply raised the contribution limits for all candidates,the plaintiffs challenge would have plainly fail ed.id.
but because the millionaire amendment raise d the contribution limits only for the candidate candidate b in the example above,davis held that the amendment imposed an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercise d his or her right,under the first amendment,to spend personal funds for campaign speech.id.at.accordingly,davis determined that the millionaire amendment created a substantial burden on the exercise of the first amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech,and held that the millionaire amendment could be upheld only if it was justified by a compelling state interest.id.at quotation marks omitted.applying that standard,davis struck down the millionaire amendment,concluding that the asserted government interest to level electoral opportunities was not compelling.id.at quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court analysis in davis directly governs plaintiffs challenge to the cep trigger provisions in counts two and three.
a.the excess expenditure provision 
the similarity between the claim in davis and the claims raised by plaintiffs in counts two and three is clearest with respect to the cep excess expenditure provision.consider a race for a state office in connecticut between candidate a and candidate candidate a intends to spend her own money on the race and has,as a result,elected not to participate in the cep.candidate b,however,decides to participate in the cep.candidate b proceeds to qualify for the cep,and he receives a full grant of public money and becomes subject to the cep expenditure limit.
under the excess expenditure provision,if candidate a spends so much of her own money on the race that her expenditures exceed candidate b expenditure limit,then candidate b will receive additional public money to make up for the deficit.in other words,as candidate a spends more and more of her own money above a certain threshold,candidate b will receive more and more public money to compensate up to twice the full cep grant.that plainly causes candidate a to shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if she chooses to exercise her first amendment right to spend personal funds on her campaign,for candidate a can only spend above the threshold if she accepts that her opponent will receive additional public money.davis.at.as a result,the excess expenditure provision imposes what can only be deemed a penalty on candidate a choice to spend personal funds for campaign speech.davis.at.
the penalty imposed by the excess expenditure provision is,to be sure,slightly different from the penalty imposed by the millionaire amendment in davis.we agree with the district court,however,that insofar as the two penalties are different,the penalty at issue in this case is more constitutionally objectionable.green party ii,d at.
in davis,the penalty consisted of a a new,asymmetrical regulatory scheme contribution restrictions were relaxed for the candidate.at.in davis,therefore,there was some possibility that the candidate candidate b,above would be unable to raise additional money under the relaxed restrictions.
here,however,the penalty imposed by the excess expenditure provision consists of a voucher of public funds given directly to candidate see.a see also green party ii,d at.the penalty imposed by the excess expenditure provision,therefore,is harsher than the penalty in davis,as it leaves no doubt that candidate b,the opponent of the candidate,will receive additional money.
accordingly,the excess expenditure provision imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of the first amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech.davis.at.to be upheld under plaintiffs first amendment challenge,the provision must be justified by a compelling state interest.id.quotation marks omitted.
applying that standard,we agree with the district court that connecticut asserted interest promot ing participation in the cep is not compelling.green party ii,d at.davis was clear that a burden on the expenditure of personal funds is not justified by any governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption.at.since the cep is justified by a governmental interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption,pursuant to the supreme court teaching in davis,encouraging participation in the cep does not justify the burden on first amendment rights caused by the excess expenditure provision.moreover,insofar as the excess expenditure provision is the result of a desire to level electoral opportunities,they are,under davis,clearly unconstitutional.id.at quotation marks omitted.
thus,we conclude,pursuant to davis,that the cep excess expenditure provision violates the first amendment.we therefore affirm the district court judgment for plaintiffs on count two 
b.the independent expenditure provision 
the only difference between the independent expenditure provision and the excess expenditure provision is the fact that independent expenditure provision applies to individuals and organizations who are not themselves candidates in any race.we do not think that this difference carries any significance,as nothing in davis suggests that the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is limited to candidates only.id.at.
consider again the race between candidate a and candidate b.if a resident of the district strongly favors the election of candidate strongly disfavors the election of candidate resident may choose to spend his personal funds to advocate the defeat of candidate under the independent expenditure provision,however,if the amount of the resident expenditure of personal combined with the amount of candidate a own candidate b expenditure limit,the state will provide additional funding to candidate b to make up for the supposed inequality.
in this way,the independent expenditure provision clearly acts as a penalty on the resident choice to spend personal funds for campaign speech.id.at see also day holahan,cir holding unconstitutional a similar law penalizing independent expenditures.as the resident spends more and more money advocating against the candidate he opposes,candidate b,the state will give more and more money to that candidate.
accordingly,like the excess expenditure provision,the independent expenditure provision imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of the first amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech.davis.at.to be upheld under plaintiffs first amendment challenge,the provisions must therefore be justified by a compelling state interest.id.quotation marks omitted.
applying that standard,we once again agree with the district court that,under the principles enumerated by the supreme court in davis,the state asserted interests can not justify the independent expenditure provision.see green party ii,d at.as discussed in connection with the excess expenditure provision,neither an interest in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption nor an interest in level ing electoral opportunities can justify a burden on the expenditure of personal funds.davis.at quotation marks omitted.nor can such a burden be justified by the state asserted interest in promot ing participation in the cep,green party ii,d at,as that interest merely derives from connecticut interest in establishing the is,the state interest in encourage participation in the cep derives from its interests in eliminating corruption or the perception of corruption.
thus,we conclude that the cep independent expenditure provision violates the first amendment as it is construed by the supreme court in davis.we therefore affirm the district court judgment for plaintiffs on count three.
iii.the severability of the trigger provisions 
having determined that cep trigger is,the excess expenditure provision and the independent expenditure the first amendment,we must determine whether the trigger provisions are severable from the cep or whether the entire cep must be struck down along with those provisions.
defendants argue that the connecticut general assembly designed the cep so that many of its individual provisions could be severed.plaintiffs respond that one section of the larger cfra suggests that the general assembly intended the entire law to rise and fall together.that statute,which was recently amended,now reads in full 
a if,during a period beginning on or after the day prior to any special election scheduled relative to any vacancy in the general assembly and ending the day after such special election,a court of competent jurisdiction prohibits or limits,or continues to prohibit or limit,the expenditure of funds from the citizens election fund established in section for grants or moneys for candidate committees authorized under sections to,inclusive,for a period of seven days or more,sections,to,inclusive,and and section of public act of the october special session shall be inoperative and have no effect with respect to any race of such special election that is the subject of such court order until the day after such special election,and a the amendments made to the provisions of the sections of the general statutes pursuant to public act of the october special session shall be inoperative until the day after such special election with respect to any such race,b the provisions of said sections of the general statutes,revision of,revised to december,shall be effective until the day after such special election with respect to any such race,and c the provisions of subsections g to j,inclusive,of section shall not be implemented until the day after such special election with respect to any such race.

because the district court struck down the entire cep,it had no occasion to determine whether the trigger provisions were severable.we therefore remand to the district court to consider the severability issue in the first instance.because the meaning of is far from clear,the district court should develop the record to determine how applies given our judgment for defendants on count one and our judgment for plaintiffs on counts two and three.
conclusion 
in summary,we hold as follows 
when deciding whether a system of public financing for campaigns unconstitutionally discriminates against candidates,a court should first apply the version of exacting scrutiny set forth in buckley valeo.the court should ask a whether the public financing system was enacted in furtherance of a sufficiently important governmental interest,and b whether the system burdens the political opportunity of a party or candidate in a way that is unfair or unnecessary.see id.if the system survives under that version of the exacting scrutiny standard,the system should be upheld.if the system does not survive under that version of the exacting scrutiny standard,the court should finish the line of reasoning that buckley left unresolved and determine whether a less searching standard applies.
assuming,for the sake of analysis,that the version of exacting scrutiny set forth in buckley applies to plaintiffs claim that connecticut citizen election program cep unconstitutionally discriminates against minor parties and their candidates,we hold that the connecticut general assembly enacted the cep in furtherance of sufficiently important governmental interests.at.we also hold that there is insufficient evidence on this record to demonstrate that the cep has operat ed to reduce the strength of candidates in connecticut below that attained without any public financing.id.at.we conclude,as a result,that there is insufficient evidence to show that the cep qualification criteria and distribution formulae have burdened the political opportunity of candidates in a way that is unfair or unnecessar y.id.at.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court on count one and enter judgment on that count for defendants.
plaintiffs have standing to challenge the cep trigger provisions which provide additional public funding to candidates when certain conditions are those provisions have a potential chilling effect on a plaintiffs practice of providing direct contributions to,candidates and b plaintiffs practice of making independent expenditures in support of,candidates.
the cep trigger provisions impose a penalty on the right of candidates and other individuals and organizations to spend personal funds for campaign speech.davis fed.election comm n.as a result,the trigger provisions violate the first amendment unless they are justified by a compelling state interest.id.at quotation marks omitted.in the case before us,the state asserted participation in the cep and eliminating corruption or the perception of not sufficiently compelling to justify a burden on the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech.see id.at.accordingly,the trigger provisions violate the first amendment,and we affirm the district court judgment for plaintiffs on counts two and three.
we remand the cause to the district court to determine,in the first instance,whether the trigger provisions are severable from the remainder of the cep and the cfra.to that end,the district court should develop the record to determine the effect of,given our judgment for defendants on count one and our judgment for plaintiffs on counts two and three.the district court should also conduct any other proceedings,consistent with this opinion,that may be appropriate or necessary.
the district court permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing the cep,but with the consent of all parties,the district court stayed that injunction pending this appeal.see green party of garfield,docket entry.we now vacate the permanent injunction entered by the district court and instruct the court to reconsider the scope of the injunctive relief necessary in this action in light of our holdings in this opinion and the district court resolution of the severability issue on remand.
the september,judgment of the district court on counts one,two,and three of this action is affirmed in part with respect to counts two and three,reversed in part with respect to count one,and the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with the instructions set forth above.
recognizing that an election has been scheduled for november,and given the importance of this case to ongoing campaigns for state office,we request that the district court act expeditiously in considering the issues presented for decision on remand.
i join so much of the majority opinion as affirms the district court judgment as to counts two and three but i respectfully dissent from the reversal with respect to count one,which challenged so much of the citizens election program cep as provides for the funding of candidates for the connecticut state legislature on the basis of their parties performance in the prior gubernatorial election.
under the cep,a candidate for the legislature whose party garnered less than of the vote in the prior gubernatorial election is not eligible to receive the maximum level of public funding for the legislative election if that party failed to win and failed to collect petition signatures equaling at least of the votes cast in the prior election for that legislative seat.in contrast,a candidate for the same legislative seat whose party similarly failed to win at least of the votes in the prior election for that legislative seat is eligible to receive the maximum level of public funding for the legislative election if his or her party won at least of the vote in the prior gubernatorial election.with respect to public support in such a legislative district,as neither candidate party has received of the vote the candidates are similarly situated.yet under the cep one candidate would receive a far l
