the evolution of this appeal illustrates the potential consequences when a decree of the supreme court is applied retroactively to a different case open at the time it is issued.just prior to the decree,plaintiffs were well on their way to recovering damages for age discrimination in pension benefits concededly committed by the state of new york.when the supreme court ruled,in another case,that states had sovereign immunity from suit under the statute upon which plaintiffs had been relying,plaintiffs prospects for victory vanished like spent light.
plaintiff mary mcginty is the executrix of the estate of maureen nash,who was employed by the new york state department of taxation and finance department and a member of the new york state and local employees retirement system retirement system.her death benefit beneficiary was plaintiff james nash.plaintiffs mcginty and nash,acting on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,filed suit against defendants,the retirement system,the state of new york state and the department under the age discrimination in employment act adea,as amended by the older workers benefit protection act of,stat.in particular,plaintiffs challenge what they claim were wrongful reductions in certain death and disability benefits based upon the age of the retirement system member.
plaintiffs appeal to this court for a second time,seeking reversal of a judgment entered in favor of defendants by the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn.see mcginty new york,d.on plaintiffs first appeal from an adverse judgment,we reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings.see mcginty new york,cir.the key issue on the appeal now before us is whether the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the state of new york defendants in light of the supreme court recent decision in kimel.bd.of regents,d,holding that the adea does not validly abrogate states eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.relying on kimel,the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint sua sponte.see mcginty,d at.
background 
the facts are set forth in detail in our prior opinion,with which familiarity is presumed.see mcginty,at.we set out only those facts relevant to the present appeal.
payment of death benefits 
defendants admit that for some years,from october,to june,the new york state death benefit system violated the adea.mcginty,at.death benefits were reduced when an employee joined the retirement system after turning age,and were further reduced percent for each year the employee worked after turning age,subject to a floor of percent of the benefit in force at age.retire.soc.sec.law a mckinney accord mcginty,at.maureen nash became a member of the retirement system at age and died at age while still employed her death benefit was thereby reduced under state law,in what defendants concede was a violation of the adea.
plaintiffs filed complaints of age discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in early.mcginty,at.at the same time,the state comptroller was unable to persuade the legislature to amend the to correct the adea violations by voluntarily making supplemental death benefit payments.id.at.it began making such payments in late.id.at.in october a benefits examiner contacted james nash as maureen nash beneficiary regarding the differential payment.id.at.plaintiffs commenced the instant class action in federal district court on october.
prior proceedings 
when plaintiffs brought their first appeal,the district court had dismissed their action on defendants motion under.b.we reversed the determination that plaintiffs death benefit claims were moot in light of the retirement system corrective supplemental payments,and ruled instead that the adea violations were willful and that plaintiffs were therefore entitled to liquidated damages under the adea.id.at.we remanded for a determination of damages and for a resolution of plaintiffs charge that the new administrative method for calculating death benefits still violated the adea.id.at.we also vacated the dismissal of plaintiffs disability benefit claims and remanded for the district court to reconsider plaintiffs standing to bring these claims.id.at.finally,we rejected defendants assertion of sovereign immunity.id.at quoting cooper state office of mental health,cir,vacated sub nom.bd.of trustees of of davis,d.
meanwhile,after plaintiffs had filed their appeal on july,but before we issued our decision on october,the supreme court granted certiorari in kimel.kimel.bd.of regents,cir,cert.granted,d.following our decision on the first appeal,defendants requested the district court to stay the matter pending the supreme court determination in kimel.that request was granted on october.
kimel was decided on january.on january,the district court sua sponte dismissed plaintiffs claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in a brief order it cited kimel holding that congress did not validly abrogate states sovereign immunity when it passed the adea.mcginty,d at.the trial court gave the parties no advance notice that dismissal was contemplated and afforded them no opportunity to brief the question of subject matter jurisdiction.from that order,plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
on appeal from a decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.viacom int l,kearney,cir,cert.denied,d.
i propriety of district court sua sponte dismissal 
whether a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question that may be raised at any time by the court sua sponte.lyndonville sav.bank trust lussier,cir.thus,the district court properly considered whether in light of kimel defendants had sovereign immunity that deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction.having found this immunity could be and was raised,the district court had reason to dismiss plaintiffs complaint.see id.at if subject matter jurisdiction is lacking,the action must be dismissed.
yet,the district court inappropriately dismissed the case without informing plaintiffs it was contemplating such action.a district court should not dismiss an action pending before it without first providing the adversely affected party with notice and an opportunity to be heard.acosta artuz,cir.notice serves several important purposes.it gives the adversely affected party a chance to develop the record to show why dismissal is improper it facilitates de novo review of legal conclusions by ensuring the presence of a record before an appellate court,see goodrich betkoski,cir and,it helps the trial court avoid the risk that it may have overlooked valid answers to what it perceives as defects in plaintiff case,snider melindez,cir.for example,while the district court ruled the adea did not abrogate defendants right to assert sovereign immunity,it failed to address whether immunity might have been waived or whether the retirement system was entitled to assert immunity as an arm of the state.either a yes answer to the first question,or a no answer to the second,would have required a different result.
recognizing that a sua sponte dismissal absent notice and an opportunity to be heard can itself be grounds for reversal,lewis new york,cir,we nevertheless undertake to address the issues raised on this appeal ourselves.unlike lewis,where defendants refused to defend the merits of the district court sua sponte dismissal because they had never been served,plaintiffs and defendants here have fully briefed all the questions raised on this appeal.since those issues are predominantly of a legal nature,we believe we are adequately informed to decide them.stone williams,cir question not passed on by district court was addressed because the facts were undisputed and the legal question fully briefed.
ii applicability of kimel 
prior to the supreme court decision in kimel,plaintiffs had prevailed in this action.regarding the sequence of events relative to a supreme court pronouncement,when that court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review.harper.dep t of taxation,d.
the eleventh amendment provides 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
const.amend.xi.that amendment bars suits that seek either money damages,see edelman jordan,d recognizing that a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the eleventh amendment,or injunctive relief,see cory white,d holding that the eleventh amendment by its terms clearly applies to a suit seeking an injunction.
although sovereign immunity extends beyond the literal text of the eleventh amendment to bar a citizen from suing his own state under federal question jurisdiction,see hans louisiana,there are two recognized exceptions to the bar when congress authorizes such a suit through enforcement of of the fourteenth amendment,and where a state consents to being sued.college sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.kimel examines the first exception with respect to the adea.
to determine whether congress properly abrogated states eleventh amendment immunity,two questions are asked.see kimel,at.first,did congress unequivocally express its intent to abrogate immunity and second,did congress act pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority seminole tribe of florida,d.the supreme court answered the first question yes,saying that the plain language of the adea clearly demonstrates congress intent to subject the states to suit for money damages at the hands of individual employees.kimel,at.but the answer to the second question was no.
the supreme court had previously ruled that the adea embrace of state governments within its ambit was constitutional as an exercise of congress commerce clause powers under article i of the constitution.see eeoc wyoming,d.kimel,however,reaffirmed the holding of seminole tribe that article i did not include the power to subject states to suit at the hands of private individuals.at.the court therefore turned its attention to of the fourteenth amendment where it applied a congruence and proportionality test to decide whether a federal statute is appropriate remedial legislation or improper legislation that purports to redefine the fourteenth amendment right at issue.id.at.because age is not a suspect classification under the equal protection clause,states may discriminate on the basis of age if the age classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.id.at.
surveying cases in which states were found not to have violated the equal protection clause by relying on broad generalizations regarding age,the supreme court observed that it is clear that the adea is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it can not be understood as responsive to,or designed to prevent,unconstitutional behavior.id.at.quoting city of boerne flores,d.nothing in the legislative history of the adea,the court continued,indicated congress had identified a pattern of age discrimination by the states,or that any discrimination rose to the level of a constitutional violation.id.at.hence,it concluded 
in light of the indiscriminate scope of the act substantive requirements,and the lack of evidence of widespread and unconstitutional age discrimination by the states,we hold that the adea is not a valid exercise of congress power under of the fourteenth amendment.the adea purported abrogation of the states sovereign immunity is accordingly invalid.
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish kimel by seizing upon the opinion language reviewing the rational relationship test under the equal protection clause and the adea legislative history.plaintiffs highlight defendants willful violations of the adea.yet,while no one disputes the willful nature of defendants actions,the supreme court made clear that adea violations do not necessarily translate into violations of the equal protection clause.see kimel,at.the adea,through its broad restriction on the use of age as a discriminating factor,prohibits substantially more state employment decisions and practices than would likely be held unconstitutional under the applicable equal protection,rational basis standard.
pressing their argument,plaintiffs maintain that defendants calculation of death benefits is a form of age discrimination with no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.even assuming defendants conduct rose to the level of a constitutional violation,such would not show a pattern of unconstitutional age discrimination by the states across the nation sufficient to justify the broad prohibitions in the adea.moreover,nothing in kimel suggests sovereign immunity is limited under the adea should a state engage in age discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause.rather,the supreme court unequivocally stated that the adea does not validly abrogate the states sovereign immunity.id.at.
consequently,while an aggrieved party can pursue avenues other than the adea when faced with age discrimination,see id.at,it clearly can not mount an adea claim against a state without its consent in federal court,see id.at.t he constitution does not provide for federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting states.since plaintiffs in this case assert federal question jurisdiction premised solely on the adea,they may continue their suit only if defendants waived immunity.we turn next to that issue.
iii waiver of sovereign immunity 
plaintiffs contend defendants waived immunity by declining to raise it as a defense and instead participating in the eeoc proceeding initiated when plaintiffs filed their complaint with the agency.the standards for finding waiver were recently reiterated.since a waiver of immunity is voluntary,made either by invoking federal jurisdiction or by a clear declaration,a stringent test is used to determine whether waiver has occurred.college sav.bank,at.
before addressing the merits of plaintiffs contention,we pause to consider defendants argument that it was not possible for them to have raised an immunity defense before the eeoc since states are deemed to have consented to suits brought by the federal government.see alden,at.the adea does give the eeoc authority to enforce employees rights under the statute.see c t he right of any person to bring such action under the adea shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by the eeoc.this enforcement,however,occurs when the eeoc brings suit in federal court.see,eeoc kidder,peabody,cir indicating the eeoc filed a complaint in federal court pursuant to the adea.that procedure is distinct from an individual filing a complaint with the agency.
in addition,the supreme court in alden explained that the concerns associated with a state being able to assert sovereign immunity in a suit brought by private persons do not exist when a suit is commenced and prosecuted against a state in the name of the united states by those who are entrusted with the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.at.quoting const.art.ii.nothing before us suggests that plaintiffs complaint with the eeoc was commenced or prosecuted in the name of the federal government.
returning to plaintiffs argument,they make no representation that defendants expressly consented to being sued in district court.see college sav.bank,at.instead,plaintiffs assert defendants failure to raise the immunity defense before the eeoc was tantamount to affirmatively invoking federal jurisdiction.but the cases upon which plaintiffs rely to demonstrate this proposition are factually distinguishable.
for example,in clark barnard,a state waived sovereign immunity when it voluntarily appeared in court prosecuting its claim to a fund that was the subject of the controversy.because it intervened as an actor as well as a defendant,the court had to adjudicate the adverse rights of the parties,including the state,to the fund.id.at.the same can not be said of defendants in the pending appeal.they were all named as respondents in plaintiffs eeoc proceeding and as defendants in the instant action.no intervention occurred,no claims were asserted by the state defendants,and no resolution of issues other than those presented by plaintiffs complaints had to be resolved.
plaintiffs also rely on gardner new jersey.in that case a state filed a claim against a debtor estate,which was subject to the rulings of the bankruptcy court.where a state is an actor,seeking something as a claimant,it waives any immunity it might otherwise have respecting adjudication of the claim.id.at.here,none of the state defendants filed claims before the eeoc or the district court.the facts underlying gardner therefore are inapposite.
finally,plaintiffs point to one of our decisions to show defendants participation in the eeoc proceeding amounts to a waiver of immunity.in that case,the state of new york imposed a gains tax upon a debtor about to sell its interest in a hotel as part of a reorganization plan.fifth,state dep t of taxation fin.in re fifth,cir.the debtor sought a declaration in bankruptcy court that it was exempt from the tax and entitled to a refund from the state.the state filed an administrative expense claim for additional gains tax liability.the lower courts considered that act of filing to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.the bankruptcy code then in effect provided that a governmental unit is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which such governmental unit claim arose.a,later amended and recodified at b.we read the statute on appeal as a clear expression of congress purpose to require a waiver of immunity.at.since the basis for the state administrative expense claim and the debtor claim for a refund both arose out of the sale of the debtor interest in the hotel,we reasoned that the state had waived its eleventh amendment immunity.id.at.
what distinguishes the present case from fifth avenue associates is that here no affirmative claim was made by the state of new york,the department or the retirement system.thus,their involvement in the eeoc proceeding constitutes no waiver of sovereign immunity.nor can plaintiffs prevail on their implicit argument that the fact of defendants participation in the eeoc proceeding warrants a finding of waiver,even without the filing of independent claims.not only do plaintiffs fail to cite any than the three just distinguished in the foregoing also we were unable to find any case resolving this issue in plaintiffs favor.rather,we recently affirmed a decision where the district court found no waiver of immunity when,prior to the lawsuit,the state consented to the eeoc taking over responsibility from the new york state division of human rights for investigating the plaintiff discrimination complaints.see jungels state.coll.of,aff,cir table.
moreover,the supreme court and this court have repeatedly held that a state may assert eleventh amendment sovereign immunity at any time during the course of proceedings.see,calderon ashmus,d the eleventh amendment is jurisdictional in that it limits a federal court judicial power,and may be invoked at any stage of the proceedings pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d same richardson state dep t of corr,cir the defense of eleventh amendment immunity need not be raised in trial court to be considered on the merits leonhard united states,cir sovereign immunity need not be expressly raised in the district court or on appeal since it is a jurisdictional defect and may be raised at any time.consequently,while defendants appeared before the eeoc,and even though they never asserted sovereign immunity as a defense,they are entitled to raise it in response to plaintiffs adea complaint.
this conclusion holds true regardless whether the eeoc proceeding is separate from or part of this federal lawsuit.if the eeoc investigation is distinct from the instant adea litigation,defendants participation in the investigation would have no bearing on their right to raise sovereign immunity as a defense to a federal court action.if the two are not distinct,defendants ability to raise the defense at any time means that waiting did not constitute a waiver of their right to raise the defense later in their answer.
it is urged,finally,that defendants waived immunity through their acceptance of federal funds.because this argument was raised for the first time in plaintiffs reply brief,we generally would not consider it.thomas roach,cir.but were we to reach the merits,this contention would also fail.although congress may,pursuant to its spending power,extract a constructive waiver of eleventh amendment immunity by placing conditions on the grant of funds to states,see college sav.bank,at.citing south dakota dole,d,waiver based on participation in a federal program will be found only if stated in express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.dep t of health rehabilitative servs.nursing home ass n,d per curiam alteration in original quoting edelman,at.that is to say,mere participation by a state in a federal program providing financial assistance does not establish the state consent to be sued in federal court.edelman,at.because plaintiffs failed to identify under what statutes defendants receive federal funding,or what congress provided for in those statutes with respect to sovereign immunity,we have no way of ascertaining what congress intended or whether the abrogation of immunity was expressed in unmistakably clear language.welch.dep t of highways pub,d.
in sum,plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the stringent test for finding waiver of immunity has been met.nor have we seen any of the required evidence that defendants made a clear declaration that they intended to submit to federal court jurisdiction.hence,plaintiffs waiver argument may not succeed.
iv whether the retirement system is an arm of the state 
we pass now to the question of whether defendant retirement system is an arm of the state entitled to assert sovereign immunity as a defense to this suit against it.the eleventh amendment extends immunity not only to a state,but also to entities considered arms of the state.posr court officer shield,cir see also healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d asking whether the defendant board of education was an arm of the state,in which case sovereign immunity would be extended to it.plaintiffs argue that the retirement system falls outside this category.
in determining whether an entity is an arm of a state,six factors are initially considered.see mancuso state thruway,cir.those factors,identified in feeney port authority,cir,aff on other grounds,d,are derived from lake country estates,tahoe regional planning agency,d.they are how the entity is referred to in its documents of origin how the governing members of the entity are appointed how the entity is funded whether the entity function is traditionally one of local or state government whether the state has a veto power over the entity actions and whether the entity financial obligations are binding upon the state.mancuso,at.if these factors point in one direction,the inquiry is complete.if not,a court must ask whether a suit against the entity in federal court would threaten the integrity of the state and expose its treasury to risk.id.if the answer is still in doubt,a concern for the state fisc will control.hess port auth,d quoting feeney,at,with approval.
we examine the six factors.
a.how the retirement system is referred to in state statutes 
the retirement system was formed under new york statute,now codified at article of retire.soc.sec.law mckinney supp,and has the powers and privileges of a corporation,id.in mancuso,we noted that the phrase public corporation is of little help in determining whether an entity is an arm of the state,and looked to new york case law for clarification.see at.
the new york court of appeals has stated that the retirement system is the kind of state instrumentality that is clothed with the sovereign immunity of the state.glassman glassman.notwithstanding that the state retirement system is a corporation,endowed with the powers and privileges that inhere to that kind of entity,glassman said this fact had no effect on the agency immunity.see id.at.plaintiffs say this conclusion was dicta since the retirement system was only an incidental party to the real controversy between a husband and wife over the wife entitlement as creditor to reach funds deposited by the husband in the system.id.at.even granting that,still,new york highest court tells us how new york courts view the retirement system,and because plaintiffs point to no contrary authority,this factor favors granting immunity to the system.
b.how governing members of the retirement system are appointed 
retirement system officers are designated by statute.the state comptroller serves as administrative head,retire.soc.sec.law a,as well as trustee,id.b.the state attorney general serves as legal advisor,id,and the system is subject to supervision by the state superintendent of insurance,id.the superintendent of insurance is in turn appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate.ins.law mckinney.the custody of the retirement system funds is vested in the head of the division of the treasury of the department of taxation and finance.retire.soc.sec.law d.given that the state legislature and the governor ratified the statutes by which these officers were designated,this factor too leans in favor of immunity.see glassman,at,the close relationship between the retirement system and the state government is apparent throughout the civil service law provisions from which the retirement and social security law was derived which create and govern the affairs of the system.
it makes no difference that the comptroller and the attorney general are elected officials because,regardless of that fact,the state has named them to positions of authority in the retirement system.mancuso,at holding that the appointment of thruway authority members by the governor with the advice and consent of the state senate leans toward immunity feeney,at noting that the state appointment of commissioners to the port authority trans hudson corporation favors immunity.
c.how the retirement system is funded 
the retirement system consists of four funds titled annuity savings,annuity reserve,pension accumulation,and pension reserve.retire.soc.sec.law.monies are provided by several sources.the state as an employer makes an annual appropriation,id.a,as do other participating employers,id.employee members of the retirement system also make contributions via payroll deductions.id.b d.an exception exists however,for state employees who became members prior to july,in which case no further contributions are required.id.a.their contributions are covered by the state in its annual appropriation.id.b.
ascertaining the particular funds where these contributions are deposited and from which benefits are paid is equally important.payroll deductions from a retirement system member,once remitted to the comptroller,are deposited in the annuity savings fund.id.f.upon retirement,contributions to that fund are transferred to the annuity reserve fund,from which all annuities and all benefits in lieu of annuities are paid.id.a b.an annuity is defined as t he annual allowance for life,payable in monthly installments and derived from a member accumulated contributions.id.
the state and other employers make contributions to the pension accumulation fund.id.a,a.expenses incurred by the retirement system are covered by monies contributed to this fund,in addition to monies appropriated in the state executive budget.id.b,b.when a pension becomes payable,monies are transferred from the pension accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund.id.b.ordinary death benefits,as those received by plaintiff james payable wholly out of the pension accumulation fund.id.a,b.
even with the payroll deductions of member employees,the state makes significant payments each year to the retirement system for the payment of benefits and expenses.in particular,death benefits are payable out of a fund to which only the state and other participating employers presently contribute.these facts distinguish mancuso where we ruled the state was not required to fund the thruway authority operations since such funding was limited by law to a guarantee on the initial bond offering and to isolated instances of allocated funds for specific projects advocated by the state.see at.hence,the third factor also weighs in favor of immunity.
whether the function of the retirement system is traditionally one of state or local government 
glassman described the retirement system as taking part in an important governmental function by providing retirement pensions,annuities and other employment benefits for its personnel,comparable to those received by the employees of private industry.at.in so doing,it assists and promotes the efficient operation of the affairs of the state itself.id.at.
the fact that the retirement system also facilitates pension benefits for municipal employees does not mean it is not serving state employees,since it was originally created as a plan for state employees.only later was it extended to cover county,city,town and village employees.mcdermott regan.moreover,by way of analogy,we said in mancuso that since the state thruway covered the entire state,the thruway authority performed a function that a state would normally provide,even though the construction and operation of roads and bridges could be seen as either a state or local function.at.although the retirement system does not service state employees exclusively,it assists in the business of the state by enabling the state to meet its pension and benefits obligations,and immunity should accordingly be extended to the retirement system.
whether the state has veto power over the actions of the retirement system 
the comptroller as the administrative head and trustee of the funds of the retirement system is thereby authorized to adopt and amend only such rules and regulations as he determines to be for the best interests of the retirement system.retire.soc.sec.law g.
there are certain legal restraints on the retirement system.for example,funds are to be invested only in accordance with state law.id.b.without specifying exactly how funds may be invested,the statutory scheme includes percentage limits,and identifies permissible and impermissible investments.see generally id.entitled management of funds id.a entitled investments of public pension funds.further,the system is subject to the supervision of the superintendent of insurance,id,who may require the comptroller to file an annual report and to respond to inquiries related to transactions or to the condition of the retirement system,ins.law b.the superintendent may promulgate standards with respect to a number of financial practices including investment policies and financial soundness.id.b.he is required to conduct an examination into the affairs of the retirement system at least once every five years and to incorporate his findings in a report made available for public inspection and filed with the governor,the comptroller and the legislature.id.b.while these provisions do not constitute a veto power,they subject the comptroller to strong oversight protections limiting his discretion.
at the same time,new york court of appeals has held that the state legislature does not have unfettered power over the retirement system.sgaglione levitt,struck down of the new york state financial emergency act for the city of new york,which was enacted in.sgaglione ruled that this section of the law violated the state constitution because implicit in the constitution is protection for the source of funds for retirement benefits.id.at.thus,although the legislature reserved to itself some flexibility in shaping the retirement system,it is not unlimited.id.at.
these concepts were reaffirmed in mcdermott regan,where the court stated that w here the state maintains some independent authority in regard to the comptroller,concomitant with that authority is
