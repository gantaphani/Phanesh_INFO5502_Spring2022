vinoo varghese,counsel for mary mayo,moves for permission to withdraw as counsel in this appeal.mayo appeals from a civil judgment ordering the forfeiture of two pieces of real property,one of which is her primary residence,and a sum of currency.although claimants in civil forfeiture proceedings lack a sixth amendment right to counsel,congress,through the civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra,has created a statutory right to fill that void.the district court appointed varghese to represent mayo pursuant to this statute,b a,as did we for purposes of this appeal.
like the limited exception to the constitutional right to counsel announced in anders california,the statutory right to counsel under cafra is not absolute.we need not,and therefore do not,reach the question of whether these distinct rights to counsel are coextensive.however,we hold that,with regard to motions to withdraw filed by appellate counsel appointed pursuant to b a,the procedure established under anders and its progeny is best suited to protect the right to counsel to which indigent litigants,such as claimantappellant,are entitled.
counsel has not filed an appellate brief on behalf of mayo,despite receiving several extensions of the relevant deadlines.instead,he now seeks to withdraw and supporting authority,record citations,or the issues in the appeal are not viable.we appointed varghese to act as mayo zealous advocate,not an amicus curiae.accordingly,because counsel application falls short of the standards announced in anders,the motion is denied.
background 
the government commenced this action in january,seeking to take possession of two properties and in united states currency,all of which it alleged was subject to forfeiture because,inter alia,the property was traceable to the exchange of controlled substances.see a c an attorney initially appeared in the case on behalf of the defendants in rem as well as mary mayo,who intervened in the action as a claimant with an interest in the properties.at a december,settlement conference,however,mayo consented to allow the attorney to withdraw.
on december,mayo filed a motion requesting that the district court appoint her new counsel,along with a declaration indicating that the real properties at issue serve as her homes and that she could not afford an attorney.application for the court to request counsel,united states stuyvesant,civ.the district court granted the motion,and instructed the legal services corporation to provide counsel from the criminal justice act panel pursuant to u.b a.on april,the legal services corporation consent ed to the appointment of vinoo varghese,as counsel for mayo in the district court proceedings.varghese went on to represent mayo at a jury trial,which resulted in a september,verdict in favor of the government.the district court entered a decree of final forfeiture on november.
on november,varghese filed a notice of appeal on mayo behalf.by letter dated january,varghese represented to this court that he was appearing as mayo l ead attorney of record.on april,after receiving several extensions of the relevant submission deadlines,varghese filed a motion on behalf of mayo requesting that he be formally appointed as her counsel in this appeal pursuant to b a and an additional extension of the briefing schedule.
we granted the motion in both respects and entered a revised scheduling order directing varghese to file his client opening brief by november.counsel failed to meet that deadline.the clerk of the court therefore entered an order on january,which stated that the appeal will be dismissed effective january,if brief and appendix are not filed by that date.no extension of time to file will be granted.
once again,counsel did not heed our scheduling order.on the day of the final deadline,january,he filed the instant motion requesting that the court permit him to withdraw from his representation of mayo.the government did not take a position regarding the application.the motion did not include an affirmation from mayo,legal authority,record citations,or analysis of mayo appellate arguments.instead,it was accompanied only by a affirmation from varghese that stated,in pertinent part 
after reviewing all the transcripts and evidence in this case,i have determined that there are no viable issues on appeal which could lead to reversal.thus,i do not wish to waste the court or the government time in filing an appeal that i know has no chance of succeeding on appeal.
i also do not seek compensation for the hours i have spent filing the necessary notices and motions on this appeal,as well as the time attending the camp conference,and for my research hours.
varghese aff.emphasis in original.varghese also indicated that he had informed appellant of his findings regarding the of her appeal,but that she still wished to pursue the appeal.id.based on those representations,counsel ask ed the court to allow appellant to proceed pro se and to set a new briefing schedule.id.
ii.discussion 
having invoked b a as the basis for his appointment in this appeal,counsel now seeks permission to withdraw.the motion rests principally on counsel representation that,in his view,the appeal is not viable.in a criminal appeal,this bald by a brief in any be insufficient to permit appointed counsel to withdraw under anders california.insofar as this motion is concerned,we have not identified material differences between the federal constitutional concerns presented by an anders motion and the statutory directives from congress that are at issue here.accordingly,for the reasons set forth below,the motion is denied.
although the supreme court has not categorically rejected the application of the sixth amendment right to counsel in civil forfeiture proceedings,several circuits,including this one,have done so.united states blackheath road,cir citing austin united states.soon after our decision in blackheath road,congress overhauled the civil forfeiture laws by enacting the civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra,stat.in passing cafra,congress was reacting to public outcry over the government pursuit of civil and criminal forfeiture.united states khan,f d,cir see also,at citing united states all assets of statewide auto parts,cir.one of the e ight c ore r eforms of cafra was the creation of a statutory right to counsel in certain types of civil forfeiture proceedings,at.the pertinent provision for the purpose of this motion is b a,which created a right to counsel for the indigent in civil forfeiture actions involving their homes 
if a person with standing to contest the forfeiture of property in a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel,and the property subject to forfeiture is real property that is being used by the person as a primary residence,the court,at the request of the person,shall insure that the person is represented by an attorney for the legal services corporation with respect to the claim.
id.thus,where an indigent claimant seeks counsel in a civil forfeiture action relating to his or her primary residence,the court shall insure that the person is represented.id.emphasis added the house of representatives report that accompanied cafra suggests that the provision was intended to create a right to counsel similar to the sixth amendment right in criminal proceedings.see,at 
of course,even in criminal proceedings,the sixth amendment right to counsel is not absolute.relevant here is anders california,which recognizes the limited exception to indigent defendants right to the effective assistance of counsel on direct appeals from convictions.united states hall,cir.based on the sixth amendment exception arising out of anders,we have created a procedure whereby appointed counsel may seek to withdraw from a criminal appeal in instances where professional ethics and judicial economy require an attorney to inform the court that the appeal is frivolous.see,united states leyba,cir.
under anders,there are several prerequisites that must be satisfied before we will allow an appointed attorney to withdraw,united states whitley,cir.among other thin
