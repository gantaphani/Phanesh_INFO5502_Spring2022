proceedings below 
after a five day evidentiary hearing in this case,the district court made extensive findings of fact,as follows.petitioner adam hofmann is a canadian citizen.he was born,raised,educated,and continues to work in montreal,quebec.roa doc.at he is not a citizen of,nor does he have a visa to work in any other country.id.respondent abigail sender is a united states citizen.she was born and raised in the united states and attended medical school beginning in at mcgill university in montreal,quebec.id.she was formerly a permanent resident of canada.at one time she applied for,but never received,canadian citizenship.id.hofmann and sender met and began dating while they were residing in montreal and serving as medical residents at mcgill.id.at.both parties earned medical degrees that are recognized as the equivalent of a comparable degree in the united states.hofmann,however,is unable to work in the united states due to his immigration status.in montreal,the parties attended the spanish and portuguese synagogue.they were married there in february and lived together in montreal as husband and wife until may or june of.id.at.their first son,r,was born in montreal in january.id.at.after the baby birth,sender traveled to new york so that her family could help her care for the child.id.in the fall of,hofmann took two months of unpaid leave in order to spend time with his wife and child at the home of his in new york.id.at that time,hofmann and sender discussed their marital difficulties,including problems they were having with their families.they also discussed the possibility of having a second child and of relocating outside of canada.id.they took various trips to communities in new york and new jersey in order to see whether any would make a suitable future home.they were particularly concerned about finding an orthodox jewish community where they could raise their family.id.at.hofmann and sender returned to montreal with their son later in,but they kept open the possibility of relocating to new york at some point in.id.
around this time,the relationship between the parties families broke down entirely.as a result,hofmann cut all ties with his immediate family,stopped speaking with his parents,and did not attend his brother wedding.id.in the summer of,hofmann and sender both finished their medical training,and hofmann received an offer to work at sacre coeur hospital in montreal.sender agreed that hofmann should accept the position because of his interest in working in an academic institution and the possibility that he could moonlight at other hospitals.id.hofmann and sender also continued to discuss a possible relocation to the united states.toward this end,hofmann exchanged emails with recruiters and other doctors in order to explore opportunities for work in the united states.id.ex.bl,bm.the parties,however,did not make a final decision to relocate at any point in,and at that time hofmann took no steps to obtain legal resident status in the united states.sender continued to travel to new york and new jersey to look at schools and communities that might suit the parties needs if they were to relocate.id.at.
the lease for the parties montreal apartment,where they had resided since their wedding,expired in the summer of.hofmann employment with sacre coeur hospital also ended around the same time,and the parties moved to another apartment in montreal.the new apartment was less expensive,but was still close to the spanish and portuguese synagogue.on july,the parties second son,a,was born in montreal.at some point that summer,the parties decided that sender would take the children to stay for a prolonged period at her parents home in rifton,new york in order that her parents could help with the children.doc.at.on august,sender and the children departed for new york,taking with them certain personal and family belongings for their stay.hofmann switched to a position covering for doctors who had gone on leave so that he could have more flexibility to spend time with his family in new york.the new position was less prestigious than his former academic career path,but it allowed him to spend approximately half of his time with his wife and children in rifton.
in the hearing before the district court,the parties vigorously contested the purpose of the trip to rifton.hofmann asserted that the trip was intended as a temporary visit,and that sender and the children intended to return to montreal after the winter.doc.at.sender,by contrast,claimed that the move to rifton was the first step in the family permanent relocation to new york.id.on this point,the district court found that sender testimony was specific and in large part credible,noting that sender testimony was supported by the actions of the parties,which included moving clothes,toys,and other essentials to rifton,consistent with a lengthy stay.after sender had gone to new york,hofmann periodically brought more of his and sender belongings to her parents home in rifton.the district court found that the second montreal apartment did not seem suitable for a family residence,because of its smaller size.id.at.the parties made renovations to a room in sender parents house in order to accommodate their family for an extended period of time.id.at.
in september the parties opened a joint bank account in new paltz,new york.between the end of and the beginning of they transferred over to that account.id.their older son,who was three at the time,began attending classes in new york.id.the district court found,however,that the parties had not reached the unequivocal decision to relocate to new york,by august.id.at.although sender had abandoned her pursuit of canadian citizenship by this point,the court found that as late as november and december of,the parties were still considering the possibility of permanently settling in a new residence in montreal.id.the evidence showed that the parties had no intent of residing permanently in rifton because it does not have an orthodox community or an orthodox school for the parties children,and until august,sender had not found a permanent residence in new york.
sender returned to canada at least once in the fall of and once in the winter of.in the fall of,sender renewed her quebec car insurance.during sender visit,hofmann and sender met with an attorney to execute a divestiture of assets that hofmann held in a company owned by his family.id.at.in the fall of and the winter of,sender also continued to receive certain tax credits and maternity leave from her job in montreal.those payments were predicated precisely on the understanding that she would return to the job at some point in the future.id.at citing ex.
on this record,the district court determined that hofmann had acquiesced to the children removal to new york in august of.the court also found that until september,the parties believed that,if they were relocating permanently to new york they were doing it as a family.id.at.the court determined that while this condition may not have been expressly stated,it was understood by the parties,and it certainly was understood by hofmann.in the court view,both petitioner and respondent specifically and persuasively testified to their shared understanding of this condition.id.on direct examination,hofmann testified that he consented to respondent travel to new york with the children based on his understanding that he and the children,would stay as a family come what may.the court found this statement was consistent with hofmann other actions including his institution of this hague convention proceeding immediately after he was served with divorce papers.similarly,the court found that sender testified,both on direct and on cross examination,that it was her understanding and assumption that she and hofmann were relocating to new york as a family.sender admitted on cross examination that the only reason hofmann had allowed her to take the children to new york in was his belief that he would remain part of the family.she also stated that the parties had agreed to move to new york as a family,and that it was an attempted rebirth of their marriage.id.at.
throughout the spring of,the parties continued to search in new york for a suitable community for the family and a suitable school for the children.id.at.hofmann continued his work moonlighting at the hospital in montreal but did not take a permanent position.id.at.hofmann paid canadian income taxes,while sender filed tax returns in both canada and the united states.id.at.in february or march of,sender cancelled her quebec health insurance,informed her employer that she would not be returning to work,and repaid to the insurance plan.id.at.hofmann continued to make regular trips to new york to visit his family,and in the spring the parties older son was accepted for enrollment at breuers yeshiva in new york.id.at.in may of,the parties shipped their belongings to a storage unit in new york.that year sender filed tax returns only in the united states.id.
between february,and september,sender was indicating to hofmann that she was looking for a suitable family home in the metro new york area.id.in the summer of,however,sender had become increasingly discontent in her marriage and began to speak with divorce attorneys.in august,she found a home for herself and the children near the school the parties had selected.throughout this period the parties and their children,sometimes accompanied by sender mother,continued to go on family vacations on the weekends.id.sender never mentioned the possibility of divorce to hofmann,and,in fact,she took pains to hide the fact that she was seeing attorneys,including making all attorney fee payments in cash.id.at.at some point in,the parties spoke to an attorney in new york about changing their family name.both the parties signed forms explaining that their intent in changing their and their children names was to separate themselves further from a family situation,obviously from petitioner family.id.at citing exhibits n,o,and p.sender and the children last names were changed to sender,and r middle name was also changed.hofmann could not change his last name because he lacked legal status in the united states.id.at.
hofmann continued to pursue a path to achieving legal status in the united states,and as late as august of he had contacted at least two immigration lawyers regarding his obtaining american citizenship.there was conflicting testimony as to whether sender had stalled hofmann attempts to obtain a green card that would have been based on his marriage to her,and sender testified that she had at various times agreed to sponsor hofmann for immigration status.she also testified that she encouraged hofmann to consider other options,including a work visa.id.at.ultimately,hofmann never obtained any sort of legal status in the united states that would have permitted him to work here.id.
in late august,sender retained counsel for the divorce proceeding against hofmann.id.at.the next day,she requested that hofmann expedite delivery of documents that would allow her,acting unilaterally,to change the children names on their passport s.id.at citing ex.she claimed the documents were needed so that the passports could be used to enroll r at breuers.the district court found,however,that sender asked for these documents in an attempt to complete the name change before hofmann realized that she was going to seek to divorce him and seek custody of the children.id.at.
in august,the parties went on their last vacation as a family even though at this point sender had already decided to divorce hofmann.the district court found,based on the parties testimony,that at the end of the vacation,sender kissed hofmann on the cheek goodbye before he drove back to montreal.id.at.sender asked hofmann to return to the united states on september and.hofmann was told to meet sender at a specific hotel in new jersey,and sender also told hofmann he was coming to join the family for r first day of school.id.when hofmann arrived at the hotel in new jersey,his family was not there.instead he was served with divorce papers while he stood in the parking lot of the hotel.id.hofmann returned to canada and filed with the canadian central authority the hague convention petition for return of the children to canada,which is the subject of our present review.
based on its findings of fact,the district court reached the following conclusions the parties children were habitually resident in canada and although hofmann had consented to the children removal to the united states,that consent was a conditional one,contingent on his accompanying them and residing with them and sender as a family in the united states.id.at.the district court found,therefore,that the parties last shared intent with respect to the children residence was for the children to reside in canada.id.at citing mota castillo,cir.see also baxter baxter,cir.the district court also concluded that the children had not become so acclimated to new york that a return to canada would be harmful to them,doc at,and because the wrongful retention of the children under the hague convention occurred on september,when sender had hofmann served with divorce papers,id.at,the affirmative defense that the children were well settled in the united states did not apply.id.at.largely for the reasons on which it based its determination of the children habitual residence,the district court also found that the affirmative defenses of consent and acquiescence did not apply.id.at.the court thus granted hofmann petition and ordered that the children be returned to canada,enabling the canadian courts to determine issues of parental custody.subsequently,the quebec superior court,family division issued an order granting temporary sole custody to the respondent appellant sender and directing that the children be returned to new york.a further hearing is scheduled in montreal on may.the quebec superior court awarded petitioner appellee hofmann visitation and phone access rights.
on appeal,sender argues primarily that the district court committed clear error when it found that hofmann agreement that the children move to the united states was conditioned upon their residing together as a family in the united states.she asserts,in substance,that the district court was wrong in its analysis of the evidence.sender contends that the parties,in fact,shared the intention to relocate to new york and that there is no evidence to support the district court conclusion that hofmann consent was conditional in any way.in a similar vein,she asserts that because she and her husband had begun the process of moving from montreal to new york,which included her taking the children to reside in new york while hofmann continued to try to move there,that was sufficient to establish the parties joint intention that the children were to reside in new york.she contends,moreover,that if this court were to accept the district court determination that a conditional consent controlled the determination of a child habitual residence,it would effectively preclude married couples that have consented to relocate from one country to another from ever separating or dissolving their union,lest one of the parties claim that remaining married with the family fully intact was an implied condition precedent to the consent to relocate.sender also asserts that the children are now so well settled in the united states that under the hague convention their habitual residence has changed.she argues that the district court decision is contrary to the purposes of the hague convention,and that certain affirmative defenses available under the convention should apply.for the reasons set forth below,we disagree.
ii.jurisdiction 
although neither party to this appeal has raised the issue before this court,it was raised before the district court,and we have an obligation to examine our jurisdiction nostra sponte.kalson paterson,cir.thus,we consider whether the return of the children to canada pursuant to the district court january,order renders this case moot.see,beiker beiker,cir holding that child return to israel rendered appeal of district court decision under the hague convention moot see also whiting krassner,cir recognizing circuit split on the issue of whether child return to the country of habitual residence outside of the united states rendered an appeal moot.the supreme court has now decisively answered that question in chafin chafin,where it held that although t he hague convention mandates the prompt return of children to their countries of habitual residence,such return does not render th e case moot there is a live dispute between the parties over where their child ren will be raised,and there is a possibility of effectual relief for the prevailing parent.the courts below therefore continue to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the parties respective claims.chafin chafin,d.in line with chafin,therefore,we hold that the fact that the parties children have already been returned to canada pursuant to the district court order does not render this appeal moot.it remains a live case and controversy.id.
iii.discussion 
the hague convention on civil aspects of international child abduction seeks to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state,and to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.abbott abbott,d internal quotation marks omitted.the united states is a contracting state to the convention,which has been implemented domestically by icara,et.abbott.at.the central remedy under the convention is the return of the child.abbott.at.when a child under the age of has been wrongfully removed or retained,the country to which the child has been brought must order the return of the child forthwith,unless certain exceptions apply.id.internal quotation marks omitted.to that end,icara provides that a ny person seeking to initiate judicial proceedings under the convention for the return of a child or for arrangements for securing the effective exercise of rights of access to a child may do so by commencing a civil action in a state or federal court in the place where the child is located at the time the petition is filed.mota castillo,cir quoting b.
article of the convention provides that 
t he removal or the retention of the child is to be considered wrongful where 
it is in breach of the rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
abbott.at quoting the hague convention article.thus,a petitioner under the hague convention must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the child was habitually resident in one state and has been removed to or retained in a different state the removal or retention was in breach of the petitioner custody rights under the law of the state of habitual residence and the petitioner was exercising those rights at the time of the removal or retention.gitter gitter,cir.
we turn first to issues raised under subsection b of article and the third element identified in gitter.the parties do not dispute that hofmann had custody rights under quebec law,recognized by the convention,which he was exercising at the time the children were retained by sender.doc.at.the district court found that hofmann multiple visits to new york as well as his participation in family vacations demonstrated that he was exercising his custodial rights up to the time the divorce proceedings were initiated.id.at.in sum,the district court concluded that hofmann had initially consented to the children removal from quebec as part of the anticipated change in residence but that sender retention of the children became wrongful once she sought to prevent hofmann from exercising his custody rights under quebec law.id.at see also baxter,at.each of these conclusions finds sound support in the record,including hofmann and sender recounting of their discussions throughout and concerning the best location to raise their family and the various steps taken to relocate together to the united states.until september,when sender unilaterally initiated divorce proceedings and deprived hofmann of access to the children,hofmann was involved in each of these family decisions,including where his children would be sent to school,where the family would vacation together,and in what type of community the family would live.we see no reason to disturb these findings on appeal.see abbott.at the convention defines rights of custody to include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence.citing the hague convention a.
to determine which country is a child country of habitual residence under the hague convention,we apply the test set forth in gitter gitter.there we held that 
first,the court should inquire into the shared intent of those entitled to fix the child residence usually the parents at the latest time that their intent was shared.in making this determination the court should look,as always in determining intent,at actions as well as declarations.normally the shared intent of the parents should control the habitual residence of the child.second,the court should inquire whether the evidence unequivocally points to the conclusion that the child has acclimatized to the new location and thus has acquired a new habitual residence,notwithstanding any conflict with the parents latest shared intent.
gitter,at.a district court findings of fact under the convention are reviewed for clear error.mota,at.we review de novo the district court interpretation of the convention,and its application of the convention to the facts.id.at.
as we have previously held,our primary consideration in determining a child place of habitual residence is the shared intention of the child parents at the last time that their intent was shared.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the last shared intent of the parents is a question of fact,and the district court determination in that regard is reviewed for clear error and thus entitled to deference.id.at.decisions relating to the credibility of witnesses and the relative weight of their testimony are properly left to the discretion of the trier of fact.see,design strategy,davis,cir.here,the district court determined,after careful weighing of the evidence and assessment of the parties credibility,that the last shared intent of the parties was that the children would reside in canada.doc.at.correlatively,the court also found that at the time the parties were transitioning from montreal to new york,hofmann only intended the children to reside habitually in new york if he was also resident in new york with his children and his wife,as a family.id.at.
the district court decision was amply supported by the record,and there is nothing that would leave us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.mota,at quoting bessemer trust branin,cir.the district court spent signific
