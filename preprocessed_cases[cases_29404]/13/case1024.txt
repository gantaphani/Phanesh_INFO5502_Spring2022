castine complaint included a second claim,brought under supplemental jurisdiction,see,seeking a declaratory judgment that clinton county local law is void under new york state law.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on that claim as well.we vacate that aspect of the judgment and remand for further consideration.
factual background 
in,castine was elected to the position of beekmantown town justice for a term beginning january.in,while serving as town justice,she was appointed as the democratic party election commissioner for clinton county to fill a vacancy beginning january.
as election commissioner,castine served at the head of the board of elections,which was charged with,among other things,determining the validity of petitions,determining which voters are entitled to vote by absentee ballot,counting,tallying,and canvassing votes for primary and general elections,and approving the form of the ballots for primary and general elections.election commissioners also share responsibility for preparing the form of the ballot,including deciding the placement of candidates on the ballot.these responsibilities extend to beekmantown local elections,including its election for town justice.
to preserve the integrity of local elections,local law prohibits candidates for elective public office from simultaneously holding employment or office in the board of elections.that law provides,in relevant part,that a ny person who shall become a candidate for elective public office shall be disqualified during the period of his or her candidacy from appointment or continued employment from the board of elections.local law.
on july,while serving as election commissioner,castine filed a petition with the clinton county board of elections to become a candidate for reelection to the position of beekmantown town justice.in response,at a july meeting of the clinton county legislature,zurlo called an executive session seeking direction on how to handle castine simultaneous employment as election commissioner and candidacy for beekmantown town justice.in particular,zurlo sought a determination whether to enforce local law.after receiving advice from the county attorney,the legislature unanimously agreed that local law should be enforced against castine 
on july,zurlo wrote castine a letter informing her of the clinton county legislature determination to enforce local law against her.the letter also informed castine that,unless she provided evidence of the declination of her candidacy for town justice prior to july,she would be expected to terminate her employment as election commissioner.the next day,zurlo sent castine an saying i just wanted to confirm that you will be sending me a copy of proof of declination today.castine wrote back almost immediately i will be responding today,but sent no further communication.
castine had multiple conversations with clinton county personnel director alan gibson.gibson asked castine to complete a termination form and to vacate her office.castine responded that she believed gibson did not have the authority to remove her from office and that she would leave her office only with a deputy present.
on july,gibson went to castine office with a deputy sheriff who waited outside her door.gibson asked castine to sign a termination checklist,which she refused to do.he and the deputy then escorted castine from the building.that same day,castine filed this lawsuit.
on november,castine won the election for beekmantown town justice,and the next day she returned to her position as election commissioner.
procedural history 
castine,the clinton county democratic party,and martin mannix as chairman of the clinton county democratic party brought this action on july,against county administrator zurlo in his individual and official capacities and the county.in october,mannix and the clinton county democratic party then voluntarily dismissed all of their claims.in late and early,castine and defendants cross moved for summary judgment.on april,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all of castine claims.castine appealed.she contests only the dismissal of the two claims described above.
discussion 
castine federal claim asserts that the defendants violated her constitutional rights by removing her from office as election commissioner under local law in retaliation for exercising her first right to run for elective office.she contends on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on that claim 
for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court that castine has not cited to evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to find in her favor.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on that claim.
the principal authority governing cases of this nature is pickering board of education,d,in which the local newspaper published a letter to the editor from a teacher,marvin pickering,which criticized the local school board handling of certain bond issue proposals and its allocation of resources.pickering letter took the position,among others,that too much money was being spent on athletics.the board fired pickering for writing the letter,and pickering brought suit,alleging that the firing in retaliation for his exercise of a first right was a tort in violation of the constitution.id.at.
the supreme court ruled in the teacher favor,but only after engaging in a balancing of interests.the court made clear that,while public school teachers do not relinquish their first amendment right to speak as citizens on matters of public interest regarding their schools,that right does not necessarily protect them from adverse employment action by reason of their speech.this is because the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.id.at.the court reasoning thus relied on the proposition that a public employer does not necessarily violate an employee first amendment rights by taking an adverse employment action against that employee to discipline her for speech on matters of public concern,even when that speech is protected in other ways under the first amendment.in such circumstances,rather than consider the speech under the lens of strict scrutiny,courts must arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.
applying this test to the facts of pickering case,the court found that the balance favored pickering.his letter to the editor in no way impaired pickering performance of his job as a teacher or the ability of the schools to function properly 
his statements were in no way directed towards any person with whom he would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work as a teacher.thus no question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among
