petitioner daniel torres appeals from a judgment denying a writ of habeas corpus entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york martin.torres filed his petition for the writ pursuant to as a person in state custody.by the petition,torres challenged his resentencing by a state court following an alleged breach of the condition of his original sentence.the district court determined that the resentencing was justified by a satisfactory evidentiary showing of the breach in state court and concluded that the decision of the trial court was not contrary to the jurisprudence of the supreme court of the united states.see torres berbary,civ,wl june.because we conclude that the hearing afforded by the state court that resulted in the resentencing was inconsistent with due process,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to grant the writ conditionally.
background 
on march,torres entered a plea of guilty in new york supreme court,bronx county,to the offense of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree,penal law,a class b felony.the court accepted the plea following the customary allocution and proceeded to impose sentence in accordance with a plea bargain previously arrived at.the sentence provided for a conditional release to phoenix house,a drug treatment facility and was encompassed in its entirety in the following dialogue between the court and torres,designated the defendant in the transcript 
the court okay.i am going to sentence you.i will release you on the to phoenix house.if you work out,you will be allowed to come back,to a misdemeanor,and i will sentence you to time served.if you do work out,you will get at least four and a half to nine years in jail.do you understand 
the defendant yes.
the court is that satisfactory to you 
the defendant yes.
if you work out apparently was understood by all concerned to refer to the successful completion by torres of the drug treatment program provided by phoenix house.according to the sentence,successful completion would result in a return to court for repleading to a misdemeanor in place of the felony,and a resentencing to time served.failure to complete would result in a sentence of imprisonment of years on the original felony charge.
torres immediately entered the phoenix house program.less than a month later,torres was discharged from the program.the client discharge form dated april,provided to torres by phoenix house,gave the following reasons for his discharge your alledge sic involvement in the distribution of contraband in the facility.you are being directed to immediately surrender yourself to grand concourse part bronx supreme court.the form contained the following legend you have the right to have this decision reviewed by the program director.you may seek advice from outside sources in preparation for the program review of the discharge decision.although torres inserted a checkmark in the space provided in the form following the words i wish a review and signed the form,no review was provided to him.
by letter dated the same date as the discharge form,ed greaux of phoenix house advised the bronx supreme court of torres discharge.the letter,in its substantive entirety,reads as follows 
your honor,with reference to the client,information has come to light that compels us to discharge this resident.new resi d ents overheard conversations conducted in s panish between this client and other residents claiming that they could make illicit drugs available for sale within this facility.
it is suspected that the drugs may have been entering the facility through the use of church trips.confederates may have met clients at church to pass drugs or money.also,it is suspected that gang activity in the form of meetings on the male floor and the use of gang hand signals have involved the client.
although we have been unable to obtain physical evidence,we have received information from residents that clearly implicates this individual in an organized attempt to sell drugs in this facility.
following his discharge,torres was returned to the court for further proceedings.at the outset of the proceedings,counsel for torres addressed the court as follows 
counsel judge,for the record,my client is,again,he had pled guilty and was given his plea wherein if he completed the phoenix drug house program,to which he was assigned,he would be allowed to complete that program and that if he completed it successfully,he would be allowed to withdraw his felony plea and receive a plea with a misdemeanor and time served.
i realize there has been a communication to the court.i seen a copy of it indicating that my client was discharged from phoenix house and making an accusation that he was involved with other people in trying to bring drugs into the facility.my client denies that.he asked me to state that he never was a participant with anyone else in trying to bring drugs into the facilities,and he has tested clear all times and he would like an opportunity to complete a drug program and complete all the conditions of the plea.
the court responded as follows 
the court the application is denied.the report has convinced me that he violated the conditions i set down,very seriously.you have an exception for the record.
later,there was this exchange between counsel and the court 
counsel judge,the defendant is again giving me a copy of the notification,that he received a client discharge form from phoenix house,and that he says he requested a review which he was never given.
the court i still prepared to sentence him.phoenix house has indicated they do want him.let proceed,please.
after a further exchange during the proceedings,counsel again advised the court of torres adamant assertion that he did not bring drugs into phoenix house,and of torres request that he have some sort of hearing,evidentiary hearing on this issue.the court responded to that request as follows 
the court i decline to do so.i received a communication,as you know,you were given it as soon as i received it,indicating that phoenix house had had people overhear him plotting with other people to bring drugs into the facility.i not going to try that case because phoenix house,in my opinion,generally gives me accurate reports,and most of the time,they want to keep a client,not let a client go.i prepared to sentence your client.i deny any further applications to be given.
torres then personally requested the opportunity to speak,which the court granted.the following is a transcript of torres unsworn statement to the court 
the defendant yeah.when i went,a lot of people,which is usually people that i know was upstate with me before,one of them,which i do know,who supposedly got caught with drugs or gave drugs to somebody,now,it the people i talk to almost every day when i have a cigarette break.when that happened,they took my unit twice and searched me and saying,that my people,that i screw around,but i say that i do know what happened.they still threw me out due to the fact that i associate with them,that i say what up to them,and i say hello to them,when we used to go down for a cigarette smoke.in other words,they also told me,i will have a review with the director,but they are stating that they just threw me out for associating with them.it was really,i do know who or what really happened.
the court immediately proceeded with sentencing after torres statement as follows 
the court okay.based upon everything i know about the case,based upon the recent communication and writing that i received from phoenix house,defendant is sentenced to a minimum term,which i promised him if he did not successfully complete the program,four and a half to nine years,and i am imposing the statutory surcharge.
on appeal to the appellate division,first department,torres judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed.the appellate division reasoned as follows 
the court promised that it would impose a more lenient disposition in the event that torres successfully completed a drug program.torres was expelled from the drug program.before imposing sentence,the court conducted an inquiry to determine whether or not there was any legitimate basis for defendant exclusion from the drug program,and satisfied itself that the report of torres misconduct in the program was reliable and accurate.hence,the court properly sentenced torres on the felony.
people torres,dep t mem.citations omitted.leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals was denied.see people torres.
in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus dated may,torres alleged that his due process rights were violated because he was denied an evidentiary hearing in connection with his discharge from phoenix house.he asserted that he was ejected from the treatment program on the basis of uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations from unnamed sources and that t he ejection was conducted without an internal review hearing and in violation of the treatment program internal policies.his due process challenge was grounded in his claim that n o evidentiary hearing of any kind was conducted by the sentencing court to evaluate the allegation,even though i requested and was not given a hearing at the treatment center,and i was not permitted to challenge the evidence or any witness.
in an unpublished,opinion and order dated may,the district court denied torres petition for relief under the provisions of.the district court concluded that the state court decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.torres,wl,at.in support of that conclusion,the district court reasoned as follows 
t he sentencing judge had a report from a reliable institution to which the courts regularly send defendants for treatment,that petitioner had been involved in bringing drugs into the institution.while the institution conclusion was based on information from unnamed,recently admitted residents,there was no reason to believe that the institution did not have an adequate basis to believe their statements.had the court ordered a hearing,the institution would no doubt have resisted disclosing the identities of those who provided information in confidence.thus,it is likely that the record at the close of the hearing would have been no different than it was at the time of sentencing,with the petitioner denying the charge,and phoenix house staff persuaded that the charges were true and stating that they would not the petitioner.
id.a certificate of appealability was issued by the district court,and torres filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standards for habeas corpus review of state convictions the statutory scheme examined.
we review de novo a district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus to a person in custody pursuant to a state court judgment.loliscio goord,cir.the standard for review by a district court in the first instance has been established by an act of congress,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,as codified in d.the statute provides as follows 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the deferential review of state court judgments established by the statutory scheme is dependent on the federal claim having been adjudicated on the merits by the state court.if there is no such adjudication,the deferential standard does not apply,and we apply the standards,and review de novo the state court disposition of the petitioner federal constitutional claims.aparicio artuz,cir.a petitioner federal constitutional claim is adjudicated on the merits in state court when the state court disposes of the claim on the merits and reduces its disposition to judgment.see norde keane,cir.the issue of whether the claim has been disposed of on the merits by a state court includes an inquiry into what the state courts have done in similar cases whether the history of the case suggests that the state court was aware of any ground for not adjudicating the case on the merits and whether the state court opinion suggests reliance upon procedural grounds rather than a determination on the merits.sellan kuhlman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.the appropriate standard of review in this case the unreasonable application rule described.
there is no question that the issue before us was adjudicated on the merits in the state courts.the appellate division concluded that the inquiry conducted by the state trial court revealed an adequate basis for the expulsion of torres from the drug program,specifically determining that the trial court had properly satisfied itself that the report of torres conduct at phoenix house was reliable and accurate.torres,at.the appellate division effectively decided that there was no violation of torres right to constitutional due process and sentencing when it held that the trial court properly sentenced torres on the felony.id.accordingly,we are constrained to conduct our review under the deferential standard established by the aedpa.
with respect to the elements of aedpa deferential review set forth in d,a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d see also eze senkowski,cir.and an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams,at.although it is clear that the question is whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable,the precise method for distinguishing objectively unreasonable decisions from merely erroneous ones is less clear.cotto herbert,cir citation omitted.however,it is in this c ircuit that the objectively unreasonable standard of d means that petitioner must identify some increment of incorrectness beyond error in order to obtain habeas relief.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.due process in the sentencing context supreme court precedent identified.
the supreme court has clearly spoken on the question of the standard of proof of facts in sentencing in relation to the constitutional requirement of due process,holding that the preponderance of evidence standard satisfies the requirement.see mcmillan pennsylvania,d like the state court below,we have little difficulty concluding that in this case the preponderance standard satisfies due process.see also united states watts,d noting,in connection with the approval of standard under federal sentencing guidelines,that the court has held that application of the preponderance standard at sentencing generally satisfies due process.
the supreme court also has clearly spoken on the question of the process due one who is alleged to have fail ed to abide by the rules governing his parole.see morrissey brewer,d.the determination to resentence for the breach of a condition of a sentence is analogous to the determination to revoke the parole of a parolee for failure to comply with the conditions of parole.it is also analogous to the determination to impose a sentence for violation of the terms of probation.all these determinations should be informed by the same considerations.for parole revocation,an opportunity for a hearing must be provided.according to the supreme court,
t his hearing must be the basis for more than determining probable cause it must lead to a final evaluation of any contested relevant facts and consideration of whether the facts as determ
