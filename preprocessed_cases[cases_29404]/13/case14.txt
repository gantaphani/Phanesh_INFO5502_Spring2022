the individuals with disabilities education act idea offers states federal funds to assist in educating children with disabilities.the act conditions that funding on compliance with certain statutory requirements,including the requirement that states provide every eligible child a free appropriate public education,or fape,by means of a uniquely tailored individualized education program,or iep.d,a.
this court first addressed the fape requirement in board of ed.of hendrick hudson central school,westchester cty.rowley.the court held that the act guarantees a substantively adequate program of education to all eligible children,and that this requirement is satisfied if the child iep sets out an educational program that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.at.for children fully integrated in the regular classroom,this would typically require an iep reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.at.because the iep challenged in rowley plainly met this standard,the court declined to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the act,instead confin ing its analysis to the facts of the case before it,at.
petitioner endrew,a child with autism,received annual ieps in respondent douglas county school district from preschool through fourth grade.by fourth grade,endrew parents believed his academic and functional progress had stalled.when the school district proposed a fifth grade iep that resembled those from past years,endrew parents removed him from public school and enrolled him in a specialized private school,where he made significant progress.school district representatives later presented endrew parents with a new fifth grade iep,but they considered it no more adequate than the original plan.they then sought reimbursement for endrew private school tuition by filing a complaint under the idea with the colorado department of education.their claim was denied,and a federal district court affirmed that determination.the tenth circuit also affirmed.that court interpreted rowley to establish a rule that a child iep is adequate as long as it is calculated to confer an educational benefit that is merely more than de minimis,internal quotation marks omitted,and concluded that endrew iep had been reasonably calculated to enable him to make some progress,at internal quotation marks omitted.the court accordingly held that endrew had received a fape.
held to meet its substantive obligation under the idea,a school must offer an iep reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child circumstances.
a rowley and the language of the idea point to the approach adopted here.the reasonably calculated qualification reflects a recognition that crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials,informed by their own expertise and the views of a child parents or guardians any review of an iep must appreciate that the question is whether the iep is reasonable,not whether the court regards it as ideal.an iep must aim to enable the child to make progress the essential function of an iep is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement.and the degree of progress contemplated by the iep must be appropriate in light of the child circumstances,which should come as no surprise.this reflects the focus on the particular child that is at the core of the idea,and the directive that states offer instruction specially designed to meet a child unique needs through an i ndividualized education program.emphasis added.
rowley sheds light on what appropriate progress will look like in many cases for a child fully integrated in the regular classroom,an iep typically should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.at.this guidance is grounded in the statutory definition of a fape.one component of a fape is special education,defined as specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.in determining what it means to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability,the provisions of the idea governing the iep development process provide guidance.these provisions reflect what the court said in rowley by focusing on progress in the general education curriculum.d a i i aa,ii aa,iv bb.
rowley did not provide concrete guidance with respect to a child who is not fully integrated in the regular classroom and not able to achieve on grade level.a child iep need not aim for advancement if that is not a reasonable prospect.but that child educational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances,just as advancement from grade to grade is appropriately ambitious for most children in the regular classroom.the goals may differ,but every child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.
this standard is more demanding than the merely more than de minimis test applied by the tenth circuit.it can not be right that the idea generally contemplates advancement for children with disabilities who are fully integrated in the regular classroom,but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for children who are not.
b endrew parents argue that the act goes even further and requires states to provide children with disabilities educational opportunities that are substantially equal to the opportunities afforded children without disabilities.brief for petitioner.but the lower courts in rowley adopted a strikingly similar standard,and this court rejected it in clear terms.mindful that congress has not materially changed the statutory definition of a fape since rowley was decided,this court declines to interpret the fape provision in a manner so plainly at odds with the court analysis in that case.
c the adequacy of a given iep turns on the unique circumstances of the child for whom it was created.this absence of a rule should not be mistaken for an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.rowley,at.at the same time,deference is based on the application of expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities.the nature of the iep process ensures that parents and school representatives will fully air their respective opinions on the degree of progress a child iep should pursue thus,by the time any dispute reaches court,school authorities will have had the chance to bring their expertise and judgment to bear on areas of disagreement.see,rowley,at.at that point,a reviewing court may fairly expect those authorities to be able to offer a cogent and responsive explanation for their decisions that shows the iep is reasonably calculated to enable the child to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances.
vacated and remanded.

endrew,a minor,by and through his parents and next friends,joseph and jennifer,petitioner douglas county school district 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
years ago,this court held that the individuals with disabilities education act establishes a substantive right to a free appropriate public education for certain children with disabilities.board of ed.of hendrick hudson central school,westchester cty.rowley.we declined,however,to endorse any one standard for determining when handicapped children are receiving sufficient educational benefits to satisfy the requirements of the act.at.that more difficult problem is before us today.ibid.
the individuals with disabilities education act idea or act offers states federal funds to assist in educating children with disabilities.stat,as amended,et see arlington central school dist.bd.of ed.murphy.in exchange for the funds,a state pledges to comply with a number of statutory conditions.among them,the state must provide a free appropriate public education a fape,for short to all eligible children.a.
a fape,as the act defines it,includes both special education and related services.special education is specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability related services are the support services required to assist a child to benefit from that instruction.a state covered by the idea must provide a disabled child with such special education and related services in conformity with the child individualized education program,or iep.d.
the iep is the centerpiece of the statute education delivery system for disabled children.honig doe.a comprehensive plan prepared by a child iep team which includes teachers,school officials,and the child parents,an iep must be drafted in compliance with a detailed set of procedures.d b internal quotation marks omitted.these procedures emphasize collaboration among parents and educators and require careful consideration of the child individual circumstances.the iep is the means by which special education and related services are tailored to the unique needs of a particular child.rowley,at.
the idea requires that every iep include a statement of the child present levels of academic achievement and functional performance,describe how the child disability affects the child involvement and progress in the general education curriculum,and set out measurable annual goals,including academic and functional goals,along with a description of how the child progress toward meeting those goals will be gauged.d a i i iii.the iep must also describe the special education and related services that will be provided so that the child may advance appropriately toward attaining the annual goals and,when possible,be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.d a i iv.
parents and educators often agree about what a child iep should contain.but not always.when disagreement arises,parents may turn to dispute resolution procedures established by the idea.the parties may resolve their differences informally,through a p reliminary meeting,or,somewhat more formally,through mediation.e,f b i.if these measures fail to produce accord,the parties may proceed to what the act calls a due process hearing before a state or local educational agency.f a,g.and at the conclusion of the administrative process,the losing party may seek redress in state or federal court.i a.
this court first addressed the fape requirement in rowley plaintiff amy rowley was a first grader with impaired hearing.her school district offered an iep under which amy would receive instruction in the regular classroom and spend time each week with a special tutor and a speech therapist.the district proposed that amy classroom teacher speak into a wireless transmitter and that amy use an fm hearing aid designed to amplify her teacher words the district offered to supply both components of this system.but amy parents argued that the iep should go further and provide a interpreter in all of her classes.contending that the school district refusal to furnish an interpreter denied amy a fape,amy parents initiated administrative proceedings,then filed a lawsuit under the act.rowley,at.
the district court agreed that amy had been denied a fape.the court acknowledged that amy was making excellent progress in school she was perform ing better than the average child in her class and advancing easily from grade to grade.at internal quotation marks omitted.at the same time,amy under stood considerably less of what goes on in class than she could if she were not deaf.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.concluding that it has been left entirely to the courts and the hearings officers to give content to the requirement of an appropriate education,supp,sdny,the district court ruled that amy education was not appropriate unless it provided her an opportunity to achieve her full potential commensurate with the opportunity provided to other children.rowley,at internal quotation marks omitted.the second circuit agreed with this analysis and affirmed.
in this court,the parties advanced starkly different understandings of the fape requirement.amy parents defended the approach of the lower courts,arguing that the school district was required to provide instruction and services that would provide amy an equal educational opportunity relative to children without disabilities,at internal quotation marks omitted.the school district,for its part,contended that the idea did not create substantive individual rights the fape provision was instead merely aspirational.brief for petitioners in rowley.
neither position carried the day.on the one hand,this court rejected the view that the idea gives courts carte blanche to impose upon the states whatever burden their various judgments indicate should be imposed.rowley,at.after all,the statutory phrase free appropriate public education was expressly defined in the act,even if the definition tend ed toward the cryptic rather than the comprehensive.at.this court went on to reject the equal opportunity standard adopted by the lower courts,concluding that free appropriate public education was a phrase too complex to be captured by the word equal whether one is speaking of opportunities or services.at.the court also viewed the standard as entirely unworkable,apt to require impossible measurements and comparisons that courts were ill suited to make,at.
on the other hand,the court also rejected the school district argument that the fape requirement was actually no requirement at all,at.instead,the court carefully charted a middle path.even though congress was rather sketchy in establishing substantive requirements under the act,at,the court nonetheless made clear that the act guarantees a substantively adequate program of education to all eligible children,at,see,at,describing the substantive standard implicit in the act we explained that this requirement is satisfied,and a child has received a fape,if the child iep sets out an educational program that is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.at.for children receiving instruction in the regular classroom,this would generally require an iep reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.at see also,at.
in view of amy rowley excellent progress and the substantial suite of specialized instruction and services offered in her iep,we concluded that her program satisfied the fape requirement,at.but we went no further.instead,we expressly confine d our analysis to the facts of the case before us.ibid.observing that the act requires states to educate a wide spectrum of children with disabilities and that the benefits obtainable by children at one end of the spectrum will differ dramatically from those obtainable by children at the other end,we declined to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the act.ibid.
petitioner endrew was diagnosed with autism at age two.autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder generally marked by impaired social and communicative skills,engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements,resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines,and unusual responses to sensory experiences.cfr c i see brief for petitioner.a child with autism qualifies as a c hild with a disability under the idea,and colorado where endrew resides accepts idea funding.a.endrew is therefore entitled to the benefits of the act,including a fape provided by the state.
endrew attended school in respondent douglas county school district from preschool through fourth grade.each year,his iep team drafted an iep addressed to his educational and functional needs.by endrew fourth grade year,however,his parents had become dissatisfied with his progress.although endrew displayed a number of strengths his teachers described him as a humorous child with a sweet disposition who show ed concern for friends he still exhibited multiple behaviors that inhibited his ability to access learning in the classroom.supp.app.endrew would scream in class,climb over furniture and other students,and occasionally run away from school,at.he was afflicted by severe fears of commonplace things like flies,spills,and public restrooms.as endrew parents saw it,his academic and functional progress had essentially stalled endrew ieps largely carried over the same basic goals and objectives from one year to the next,indicating that he was failing to make meaningful progress toward his aims.his parents believed that only a thorough overhaul of the school district approach to endrew behavioral problems could reverse the trend.but in april,the school district presented endrew parents with a proposed fifth grade iep that was,in their view,pretty much the same as his past ones.so his parents removed endrew from public school and enrolled him at firefly autism house,a private school that specializes in educating children with autism.
endrew did much better at firefly.the school developed a behavioral intervention plan that identified endrew most problematic behaviors and set out particular strategies for addressing them.see supp.app.firefly also added heft to endrew academic goals.within months,endrew behavior improved significantly,permitting him to make a degree of academic progress that had eluded him in public school.
in november,some six months after endrew started classes at firefly,his parents again met with representatives of the douglas county school district.the district presented a new iep.endrew parents considered the iep no more adequate than the one proposed in april,and rejected it.they were particularly concerned that the stated plan for addressing endrew behavior did not differ meaningfully from the plan in his fourth grade iep,despite the fact that his experience at firefly suggested that he would benefit from a different approach.
in february,endrew parents filed a complaint with the colorado department of education seeking reimbursement for endrew tuition at firefly.to qualify for such relief,they were required to show that the school district had not provided endrew a fape in a timely manner prior to his enrollment at the private school.see a c ii.endrew parents contended that the final iep proposed by the school district was not calculated to enable endrew to receive educational benefits and that endrew had therefore been denied a fape.rowley,at.an administrative law judge alj disagreed and denied relief.
endrew parents sought review in federal district court.giving due weight to the decision of the alj,the district court affirmed.wl,d,quoting rowley,at.the court acknowledged that endrew performance under past ieps did not reveal immense educational growth.wl,at.but it concluded that annual modifications to endrew iep objectives were sufficient to show a pattern of,at the least,minimal progress.ibid.because endrew previous ieps had enabled him to make this sort of progress,the court reasoned,his latest,similar iep was reasonably calculated to do the same thing.in the court view,that was all rowley demanded.wl,at.
the tenth circuit affirmed.the court of appeals recited language from rowley stating that the instruction and services furnished to children with disabilities must be calculated to confer some educational benefit.at quoting rowley,at emphasis added by tenth circuit.the court noted that it had long interpreted this language to mean that a child iep is adequate as long as it is calculated to confer an educational benefit that is merely more than de minimis.at internal quotation marks omitted.applying this standard,the tenth circuit held that endrew iep had been reasonably calculated to enable him to make some progress.at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,he had not been denied a fape.
we granted certiorari.
the court in rowley declined to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the act.at.the school district,however,contends that rowley nonetheless established that an iep need not promise any particular level of benefit,so long as it is reasonably calculated to provide some benefit,as opposed to none.brief for respondent.
the district relies on several passages from rowley to make its case.it points to our observation that any substantive standard prescribing the level of education to be accorded children with disabilities was n oticeably absent from the language of the statute.at see brief for respondent.the district also emphasizes the court statement that the act requires states to provide access to instruction sufficient to confer some educational benefit,reasoning that any benefit,however minimal,satisfies this mandate.brief for respondent quoting rowley,at.finally,the district urges that the court conclusively adopted a some educational benefit standard when it wrote that the intent of the act was more to open the door of public education to handicapped children than to guarantee any particular level of education.at see brief for respondent.
these statements in isolation do support the school district argument.but the district makes too much of them.our statement that the face of the idea imposed no explicit substantive standard must be evaluated alongside our statement that a substantive standard was implicit in the act.rowley,at.similarly,we find little significance in the court language concerning the requirement that states provide instruction calculated to confer some educational benefit.at.the court had no need to say anything more particular,since the case before it involved a child whose progress plainly demonstrated that her iep was designed to deliver more than adequate educational benefits.see,at.the court principal concern was to correct what it viewed as the surprising rulings below that the idea effectively empowers judges to elaborate a federal common law of public education,and that a child performing better than most in her class had been denied a fape.the court was not concerned with precisely articulating a governing standard for closer cases.see,at.and the statement that the act did not guarantee any particular level of education simply reflects the unobjectionable proposition that the idea can not and does not promise any particular educational outcome.at internal quotation marks omitted.no law could do that for any child.
more important,the school district reading of these isolated statements runs headlong into several points on which rowley is crystal clear.for instance just after saying that the act requires instruction that is sufficient to confer some educational benefit we noted that t he determination of when handicapped children are receiving sufficient educational benefits presents a difficult problem.at,emphasis added.and then we expressly declined to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits under the act,at emphasis added.it would not have been difficult for us to say when educational benefits are sufficient if we had just said that any educational benefit was enough.and it would have been strange to refuse to set out a test for the adequacy of educational benefits if we had just done exactly that.we can not accept the school district reading of rowley.
while rowley declined to articulate an overarching standard to evaluate the adequacy of the education provided under the act,the decision and the statutory language point to a general approach to meet its substantive obligation under the idea,a school must offer an iep reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child circumstances.
the reasonably calculated qualification reflects a recognition that crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials,at.the act contemplates that this exercise will be informed not only by the expertise of school officials,but also by the input
