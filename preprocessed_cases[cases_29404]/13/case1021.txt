appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,district judge,which granted dismissal of their claims under the establishment clause and the free exercise clause of the united states constitution,as well as the religious freedom restoration act of rfra.appellants are eleven individuals who as atheists and secular humanists and who include numismatics,a teacher,parents and their minor children,and others who state that they have been harmed by the placement of in god we trust on currency,as well as two organizations,the new york city atheists and the freedom from religion foundation.they challenge two statutory provisions,d and b,which require that the country motto,in god we trust,be placed on all coinage and paper currency.on may,defendants,including the united states,richard peterson,deputy director of the united states mint,larry felix,director of the bureau of engraving and printing,and jacob lew,secretary of the treasury moved to dismiss the case in its entirety.judge baer granted the motion and appellants timely filed the instant appeal.
we have never addressed the question of whether the inclusion of the words in god we trust on united states currency violates the constitution or rfra and write today to clarify the law on this issue.four other circuit courts have ruled on this question,however,and have found that the statutes at issue do not contravene the constitution.see kidd obama,app per curiam affirming the district court and holding that the printing of the motto on currency does not violate the first amendment gaylor united states,cir holding that the statutes establishing the national motto and directing its reproduction on currency clearly have a secular purpose and that the motto primary effect is not to advance religion instead,it is a form of ceremonial deism,and,therefore,the statutes do not violate the establishment clause murray,cir per curiam upholding the constitutionality of the statutes requiring the motto to be placed on currency and the statute criminalizing the defacement of the motto,aff g district court opinion in blumenthal.aronow united states,cir affirming the dismissal of a challenge to both the motto and its inscription on currency because i t is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency in god we trust has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion.its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial character see also newdow lefevre,cir declining to overrule aronow.we agree with our sister circuits and hold that d and b do not violate the establishment clause,the free exercise clause or rfra.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

a.the establishment clause 
the first amendment of the constitution provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.in lemon kurtzman,the supreme court held that,in order to comply with the establishment clause first,the statute at issue must have a secular legislative purpose second,its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances or inhibits religion finally,the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.although the supreme court has,in some cases,criticized or declined to apply lemon,see,van orden perry,we have previously held that lemon remains the prevailing test in this circuit,absent its abrogation.see bronx household of faith bd.of educ.of city of new york,cir both the appellants and the appellees agree that only the first and second prongs of the lemon test are at issue in this case.
as the supreme court has repeatedly indicated in dicta the statutes at issue in this case have a secular purpose and neither advance nor inhibit religion.the court has recognized in a number of its cases that the motto,and its inclusion in the design of currency,is a reference to our religious heritage.lynch donnelly,see also cnty.of allegheny am.civil liberties union greater pitts.chapter,concurring in my view,governmental acknowledgements of religion,such legislative prayers and the printing of in god we trust on our coins serve the secular purposes of solemnizing public occasions,expressing confidence in the future and encouraging the recognition of what is worthy of appreciation in society.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.as such,the court justices have distinguished our currency from improper governmental endorsements of religion.see,van orden,at stevens,dissenting noting that the message conveyed by the ten commandments can not be analogized to an appendage to a common article of commerce in god we trust.cnty.of allegheny,at holding,inter alia,that the display of a crèche at a country courthouse violated the establishment clause but noting that there is an obvious distinction between a crèche display and references to god in the motto and the pledge.lynch,at brennan,dissenting dissenting from the court approval of a crèche display in a park but distinguishing the motto as a form of ceremonial deism,protected from establishment clause scrutiny chiefly because it has lost through rote repetition any significant religious content.we therefore hold,in line with the supreme court dicta,that d and b do not violate the establishment clause 
b.the free exercise clause and rfra 
in addition to their establishment clause argument,appellants also contend that d and b violate the free exercise clause and rfra.pursuant to the free exercise clause,the government may not prohibit the free exercise of religion.const.amend.i.in,the supreme court clarified its free exercise clause jurisprudence by holding that the government need not have a compelling interest in order to enact generally applicable laws that happen to burden religious practice.emp t,dep t of human res.of smith.in response,congress enacted rfra,which provides in relevant part that the government may substantially burden a person exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means necessary of furthering that compelling government interest.b see also sossamon texas,noting that by enacting rfra,congress intended to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in sherbert verner,and wisconsin yoder,in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.quoting b.as we have noted previously,the free exercise clause does not normally inhibit enforcement of otherwise valid laws of general application that incidentally burden religious conduct.rfra,in contrast,requires strict scrutiny of such laws where the incidental burden on religion is substantial.hankins lyght,cir quoting cutter wilkinson,see also skoros city of new york,cir absent an objective to impugn plaintiffs religious beliefs or to restrict their religious practices,a free exercise claim will be sustained only if the government has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious belief,without a compelling governmental interest justif ying the burden.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
appellants argue that they are substantially burdened by the necessity of using currency because doing so requires them to bear on their persons a statement that attributes to them personally a perceived falsehood that is the antithesis of the central tenant of their religious system.appellants also contend that using money forces them to proselytize.we respectfully disagree that appellants have identified a substantial burden upon their religious practices or beliefs.
a substantial burden exists where the state put s substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.jolly coughlin,cir quoting thomas review bd.of the.emp t sec,see also westchester day sch.village of mamaroneck,cir supreme court precedents teach that a substantial burden
