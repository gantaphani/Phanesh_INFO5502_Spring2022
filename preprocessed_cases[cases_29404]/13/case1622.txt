the questions presented are whether there is a first amendment right to use special license plates bearing the letters shthpns,and whether a car registrant due process rights under the fourteenth amendment are violated when a state department of motor vehicles revokes these plates after the department realizes that they have been issued in error.we answer both questions in the negative and therefore affirm.
paula perry paula perry or perry appeals from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,chief judge granting summary judgment for defendants patricia mcdonald,of the vermont department of motor vehicles vermont dmv or dmv,and michael smith,a former motor vehicle unit supervisor for registration and license information at the dmv,and dismissing perry claims under the first and fourteenth amendments.adopting the recommendation and report of magistrate judge jerome niedermeier on the first amendment claim,and issuing its own opinion on the fourteenth amendment claim,the district court held that mcdonald and smith did not violate perry constitutional rights by revoking her specially requested license plates vanity plates,which bear the letters shthpns.
we conclude that perry does not have a first amendment right to use vanity plates bearing the letters shthpns and defendants did not violate perry due process rights under the fourteenth amendment when they revoked these plates after issuing them in error.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the following facts are not disputed,unless otherwise indicated.
on july,perry submitted an application to the vermont dmv for vanity plates for her motor vehicle,which she with her husband,lawrence perry.vanity plates are license plates bearing a combination of letters numbers chosen by the vehicle owner rather than chosen randomly by the dmv.in vermont a vehicle owner may obtain vanity plates by paying an additional fee as long as the requested combination of letters numbers meets certain criteria,including that the requested plate not be offensive or confusing to the general public.stat.ann.tit,d 
here,perry requested vanity plates bearing the letters shthpns,which stand for shit happens.the application listed lawrence paula perry as of the vehicle and gave their mailing address as hcr,box,montpelier,vt,but it was signed only by paula perry.she paid a additional fee for the plates,and the dmv issued the plates on july.
the dmv officials explained to the district court and in their brief on appeal that the plates were issued in error.the dmv considered perry plates to be offensive and accordingly asserted that it could have,and should have,refused to issue them pursuant to.stat.ann.tit,d.as noted above,this provision of the vermont statutes empowers the commissioner of the dmv to refuse to honor any request for special plates that might be offensive or confusing to the general public.dmv officials first became concerned that perry plates were offensive and had been issued in error when a dmv employee saw the plates and informed defendant smith.the dmv then took steps to recall the plates and to replace them at no extra charge.
pursuant to the dmv policy of mailing correspondence to the first listed on the vehicle registration,smith sent a letter dated august,the august letter to lawrence perry at the address listed on the application.by this time,perry and her husband were estranged,and perry had obtained a new mailing address,of which she had not informed the dmv.as a result,perry did not see the august letter or the dmv letters that followed it until the first week of november.
the august letter explained that the shthpns vanity plates had been issued in error and requested that the addressee,lawrence perry,return them to the dmv.enclosed with the letter were a set of temporary plates to replace the vanity plates,an application for a new set of plates to be issued at no charge,and a envelope in which to return the vanity plates.the letter apologized for any inconvenience and invited lawrence perry to contact the dmv if he had any questions.the dmv received no response.
smith then sent a second letter,dated september,the september letter,to lawrence perry at the same address.smith attached a copy of the august letter,stated that the plates had not yet been received by the dmv,and explained that action to suspend this registration would be initiated if the dmv did not receive,by october,either the plates or a letter indicating that the plates had been destroyed.the dmv received no response to the september letter.
on november,the dmv mailed an order of suspension revocation of registration order to lawrence perry at the same listed address.the order stated that the registration number shthpns had been suspended revoked as of november,and informed the recipient of the right to a hearing on the matter if such a hearing was requested within ten days.by this time,the temporary plates that had been sent with the august letter had expired.
by november,perry had seen all of the letters,and on that day she mailed to the dmv a response to the order the november letter,in which she gave her address as hcr,box,montpelier,vt,an address with a different box number from the one that she had shared with lawrence perry.in this november letter,perry requested a hearing on the revocation of her vanity plates and requested that the plates be reinstated pending the outcome of the hearing,but she did not request a new set of temporary plates.perry wrote,inter alia i do understand why i was not notified of this complaint against my vanity plate since this registration is not only in lawrence perry name but also mine,paula perry.none of the correspondence received on this issue has ever been sent to me,the operator of this vehicle.however,the dmv perry does not perry had not notified the dmv of her new address until she wrote the november letter.
smith responded to perry november letter with a letter dated november,which described the previous correspondence sent by the dmv and enclosed copies.he explained to perry that the dmv files showed the same address for the owner and of the vehicle and that no address change information for paula perry had been received by the dmv.the november letter included a change of address form.it also stated that perry request for a hearing had been forwarded to the hearings division,and that perry would be notified of the outcome of the request.it concluded by stating that the license plate shthpns remains under suspension until the decision is received from the hearings division.in his november letter,smith did not explain that perry could still obtain temporary plates,or apply for either new vanity plates or a new set of regular plates at no extra charge.
the hearing on the registration revocation was held on november.on january,while the hearing officer decision was still pending,perry attorney called the dmv to inquire about the status of perry registration.realizing at that point that perry did not have valid plates since the revocation of her vanity plates had become effective on november,commissioner mcdonald issued a new set of permanent plates and had them to perry home that day.the dmv claims that perry could have accepted these plates without relinquishing her right to appeal the dmv proposed revocation of the shthpns plate it is not clear,however,whether anyone explained this to perry,and perry has consistently maintained that accepting these plates would have meant giving up her appeal.in any case,perry refused the new plates.
several days later,on january,the commissioner reinstated the shthpns plates pending the hearing officer decision,so that perry would not have to continue driving her vehicle with invalid plates.on may,the hearing officer ruled that the revocation had been improper because,at the time of the purported revocation november,the governing statute.stat.ann.tit,did not provide for the revocation of a vanity plate issued in error as a result,perry plates remain on her vehicle to this day.
after the hearing officer handed down his decision,on january,perry filed this lawsuit against the dmv in the district court,seeking a declaratory judgment setting forth her rights,a permanent injunction against defendants prohibiting them from taking similar action against her in the future,and damages for the period in which her shthpns plates were revoked,including hardship in getting to work,procuring food and doing activities outside of the home.on june,the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the parties for summary judgment,and perry filed this timely appeal.

it is well established that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls,international soc y for krishna consciousness lee,d.in evaluating government regulations concerning private individuals speech on property,the supreme court has identified three categories of traditional public forum,the designated public forum,and the nonpublic has developed a body of law styled forum analysis.see cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d perry educ.ass perry local educ.ass n,d.
a traditional public forum is property,such as a public street or a park,that by long tradition or by government fiat ha s been devoted to assembly and debate.perry educ.ass n,at.general media communications,cohen,cir.government restrictions on speech in a traditional public forum are subject to strict scrutiny and must be necessary to serve a compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.cornelius,at.a designated public forum is created by purposeful governmental is,when the government intentionally open s a nontraditional forum for public discourse.id.at.restrictions on speech in a designated public forum are also subject to strict scrutiny see general media,at.other government properties are nonpublic forums.see krishna consciousness,at.the government may impose restrictions on speech in a nonpublic forum as long as these restrictions are reasonable and.see perry educ.ass n,at.cornelius,at.
it is undisputed that vermont vanity plates are not a traditional public forum.perry argues that they are a designated public forum,and that we must therefore subject the dmv restriction on offensive scatological terms to strict scrutiny.defendants argue,in turn,that vermont vanity plates are a nonpublic forum,and that the dmv restrictions on expressive activity on such plates need only be reasonable and.
forum analysis 
in order to determine whether a particular species of government property is a designated public forum,we examine factors such as the policy and practice of the government and the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity.see also general media,at paulsen county of nassau,cir.the focus of this analysis is the government intent accordingly,a court must ascertain whether the government intended to designate a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum.cornelius,at.in conducting this analysis,we bear in mind that the government creates a public forum by designating a place or channel of communication for use by the public at large for assembly and speech,for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain subjects.id.the government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.id.emphasis added.
after reviewing vermont policies and practices regarding vanity plates and considering the nature of such plates and their compatibility with expressive activity,cornelius,at,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that vermont did not intend to designate a public forum when it established a vanity plate regime.
first,vermont stated policy in issuing license plates,including vanity plates,is to aid in vehicle identification.see.stat.ann.tit,b c t he primary purpose of motor vehicle plates is vehicle identification.although a policy of vehicle identification is not necessarily inconsistent with a government intention to designate a public forum,the statement of such a legislative policy does not suggest,much less show,an intention to create a public forum.
second,as noted by counsel for the state at oral argument,vermont vanity plates serve the purpose of raising revenue.nothing about the aim of the regime suggests that vermont intended to create a forum for unlimited public expression.diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir holding that a public school did not create a public forum by allowing commercial advertising on a baseball field fence see new york magazine metropolitan transp,cir.
third,expressive activity on vermont vanity plates is subject to numerous restrictions,including limitations on the number of letters that may appear on a vanity plate and on how many numbers may be used in combination with letters.furthermore.stat.ann.tit,d permits the commissioner to refuse to honor any request for a special plate deemed offensive or confusing to the general public.at the time of perry application,the dmv exercised its authority to prohibit offensive vanity plates in part through an unwritten policy of denying requests for plates bearing scatological terms such extensive government regulation of expressive activity does not suggest an intent to designate a public forum.see cornelius,at.holding that a charity drive aimed at employees in the federal workplace was a nonpublic forum because,inter alia,the literature each could distribute was limited to a word statement.
fourth,the general public does not have unimpeded access to vermont license plates,including vanity plates.rather,only vermont vehicle owners who have obtained permission to do so may place a message of their choice on their vanity plate.such limited access provides a further indication that the government did not intend to designate a public forum on vermont vanity plates see arkansas educ.television comm forbes,d explaining that government property remains a nonpublic forum when it does no more than reserve eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers,whose members must then,as individuals,obtain permission to use it internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis added quoting cornelius,at.perry educ.ass n,at,d explaining that an internal school mail system had not been opened for indiscriminate use by the general public and therefore was not a public permission had to be sought from principal before using it.
finally,when we examine the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity to discern the government intent,cornelius,at,we reach the obvious conclusion that vanity plates are an unlikely means by which to engage in meaningful assembly and debate,perry educ.ass n,at,or other expressive activity.because vanity plates are physically restricted by size and shape and by the state interests,including that of vehicle identification,vanity plates are a highly limited and extremely constrained means of expression.the very character of license plates also suggests that they are not a designated public forum.
in light of all of the circumstances described above,we hold that vermont has not intended to designate,and has not designated,its vanity plates as a public forum.in re denial of the application for the custom plates,en banc holding that a vanity plate is not a public forum.but see sons of confederate veterans,holcomb,d,holding that a vanity plate is a designated public forum where a state allow s groups to place various slogans and designs on license plates.accordingly,we agree with defendants that a vermont vanity plate is a nonpublic forum.
having concluded that a vermont vanity plate is a nonpublic forum,we must now consider whether the dmv policy of prohibiting vanity plates with offensive scatological terms passes constitutional muster.
reasonableness and viewpoint neutrality 
as noted above,we will uphold a governmental restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum as long as the restriction is reasonable and.see perry educ.ass n,at.cornelius,at.
a reasonableness.a governmental restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum need only be reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum and reflect a legitimate government concern.general media,at.vermont asserts that it has two interests at stake in the restriction on offensive scatological terms protecting the public,especially young children,from offensive and indecent speech and not associating the state with such speech.perry argues,however,that the restriction is unreasonable because her vanity plates do not actually interfere with vehicle identification,the dmv stated purpose in issuing license plates.
we are not persuaded.as the district court correctly concluded,vermont restriction on scatological the vermont statute describes as offensive reasonably serves legitimate governmental interests.automobile license plates are governmental property intended primarily to serve a governmental purpose,and inevitably they will be associated with the state that issues them.although the owner of a vehicle chooses the characters that appear on a vanity plate,the vermont dmv must approve of a vanity plate before issuing it.the state has a legitimate interest in not communicating the message that it approves of the public display of offensive scatological terms on state license plates.see general media,at holding that the government has a legitimate interest in not appearing to endorse lascivious materials on a military base,and that banning such materials is a reasonable way to serve that interest.
the fact that perry plates do not actually interfere with vehicle identification,vermont stated purpose in issuing license plates,does not end the inquiry.whether or not vehicle identification is hampered is merely one factor in a broader inquiry that includes consideration of whether the restriction serves legitimate governmental interests.see cornelius,at.if a restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum serves a legitimate governmental in this case,it the fact that the prohibited expression does not interfere with a principal purpose of the forum does not render that prohibition unconstitutional.otherwise,no governmental restriction on speech on any vermont license plate would be permissible as long as each plate was somehow unique,because each plate would further vermont interest in vehicle identification.
moreover,vermont policy does not prevent perry from communicating any particular message on her automobile.for instance,perry may display a bumper sticker bearing the letters shthpns if she so desires.vermont scatological terms policy is thus reasonably directed not to suppressing,but to disassociating the state from,plaintiff speech.general media,at.accordingly,vermont restrictions on offensive scatalogical vanity plates are reasonable.
b.we have explained that the government may reasonably restrict expressive activity in a nonpublic forum on the basis of content,but not on the basis of the speaker viewpoint.see longo united states postal,cir.for instance,a state might be permitted to prohibit speech on scatalogical subjects,but it may not be able to prohibit the expression of particular views about such subjects.see rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d.
it is apparent that vermont policy does not oppose perry philosophical views as reflected in the vanity plate.vermont policy prohibits perry vanity plate not because it stands for shit happens so do let life problems drive you to drink,but because perry chose to express that viewpoint using a combination of letters that stands in part for the word shit.this restriction does not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint 
perry argues that the dmv did not act neutrally when it attempted to revoke her plates because it has issued several vanity plates bearing scatological terms,including cashit,trashit,shtrbug,shtzer,irshitl,dumprun,cowpies,ecoli,pooper,toot,bm,merde,shhad.there are two problems with this argument.
first,as the dmv notes,it has issued vanity plates and receives applications per week for such plates,and as a result of the large number of applications it has to process,some plates,like perry,are issued in error.that errors have happened in other instances does not mean that perry is a victim of viewpoint discrimination.
second,perry contends that some of the aforementioned vanity plates were not issued in error,and that this proves that,in applying its scatological terms policy to her shthpns plates,the dmv discriminated against her on the basis of her viewpoint 
we disagree.even if some of the plates listed above were not issued in error,perry errs in focusing solely on the scatological aspect of the policy and ignoring its offensiveness aspect.section d concerns offensive scatological terms,not just scatological terms.thus,more than half of the plates perry identifies specifically,those that do not use readily recognizable profanities do not suggest that the dmv discriminated against her choice of letters.perry argues that the dmv has inconsistently applied its scatological terms policy by issuing plates with scatological terms it considers cute,and that this distinction does not pass muster as under the first amendment.but the difference between perry plates and most of those listed above is not that the latter are cute,but that they do not use easily recognizable profanities.the relevant difference between shit and pooper,for instance,is not the cuteness of the word pooper,but the fact that shit is a profanity.that is why the dmv considers the latter offensive.
prior restraint 
perry makes the additional argument that the dmv actions imposed an impermissible prior restraint on her speech by denying the application for vanity plates before providing her notice and a hearing and by placing the burden on perry to prove that the denial was improper.
a prior restraint is a governmental order or action forbidding certain communications when issued in advance of the time that such communications are to occur.alexander united states,d quoting melville nimmer,nimmer on freedom of speech,at.in addition,a system of licensing that requires parties to obtain permits from the state before engaging in expression can be an unconstitutional prior restraint when state officials are allowed to exercise unfettered discretion in the absence of explicit standards or procedures.see city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d freedman maryland,d.prior restraints on expression in a public forum have generally been subjected to exacting scrutiny.see,dallas,d plurality opinion collecting cases.
however,the context in which a prior restraint occurs can affect the level of scrutiny applied.milwaukee police ass jones,cir.prior restraints in a nonpublic forum have been upheld as long as they were reasonable and.see cornelius,at.holding that a federal charity drive,a nonpublic forum,could limit participation to a number of select charities as long as the restriction was reasonable and muller jefferson lighthouse,cir holding that school officials could prevent a student from distributing invitations in a public elementary school,a nonpublic forum,because the restraint was reasonable.a nonpublic forum by definition is characterized by selective access,arkansas educ.television comm forbes,d,which necessarily means that the state can select or limit who may speak and what may be said prior to its expression as long as the restrictions meet the requirements of reasonableness and.accordingly,a restriction on expression which would otherwise be deemed a prior restraint if it had been applied in a public forum is valid in a nonpublic forum
