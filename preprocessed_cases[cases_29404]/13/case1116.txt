background 
factual allegations 
the following facts are drawn from walker pro se complaint,and we assume them to be true for purposes of this appeal.on november,while walker was an inmate at fci ray brook,he was placed in a cell.compl.the cell was approximately to square feet in size,providing each prisoner with to square feet of total space,and less than square feet moving space,which was not enough space to even turn or move in the man cell.id.in addition to the six prisoners,the cell contained their bunk beds,their belongings,two toilets,and two sinks.id.the prisoners were required to be in their cells each day from approximately to,and for minute periods each and.id.
walker,who is tall and weighs pounds,was assigned to one of the top bunk beds for four months.id.the bed itself was only inches wide four inches narrower than what guards told walker was the required width of beds which forced walker to sleep on his side rotating back and forth.id.there were no ladders to climb up to the top bunks walker had to climb onto a chair and then onto another inmate locker to reach his bed.id.once,when climbing up to his bed,walker fell onto the chair,which broke his fall to the floor.id.if,when climbing up to his bed,he knocked another inmate property off a locker,it would lead to arguments and possibly fights.id.
walker cellmates included gang members,members,and men of different races.id.mixing inmates from different backgrounds caused insurmountable problems,including fights,friction,and violence throughout the prison.id.the overcrowding,gang activities,violence and fights in the cell placed walker in a situation to kill or be killed.id.further,because the cell was so crowded and noisy,the prison guards would not know when prisoners were fighting unless another prisoner alerted them.id.
walker five cellmates stayed up all night watching television and playing games,which led to hollering,screaming and sometimes fights.id.in addition,his cellmates constantly had other prisoners running into the cell using the and making noise.id.walker got almost no sleep and was tired most of the time,because t he noise inside the cell was constant and loud.id.walker got so little sleep that there was no way he could work on a job without hurting himself or someone else.id.
walker cell was also unsanitary,with so much urine on the floor and sometimes on the toilet that the toilet required cleaning a t least times per day.id.walker cellmates warned him that urin e or defecat ion would splatter to the floor.id.the inmates were not provided sufficient cleaning supplies or equipment to keep the toilet and surrounding area clean.id.thus,walker had to use his personal soap and dishwashing liquid to clean the toilets and cell.id.
finally,walker cell was inadequately ventilated,such that during the winter the cell was cold and during the summer months extremely hot and quite difficult to breathe.id.
walker still resided in the cell when he filed his complaint on march,nearly months after having been placed there on november,for walker,the experience of being in the cell was horrifying.id.
according to walker,defendants were aware of and did nothing to remedy the conditions in his cell.fci ray brook wardens deborah schult and russell perdue associate wardens david porter,anne mary carter,and steven wagner,unit manager david salamy,and counselor sepanek each knew of the overcrowding,gang activities,and violence in the cells and the physical danger that walker faced id.walker informed schult,sepanek,salamy,porter,and carter that his bed was too narrow for him,but he received no response.id.further,defendants were fully aware that the noise in the unit was so loud and constant,id,and that the cell was inadequately ventilated,id.finally,sepanek,whose job it was to issue cleaning supplies,failed to do so.id.
walker pursued his administrative remedies,but alleged that defendants interfered with and obstructed his efforts to obtain relief.id.
procedural history 
on march,walker,proceeding pro se,filed the instant action alleging that defendants violated his constitutional rights while he was imprisoned at fci ray brook 
on august,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint based on walker failure to exhaust administrative remedies walker failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted walker failure to allege defendants personal involvement in the constitutional violations and qualified immunity.
by report and recommendation filed on january,magistrate judge randolph treece recommended dismissing walker complaint for failure to state a claim,pursuant to rule b.the magistrate judge noted that he was unable to properly assess whether walker fully exhausted his available administrative remedies or whether defendants should be estopped from asserting failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.with respect to walker allegation that his cell lacked a ladder to access his top bunk bed,the magistrate judge recommended in the alternative granting the motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.the magistrate judge also recommended dismissing the claims against sepanek and lappin for failure to serve them 
finally,the magistrate judge declined to address defendants argument that all of walker claims should be dismissed for failure to allege that defendants were personally involved in the constitutional violations.
on march,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in full and dismissed the case.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
applicable.motions to dismiss 
to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,u,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.a claim is plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.in exercising this review,our task is necessarily a limited one.the issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.scheuer rhodes,abrogated on other grounds by harlow fitzgerald,accord difolco msnbc cable,cir in ruling on a motion pursuant to.b,the duty of a court is merely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint,not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
where,as here,the complaint was filed pro se,it must be construed liberally to raise the strongest arguments it suggest s.pabon wright,cir quoting burgos hopkins,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord erickson pardus.nonetheless,a pro se complaint must state a plausible claim for relief.see harris mills,cir.
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff favor.see chambers time warner,cir.
the eighth amendment 
the eighth amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.const.amend.viii.although the constitution does not require comfortable prison conditions,the conditions of confinement may not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain.rhodes chapman.
to state an eighth amendment claim based on conditions of confinement,an inmate must allege that objectively,the deprivation the inmate suffered was sufficiently serious that he was denied the minimal civilized measure of life necessities,and subjectively,the defendant official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind,such as deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.gaston coughlin,cir quoting farmer brennan,internal quotation marks omitted.
to meet the objective element,the inmate must show that the conditions,either alone or in combination,pose an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his health.rhodes,at phelps kapnolas,cir per curiam.thus,prison officials violate the constitution when they deprive an inmate of his basic human needs such as food,clothing,medical care,and safe and sanitary living conditions.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.t here is no static test to determine whether a deprivation is sufficiently serious the conditions themselves must be evaluated in light of contemporary standards of decency.jabbar fischer,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,conditions of confinement may be aggregated to rise to the level of a constitutional violation,but only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single,identifiable human need such as food,warmth,or exercise.wilson seiter,noting that low cell temperature at night combined with a failure to issue blankets may establish an eighth amendment violation.
to meet the subjective element,the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with more than mere negligence.farmer,at.to constitute deliberate indifference,t he prison official must know of,and disregard,an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.jabbar,at.evidence that a risk was obvious or otherwise must have been known to a defendant may be sufficient for a fact finder to conclude that the defendant was actually aware of the risk.brock wright,f d,cir.
qualified immunity 
a federal official is entitled to qualified immunity from suit for money damages unless the plaintiff shows that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.ashcroft,quoting harlow fitzgerald.
a government official conduct violates clearly established law when,at the time of the challenged conduct,the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.courts do not require a case directly on point,but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.id.if an official conduct did not violate a clearly established constitutional right,or if the official reasonably believed that his conduct did not violate such a right,then he is protected by qualified immunity.sudler city of,cir.
although courts should resolve the question of qualified immunity at the earliest possible stage in litigation,saucier katz,citation and internal quotation marks omitted,abrogated on other grounds by pearson callahan,a defendant presenting an immunity defense on a rule b motion instead of a motion for summary judgment must accept the more stringent standard applicable to this procedural route,mckenna wright,cir.
application 
we conclude that the district court erred by dismissing walker complaint for failure to state a claim.first,he plausibly alleged conditions that,perhaps alone and certainly in combination,deprived him of a minimal civilized measure of life necessities.second,he plausibly alleged that defendants were deliberately indifferent to this deprivation.third,he plausibly alleged violations of clearly established rights.we address each of these issues in turn.
the conditions of confinement 
walker plausibly alleged that his conditions of confinement at fci ray brook deprived him of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities and subjected him to unreasonable health and safety risks.he alleged that for approximately months,he was confined in a cell with five other men,with inadequate space and ventilation,stifling heat in the summer and freezing cold in the winter,unsanitary conditions,including urine and feces splattered on the floor,insufficient cleaning supplies,a mattress too narrow for him to lie on flat,and noisy,crowded conditions that made sleep difficult and placed him at constant risk of violence and serious harm from cellmates.based on these allegations,we conclude that walker has plausibly alleged cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.
first,it is well settled that exposing prisoners to extreme temperatures without adequate ventilation may violate the eighth amendment.see gaston,at we have held that an eighth amendment claim may be established by proof that the inmate was subjected for a prolonged period to bitter cold.see also,corselli coughlin,cir claims that inmate was exposed to subfreezing temperatures for three months with ice forming in toilet bowl were sufficient to raise issues of fact for jury,even where prison officials gave inmate extra blanket.
second,sleep is critical to human existence,and conditions that prevent sleep have been held to violate the eighth amendment.see tafari mccarthy,d,courts have previously recognized that sleep constitutes a basic human need and conditions that prevent sleep violate an inmate constitutional rights.citing harper showers,cir see also,wright mcmann,cir inmate stated eighth amendment claim by alleging he was forced to sleep completely nude on the cold rough concrete floor and that the cell was so cold and uncomfortable that it was impossible for him to sleep for more than an hour or two without having to stand and move about in order to keep warm robinson danberg,d,denying motion to dismiss eighth amendment claims based on allegations that defendants took specific acts designed to deprive plaintiff of sleep further,at least one court recently found that the condition of a prisoner mattress may be so inadequate as to constitute an unconstitutional deprivation.see bell luna,d,denying motion to dismiss where inmate lived for seven months with mattress that was torn,unstuffed,and smelled like mildew.
third,we have long recognized that unsanitary conditions in a prison cell can,in egregious circumstances,rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment.see lareau manson,cir noting that prisoners are entitled to,inter alia,sanitation lareau macdougall,cir causing a man to live,eat and perhaps sleep in close confines with his own human waste is too debasing and degrading to be permitted.young quinlan,cir noting that the denial of basic sanitation is cruel and unusual because,in the worst case,it can result in physical torture,and,even in less serious cases,it can result in pain without any penological purpose.citation and internal quotation marks omitted indeed,unsanitary conditions lasting for mere days may constitute an eighth amendment violation.see,gaston,at inmate stated an eighth amendment claim where the area in front of his cell was filled with human feces,urine,and sewage water for several consecutive days wright,at,placement of prisoner for days in cell that was fetid and reeking from the stench of the bodily wastes of previous occupants which covered the floor,the sink,and the toilet,combined with other conditions,would violate the eighth amendment.
further,the failure to provide prisoners with toiletries and other hygienic materials may rise to the level of a constitutional violation.see trammell keane,cir t his court and other circuits have recognized that deprivation of toiletries,and especially toilet paper,can rise to the level of unconstitutional conditions of confinement see also,atkins cnty.of orange,d,the failure to regularly provide prisoners with toilet articles including soap,razors,combs,toothpaste,toilet paper,access to a mirror and sanitary napkins for female prisoners constitutes a denial of personal hygiene and sanitary living conditions.internal quotations marks and citations omitted.availability of hygienic materials is particularly important in the context of otherwise unsanitary living conditions.see,macdougall,at.
fourth,conditions that place a prisoner at a substantial risk of serious harm from other inmates may const
