plaintiff patrick proctor,a new york state prisoner who has been administratively confined since in a special housing unit or shu at the great meadow correctional facility great meadow or at the clinton correctional facility,subject to reviews every days,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,gary sharpe,now chief judge,dismissing proctor amended complaint complaint or complaint brought under alleging that his due process rights have been violated because the decisions to continue his confinement in shu have been based on evidence that should have been expunged from his record,the periodic reviews have been perfunctory and meaningless,and the reasons given for his continued confinement have been false or misleading.the district court granted the motion of defendant lucien leclaire,deputy commissioner of the new york state department of correctional services docs,to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that,because proctor had previously lost a similar suit,see proctor kelly,cv,wl,proctor i,the present action was barred by principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel,see proctor leclaire,cv,wl july,proctor ii.challenging the district court decision in the present action,proctor contends principally that neither claim preclusion nor issue preclusion is applicable because his complaint includes material allegations of new facts,asserting a cause of action that was not previously litigated or decided.to an extent,we agree,and we therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
since,proctor has been serving a sentence of years to life imprisonment for convictions of murder and attempted escape.he had served prison terms in new york twice before.in november,proctor escaped from shawangunk correctional facility shawangunk,was recaptured,and was sentenced to serve nine years and one month in shu at great meadow as disciplinary confinement for,inter alia,escape,weapons possession,assault,and fighting.
special housing units 
a correctional facility shu is a designated area that is designed to maximize facility safety and security,by separating particular inmates from the general prison population.regs.nycrr b see also id.inmates may be assigned to shu either for disciplinary reasons,see id,or for administrative reasons,see id.administrative confinement in shu may be ordered where the inmates presence in general population would pose a threat to the safety and security of the facility.id.b.shu inmates are subject to particularly strict living conditions.see id.limited services id.controls and restrictions see generally palmer richards,cir.
a prisoner who has been confined in shu for administrative reasons administrative segregation or ad seg has a due process right to have p rison officials engage in some sort of periodic review of his confinement,hewitt helms,d helms see id.administrative segregation may not be used as a pretext for indefinite confinement of an inmate.new york law requires that these reviews be conducted every days in accordance with the following procedure 
a committee consisting of a representative of the facility executive staff,a security supervisor,and a member of the guidance and counseling staff shall examine the inmate institutional record and prepare and submit to the superintendent or designee a report setting forth the following 
i reasons why the inmate was initially determined to be appropriate for administrative segregation 
ii information on the inmate subsequent behavior and attitude and 
iii any other factors that they believe may favor retaining the inmate in or releasing the inmate from administrative segregation.
nycrr d.such reviews must not deny the prisoner basic due process protections.see generally helms,at.
proctor action 
in december,after proctor had served his sentence of disciplinary confinement in shu,he was served with an administrative segregation recommendation the ad seg recommendation recommending that,at the end of his disciplinary sentence,he remain assigned to shu rather than being released into the general prison population.the recommendation cited,inter alia,specific instances of proctor alleged misbehavior plus general allegations of misbehavior,and it asserted that proctor was an extreme risk to the safety and security of facility staff and inmates with whom he could come into contact.
as described in proctor i,part of the ad seg recommendation cited proctor conduct before he was confined in shu,including his escape from shawangunk,other escapes or attempted escapes dating back to at least,and his stabbing of another inmate.see,proctor i,wl,at.proctor alleged misconduct while in shu as recorded in unusual incident ui reports or staff memoranda,most of which did not result in misbehavior reports included his possession of a sharpened nail clipper a charge that did become the subject of a misbehavior report,but which was later reversed and eventually expunged slipping out of his handcuffs starting multiple fires telephoning a citizen whom he urged to firebomb a certain home stabbing another inmate housed in shu and concealing a razor in his rectum as evidenced by.see id.at.
a hearing,attended by proctor,was held in december to evaluate the bases for the ad seg recommendation.see generally nycrr a hearing requirement id.hearing procedures id.formal charge requirements.the hearing officer concluded that proctor did pose a threat to the safety and security of the facility,id.b,and ordered proctor placement in administrative segregation.
in,proctor,proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis,commenced the action that was eventually dismissed in proctor seven of the causes of action asserted in his amended complaint or complaint alleged that various docs employees,including leclaire,had violated his due process rights in connection with the december hearing that authorized his administrative confinement.proctor alleged principally that his administrative segregation hearing was based on false allegations of misconduct that had been dismissed or expunged and thus should not have been considered that he was denied the right to present witnesses in his defense that the hearing officer was not impartial and that portions of the hearing transcript had been destroyed.proctor also asserted three eighth amendment claims that are not relevant to his present case.proctor sought monetary and injunctive relief,including the expungement of all records that had been used in the december hearing.
following discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.with respect to the due process claims,they contended,inter alia,that several of the defendants had not been personally involved in proctor administrative segregation hearing,and that proctor had received all of the process to which he was entitled.proctor for summary judgment in his favor,reiterating the allegations in the complaint,and adding in his memorandum of law 
that defendants continue to maintain me in ad seg based upon sham,perfunctory and they are using the cloak of ad seg as a pretext to indefinitely confine me and punish me based upon false information and continue to v iolate due process by denying me constitutionally mandated meaningful reviews.
proctor memorandum added that leclaire had been repeatedly notified of the allegedly false information that was being used as grounds for proctor administrative segregation but had simply the periodic reports recommending proctor continued confinement in shu.
in reply to proctor,the defendants submitted a memorandum of law arguing that any alleged due process claim regarding periodic review is distinct from due process claims associated with the initial placement in ad seg,and that t he c omplaint is devoid of any allegations claiming any due process violation with respect to the periodic review.the defendants contended that proctor new claim should not be entertained by the court.
the magistrate judge to whom the motions had been referred for report and recommendation recommended that the defendants motion for summary judgment be granted and that proctor be denied.as to the due process claims arising out of the december administrative segregation hearing,the magistrate judge stated that the hearing had been conducted in accordance with new york state regulations and in accordance with due process.see report and recommendation of the magistrate judge gustave dibianco dated september,magistrate report,at.
the magistrate judge added that proctor claim for denial of due process with respect to the periodic reviews was not properly before the court because there was no mention of such a claim in the complaint.the magistrate judge noted that 
t he question of periodic review is a due process claim that is separate from the claim for the initial placement in administrative segregation 
plaintiff motion for summary judgment,filed in,is the first time in this case that plaintiff is complaining about his periodic reviews.there is absolutely no mention of periodic reviews in his amended complaint that was initially submitted as a motion to amend on september.since plaintiff was placed in administrative segregation in,by september of,there would have been many of those periodic reviews to challenge if plaintiff wished to do so.defendants are correct in arguing that the constitutionality of plaintiff periodic reviews is not before the court.
id.at emphases in original.
in a decision dated december,district judge glenn suddaby,to whom proctor i was then assigned,accepted and adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,see,proctor i,wl,at,and dismissed the complaint.the court found that no evidence had been proffered to show a denial of procedural due process,pointing out that proctor had been afforded,inter alia,
substantial notice of the hearing the right to choose an assistant before the hearing the ability to have two witnesses interviewed notice of his rights during the hearing the ability to be present for the entire hearing wide latitude to argue and object during the hearing the opportunity to question defendant seyfert and deputy superintendent carpenter at the hearing the opportunity to challenge evidence against him a deliberately and patiently conducted hearing and a written hearing determination that was supported by at least some evidence.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court ruled that there was also no basis for proctor claims of the denial of substantive due process.it stated that,given the record of proctor history of violent behavior,both in and out of prison,the decision to impose administrative segregation could not be viewed as arbitrary in the constitutional sense.see id.at.
with respect to proctor claim that he was denied due process in the periodic reviews,the district court noted 
a s an initial matter,that plaintiff appears to have asserted his procedural due process claim regarding periodic reviews for the first time in his memorandum of law dated february,nearly two and a half years after he filed an a mended c omplaint and nearly one and a half years after discovery closed in the action 
proctor i,wl,at emphases in original.the court concluded that 
a s a result,it appears that defendants have conducted no discovery regarding the claim.for this reason alone,this claim is not properly before the court,no matter how much special solicitude plaintiff is afforded.
id.emphasis added.
the court went on to say,however,that it would briefly address the merits of the challenge to the periodic reviews in the interest of thoroughness.id.the court concluded that proctor had not been denied meaningful periodic reviews that he had not been kept in shu for new reasons the court can find no evidence in the record that plaintiff continued to remain in administrative segregation as a result of a new reason that arose after the date on which he was originally placed in administrative segregation and that in the absence of any new reason for his administrative confinement in shu,proctor had not been deprived of any right to an explanation of the decisions to continue that confinement.proctor i,wl,at.
judgment was entered dismissing the complaint.proctor timely appealed this court dismissed the appeal as lacking any basis in fact or law.
c.the present action 
in,proctor,again proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis,commenced the present action against leclaire proctor filed his amended complaint in.the complaint alleged principally that the periodic reviews of his shu status first occurring on february,and conducted every days thereafter had been perfunctory and meaningless,complaint,and were performed merely as a formality and a pretext to indefinitely confine proctor to ad seg id.proctor contended that all references to all of the allegations mentioned in the december ad seg recommendation should have been expunged from his record one of which he stated he had been misled to believe was expunged and that that allegedly false information remained the basis for his continued administrative segregation see,complaint,that new or changed reasons given by the review committee for continuing his administrative segregation were false or misleading see,id,and that he was not provided advance notice of such proposed rationales and thus had been unable to defend against them see id.he also alleged that the reviews were discriminatory in that he was not allowed to participate in them but was allowed only to raise objections after the decisions had been made.see,id.the complaint alleged that some letters proctor had submitted to the review committee were not in fact reviewed,denying him a right to be heard.see,id,see also id.alleging that proctor counselor informed proctor that he never saw any letters proctor wrote for consideration,and had not sat down with any security supervisor committee chairman to discuss proctor ad seg status.proctor also alleged that he had been informed by multiple sources that he was being detained simply because his escape from shawangunk had angered docs staff.see id.id.alleging that proctor was told by several staff that the word is he will remain in ad seg for the rest of his sentence because of his earlier escape and because he had caus ed embarrassment for the commissioner,the department and the governor id.alleging that docs assistant commissioner told proctor,i do know if you will ever get out.i was in the office th e day of your escape.you pissed a lot of people off.they think the governor lost the election because of the escape that day.
leclaire moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the complaint failed to allege his personal involvement in the alleged due process violations proctor claim was barred by claim preclusion and the complaint was untimely.judge sharpe,to whom proctor ii was assigned,referred the motion to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation.
the magistrate judge concluded that proctor had sufficiently alleged leclaire participation in the claimed violations and that proctor claim was not.see report and recommendation of the magistrate judge david peebles dated february,magistrate report,at.but he recommended that the complaint be dismissed on grounds of claim preclusion and issue preclusion.see id.at.
the magistrate judge stated,first,that proctor could have raised his claim in proctor i,stating that b y the time of plaintiff submission of his summary judgment brief in proctor i periodic reviews of administrative segregation had already been conducted.magistrate report at.the magistrate judge also concluded that these periodic reviews were in fact raised and were addressed by judge suddaby in proctor see magistrate report at.
as to the periodic reviews that proctor summary judgment submission,the magistrate judge,focusing on whether the same transaction or connected series of transactions is at issue,id.at quoting monahan new york city department of corrections,cir.emphasis in monahan,cert.denied,d,recommended that proctor complaint be dismissed on the ground of claim preclusion.he viewed all of proctor factual allegations as deriv ing ultimately from the same origin or motivation that drove his claims in the proctor i complaint,magistrate report at internal quotation marks omitted,and viewed proctor current claim as alleging the very same unconstitutional conduct that he had challenged in the prior action,id.at.
the magistrate judge stated,however,that 
t his is not to say that a future action or series of future occurrences involving plaintiff administrative segregation review could not at some point suffice to create a new,viable section action it may well be that some time in the future the plaintiff can sufficiently allege changed circumstances altering the factual predicate of his procedural due process claim such that it would not be barred by the original judgment claims based on conduct or procedures which were not contemplated by,or a direct result of,the earlier action would not necessarily be precluded.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the magistrate judge also opined that proctor complaint should be dismissed on the ground that it was subject to issue preclusion.id.at.he stated that judge suddaby considered and addressed the merits of proctor procedural due process claim stemming from the contention that period ic reviews of his administrative segregation status have not been meaningful,but instead are sham proceedings based upon false information.id.
proctor objected to the magistrate report,arguing,inter alia,that the magistrate judge erred in suggesting that judge suddaby,when deciding proctor i,had addressed or even seen periodic reviews.proctor also stated that he had not been aware of the sham nature of the earlier reviews,or of leclaire discriminatory policy and practice,and that he therefore could not have asserted such a claim when he filed his complaint in proctor proctor argued that his due process claim as contrasted with his due process claims arising out of the december hearing was not before the proctor i court and thus that judge suddaby analysis of the periodic reviews was not necessary to the judgment in proctor 
the district court rejected proctor objections and adopted the magistrate report in its entirety.see proctor ii,wl,at.stating that the doctrine of claim preclusion forecloses a cause of action where there was a final judgment on the merits in a previous proceeding,involving the same parties or their privies,and arising out of the same transaction or connected series of transactions,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the court found that principle applicable to proctor complaint,stating as follows 
in the prior action,the issue of reviews was not raised in proctor complaint rather,the issue was first raised and resolved at the summary judgment 
proctor ii,wl,at emphases ours.the court continued 
thus,with respect to the issue of claim preclusion,judge peebles recommended dismissal because the claim should have been,and was,raised in the previous action proctor due process claim concerning his periodic reviews is the same claim he advanced in the prior action in fact,proctor c omplaint contends that leclaire discriminatory policy or practice concerning his reviews began on or about february,see am.compl.at,and that since april,each review has employed this discriminatory policy,see id.at.proctor first claim involved the initial administrative segregation determination,and his second claim developed to include the periodic reviews based on the same facts derive d ultimately from the same origin or motivation t his lawsuit would have formed a convenient trial unit with the previous action since both involve substantially the same occurrences regarding proctor periodic reviews of his administrative confinement.both actions involve facts that occurred as a single transaction or series of related transactions.waldman vill.of kiryas joel,cir accordingly,treating the facts of both actions as a single transaction would conform to the parties expectations,which supports judge peebles reasoning that the doctrine of claim preclusion bars proctor claim.
proctor ii,wl,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.
the district court also agreed with the magistrate judge recommendation to apply principles of issue preclusion.the court ruled that proctor due process claim had already been addressed on the merits and was thus barred,id.at,stating that i ssue preclusion bars a party that has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue of fact from relitigating the same issue once it has been decided against that party,id.internal quotation marks omitted.
proctor timely appealed the proctor ii decision,and this court appointed counsel to represent him on the appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,proctor principally pursues his contentions that his claim of denial of due process in the periodic reviews was not part of proctor i,was not required to be part of proctor i,and no decision of such a claim was necessary to the judgment in proctor i.we agree that the district court applications of claim preclusion and issue preclusion,which we review de novo,see,computer associates international,altai,cir computer associates,cert.denied,d,were in large part erroneous.
claim preclusion 
under the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action to support or to defend against the alleged cause of action.sec first jersey securities,cir first jersey quoting federated department stores,moitie,d,cert.denied.
t he doctrine of res judicata provides that when a final judgment has been entered on the merits of a case,i t is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy,concluding parties and those in privity with them,not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand,but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.
first jersey,at quoting nevada united states,d internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.the fact that several operative facts may be common to successive actions between the same parties does not mean that a judgment in the first will always preclude litigation of the second.see,interoceania sound pilots,cir interoceania.a prior judgment is res judicata only as to suits involving the same cause of action.first jersey,at quoting lawlor national screen service.emphasis ours see,nevada united states,at court must determine whether same cause of action is sued on first jersey,at the claim that first jersey defrauded customers in the sale,purchase,and repurchase of certain securities in is not the same as the claim that first jersey defrauded customers in the sale,purchase,and repurchase of other securities in.

in the present case,proctor current due process challenge to the periodic reviews was not within the scope of his complaint.the due process claims asserted in the original and amended complaints in proctor i were that proctor was denied due process in connection with the december hearing.as recognized by the defendants and the district court in proctor i,those pleadings made no mention of any due process claim with respect to the periodic reviews.see,proctor i,wl,at plaintiff claim regarding periodic reviews was raised for the first time in his february,memorandum of law,more than two years after plaintiff filed his a mended c omplaint m
