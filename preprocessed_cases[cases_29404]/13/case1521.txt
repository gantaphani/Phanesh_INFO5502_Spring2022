plaintiff stephen patterson brought suit against defendants city of utica,and its mayor,timothy julian,in his individual and official capacities collectively defendants,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,pursuant to and title vii of the civil rights act of,et.plaintiff alleged that defendants discriminated against him based on his race,retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights,and deprived him of a liberty interest without due process by making stigmatizing statements about him when dismissing him from city employment.patterson sought damages of million for each cause of action,punitive damages,attorney fees and costs,and also reinstatement.a jury trial on these allegations was held in december.
the jury found the city,acting through its former mayor,edward hanna,was liable for violating plaintiff procedural due process rights,and awarded plaintiff in damages and attorney fees and costs.the jury also found that although mayor julian had terminated plaintiff from city employment and had made stigmatizing statements depriving plaintiff of a liberty interest protected by the due process clause,neither he nor the city was liable for any damages for these acts because plaintiff had been given a hearing after the stigmatizing statements were made.the jury returned a verdict for the defendants on plaintiff race discrimination and first amendment retaliation claims.
after the verdict was rendered,the parties each moved under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure for judgment as a matter of law.the district court on march,denied both motions in a bench decision and issued a judgment that reflected the jury verdict.the city appeals,contending the district court erred when it entered judgment for the plaintiff on his due process claims arising from mayor hanna actions,because there was not enough evidence to support the verdict.plaintiff,arguing that the jury verdict for the city on his due process claims arising from mayor hanna actions can not be sustained because the process he was provided was deficient as a matter of law.plaintiff further appeals the jury verdicts in favor of the city on his racial discrimination and first amendment retaliation claims.
the circumstances leading to this litigation began when defendant city former mayor edward hanna hired plaintiff patterson in as commissioner of the city department of public works,and not long afterwards allegedly fired him.mayor hanna repeated this pattern of hiring and dismissing patterson twice more,with the third and final dismissal occurring in the spring of.in july for reasons unrelated to this resigned as mayor of the city.
mayor hanna was succeeded by utica current mayor,defendant timothy julian,who within a matter of days dismissed patterson and accompanied that action by making stigmatizing comments about him.these hirings and firings so traumatized plaintiff that he had to seek medical help.plaintiff eventually sued the city and mayor julian claiming that these events violated his constitutional rights and that his good name and reputation had been damaged.
the suit was brought under the legal theory of.this theory is limited by the doctrine that a state defamation action for slander by a government official,alone,can not be converted into a federal action for loss of liberty under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.instead,to state a claim under the constitution,additional circumstances must be shown.thus,for example,the theory does not come into play unless a government employee is slandered in the course of having his employment terminated and,even then,additional requirements must be met to succeed on the claim.in this case,the proof necessary to establish the requirements,with respect to the actions taken by former mayor hanna,was insufficient.accordingly,the jury verdict for the plaintiff based on those actions must be reversed.
this does not end our inquiry,however,because it is clear that mayor julian actions did satisfy the requirements.the remedy for a violation of a government employee constitutional due process rights is a hearing where the employee is given the opportunity to clear his name.although the jury found that plaintiff had been given such hearing following his termination by mayor julian,the hearing was inadequate as a matter of law.it is,of course,a basic tenet of due process that a person be given notice of and an opportunity to be heard at his hearing.those due process guarantees were not extended to plaintiff.in consequence,plaintiff is entitled to a new trial limited solely to the issue of damages incurred by plaintiff due to the city failure to provide him with an adequate hearing.
background 
plaintiff employment with the city 
plaintiff patterson,an,was appointed as codes commissioner of the city of utica in by hanna and promoted a year later to the position of commissioner of the department of public works dpw.prior to the appointment as commissioner,plaintiff had held various private sector jobs in the city but none of real authority,or that suggested that he had skills particularly suited to the posts of codes commissioner or commissioner of public works.according to the city charter,department heads,including the commissioner of the dpw,are appointed solely by the mayor.such appointees generally serve a term,but may be discharged by the mayor for any reason or no reason at all during their tenure.
beginning in plaintiff was hired,fired,and rehired three times by mayor hanna,whose treatment of patterson was,to say the least,erratic.the three hanna dismissals,which will be detailed in our discussion,occurred in april,august,and march.plaintiff final termination was undertaken by mayor julian in july,and it too will be detailed later.
activities 
following his final dismissal by mayor julian plaintiff did not try to find a new job because he thought he would be rehired.two months later he confirmed with julian office that this would not happen.plaintiff became depressed and unsuccessfully applied for a variety of jobs for which he felt qualified.in october he finally found work in glens falls,new york,miles from utica,working in a paper mill where he was employed until september.
in august,patterson began to visit julia grant,a psychiatric counselor whom he had first consulted after his august firing.she determined that the stress of his commute,the long working hours,and his depression which was caused by his negative experiences with the city were causing memory loss and a dangerous physical strain on plaintiff.these problems exacerbated a back injury plaintiff had suffered in and a head injury with resulting memory problems he had suffered in.grant submitted an affidavit to his employer in conjunction with plaintiff application for a disability accommodation.plaintiff testified that during a meeting to discuss this application the subject of his employment with the city of utica and the resulting distress was raised.also reviewed the medical report submitted by grant mentioning his problems with the city.plaintiff was fired three days after this meeting,and testified he is now forced to work in jobs requiring manual labor,which is very difficult due to his physical disabilities.
stephen patterson commenced the instant action against the city and mayor julian in november.plaintiff testified at the trial,as did mayor julian and numerous other witnesses,although former mayor hanna did not.the jury found for defendants with respect to the first amendment and racial discrimination claims.the jury also found that defendant city of utica made false,stigmatizing statements causing a loss to plaintiff stephen patterson reputation and foreclosing employment opportunities,and that such statements were made close in time to his termination s in april,august,march,or july.this verdict reflected actions taken by both mayor hanna and mayor julian.
with respect to the actions of mayor hanna,the jury found that the city failed to provide plaintiff with an opportunity for a hearing,and thereby violated his right to due process,causing him damages.with respect to the actions of mayor julian,however,the jury found that the city provided plaintiff with an opportunity for a hearing and that,therefore,neither mayor julian nor the city was liable in damages for violating plaintiff due process rights.
we proceed to analyze plaintiff claims for violation of his due process rights since,after review of the record,we agree with the district court that there were no grounds upon which to grant plaintiff motion to reinstate his first amendment and racial discrimination claims.
discussion 
i the fourteenth amendment and stigma plus 
section of title provides that every person who,under color of state law subjects any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the united states constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires that,generally,a person must be afforded the opportunity for a hearing prior to being deprived of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest.const.amend xiv,bd.of regents roth,d.
a person interest in his or her good reputation alone,apart from a more tangible interest,is not a liberty or property interest sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the due process clause or create a cause of action under.see paul davis,d morris lindau,cir.instead,when dealing with loss of reputation alone,a state law defamation action for damages is the appropriate means of vindicating that loss.davis,at.morris,at.
loss of one reputation can,however,invoke the protections of the due process clause if that loss is coupled with the deprivation of a more tangible interest,such as government employment.roth,at.valmonte bane,cir.for a government employee,a cause of action under for deprivation of a liberty interest without due process of law may arise when an alleged government defamation occurs in the course of dismissal from government employment.roth,at.morris,at.this type of claim is commonly referred to as a claim.id.
in order to fulfill the requirements of a claim arising from the termination from government employment,a plaintiff must first show that the government made stigmatizing statements about that call into question plaintiff good name,reputation,honor,or integrity.quinn syracuse model neighborhood,cir.statements that denigrate the employee competence as a professional and impugn the employee professional reputation in such a fashion as to effectively put a significant roadblock in that employee continued ability to practice his or her profession may also fulfill this requirement.donato bethpage cent.sch,cir a plaintiff generally is required only to raise the falsity of these stigmatizing statements as an issue,not prove they are false.brandt bd.of coop.educ,cir.second,a plaintiff must prove these stigmatizing statements were made public.abramson pataki,cir.and third,plaintiff must show the stigmatizing statements were made concurrently in time to plaintiff dismissal from government employment.martz.vill.of valley stream,cir five months later for publication of defamatory statements is too long.if a plaintiff successfully proves his claim,due process requires that as a remedy he be given a opportunity to clear his name.roth,at.donato,at.
ii the verdict 
having laid out the basic requirements for a claim,we now turn to an analysis of the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff based on the actions of mayors hanna and julian.as an initial matter,since the city concedes that its mayor is a official with final policymaking authority in the municipal employment area at issue in this case,the city can,pursuant to,be held liable for the actions of its mayor.see monell dep t of soc,d city of louis praprotnik,d.
appellate review of the grant or denial of a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict requires us to determine whether,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the evidence supporting the verdict is so lacking that the jury verdict could only have been the result of surmise and conjecture.see samuels air transp.local,cir.the following analysis relates the facts relevant to plaintiff procedural due process claim in the light most favorable to plaintiff with respect to the actions of mayor hanna,and in the light most favorable to defendant city with respect to the process afforded plaintiff by mayor julian.
actions by mayor hanna 
april incident.plaintiff failed to produce any evidence that the city,through the actions of mayor hanna,deprived him of a liberty interest in connection with his april termination.no stigmatizing statements were made public by hanna in the course of this termination.the record reveals that hanna accused plaintiff of bringing an affair involving city employees to hanna attention for selfish purposes.according to plaintiff,mayor hanna statement about him was made directly to him in private.thus,this statement,even if it could be categorized as stigmatizing,does not satisfy the required publication component.see bishop wood,d.
in addition,plaintiff testimony that he learned about his termination from the newspaper is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements because he failed to allege there were any defamatory or stigmatizing statements contained in the news article and,in addition,failed to produce the article as proof of any such accusation at trial.thus,with respect to plaintiff first termination,it would have been sheer surmise or conjecture on the part of the jury to conclude that any public statements,let alone stigmatizing ones,were made in the course of plaintiff termination.
august incident.four months later,in august,hanna reappointed patterson to the position of codes commissioner and in november,hanna again gave plaintiff the additional responsibility of overseeing the dpw,although plaintiff was not officially reappointed commissioner of the dpw until early.mayor hanna then began to accuse patterson of being a drug dealer.he also accused plaintiff of taking kickbacks and stealing from the city.these disparaging remarks culminated in august.at that time hanna requested plaintiff meet him on a city street called pond lane.when plaintiff arrived,mayor hanna began yelling,cursing and spitting at patterson,and accused him of being a no good drug dealer.hanna also told plaintiff that he was fired.this incident took place in front of a number of pond lane a city court had come out of their homes to investigate what was going on.none of those witnesses testified at the trial.this alleged termination of plaintiff city employment lasted for only two weeks,at which time mayor hanna asked plaintiff to return to his job as commissioner of the dpw.patterson agreed to return.
it is clear that public,stigmatizing statements that called into question plaintiff good name,reputation,honor,or integrity were made by hanna in connection with this firing.quinn,at.the evidence,proving that hanna publicly alleged that plaintiff was involved in criminal activity,was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could base a conclusion that plaintiff was publicly stigmatized.
nevertheless,plaintiff hiatus from government employment ought not,on that account,to be considered a termination for purposes of the requirements.first,plaintiff produced no evidence that he was actually taken off of the city payroll during the period for which he was dismissed.second,even if plaintiff had shown such evidence,since he began working for the city again two weeks later,his time off the job is more analogous to a suspension than a termination of employment.it can not,as a matter of law,be viewed as a significant alteration of plaintiff employment status when,in fact,he was quickly hired back in the same position from which he was supposedly fired.see davis,at.requiring significant alteration of status in order to show plus factor dobosz walsh,cir holding suspension of police officer not a sufficient plus factor to give rise to a protected liberty interest when he was later reinstated with back pay.hence,it was sheer surmise and conjecture for the jury to conclude that plaintiff proved the elements of his claim with respect to the august incident.
march incident.plaintiff served as commissioner of the dpw without incident throughout the remainder of and until early.in early the mayor,due to his rancorous relationship with the press,requested that city employees refrain from speaking individually with the press,and directed that all communications be conducted centrally through his office.in march the mayor asked plaintiff to sign a be distributed to the press in plaintiff that as many as percent of dpw employees were using illegal drugs.when patterson refused to sign,hanna convinced the deputy commissioner of the dpw to sign it instead.the memo was distributed to the media and reported in the local press.the mayor fired plaintiff because he refused to sign the memo.he then requested plaintiff not make any statements to the press about his termination or the allegations in the memo.when the media contacted plaintiff to question him about his firing and the allegations in the memo,patterson refused comment.a few hours later,hanna came to plaintiff house and took him out to lunch,thanking him for not commenting to the press.plaintiff returned to his job after lunch.
for the same reasons stated earlier with respect to the august incident,the march incident can not,as a matter of law,satisfy the requirements.the plaintiff was fired for an even shorter period of time in connection with this incident than in connection with the august incident.it was conjectural for the jury to conclude that the plaintiff had been terminated for purposes under these circumstances.
because the jury verdict was based on surmise and conjecture,the district court should have granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict with respect to the plaintiff claims arising out of the actions of mayor hanna.the plaintiff damage award was based upon the jury verdict against the city based on hanna conduct,a fact that is clear from the jury conclusion that mayor julian afforded plaintiff a hearing for his deprivation of plaintiff liberty interest.the judgment against the city must therefore be reversed,including the damage award.the case should be remanded to the district court for entry of judgment in favor of defendant city with respect to plaintiff claims pertaining to the actions of mayor hanna.
actions by mayor julian 
july termination.on july,mayor hanna unexpectedly resigned,and timothy julian,as president of the common council,succeeded him as mayor of the defendant city.because the city was hosting the annual utica internationally recognized road race drawing days after julian took office,his main concern was that the streets of utica be clean,a responsibility falling on the dpw.mayor julian testified that due to the plaintiff poor performance in connection with the race,and poor street maintenance he had observed as a private citizen,he decided to dismiss plaintiff.hence,he sent patterson a memo dated july,advising him of his termination from city employment.
statements regarding termination.on july an article in the local newspaper reported that mayor julian had asked for plaintiff resignation.this article appeared on page two of the newspaper,and quoted mayor julian as stating i want to see the dpw moving in a new direction and when you see problems with the entire unit,you look to the leadership.on the same day,the newspaper ran a front page story reporting that the city march allegations under mayor hanna of widespread drug use amongst the employees of the dpw had been found to be unsubstantiated.mayor julian was quoted as stating i am not aware of any documentation that lends credence to the allegations of drug use at dpw or substantiates them.this front page article continued onto page two with the short article about plaintiff dismissal printed in a box inside of it.the mayor testified he had spoken to the press about both of these issues on the same day,but that he was not aware that the stories would be printed in that fashion.
sometime after plaintiff termination was reported,the local chapter of the naacp contacted julian and asked if he would meet with them and other black community leaders.plaintiff was not invited to this meeting first meeting,and mayor julian testified he did not know the meeting was going to be about plaintiff termination.although there is no evidence to show exactly when this meeting took place,it must have been held after july,the date of the newspaper article reporting plaintiff termination,and before july,the date of the second meeting.patterson dismissal was the main topic of discussion before the approximately eight attendees,all of whom were members of utica community.those community leaders demanded to know why patterson had been fired.
in addition to stating that he was unhappy with plaintiff performance,mayor julian related that upon taking office,members of city government had provided him with written and oral information regarding a number of alleged incidents involving plaintiff,including a dpw vehicle being shot at,an illegal weight room in the dpw garage,a cabaret club connected with plaintiff that had an unpaid license,an outstanding city cell phone bill,and an incident where plaintiff allegedly took a payment with regard to property without having the authority to do so.julian discussed these allegations and also distributed an affidavit he had been given containing the troubling accusation related to the receipt of an unauthorized payment.the mayor testified at trial that he had not looked into the accuracy of the allegations made in the affidavit prior to distributing it,and there is no evidence that he offered plaintiff an opportunity to defend himself against any of these allegations before they were aired at the meeting.the distributed copy of the affidavit was collected before the end of the meeting.
mayor julian then held a second meeting with the same community leaders it appears one or two of the attendees at the first meeting were not present at the second meeting on july,to discuss the accusations voiced at the prior meeting.although plaintiff was not invited to or given official notice of this meeting either,he nevertheless heard about it through and chose to attend.plaintiff testified at trial that at this meeting,mayor julian asked the community members to give him a reason why he should change his mind about plaintiff firing.he also testified that the mayor mentioned the cabaret club,cell phone bill,and weight room allegations,as well as allegations that plaintiff had struck a dpw employee but that not all the accusations from the first meeting were discussed.plaintiff challenged the accusations that were raised and insisted they were all false.
after the meeting,mayor julian said he would consider reappointing plaintiff.julian testified that he did not rehire plaintiff even after patterson denied the allegations because his termination of plaintiff was based on his feeling that the job was not being done to my satisfaction,and not on the allegations accusing plaintiff of questionable behavior.contrary to the mayor recollection,a friend of plaintiff family testified at trial,however,that sometime in july he asked mayor julian why he fired plaintiff.the friend said that julian responded he had some evidence or proof that plaintiff was involved with some shady characters and that plaintiff was connected with a vehicle that had been shot at.
the jury concluded with respect to plaintiff final termination that mayor julian had made public,stigmatizing statements about plaintiff in the course of his termination,but that julian had afforded the plaintiff a hearing,and that,thus,the city could not be held accountable for any damages plaintiff suffered as a result of mayor julian actions.
establishing claim.plaintiff presented evidence the jury may have relied on to infer that mayor julian,through the use of the press,was attempting to pin partial responsibility for the false allegations of drug use at the dpw on plaintiff shoulders.there is no requirement that in order to succeed on a claim a plaintiff must produce an explicit public statement by a municipal official accusing the discharged employee of immor
