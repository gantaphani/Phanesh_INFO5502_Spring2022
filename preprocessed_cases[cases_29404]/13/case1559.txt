faiz shabazz petitioner appeals from the april,order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sterling johnson,district judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to.the district court granted a certificate of appealability to examine whether the state court erred in holding that the kings county district attorney office violated petitioner rights under brady maryland,d by promising three prosecution witnesses leniency in their pending criminal cases in exchange for their testimony at petitioner trial without disclosing these alleged promises to petitioner and allowing witnesses to testify falsely concerning the nature of their plea agreements their expectations of receiving favorable treatment in exchange for their testimony.we find no basis to disturb the state court factual finding that the kings county district attorney office made no undisclosed promises to florence boone,louis landers,or sylvia pullum.we also find no evidence that landers and pullum committed perjury when they testified that they had no expectation of favorable treatment or,if they did,that the kings county district attorney office knew or should have known about their perjury.accordingly,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
on january,at approximately,florence boone and a woman known as candy went to the apartment of van adams troutman to purchase narcotics while petitioner waited with chester turner and a man known as tango downstairs in a parked automobile.louis landers and sylvia pullum were among those present in the apartment.after purchasing narcotics and meeting petitioner at his car,boone and candy returned to the apartment under the pretense of needing to use the restroom.boone and candy went into the restroom and exited shortly thereafter,at which time boone drew a gun and announced that she intended to rob the apartment.after troutman pushed candy,boone shot and killed him petitioner and turner then entered the apartment,collected the money and narcotics,and fled with boone and candy.
petitioner was arrested on february.the next day,landers and pullum identified petitioner from a lineup.boone was also arrested,but the kings county district attorney office district attorney office agreed to recommend a term of incarceration of eight and to years if she pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and testified truthfully against petitioner.boone accepted the plea arrangement.at her plea allocution,which occurred prior to petitioner trial,boone told the court that she received the gun from candy.
on march,landers and pullum were arrested and charged with various narcotics offenses.both refused the district attorney office initial plea offer to recommend sentences of one to three years imprisonment.however,the court released landers and pullum on their own recognizance and said,i understand there is some possibility that you may be getting some kind of break.if you do come back to court,you wo get the break.the court subsequently issued bench warrants for their arrests after they failed to make their court appearances.in the process of executing the bench warrants,police discovered landers and pullum in possession of controlled substances,drug paraphernalia,and stolen credit cards.accordingly,they were charged with additional offenses.at the time of petitioner trial,both landers and pullum were incarcerated while awaiting trial for their own offenses.
petitioner trial began on april.boone testified that she had agreed with petitioner to participate in the robbery and that petitioner had provided her with the gun.in his opening statement,district attorney christopher ulrich informed the jury that boone had been promised the maximum sentence of eight and to years imprisonment if she pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree and testified truthfully at petitioner trial.boone admitted during her testimony that she cooperated with the district attorney office in order to receive the more lenient sentence associated with the charge of manslaughter in the first degree.boone also testified that she expected to receive the maximum penalty associated with that charge.
landers and pullum identified petitioner as one of the two men who entered the apartment after the shooting.both witnesses testified that the district attorney office had not promised them leniency with respect to their pending cases in exchange for their testimony.landers and pullum also testified that they did not expect to receive a benefit by virtue of their testimony against petitioner.
on,the three witnesses admitted to having serious drug habits.landers and boone testified that they were under the influence of narcotics when the shooting occurred.landers and pullum testified that they had taken cocaine and heroin the night they identified petitioner in the lineup.landers testified that he initially lied to the police about his whereabouts at the time of the shooting.moreover,landers and pullum testified to other facts that called into question the reliability of their eyewitness identifications.landers admitted that,after identifying petitioner in the lineup,he recanted his identification and then reversed his recantation.pullum testified that she could not identify petitioner from a photograph shortly after the incident.however,pullum testified that she was able to identify petitioner from the lineup approximately one month later.
the jury convicted petitioner on april,and the court sentenced him to a term of years to life imprisonment.four days after petitioner was convicted,the district attorney office recommended that the court release landers and pullum from custody on their own recognizance.shortly afterwards,landers pleaded guilty to his pending charges,and the judge noted that landers had made a lot of deals here.ulrich,who also prosecuted petitioner,recommended a sentence of sixty days imprisonment.as landers had already served days in prison,the court sentenced him to time served plus five years probation.pullum also pleaded guilty.after consulting ulrich,the assistant district attorney prosecuting pullum case recommended an unconditional discharge,and the sentencing court accepted the recommendation.
boone was sentenced on september.although her plea agreement provided for a sentence of eight and to years imprisonment,the sentencing court stated that a term of seven to years of imprisonment would be fair and asked the district attorney office to consent to the lesser sentence.ulrich informed the court that boone was not entitled to the reduction,but acceded to the court request.
after exhausting his direct appeals,petitioner filed a motion in state court to vacate the judgment of conviction and dismiss the indictment,pursuant to new york criminal procedure law.petitioner argued that the district attorney office made undisclosed promises of leniency to boone,landers,and pullum in exchange for their testimony.petitioner also argued that landers and pullum committed perjury when they testified that they received no promises of leniency and expected no benefits as a result of their cooperation,and that ulrich knew or should have known about this alleged perjury.
new york supreme court justice ruth moskowitz,who presided over petitioner trial,conducted an evidentiary hearing on june.ulrich testified that the only promise he made to boone was to recommend a sentence of eight and to years imprisonment.ulrich testified that he may have recommended leniency for landers and pullum based upon their truthful testimony against petitioner.however,ulrich testified that he made no promises to landers or pullum concerning their pending cases prior to their testimony at petitioner trial.
the state court issued a comprehensive written order denying petitioner motion on december.the state court found that the district attorney office had made no undisclosed promises of leniency to boone.although boone received a sentence that was different from the one provided by the plea agreement,the court found that the issue arose for the first time at boone sentencing and that the district attorney office had not requested additional leniency on her behalf.
the state court also found that while landers and pullum received favorable treatment due to their cooperation,there was nothing to suggest that the district attorney office procured their testimony by promising them leniency with respect to their pending criminal cases.the court accepted the truth of ulrich testimony and concluded that the judges references to breaks and deals were insufficient to establish that the district attorney office had made actual promises of leniency.the state court concluded that,i n all likelihood,the judges simply assumed that landers and pullum had agreed to cooperate with the district attorney office in exchange for lenient sentences.
after the new york supreme court,appellate division,second department denied petitioner leave to appeal on july,petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on april.petitioner initially argued that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress landers and pullum identification the prosecution failed to disclose that two of its witnesses would receive favorable treatment in pending cases in exchange for their testimony and the prosecution knowingly used perjured testimony of cooperating witnesses.the district court dismissed the petition as,but this court vacated the dismissal and remanded the case on september.on remand,petitioner withdrew the first and second grounds for his petition.petitioner also filed a memorandum of law alleging that he has established by clear and convincing evidence that pretrial deals existed with landers,pullum,and boone and that the state court decision was an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent and the prosecution failure to disclose promises to its three chief witnesses requires that the petition be granted.on august,magistrate judge lois bloom issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court deny petitioner claims.the district court denied the petition on april,and granted a certificate of appealability on may.
legal standards 
i.the issues on appeal 
at the outset,we specify which issues are properly part of this appeal.petitioner requested a certificate of appealability by submitting a letter to the district court requesting the right to appeal the court ruling on his claim.the district court simply wrote on the letter petitioner request that this court issue a certificate of appealability pursuant to is granted.
we will consider only whether the state court erred in holding that the district attorney office violated petitioner rights under brady maryland,d by promising three prosecution witnesses leniency in their pending criminal cases in exchange for their testimony at petitioner trial without disclosing these alleged promises to petitioner and allowing three witnesses to testify falsely concerning the nature of their plea agreements their expectations of receiving favorable treatment in exchange for their testimony.petitioner raised these issues before the state court,appealed the state court ruling to the appellate division,and asserted the same issues in the instant habeas petition.
petitioner brief on appeal to this court,however,could be interpreted to assert additional claims.petitioner alleges that the district attorney office failed to disclose that boone testified at her plea allocution that candy,rather than petitioner,gave her the gun that she used to shoot troutman.petitioner argues that t his statement is exculpatory since the prosecution maintained that it was appellant who the robbery.petitioner also argues that boone testimony at her plea allocution was impeachment material,as it was inconsistent with her subsequent testimony at trial,that petitioner gave her the gun.thus,petitioner asserts a brady claim based upon the district attorney office alleged failure to make available the transcript of boone plea allocution.
petitioner also asserts a brady claim based upon allegations that the district attorney office knowingly allowed pullum to testify falsely that she was innocent with respect to the charges pending against her she declined an offer of one year probation she did not know that the pending charges against her carried a maximum term of years imprisonment and the judge in her case was unaware that she was a cooperating witness in the case against petitioner.
finally,petitioner asserts a brady claim based upon the district attorney office alleged failure to disclose the state courts references to landers and pullum receiving breaks or deals.while petitioner uses this comment to attempt to demonstrate clear error with respect to the state court finding that there were no undisclosed promises,he also argues that the district attorney office had an obligation to disclose these comments under gordon united states.in that case,the supreme court held that the jury should have heard that the district court,while accepting the guilty plea of a defendant who subsequently testified against his,suggested that the defendant should demonstrate that he had cooperated with law enforcement.id.at.petitioner argues that,as in gordon,landers and pullum were informed prior to his trial that they may receive a break,and,thus,his jury was entitled to weigh what effect those words had on them when determining their credibility.
although this court has the authority to amend a certificate of appealability,see cotto herbert,cir,we decline to consider petitioner additional claims,as he failed to raise them before the district court.see singleton wulff,d.while petitioner cited gordon in his objections to judge bloom report and recommendation,he did so in the context of arguing that the prosecution can not avoid its duty to disclose by keeping its promises to a witness general,citing dubose lefevre,cir,which he claimed was a logical application of existing supreme court precedent announced in gordon united states.even were we to interpret petitioner reference to gordon as an assertion of a brady claim based upon the district attorney office failure to disclose the courts comments,petitioner did not exhaust his state remedies with respect to this claim or his additional claims.if anything is settled in habeas corpus jurisprudence,it is that a federal court may not grant the habeas petition of a state prisoner unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state aparicio artuz,cir citing b internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we decline to consider additional issues that are predicated upon stray allegations in petitioner brief.it would be helpful when a district court grants a certificate of appealability,if it would issue a separate order that states with specificity the issues it intends to certify for appeal to this court.c the certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right required by paragraph.
ii.the deferential standard of 
we review a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.see kennaugh miller,cir,cert.denied,d.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,codified at,the standard governing federal habeas review depends upon whether the petitioner claims have been previously adjudicated on the merits by a state court.cotto,at.we have held that a state court adjudicates a petitioner federal constitutional claims on the merits when it states that it is disposing of the claims on the merits and reduces its disposition to judgment.see also ryan miller,cir.in the instant case,justice moskowitz addressed the merits of petitioner claims while making detailed findings of facts and conclusions of law.the court also reduced its judgment to a comprehensive written order.as the state court adjudicated petitioner claims on the merits,we apply the deferential standard of review prescribed by aedpa specifically,the statute provides that 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the supreme court has interpreted d as giving independent meaning to both the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if it arrives at a conclusion that contradicts that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from those of relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at an opposite result.id.at.a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law if a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of a prisoner case.id.at.moreover,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.
whether cooperation agreements exist between the prosecution and its witnesses is a factual determination.see,wedra thomas,cir.a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.e.the petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.see also mckinney artuz,cir citations omitted.this presumption of correctness is particularly important when reviewing the trial court assessment of witness credibility.see cotto,at see also cockrell,d.however,e ven in the context of federal habeas,deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review a federal court can disagree with a state court credibility determination and,when guided by aedpa,conclude the decision was unreasonable or that the factual premise was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence.at.in sum,d eference does not by definition preclude relief.id.
iii.brady maryland 
t he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.brady maryland,d.under brady and its progeny,the government has a due process obligation to disclose to the defendant its knowledge of material evidence favorable to the defendant either because it is exculpatory or because it can serve to impeach a key witness.see kyles whitley,d.impeachment evidence includes promises that the prosecution makes to key witnesses in exchange for their testimony.giglio united states,d.
in order for evidence to be material within the meaning of brady,a defendant does not need to show that the evidence,if disclosed,would have resulted in his acquittal rather,he needs to show only that the evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.united states schwarz,cir per curiam quoting kyles,at.the supreme court has identified three distinct situations in which a brady claim might arise first,where previously undisclosed evidence revealed that the prosecution introduced trial testimony that it knew or should have known was perjured second,where the government failed to accede to a defense request for disclosure of some specific kind of exculpatory evidence and third,where the government failed to volunteer exculpatory evidence never requested,or requested only in a general way.kyles,at.internal citations omitted.
discussion 
petitioner does not dispute that the district attorney office disclosed that boone pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree and was promised a sentence of eight and to years imprisonment in exchange for her cooperation.instead,petitioner argues that the district attorney office made an additional undisclosed promise of leniency to boone based upon the fact that the court actually sentenced her to a term of imprisonment that was more lenient than the one provided by the plea agreement.
petitioner argument is meritless.the state court found that there was no discussion of a lesser sentence for boone until her sentencing,which occurred approximately five months after she testified in petitioner case.the state court also found that the district attorney office did not request leniency on behalf of boone.rather,the state court found that the sentencing court suggested that a term of imprisonment of seven to years would be fair and asked ulrich to consent to the lesser sentence.our own review of the record indicates that boone counsel initially requested a reduced sentence without the district attorney office assistance or consent.
petitioner proffers no evidence of any undisclosed promises between the district attorney office and boone.petitioner argues that ulrich consented to the lenient sentence in light of boone cooperation.this may be true.however,the issue is not whether boone eventually received favorable treatment because she testified at petitioner trial.the relevant inquiry is whether the district attorney office made an undisclosed promise of additional leniency in exchange for boone cooperation.contrary to petitioner argument,the mere fact that ulrich acceded to the sentencing court request does not provide sufficient evidence of any such promise.
petitioner offers no evidence demonstrating that the state court findings of fact are clearly erroneous.upon reviewing the record,we conclude that they are,in fact,correct.we also note that,while ulrich consented to the sentencing court request,he informed the court that boone was not entitled to the reduction.accordingly,petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus on this ground is denied 
ii.landers and pullum 
a.the alleged existence of undisclosed promises of leniency 
petitioner argues that the district attorney office made undisclosed promises of leniency to landers and pullum with respect to their pending criminal cases in exchange for their testimony at his trial.however,petitioner cites insufficient evidence to disturb the trial court factual finding that the district attorney office made no such promises to landers and pullum.
christopher ulrich,who prosecuted petitioner case,testified at the state court evidentiary hearing on petitioner motion for relief under new york criminal procedure law.ulrich testified that he made no promises to landers and pullum in exchange for their testimony.in fact,ulrich testified that he explicitly informed landers and pullum that there would be no promises with respect to the dispositions of their pending cases.justice moskowitz,who also presided over petitioner criminal trial,accepted the truth of ulrich testimony.credibility determinations are properly within the province of the state court that presided over the trial and evidentiary hearing.see patton yount,d united states yousef,cir.while d eference does not by definition preclude relief.at,we see no basis for finding that the state court clearly erred by accepting ulrich testimony.
petitioner also relies upon the fact that landers and pullum criminal cases were repeatedly adjourned until after his trial.while the case status and action reports reveal that the district attorney office intended to dispose of these cases after landers and pullum testified at petitioner trial,the adjournments themselves do not evidence that the district attorney office promised these witnesses leniency in exchange for their cooperation,as both sides had independent incentives to resolve these cases after petitioner trial.
landers and pullum attorneys had an interest in seeking the adjournments so that they could argue at sentencing that their clients cooperation warranted leniency.attorney barry weiss,who represented pullum,testified bef
