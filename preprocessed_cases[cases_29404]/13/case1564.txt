background 
rondout is a new york corporation with its principal place of business in poughkeepsie,new york.rondout performs electrical contract work for projects in both the public and private sector.it employs approximately electricians.approximately percent of rondout electrical work is on public work projects,and percent is on private projects.
the annualization regulation implements section of the new york labor law which was designed to insure that employees on public works projects were paid wages equivalent to the prevailing rate of similarly employed workers in the locality.burgio campofelice,nys dep t of labor,cir.the prevailing wage rate is determined annually by the fiscal officer,as defined within the statute,pursuant to section.lab.law.section was designed to implement article i,section of the new york constitution,which provides that n o laborer,worker or mechanic in the employ of a contractor or engaged in the performance of any public work shall be paid less than the rate of wages prevailing in the same trade or occupation in the locality within the state where such public work is to be situated,erected or used.const.
as originally enacted,section was silent on the issue of fringe benefits,allowing employers who provided no such benefits to underbid those that did.burgio,at.in,the statute was amended to require that all bidders for public work contracts assume the cost of prevailing wage supplements in the locality.id.citing lab law.the prevailing wage rate is now calculated to include not only the hourly cash wages paid to workers,but also to include supplements.hmi mech.mcgowan,cir.supplements are defined as all remuneration for employment paid in any medium other than cash,or reimbursement for expenses,or any payments which are not wages within the meaning of the law,including,but not limited to,health,welfare,disability,retirement,vacation benefits,holiday pay,life insurance,and apprenticeship training.lab.law b.this amendment presumably put all bidders on an even footing.state dep t of labor,cir.
the hourly value of supplements is calculated by dol according to the annualization regulation,which provides 
to determine the hourly cash equivalent of any applicable supplement provided to or on behalf of laborers,workers and mechanics employed upon public work projects in accordance with subdivision a of this section,the commissioner of labor will divide the actual contribution or cost for providing such supplement by the total annual hours worked on both public and private work,where such proof is provided to the commission of labor by the employer 
regs.tit,d.contractors may pay supplements to a fund that pays benefits to the employee,including a qualifying erisa plan as a cash payment to the employees in lieu of payment to a benefit plan or in any combination thereof as long as the total payment is not less than the total prevailing wage supplements.regs.tit,a.
if it determines that wages or supplements are due,dol requires that the public entity owing payment to the contractor withhold such payment in an amount sufficient to satisfy the wages and supplements,including interest and any civil penalty that may be assessed pending a final determination.lab.law a.after ordering the withholding,dol commences an investigation and schedules an administrative hearing on the matter.id.at c.
since january,rondout has maintained an erisa prevailing wage pension and annuity plan plan for the benefit of its laborers,workers,and machinists employed on public work projects.for each hour during the plan year that an eligible rondout employee works on a public work project,rondout contributes to that plan an amount equal to the hourly prevailing wage supplement specified by the commissioner.however,the annualization regulation requires rondout to pay the supplement in respect of hours worked by its employees on private projects as well as public work projects this is the purpose of the regulation and the ground on which rondout argues preemption.because rondout pays no supplement for hours worked on private projects,workers receive less than they would under the annualization regulation.
rondout contribution for the benefit of an individual employee is solely for the benefit of that employee.each eligible employee has a,individual account within the plan,which vests immediately.none of the contributions that rondout makes to an employee account within the plan are used to obtain benefits for individuals other than the eligible employee on whose behalf the payments were made.
on december,dol issued four separate notice of labor law inspection findings to rondout,alleging that rondout had underpaid prevailing wages and supplements to its employees on public work projects.dol also issued notices to each public agency with which rondout had a contract to withhold money from its payment pending the outcome of an administrative hearing on the underpayment claims.after dol scheduled an administrative hearing with respect to its investigations,rondout filed this action,alleging that the benefits annualization regulation violates federal law.rondout argues that the formula set forth in the annualization regulation is preempted by the nlra,et,under the doctrine of machinists preemption,because,as applied,it impermissibly interferes with the equality of bargaining power between labor and management on both private and public work projects.rondout argues further that it affects adversely the competitive position of contractors within the private marketplace.the district court granted rondout motion for summary judgment,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.mandell county of suffolk,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if it can be established that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.sheppard beerman,cir internal citations omitted.the material facts in this action are not in dispute.
the issue on appeal is whether the annualization regulation is preempted by the nlra.pursuant to this regulation,dol determines the hourly cash equivalent of any applicable supplement paid to workers covered by the law by dividing the annual contribution,or the cost of providing such a supplement,by the total number of hours worked by employees on both public and private work.regs.tit,d hmi,at.in other words,dol determines a contractor compliance with the annualization regulation by calculating the hourly cash equivalent of public work supplements that contractors pay by dividing the actual cash value of a contractor supplement contribution,by the total number of hours employees work annually on both public and private jobs.id.the annualization regulation is designed to discourage contractors from paying supplements,owed to employees for public work,into an employee benefit plan that also provides benefits to employees for private work,a practice commonly known as pooling.this practice dilutes the value of the supplements paid into the plan on behalf of the employee for work done on public works.id.at.
