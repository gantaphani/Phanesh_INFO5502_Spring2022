the america invents act creates an agency procedure called inter partes review that allows a third party to ask the patent and trademark office to reexamine the claims in an patent and to cancel any claim that the agency finds to be unpatentable in light of prior art.the act,as relevant here,provides that the patent office decision whether to institute an inter partes review shall be final and,d,and grants the patent office authority to issue regulations establishing and governing inter partes review,a.a patent office regulation issued pursuant to that authority provides that,during inter partes review,a patent claim shall be given its broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it appears.cfr b.
in,garmin international,and garmin usa,sought inter partes review of all claims of a patent held by petitioner cuozzo speed technologies,llc,asserting,among other things,that claim was obvious in light of three prior patents.the patent office agreed to review claim.it also decided to reexamine claims and on that same ground because it determined those claims to be logically linked to the obviousness challenge to claim.the patent office,through its patent trial and appeal board,concluded that the claims were obvious in light of prior art,denied for reasons of futility cuozzo motion to amend the claims,and canceled all three claims.
cuozzo appealed to the federal circuit.cuozzo claimed that the patent office improperly instituted inter partes review with respect to claims and,and it alleged that the board improperly used the broadest reasonable construction standard to interpret the claims rather than the standard used by courts,which gives claims their ordinary meaning as understood by a person of skill in the art,phillips awh.the federal circuit rejected both arguments.it reasoned that d made the patent office decision to institute inter partes review nonappealable,and it concluded that the patent office regulation was a reasonable exercise of the agency rulemaking authority.
section d bars cuozzo challenge to the patent office decision to institute inter partes review.
a the text of d expressly states that the patent office determinations whether to institute inter partes review shall be final and nonappealable.moreover,construing d to permit judicial review of the patent office preliminary decision to institute inter partes review undercuts the important congressional objective of giving the agency significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.past practice in respect to related proceedings,including the predecessor to inter partes review,also supports the conclusion that congress did not intend for courts to review these initial determinations.finally,reading d as limited to interlocutory appeals would render the provision largely superfluous in light of the administrative procedure act.
b the strong presumption favoring judicial review,mach mining,llc eeoc,is overcome here by these clear and convincing indications that congress intended to bar review,block community nutrition institute.given that presumption,however,the interpretation adopted here applies to cases in which the challenge is to the patent office determination to initiate an inter partes review under this section,or where the challenge consists of questions closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to that determination.cuozzo claim does not implicate a constitutional question,nor does it present other questions of interpretation that reach well beyond this section in terms of scope and impact.rather,cuozzo allegation that garmin petition did not plead with particularity the challenge to claims and as required by is little more than a challenge to the patent office conclusion under a that the information presented in the petition warranted review.
the patent office regulation requiring the board to apply the broadest reasonable construction standard to interpret patent claims is a reasonable exercise of the rulemaking authority granted to the patent office by statute.
a where a statute leaves a gap or is ambiguous,this court typically interprets a congressional grant of rulemaking authority as giving the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text,nature,and purpose of the statute.united states mead,chevron natural resources defense council.here,the statute grants the patent office the authority to issue regulations governing inter partes review,and no statutory provision unambiguously mandates a particular claim construction standard.
the patent office rulemaking authority is not limited to procedural regulations.analogies to interpretations of other congressional grants of rulemaking authority in other statutes,which themselves do not unambiguously contain a limitation to procedural rules,can not magically render unambiguous the different language in the different statutory grant of rulemaking authority at issue.
the nature and purpose of inter partes review does not unambiguously require the patent office to apply one particular claim construction standard.cuozzo contention that the purpose of inter partes review to establish procedures for reviewing previously issued patents supports the application of the ordinary meaning standard ignores the fact that in other significant respects,inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding.this indicates that congress designed a hybrid proceeding.the purpose of inter partes review is not only to resolve disputes among parties,but also to protect the public paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope.precision instrument automotive maintenance machinery.neither the statute language,nor its purpose,nor its legislative history suggests that congress decided what standard should apply in inter partes review.
b the regulation is a reasonable exercise of the patent office rulemaking authority.the broadest reasonable construction standard helps ensure precision in drafting claims and prevents a patent from tying up too much knowledge,which,in turn,helps members of the public draw useful information from the disclosed invention and understand the lawful limits of the claim.the patent office has used this standard for more than years and has applied it in proceedings which,as here,resemble district court litigation.
cuozzo two arguments in response are unavailing.applying the broadest reasonable construction standard in inter partes review is not,as cuozzo suggests,unfair to a patent holder,who may move to amend at least once in the review process,and who has had several opportunities to amend in the original application process.and though the application of one standard in inter partes review and another in district court proceedings may produce inconsistent outcomes,that structure is inherent to congress regulatory design,and it is also consistent with past practice,as the patent system has long provided different tracks for the review and adjudication of patent claims.the patent office regulation is reasonable,and this court does not decide whether a better alternative exists as a matter of policy.

the america invents act,et,creates a process called inter partes review.that review process allows a third party to ask the patent and trademark office to reexamine the claims in an patent and to cancel any claim that the agency finds to be unpatentable in light of prior art.see requiring novel ty disqualifying claims that are obvious 
we consider two provisions of the act.the first says 
no appeal.the determination by the director of the patent office whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and.d.
does this provision bar a court from considering whether the patent office wrongly determin ed to institute an inter partes review,when it did so on grounds not specifically mentioned in a third party review request 
the second provision grants the patent office the authority to issue

we conclude that the first provision,though it may not bar consideration of a constitutional question,for example,does bar judicial review of the kind of claim at issue here,involving the patent office decision to institute inter partes review.we also conclude that the second provision authorizes the patent office to issue the regulation before us.see,united states mead,chevron natural resources defense council.
an inventor obtains a patent by applying to the patent office.a patent examiner with expertise in the relevant field reviews an applicant patent claims,considers the prior art,and determines whether each claim meets the applicable patent law requirements.see.then,the examiner accepts a claim,or rejects it and explains why.see a.
if the examiner rejects a claim,the applicant can resubmit a narrowed or otherwise modified claim,which the examiner will consider anew,measuring the new claim against the same patent law requirements.if the examiner rejects the new claim,the inventor typically has yet another chance to respond with yet another amended claim.ultimately,the patent office makes a final decision allowing or rejecting the application.the applicant may seek judicial review of any final rejection.see a.
for several decades,the patent office has also possessed the authority to reexamine and perhaps cancel a patent claim that it had previously allowed.in,for example,congress enacted a statute providing for ex parte reexamination.act to amend the patent and trademark laws,et.that statute which remains in effect gives a ny person at any time the right to file a request for reexamination on the basis of certain prior art bearing on the patentability of an patent.a.if the patent office concludes that the cited prior art raises a substantial new question of patentability,the agency can reexamine the patent.a.and that reexamination can lead the patent office to cancel the patent or some of its claims.alternatively,the director of the patent office can,on her own initiative,trigger such a proceeding.ibid.and,as with examination,the patent holder can seek judicial review of an adverse final decision.
in and,congress enacted statutes that established another,similar procedure,known as inter partes reexamination.those statutes granted third parties greater opportunities to participate in the patent office reexamination proceedings as well as in any appeal of a patent office decision.see,american inventors protection act of,et ed.superseded.
in,congress enacted the statute before us.that statute modifies inter partes reexamination,which it now calls inter partes review.see,pt.like inter partes reexamination,any third party can ask the agency to initiate inter partes review of a patent claim.but the new statute has changed the standard that governs the patent office institution of the agency process.instead of requiring that a request for reexamination raise a substantial new question of patentability,it now requires that a petition show a reasonable likelihood that the challenger would prevail.compare a ed.repealed with a ed.
the new statute provides a challenger with broader participation rights.it creates within the patent office a patent trial and appeal board board composed of administrative patent judges,who are patent lawyers and former patent examiners,among others.that board conducts the proceedings,reaches a conclusion,and sets forth its reasons.see ibid.
the statute sets forth time limits for completing this review.a.it grants the patent office the authority to issue rules.a.like its predecessors,the statute authorizes judicial review of a final written decision canceling a patent claim.and,the statute says that the agency initial decision whether to institute an inter partes review is final and nonappealable.d compare ibid.with a,c ed.repealed the determination that a petition for inter partes reexamination raise s a substantial new question of patentability is final and and c ed.similar in respect to ex parte reexamination.
in,giuseppe cuozzo applied for a patent covering a speedometer that will show a driver when he is driving above the speed limit.to understand the basic idea,think of the fact that a white speedometer needle will look red when it passes under a translucent piece of red glass or the equivalent say,red cellophane.if you attach a piece of red glass or red cellophane to a speedometer beginning at miles per hour,then,when the white needle passes that point,it will look red.if we attach the red glass to a plate that can itself rotate,if we attach the plate to the speedometer,if we connect the plate to a global positioning system gps receiver,and if we enter onto a chip or a disk all the speed limits on all the nation roads,then the gps can signal where the car is,the chip or disk can signal the speed limit at that place,and the plate can rotate to the right number on the speedometer.thus,if the speed limit is miles per hour,then the white speedometer needle will pass under the red plate at,not,and the driver will know if he is driving too fast.

petitioner cuozzo speed technologies,llc cuozzo,now holds the rights to the cuozzo patent.in,garmin international,and garmin usa,filed a petition seeking inter partes review of the cuozzo patent claims.garmin backed up its request by stating,for example,that the invention described in claim was obvious in light of three prior patents,the aumayer,evans,and wendt patents.patent patent and patent.goodyear tire rubber,black,dissenting s omeone,somewhere,sometime,made th is discovery but i can not agree that this patentee is that discoverer 
the board agreed to reexamine claim,as well as claims and.the board recognized that garmin had not expressly challenged claim and claim on the same obviousness ground.but,believing that claim depends on claim which depends on claim,the board reasoned that garmin had implicitly challenged claims and on the basis of the same prior inventions,and it consequently decided to review all three claims together.app.to pet.for cert.
after proceedings before the board,it concluded that claims,and of the cuozzo patent were obvious in light of the earlier patents to which garmin had referred.the board explained that the aumayer patent makes use of a gps receiver to determine the applicable speed limit at that location for display,the evans patent describes a colored plate for indicating the speed limit,and the wendt patent describes us ing a rotatable pointer for indicating the applicable speed limit.at.anyone,the board reasoned,who is not an automaton anyone with ordinary skill and ordinary creativity could have taken the automated approach suggested by the aumayer patent and applied it to the manually adjustable signals described in the evans and wendt patents,at.the board also concluded that cuozzo proposed amendments would not cure this defect,at,and it consequently denied cuozzo motion to amend its claims.ultimately,it ordered claims,and of the cuozzo patent canceled,at.
cuozzo appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.cuozzo argued that the patent office improperly instituted inter partes review,at least in respect to claims and,because the agency found that garmin had only implicitly challenged those two claims on the basis of the aumayer,evans,and wendt patents,while the statute required petitions to set forth the grounds for challenge with particularity.a.cuozzo also argued that the board,when construing the claims,improperly used the interpretive standard set forth in the patent office regulation,it gave those claims their broadest reasonable construction,cfr b,when it should have applied the standard that courts normally use when judging a patent validity,it should have given those claims their ordinary meaning as understood by a person of skill in the art,phillips awh,ca fed.en banc.
a divided panel of the court of appeals rejected both arguments.first,the panel majority pointed out that d made the decision to institute inter partes review nonappealable.in re cuozzo speed technologies,llc,ca fed.internal quotation marks omitted.second,the panel majority affirmed the application of the broadest reasonable construction standard on the ground among others that the regulation was a reasonable,and hence lawful,exercise of the patent office statutorily granted rulemaking authority,at see a.by a vote of to,the court of appeals denied cuozzo petition for rehearing en banc.in re cuozzo speed technologies,llc,ca fed.
we granted cuozzo petition for certiorari to review these two questions.
like the court of appeals,we believe that cuozzo contention that the patent office unlawfully initiated its agency review is not appealable.for one thing,that is what d says.it states that the determination by the patent office whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.emphasis added.
for another,the legal dispute at issue is an ordinary dispute about the application of certain relevant patent statutes concerning the patent office decision to institute inter partes review.cuozzo points to a related statutory section,which says that petitions must be pleaded with particularity.those words,in its view,mean that the petition should have specifically said that claims and are also obvious in light of this same prior art.garmin petition,the government replies,need not have mentioned claims and separately,for claims,and are all logically linked the claims rise and fall together,and a petition need not simply repeat the same argument expressly when it is so obviously implied.see,at.in our view,the no appeal provision language must,at the least,forbid an appeal that attacks a determination whether to institute review by raising this kind of legal question and little more.d.
moreover,a contrary holding would undercut one important congressional objective,namely,giving the patent office significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.see,at,explaining that the statute seeks to improve patent quality and restore confidence in the presumption of validity that comes with issued patents cong.rec.remarks of goodlatte noting that inter partes review screen s out bad patents while bolstering valid ones we doubt that congress would have granted the patent office this authority,including,for example,the ability to continue proceedings even after the original petitioner settles and drops out,a,if it had thought that the agency final decision could be unwound under some minor statutory technicality related to its preliminary decision to institute inter partes review.
further,the existence of similar provisions in this,and related,patent statutes reinforces our conclusion.see limiting appellate review to the final written decision c ed.repealed the determination that a petition for inter partes reexamination raise s a substantial new question of patentability is final and see also c ed.in re hiniker,ca fed.section is directed toward the patent office authority to institute a reexamination,and there is no provision granting us direct review of that decision 
the dissent,like the panel dissent in the court of appeals,would limit the scope of the no appeal provision to interlocutory appeals,leaving a court free to review the initial decision to institute review in the context of the agency final decision.post,at,alito,concurring in part and dissenting in part,at newman,dissenting.we can not accept this interpretation.it reads into the provision a limitation to interlocutory decisions that the language nowhere mentions and that is unnecessary.the administrative procedure act already limits review to final agency decisions.the patent office decision to initiate inter partes review is preliminary,not final.ibid.and the agency decision to deny a petition is a matter committed to the patent office discretion.see a a no mandate to institute review see also post,at,and.so,read as limited to such preliminary and discretionary decisions,the no appeal provision would seem superfluous.the dissent also suggests that its approach is a familiar practice,consistent with other areas of law.post,at.but the kind of initial determination at issue here that there is a reasonable likelihood that the claims are unpatentable on the grounds asserted is akin to decisions which,in other contexts,we have held to be unreviewable.see kaley united states,slip,at the grand jury gets to say without any review,oversight,or whether probable cause exists to think that a person committed a crime 
we recognize the strong presumption in favor of judicial review that we apply when we interpret statutes,including statutes that may limit or preclude review.mach mining,llc eeoc,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.this presumption,however,may be overcome by clear and convincing indications,drawn from specific language,specific legislative history,and inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole,that congress intended to bar review.block community nutrition institute.that standard is met here.the dissent disagrees,and it points to lindahl office of personnel management,to support its view that,in light of this presumption,d should be read to permit judicial review of any issue bearing on the patent office preliminary decision to institute inter partes review.see post,at.lindahl is a case about the judicial review of disability determinations for federal employees.we explained that a statute directing the office of personnel management to determine questions of disability,and making those decisions final,conclusive,and not subject to review,barred a court from revisiting the factual underpinnings of disability determinations though it permitted courts to consider claims alleging,for example,that the office of personnel management substantial ly depart ed from important procedural rights.at.thus,lindahl interpretation of that statute preserved the agency primacy over its core statutory function in accord with congress intent.our interpretation of the no appeal provision here has the same effect.congress has told the patent office to determine whether inter partes review should proceed,and it has made the agency decision final and nonappealable.d.our conclusion that courts may not revisit this initial determination gives effect to this statutory command.moreover,lindahl conclusion was consistent with prior judicial practice in respect to those factual agency determinations,and legislative history strongly suggest ed that congress intended to preserve this prior practice,at.these features,as explained above,also support our interpretation the text of the no appeal provision,along with its place in the overall statutory scheme,its role alongside the administrative procedure act,the prior interpretation of similar patent statutes,and congress purpose in crafting inter partes review,all point in favor of precluding review of the patent office institution decisions.
nevertheless,in light of d own text and the presumption favoring review,we emphasize that our interpretation applies where the grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter partes review consist of questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the patent office decision to initiate inter partes review.see d barring appeals of determinations to initiate an inter partes review under this section emphasis added.this means that we need not,and do not,decide the precise effect of d on appeals that implicate constitutional questions,that depend on other less closely related statutes,or that present other questions of interpretation that reach,in terms of scope and impact,well beyond this section.johnson robison,statute precluding review of any question of law or fact under any law administered by the veterans administration does not bar review of constitutional challenges emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted traynor turnage,that same statute does not bar review of decisions made under different statutes enacted at other times.thus,contrary to the dissent suggestion,we do not categorically preclude review of a final decision where a petition fails to give sufficient notice such that there is a due process problem with the entire proceeding,nor does our interpretation enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits by,for example,canceling a patent claim for indefiniteness under in inter partes review.post,at.such shenanigans may be properly reviewable in the context of and under the administrative procedure act,which enables reviewing courts to set aside agency action that is contrary to constitutional right,in excess of statutory jurisdiction,or arbitrary and capricious.compare post,at,with a d.
by contrast,where a patent holder merely challenges the patent office determin ation that the information presented in the petition shows that there is a reasonable likelihood of success with respect to at least of the claims challenged,a,or where a patent holder grounds its claim in a statute closely related to that decision to institute inter partes review,d bars judicial review.in this case,cuozzo claim that garmin petition was not pleaded with particularity under is little more than a challenge to the patent office conclusion,under a,that the information presented in the petition warranted review.united states williams,a complaint about the quality or adequacy of the evidence can always be recast as a complaint that the presentation was incomplete or misleading we therefore conclude that d bars cuozzo efforts to attack the patent office determination to institute inter partes review in this case.
cuozzo further argues that the patent office lacked the legal authority to issue its regulation requiring the agency,when conducting an inter partes review,to give a patent claim its broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it appears.cfr b.instead,cuozzo contends that the patent office should,like the courts,give claims their ordinary meaning as understood by a person of skill in the art.phillips,at.
the statute,however,contains a provision that grants the patent office authority to issue regulations establishing and governing inter partes review under this chapter.a.the court of appeals held that this statute gives the patent office the legal authority to issue its broadest reasonable construction regulation.we agree.
we interpret congress grant of rulemaking authority in light of our decision in chevron.where a statute is clear,the agency must follow the statute,at.but where a statute leaves a gap or is ambigu ous,we typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text,nature,and purpose of the statute.mead,at chevron,supra,at.the statute contains such a gap no statutory provision unambiguously directs the agency to use one standard or the other.and the statute express ly authoriz es the patent office to engage in the process of rulemaking to address that gap.mead,supra,at.indeed,the statute allows the patent office to issue rules governing inter partes review,a,and the broadest reasonable construction regulation is a rule that governs inter partes review.
both the dissenting judges in the court of appeals and cuozzo believe that other ordinary tools of statutory interpretation,ins,and,lead to a different conclusion.the dissenters,for example,point to cases in which the circuit interpreted a grant of rulemaking authority in a different statute,b a,as limited to procedural rules.see,cooper technologies dudas,ca fed.these cases,however,as we just said,interpret a different statute.that statute does not clearly contain the circuit claimed limitation,nor is its language the same as that of a.section b a grants the patent office authority to issue regulations which shall govern proceedings in the office emphasis added,but the statute before us,a,does not refer to proceedings it refers more broadly to regulations establishing and governing inter partes review.the circuit prior interpretation of b a can not magically render unambiguous the different language in the different statute before us.
cuozzo and its supporting amici believe we will reach a different conclusion if we carefully examine the purpose of inter partes review.that purpose,in their view,is to modify the previous reexamination procedures and to replace them with a trial,adjudicatory in nature.brief for petitioner quoting google jongerius panoramic,llc,ipr,paper,ptab.they point out that,under the statute,an opposing party can trigger inter partes review.parties can engage in discovery of relevant evidence,including deposition s,affidavits or declarations as well as anything otherwise necessary in the interest of justice.a.parties may present factual evidence and expert opinions to support their arguments.a.the challenger bears the burden of proving unpatentability.e.and,after oral argument before a panel of three of the board administrative patent judges,it issues a final written decision,a.perhaps most importantly,a decision to cancel a patent normally has the same effect as a district court determination of a patent invalidity.
in light of these adjudicatory characteristics,which make these agency proceedings similar to court proceedings,congress,in cuozzo view,must have designed inter partes review as a surrogate for court proceedings.brief for petitioner.cuozzo points to various sources of legislative history in support of its argument.see,at inter partes review is a quick and cost effective alternativ e to litigation at the act converts inter partes reexamination from an examinational to an adjudicative proceeding see also,inter partes review is a quick,inexpensive,and reliable alternative to district court litigation cong.rec.remarks of kyl among the reforms that are expected to expedite these proceedings is the shift from an examinational to an adjudicative model and,if congress intended to create a surrogate for court proceedings,why would congress not also have intended the agency to use the claim construction standard that district courts apply namely,the ordinary meaning standard,rather than the claim construction standard that patent examiners apply namely,the broadest reasonable construction standard 
the problem with cuozzo argument,however,is that,in other significant respects,inter partes review is less like a judicial proceeding and more like a specialized agency proceeding.parties that initiate the proceeding need not have a concrete stake in the outcome indeed,they may lack constitutional standing.see a consumer watchdog wisconsin alumni research foundation,ca fed.as explained above,challengers need not remain in the proceeding rather,the patent office may continue to conduct an inter partes review even after the adverse party has settled.a.moreover,as is the case here,the patent office may intervene in a later judicial proceeding to defend its decision even if the private challengers drop out.and the burden of proof in inter partes review is different than in the district courts in inter partes review,the challenger or the patent office must establish unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence in district court,a challenger must prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.compare e with microsoft.partnership.
most importantly,these features,as well as inter partes review predecessors,indicate that the purpose of the proceeding is not quite the same as the purpose of district court litigation.the proceeding involves what used to be called a reexamination and,as noted above,a cousin of inter partes review,ex parte reexamination,et,still bears that name.the name and accompanying procedures suggest that the proceeding offers a second look at an earlier administrative grant of a patent.although congress changed the name from reexamination to review,nothing convinces us that,in doing so,congress wanted to change its basic purposes,namely,to reexamine an earlier agency decision.thus,in addition to helping resolve concrete disputes among parties,inter partes review helps protect the public paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope.precision instrument automotive maintenance machinery,see,at inter partes review is an efficient system for challenging patents that should not have issued 
finally,neither the statutory language,its purpose,or its history suggest that congress considered what standard the agency should apply when reviewing a patent claim in inter partes review.cuozzo contends that d,explaining that the patent office should determine the proper meaning of a patent claim,reinforces its conclusion that the ordinary meaning standard should apply.but viewed against a background of language and practices indicating that congress designed a hybrid proceeding,d reference to the proper meaning of a claim is ambiguous.it leaves open the question of which claim construction standard is proper.
the upshot is,whether we look at statutory language alone,or that language in context of the statute purpose,we find an express delegation of rulemaking authority,a gap that rules might fill,and ambiguity in respect to the boundaries of that gap.mead,at see chevron,at.we consequently turn to the question whether the patent office regulation is a reasonable exercise of its rulemaking authority.
we conclude that the regulation represents a reasonable exercise of the rulemaking authority that congress delegated to the patent office.for one thing,construing a patent claim according to its broadest reasonable construction helps to protect the public.a reasonable,yet unlawfully broad claim might discourage the use of the invention by a member of the public.because an examiner or reexaminer use of the broadest reasonable construction standard increases the possibility that the examiner will find the claim too broad and deny it,use of that standard encourages the applicant to draft narrowly.this helps ensure precision while avoiding overly broad claims,and thereby helps prevent a patent from tying up too much knowledge,while helping members of the public draw useful information from the disclosed invention and better understand the lawful limits of the claim.see a nautilus,biosig instruments,slip,at see also in re yamamoto,ca fed.
for another,past practice supports the patent office regulation.see fed.reg.the patent office has used this standard for more than years,at.it has applied that standard in proceedings,which,as here,resemble district court litigation.see bamberger cheruvu,uspq,bpai broadest reasonable construction standard applies in interference proceedings brief for generic pharmaceutical association et as amici curiae describing similarities between interference proceedings and adjudicatory aspects of inter partes review see also in re yamamoto,supra,at broadest reasonable construction standard applies in reexamination.it also applies that standard in proceedings that may be consolidated with a concurrent inter partes review.see fed.reg.
cuozzo makes two arguments in response.first,cuozzo says that there is a critical difference between the patent office initial examination of an application to determine if a patent should issue,and this proceeding,in which the agency reviews an patent.in an initial examination of an application for a patent the examiner gives the claim its broadest reasonable construction.but if the patent examiner rejects the claim,then,as described above,part,supra,the applicant has a right to amend and resubmit the claim.and the examiner and applicant may repeat this process at least once more.this system broad construction with a chance to amend both protects the public from overly broad claims and gives the applicant a fair chance to draft a precise claim that will qualify for patent protection.in inter partes review,however,the broadest reasonable construction standard may help protect certain public interests,but there is no absolute right to amend any challenged patent claims.this,cuozzo says,is unfair to the patent holder.
the process however,is not as unfair as cuozzo suggests.the patent holder may,at least once in the process,make a motion to do just what he would do in the examination process,namely,amend or narrow the claim.d ed.this opportunity to amend,together with the fact that the original application process may have presented several additional opportunities to amend the patent,means that use of the broadest reasonable construction standard is,as a general matter,not unfair to the patent holder in any obvious way.
cuozzo adds that,as of june,only out of motions to amend have been granted.brief for petitioner see tr.of oral arg.noting that a sixth motion had been granted by the time of oral argument in this case.but these numbers may reflect the fact that no amendment could save the inventions at issue,that the patent should have never issued at all.
to the extent cuozzo statistical argument takes aim at the manner in which the patent office has exercised its authority,that question is not before us.indeed,in this particular case,the agency determined that cuozzo proposed amendment enlarge d,rather than narrowed,the challenged claims.app.to pet.for cert.see d.cuozzo does not contend that the decision not to allow its amendment is arbitrary or capricious,or otherwise un lawful.a.
second,cuozzo says that the use of the broadest reasonable construction standard in inter partes review,together with use of an ordinary meaning standard in district court,may produce inconsistent results and cause added confusion.a district court may find a patent claim to be valid,and the agency may later cancel that claim in its own review.we recognize that that is so.this possibility,however,has long been present in our patent system,which provides different tracks one in the patent office and one in the courts for the review and adjudication of patent claims.as we have explained above,inter partes review imposes a different burden of proof on the challenger.these different evidentiary burdens mean that the possibility of inconsistent results is inherent to congress regulatory design.one lot emerald cut stones united states,per curiam.
moreover,the patent office uses the broadest reasonable construction standard in other proceedings,including interference proceedings described above,which may implicate patents that are later reviewed in district court.the statute gives the patent office the power to consolidate these other proceedings with inter partes review.to try to create uniformity of standards would consequently prove difficult.and we can not find unreasonable the patent office decision to prefer a degree of inconsistency in the standards used between the courts and the agency,rather than among agency proceedings.see fed.reg.
finally,cuozzo and its supporting amici offer various policy arguments in favor of the ordinary meaning standard.the patent office is legally free to accept or reject such policy arguments on the basis of its own reasoned analysis.having concluded that the patent office regulation,selecting the broadest reasonable construction standard,is reasonable in light of the rationales described above,we do not decide whether there is a better alternative as a policy matter.that is a question that congress left to the particular expertise of the patent office.
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the federal circuit.
it is so ordered.

the court invokes chevron natural resources defense council,and united states mead,to resolve one of the questions presented in this case.see ante,at.but today decision does not rest on chevron fiction that ambiguity in a statutory term is best construed as an implicit delegation of power to an administrative agency to determine the bounds of the law.in an appropriate case,this court should reconsider that fiction of chevron and its progeny.see michigan epa,thomas,concurring slip,at chevron deference raises serious questions see also department of transportation association of american railroads,thomas,concurring in judgment slip,at t he discretion inherent in executive power does not comprehend the discretion to formulate generally applicable rules of private conduct perez mortgage bankers,thomas,concurring in judgment slip,at those who ratified the constitution knew that legal texts would often contain ambiguities.the judicial power was understood to include the power to resolve these ambiguities over time cass,is chevron game worth the candle burning interpretation at both ends,in liberty nemesis reuter yoo eds.
the court avoids those constitutional concerns today because the provision of the america invents act at issue contains an express and clear conferral of authority to the patent office to promulgate rules governing its own proceedings.see a ante,at.and by asking whether the patent office preferred rule is reasonable,ante,at,the court effectively asks whether the rulemaking was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,in conformity with the administrative procedure act,a.i therefore join the court opinion in full.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice alito,with whom justice sotomayor joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
congress has given the patent and trademark office considerable authority to review and cancel issued patent claims.at the same time,congress has cabined that power by imposing significant conditions on the patent office institution of patent review proceedings.unlike the court,i do not think that congress intended to shield the patent office compliance or noncompliance with these limits from all judicial scrutiny.rather,consistent with the strong presumption favoring judicial review,congress required only that judicial review,including of issues bearing on the institution of patent review proceedings,be channeled through an appeal from the agency final decision.i respectfully dissent from the court contrary holding 
in the america invents act aia,et,congress created three new mechanisms for patent office review of issued patent claims inter partes review,review,and covered business method patent review cbm review.this case involves the first of these proceedings,inter partes review.
under inter partes review,anyone may file a petition challenging the patentability of an issued patent claim at almost any time.a,c.the grounds for challenge are limited to the patentability of the claim under which requires patent claims to be novel and which requires patent claims to be nonobvious.b.
the statute imposes other restrictions as well.a petition for inter partes review may be considered only if the petition satisfies certain requirements,including as relevant here that the petition identif y,in writing and with particularity,each claim challenged,the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based,and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim.a.additionally,inter partes review may not be instituted if the party challenging the patent previously filed a civil action challenging the patent validity or was sued for infringing the patent more than a year before seeking inter partes review.a,b.finally,the patent office may not institute inter partes review unless the director of the patent office determines that the information presented in the challenger petition and any response by the patent owner shows that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least of the claims challenged in the petition.a 
the statute provides that t he determination by the director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.d.if inter partes review is instituted,the patent office conducts a trial that culminates in a final written decision on the patentability of the challenged claims.a.any patent owner or challenger that is dissatisfied with that decision may appeal to the federal circuit.
in this case,the patent office instituted inter partes review of claims and of cuozzo patent based on prior art that the challenger petition did not cite with respect to those claims.after trial,the patent office issued a final written decision holding those claims unpatentable,and cuozzo appealed that decision to the federal circuit.in its appeal,cuozzo argued among other things that the patent office had violated the requirement that a petition for inter partes review may be considered only if the petition identifies the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based,and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge,with particularity.a.
the federal circuit held that it could not entertain this argument because d provides that the patent office decision to institute an inter partes review is final and nonappealable.see in re cuozzo speed technolo gies,llc.this court now affirms.
i disagree.we have long recognized that congress rarely intends to prevent courts from enforcing its directives to federal agencies.for that reason,this court applies a strong presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action.mach mining,llc eeoc,slip,at quoting bowen michigan academy of family physicians.while the presumption is rebuttable,the agency bears a heavy burden in attempting to show that congress prohibit ed all judicial review of the agency compliance with a legislative mandate.mach mining,supra,at slip,at quoting dunlop bachowski.if a provision can reasonably be read to permit judicial review,it should be.
our decision in lindahl office of personnel management,illustrates the power of this presumption.the statute at issue there provided that agency decisions concerning questions of disability and dependency are final and conclusive and are not subject to review.at.the federal circuit concluded that the statute cut off all judicial review of such decisions,stating that i t is difficult to conceive of a more statement of congressional intent to preclude review than one in which the concept of finality is thrice repeated in a single sentence.at.we reversed.we acknowledged that the statute plausibly c ould be read as imposing an absolute bar to judicial review,but we concluded that it also quite naturally c ould be read as precluding review only of factual determinations underlying the agency decision,while permitting review of legal questions.ibid.in light of the presumption of reviewability,we adopted the latter reading.we observed that when congress intends to bar judicial review altogether,it typically employs language far more unambiguous and comprehensive,giving as an example a statute that made an agency decision final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law or fact and not subject to review by another official of the united states or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.at,and 
this is a far easier case than lindahl.there is no question that the statute now before us can naturally perhaps most naturally be read to permit judicial review of issues bearing on the patent office institution of inter partes review.section d reads the determination by the director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.unlike the statutes we addressed in lindahl including the one we found to permit review,d does not say that an institution decision is not subject to review.instead,it makes the institution decision nonappealable.this is fairly interpreted to bar only an appeal from the institution decision itself,while allowing review of institutionrelated issues in an appeal from the patent office final written decision at the end of the proceeding.see.our cases have used the term nonappealable in just this way to refer to matters that are not immediately or independently appealable,but which are subject to review at a later point thus,while the decision to institute inter partes review is final and nonappealable in the sense that a court can not stop the proceeding from going forward the question whether it was lawful to institute review will not escape judicial scrutiny.this approach is consistent with the normal rule that a party may challenge earlier agency rulings that are themselves not directly reviewable when seeking review of a final,appealable decision.and it strikes a sensible balance the patent office may proceed unimpeded with the inter partes review process which must normally be completed within one year,see a,but it will be held to account for its compliance with the law at the end of the day.
in rejecting this commonsense interpretation,the court gives short shrift to the presumption in favor of judicial review.its primary reason for disregarding the presumption reduces to an assertion devoid of any textual analysis that surely d must bar review of legal questions related to institution decisions.ante,at.as i have explained,the statute text does not require that conclusion.
moving further away from the statutory text,the court next objects that allowing judicial review would undercut one important congressional objective,namely,giving the patent office significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.ante,at.i am not sure that the court appreciates how remarkable this assertion is.it would give us cause to do away with judicial review whenever we think that review makes it harder for an agency to carry out important work.in any event,the majority logic is flawed.judicial review enforces the limits that congress has imposed on the agency power.it thus serves to buttress,not undercut,congress objectives.by asserting otherwise,the majority loses sight of the principle that no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.rodriguez united states,per curiam.every statute purposes,not only to achieve certain ends,but also to achieve them by particular means and there is often a considerable legislative battle over what those means ought to be.the withholding of agency authority is as significant as the granting of it,and we have no right to play favorites between the two.director,office of workers compensation programs newport news shipbuilding dry dock.the inter partes review statute is no exception.it empowers the patent office to clean up bad patents,but it expressly forbids the patent office to institute inter partes review or even consider petitions for inter partes review unless certain conditions are satisfied.nothing in the statute suggests that congress wanted to improve patent quality at the cost of fidelity to the law.
the court also observes that the inter partes review appeal provision,limit s appellate review to the final written decision.ante,at.the majority reads too much into this provision.section provides simply that a party dissatisfied with the final written decision may appeal the decision.the statute does not restrict the issues that may be raised in such an appeal.as the patent office once explained before having a change of heart,the plain language of the statutory text recognizes a right of judicial review for any party dissatisfied by the patent office ultimate written decision,and n othing in the statutory scheme limits the reasons that a party might be so dissatisfied.memorandum of law in support of defendant motion to dismiss in versata development group,rea,civ.action ed,may.a party may be dissatisfied with a final written decision in an inter partes review because the patent office lacked authority to institute the proceeding in the first place,or because the office committed some other error in the to its final decision.neither d nor prevents a party from pressing such issues on an appeal from the final decision.this is familiar practice under,which similarly limits appeals to final decisions of the district courts but allows appellants to challenge earlier rulings as part of those appeals.see quackenbush allstate ins,the general rule is that a party is entitled to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered,in which claims of district court error at any stage in the litigation may be ventilated internal quotation marks omitted wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.noting the general rule that an appeal from final judgment permits review of all rulings that led up to the judgment and observing that t he variety of orders open to review on subsequent appeal from a final judgment is enormous and,as noted above,judicial review of final agency action likewise encompasses earlier rulings that are not directly reviewable.see supra,at.
the court next contends that my interpretation renders d superfluous.ante,at.reading the statute to defer review of institution decisions is unnecessary,the court says,because the administrative procedure act already limits review to final agency decisions and a decision to initiate inter partes review is preliminary,not final.ibid.but congress reasonably may have thought that the matter needed clarifying,given that d itself calls such a decision final albeit in a different sense,see supra,at.language is not superfluous when it remove s any doubt about a point that might otherwise be unclear.ali federal bureau of prisons.more important,my reading prevents an appeal from a decision not to institute inter partes review,which is plainly final agency action and so absent d might otherwise trigger immediate review.the co
