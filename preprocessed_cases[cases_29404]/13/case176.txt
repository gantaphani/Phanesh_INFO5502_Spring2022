new hampshire cause of action imposes affirmative duties on manufacturers,including a duty to design their products reasonably safely for the uses which they can foresee.thibault sears,roebuck.
to assess whether a product design is unreasonably dangerous to the user,vautour body masters sports industries,the new hampshire supreme court employs a approach,which asks whether the danger magnitude outweighs the product utility,at,at.the court has repeatedly identified three factors as germane to that inquiry the usefulness and desirability of the product to the public as a whole,whether the risk of danger could have been reduced without significantly affecting either the product effectiveness or manufacturing cost,and the presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.ibid.increasing a drug usefulness or reducing its risk of danger would require redesigning the drug,since those factors are direct results of a drug chemical design and active ingredients.here,however,redesign was not possible for two reasons.first,the fdca requires a generic drug to have the same active ingredients,route of administration,dosage form,strength,and labeling as its drug equivalent.second,because of sulindac simple composition,the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned.accordingly,because redesign was impossible,mutual could only ameliorate sulindac profile by strengthening its warnings.thus,new hampshire law ultimately required mutual to change sulindac labeling.
but pliva makes clear that federal law prevents generic drug manufacturers from changing their labels.see,at.accordingly,mutual was prohibited from taking the remedial action required to avoid liability under new hampshire law.
when federal law forbids an action required by state law,the state law is without effect.maryland,supra,at.because it was impossible for mutual to comply with both state and federal law,new hampshire cause of action is with respect to drugs sold in interstate commerce.

mutual pharmaceutical company,petitioner karen bartlett 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
we must decide whether federal law the new hampshire claim under which respondent karen bartlett recovered damages from petitioner mutual pharmaceutical,the manufacturer of sulindac,a generic nonsteroidal drug nsaid.new hampshire law imposes a duty on manufacturers to ensure that the drugs they market are not unreasonably unsafe,and a drug safety is evaluated by reference to both its chemical properties and the adequacy of its warnings.because mutual was unable to change sulindac composition as a matter of both federal law and basic chemistry,new hampshire cause of action effectively required mutual to change sulindac labeling to provide stronger warnings.but,as this court recognized just two terms ago in pliva,mensing,federal law prohibits generic drug manufacturers from independently changing their drugs labels.accordingly,state law imposed a duty on mutual not to comply with federal law.under the supremacy clause,state laws that require a private party to violate federal law are and,thus,are without effect.maryland louisiana.
the court of appeals solution that mutual should simply have pulled sulindac from the market in order to comply with both state and federal law is no solution.rather,adopting the court of appeals rationale would render impossibility a dead letter and work a revolution in this court case law.
accordingly,we hold that claims that turn on the adequacy of a drug warnings are by federal law under pliva.we thus reverse the decision of the court of appeals below.
under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,ch,stat,as amended,et,drug manufacturers must gain approval from the united states food and drug administration fda before marketing any drug in interstate commerce.a.in the case of a new drug,fda approval can be secured only by submitting a application nda.an nda is a compilation of materials that must include full reports of all clinical investigations,b a,relevant nonclinical studies,and any other data or information relevant to an evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the drug product obtained or otherwise received by the applicant from any source,cfr d and iv.the nda must also include the labeling proposed to be used for such drug,b f cfr c i,and a discussion of why the drug benefits exceed the risks under the conditions stated in the labeling,cfr d viii c ix.the fda may approve an nda only if it determines that the drug in question is safe for use under the conditions of use prescribed,recommended,or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof.d.in order for the fda to consider a drug safe,the drug probable therapeutic benefits must outweigh its risk of harm.fda brown williamson tobacco.
the process of submitting an nda is both onerous and lengthy.see report to congressional requesters,government accountability office,new drug development,biotechnology,a typical nda spans thousands of pages and is based on clinical trials conducted over several years.in order to provide a swifter route for approval of generic drugs,congress passed the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat,popularly known as the act.under,a generic drug may be approved without the same level of clinical testing required for approval of a new drug,provided the generic drug is identical to the drug in several key respects.
first,the proposed generic drug must be chemically equivalent to the approved drug it must have the same active ingredient or active ingredients,route of administration,dosage form,and strength as its counterpart.j a ii and iii.second,a proposed generic must be bioequivalent to an approved drug.j a iv.that is,it must have the same rate and extent of absorption as the drug.j b.third,the generic drug manufacturer must show that the labeling proposed for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for the approved drug.j a v.

in the instant case,it was impossible for mutual to comply with both its duty to strengthen the warnings on sulindac label and its duty not to alter sulindac label.accordingly,the state law is.
we begin by identifying petitioner duties under state law.as an initial matter,respondent is wrong in asserting that the purpose of new hampshire designdefect cause of action is compensatory,not regulatory.brief for respondent.rather,new hampshire cause of action imposes affirmative duties on manufacturers.
respondent is correct that new hampshire has adopted the doctrine of strict liability in tort as set forth in section of the restatement second of torts.see restatement second of torts and hereinafter restatement.see buttrick arthur lessard sons.under the restatement and consequently,under new hampshire tort law o ne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused even though he has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product.restatement,at.
but respondent argument conflates what we will call a regime in which liability does not depend on negligence,but still signals the breach of a duty with what we will call an regime in which liability does not reflect the breach of any duties at all,but merely serves to spread risk.new hampshire has adopted the former,not the latter.indeed,the new hampshire supreme court has consistently held that the of a product has a duty to design his product reasonably safely for the uses which he can foresee.thibault sears,roebuck.see also reid spadone mach,in new hampshire,the manufacturer is under a general duty to design his product reasonably safely for the uses which he can foresee internal quotation marks omitted chellman ab,the duty to warn is part of the general duty to design,manufacture and sell products that are reasonably safe for their foreseeable uses simoneau south bend lathe,we limit the application of strict tort liability in this jurisdiction by continuing to emphasize that liability without negligence is not liability without fault price bic,cautioning that the term unreasonably dangerous should not be interpreted so broadly as to impose absolute liability on manufacturers or make them insurers of their products accordingly,respondent is incorrect in arguing that new hampshire system imposes no substantive duties on manufacturers.brief for respondent 
that new hampshire tort law imposes a duty on manufacturers is clear.determining the content of that duty requires somewhat more analysis.as discussed below in greater detail,new hampshire requires manufacturers to ensure that the products they design,manufacture,and sell are not unreasonably dangerous.the new hampshire supreme court has recognized that this duty can be satisfied either by changing a drug design or by changing its labeling.since mutual did not have the option of changing sulindac design,new hampshire law ultimately required it to change sulindac labeling.
respondent argues that,even if new hampshire law does impose a duty on drug manufacturers,that duty does not encompass either the duty to change sulindac design or the duty to change sulindac labeling.brief for respondent capitalization and emphasis deleted.that argument can not be correct.new hampshire imposes liability only where the design of the product created a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.vautour body masters sports industries,chellman,supra,at,at.to determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous,the new hampshire supreme court employs a approach under which a product is defective as designed if the magnitude of the danger outweighs the utility of the product.vautour,supra,at,at internal quotation marks omitted.that approach requires a multifaceted balancing process involving evaluation of many conflicting factors.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted see also thibault,supra,at,at same.
while the set of factors to be considered is ultimately an open one,the new hampshire supreme court has repeatedly identified three factors as germane to the inquiry the usefulness and desirability of the product to the public as a whole,whether the risk of danger could have been reduced without significantly affecting either the product effectiveness or manufacturing cost,and the presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.vautour,supra,at,at see also price,supra,at,at same chellman,supra,at,at same.
in the drug context,either increasing the usefulness of a product or reducing its risk of danger would require redesigning the drug a drug usefulness and its risk of danger are both direct results of its chemical design and,most saliently,its active ingredients.see cfr b active ingredient means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis,cure,mitigation,treatment,or prevention of disease,or to affect the structure of any function of the body of humans italics deleted.
in the present case,however,redesign was not possible for two reasons.first,the fdca requires a generic drug to have the same active ingredients,route of,dosage form,strength,and labeling as the drug on which it is based.j a ii v and b cfr c.consequently,the court of appeals was correct to recognize that mutual can not legally make sulindac in another composition.at.indeed,were mutual to change the composition of its sulindac,the altered chemical would be a new drug that would require its own nda to be marketed in interstate commerce.see cfr h giving examples of when the fda considers a drug to be new,including cases involving newness for drug use of any substance which composes such drug,in whole or in part second,because of sulindac simple composition,the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned.see,at mutual can not legally make sulindac in another composition nor it is apparent how it could alter a drug anyway 
given the impossibility of redesigning sulindac,the only way for mutual to ameliorate the drug profile and thus to escape liability was to strengthen the presence and efficacy of sulindac warning in such a way that the warning avoid ed an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.vautour,supra,at,at.see also chellman,at,at the duty to warn is part of the general duty to design,manufacture and sell products that are reasonably safe for their foreseeable uses.if the design of a product makes a warning necessary to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from a foreseeable use,the lack of warning or an ineffective warning causes the product to be defective and unreasonably dangerous citation omitted.thus,new hampshire cause of action imposed a duty on mutual to strengthen sulindac warnings.
for these reasons,it is unsurprising that allegations that sulindac label was inadequate featured prominently at trial.respondent introduced into evidence both the label for mutual sulindac at the time of her injuries and the label as revised in after respondent had suffered her injuries.app.her counsel opening statement informed the jury that the evidence will show you that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous and had an inadequate warning,as well.you will hear much more evidence about why this label was inadequate in relation to this case.tr.and,the district court repeatedly instructed the jury that it should evaluate sulindac labeling in determining whether mutual sulindac was unreasonably dangerous.see app.jury instruction that the jury should find a defect in design only if it found that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous and that a warning was not present and effective to avoid that unreasonable danger ibid.jury instruction that no design defect exists if a warning was present and effective to avoid that unreasonable danger finally,the district court clarified in its order and opinion denying mutual motion for judgment as a matter of law that the adequacy of sulindac labeling had been part of what the jury was instructed to consider.supp,if the jury found that risks outweighed its benefits,then it could consider whether the warning regardless of its adequacy those risks to such an extent that it eliminated the unreasonable danger 
thus,in accordance with new hampshire law,the jury was presented with evidence relevant to,and was instructed to consider,whether mutual had fulfilled its duty to label sulindac adequately so as to render the drug not unreasonably dangerous.in holding mutual liable,the jury determined that mutual had breached that duty.
the duty imposed by federal law is far more readily apparent.as pliva made clear,federal law prevents generic drug manufacturers from changing their labels.see,at slip,at federal drug regulations,as interpreted by the fda,prevented the manufacturers from independently changing their generic drugs safety labels see also j a v t he labeling proposed for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for the approved drug cfr a iii,b approval for a generic drug may be withdrawn if the generic drug label is no longer consistent with that for the drug thus,federal law prohibited mutual from taking the remedial action required to avoid liability under new hampshire law.
when federal law forbids an action that state law requires,the state law is without effect.maryland,at.because it is impossible for mutual and other similarly situated manufacturers to comply with both state and federal law new hampshire cause of action is with respect to drugs sold in interstate commerce 
the court of appeals reasoned that mutual could escape the impossibility of complying with both its federal and duties by choos ing not to make sulindac at all.at.we reject this rationale as incompatible with our jurisprudence.our cases presume that an actor seeking to satisfy both his federal and obligations is not required to cease acting altogether in order to avoid liability.indeed,if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility,impossibility would be all but meaningless.at slip,at.
the incoherence of the theory becomes plain when viewed through the lens of our previous cases.in every instance in which the court has found impossibility,the direct conflict between federal and duties could easily have been avoided if the regulated actor had simply ceased acting.
pliva is an obvious example as discussed above,the pliva court held that state claims were by the fdca because it was impossible for drug manufacturers like pliva to comply with both the duty to label their products in a way that rendered them reasonably safe and the duty not to change their drugs labels,at slip,at.it would,of course,have been possible for drug manufacturers like pliva to pull their products from the market altogether.in so doing,they would have avoided liability under both state and federal law such manufacturers would neither have labeled their products in a way that rendered them unsafe nor impermissibly changed any federally approved label.
in concluding that it was impossible for the manufacturers to comply with both their duty to change the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the same,at slip,at,the court was undeterred by the prospect that pliva could have complied with both state and federal requirements by simply leaving the market.the court of appeals decision below had found that mensing claims 
escaped based on the very same rationale the first circuit relied on in this case.see mensing wyeth,g eneric defendants were not compelled to market metoclopramide.if they realized their label was insufficient they could have simply stopped selling the product moreover,mensing advanced the rationale in its petition for rehearing,which this court denied.pliva,supra pet.for reh g in.nonetheless,this court squarely determined that it had been impossible for pliva to comply with both its state and federal duties,at slip,at 
adopting the first circuit rationale would mean that not only pliva,but also the vast majority if not all of the cases in which the court has found impossibility,were wrongly decided.just as the prospect that a regulated actor could avoid liability under both state and federal law by simply leaving the market did not undermine the impossibility analysis in pliva,so it is irrelevant to our analysis here.
the dreadful injuries from which products liabilities cases arise often engender passionate responses.today is no exception,as justice sotomayor dissent hereinafter the dissent illustrates.but sympathy for respondent does not relieve us of the responsibility of following the law.
the dissent accuses us of incorrectly assuming that federal law gives pharmaceutical companies a right to sell a federally approved drug free from liability,post,at,but we make no such assumption.rather,as discussed at length above,see supra,at,we hold that claims like new hampshire that place a duty on manufacturers to render a drug safer by either altering its composition or altering its labeling are in conflict with federal laws that prohibit manufacturers from unilaterally altering drug composition or labeling.the dissent is quite correct that federal law establishes no for drug companies but it does prevent them from taking certain remedial measures.where state law imposes a duty to take such remedial measures,it actual ly conflict s with federal law by making it for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.freightliner myrick,quoting english,at.the dissent seems to acknowledge that point when it concedes that,if federal law requires a particular product label to include a complete list of ingredients while state law specifically forbids that labeling practice,there is little question that state law must yield.post,at quoting felder casey.what the dissent does not see is that that is this case federal law requires a very specific label for sulindac,and state law forbids the use of that label.
the dissent responds that new hampshire law merely create s an incentive to alter sulindac label or composition,post,at,but does not impose any actual legal obligation,post,at.the contours of that argument are difficult to discern.perhaps the dissent is drawing a distinction between exposure to liability,post,at,and a statutory legal mandate,ibid.but the distinction between common law and statutory law is irrelevant to the argument at hand in violating a duty,as surely as by violating a statutory duty,a party contravenes the law.while it is true that,in a certain sense,duties give a manufacturer the choice between exiting the market or continuing to sell while knowing it may have to pay compensation to consumers injured by its product,post,at,statutory mandate s do precisely the same thing they require a manufacturer to choose between leaving the market and accepting the consequences of its actions in the form of a fine or other sanction.see generally calabresi melamed,property rules,liability rules,and inalienability one view of the cathedral,harv.discussing liability rules.and,in any event,pliva which the dissent agrees involved a requirement that conflicted with federal law,post,at dealt with claims,see pliva,supra,at slip,at.because pliva controls the instant case,the dissent is reduced to fighting a rearguard action against its reasoning despite ostensibly swearing fealty to its holding.
to suggest that bates dow agrosciences llc,is to the contrary is simply misleading.the dissent is correct that bates held a texas claim not to be.but,it did so because the claim in question was not a requirement for labeling or packaging and thus fell outside the class of claims covered by the express provision at issue in that case,at emphasis in original.indeed,contrary to the impression one might draw from the dissent,post,at,the bates court actually blessed the lower court determination that the state claim imposed a requirement the court of appeals did,however,correctly hold that the term requirements in b reaches beyond positive enactments,such as statutes and regulations,to embrace duties.bates,supra,at.the dissent offers no compelling reason why the duty in this case should not similarly be viewed as a requirement.we agree,of course,that determining precisely what,if any,specific requirement a state claim imposes is important.post,at.as bates makes clear,t he proper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of the duty at issue it does not call for speculation as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the to take any particular action.at citation omitted.here,as we have tried to make clear,the duty to ensure that one products are not unreasonably dangerous imposed by new hampshire cause of action,vautour,at,at,involves a duty to make one of several changes.in cases where it is impossible in fact or by law to alter a product design and thus to increase the product usefulness or decrease its risk of danger the duty to render a product reasonably safe boils down to a duty to ensure the presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.at,at.the duty to redesign sulindac label was thus a part of the duty at issue not merely an action mutual might have been prompted to take by the adverse jury verdict here.
finally,the dissent laments that we have ignored congress explicit efforts to preserve state liability.post,at.we have not.suffice to say,the court would welcome congress explicit resolution of the difficult questions that arise in the prescription drug context.that issue has repeatedly vexed the court and produced widely divergent views in recent years.see,wyeth levine,pliva.as the dissent concedes,however,the fdca treatment of prescription drugs includes neither an express clause as in the vaccine context,b,nor an express clause as in the drug context,e,d.in the absence of that sort of explicit expression of congressional intent,we are left to divine congress will from the duties the statute imposes.that federal law forbids mutual to take actions required of it by state tort law evinces an intent to.
this case arises out of tragic circumstances.a combination of factors combined to produce the rare and devastating injuries that respondent suffered the fda decision to approve the sale of sulindac and the warnings that accompanied the drug at the time it was prescribed,the decision by respondent physician to prescribe sulindac despite its known risks,and congress decision to regulate the manufacture and sale of generic drugs in a way that reduces their cost to patients but leaves generic drug manufacturers incapable of modifying either the drugs compositions or their warnings.respondent situation is tragic and evokes deep sympathy,but a straightforward application of law requires that the judgment below be reversed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice breyer,with whom justice kagan joins,dissenting.
it is not literally impossible here for a company like petitioner to comply with conflicting state and federal law.a company can comply with both either by not doing business in the relevant state or by paying the state penalty,say damages,for failing to comply with,as here,a tort standard.see post,at sotomayor,dissenting.but conflicting state law that requires a company to withdraw from the state or pay a sizable damages remedy in order to avoid the conflict between state and federal law may nonetheless stan d as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal law objective,in which case the relevant state law is.post,at quoting crosby national foreign trade.
normally,for the reasons i set forth in medtronic,lohr,opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment,in deciding whether there is such a conflict i would pay particular attention to the views of the relevant agency,here the food and drug administration fda.where the statute contains no clear command,courts may infer that the administrative agency has a degree of leeway to determine the extent to which governing statutes,rules,regulations,or other administrative actions have effect.see,at citing smiley citibank south dakota,hillsborough county automated medical laboratories,lawrence county school dist,chevron natural resources defense council.see also wyeth levine.skidmore swift.the fda is responsible for administering the relevant federal statutes.and the question of may call for considerable expertise.indeed,one might infer that,the more medically valuable the drug,the less likely congress intended to permit a state to drive it from the marketplace.
at the same time,the agency can develop an informed position on the question by providing interested parties with an opportunity to present their views.it can translate its understandings into particular intentions accompanying its various rules and regulations.and i t can communicate those intentions through statements in regulations,preambles,interpretive statements,and responses to comments.medtronic,supra,at opinion of breyer.quoting,supra,at.
here,however,i can not give special weight to the fda views.for one thing,as far as the briefing reveals,the fda,in developing its views,has held no hearings on the matter or solicited the opinions,arguments,and views of the public in other ways.for another thing,the fda has set forth its positions only in briefs filed in litigation,not in regulations,interpretations,or similar agency work product.see bowen georgetown.hospital,a gency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,rulings,or administrative practice are entitled to less than ordinary weight.christensen harris county.
finally,the fda has set forth conflicting views on this general matter in different briefs filed at different times.compare wyeth,supra,at,noting that the fda had previously found no,that the united states now argued for,and that this new position was not entitled to deference,with pliva,mensing,slip,at,declining to defer to the united states argument against and,instead,finding,and with brief for united states as amicus curiae now arguing,again,for.see national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,agency views that vary over time are accorded less weight motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins,same verizon communications fcc,same.
without giving the agency views special weight,i would conclude that it is not impossible for petitioner to comply with both state and federal regulatory schemes and that the federal regulatory scheme does not state common law read as potentially requiring petitioner to pay damages or leave the market.as two former fda commissioners tell us,the fda has long believed that state tort litigation can supplemen t the agency regulatory and enforcement activities.brief for donald kennedy et as amici curiae.see also wyeth,supra,at in keeping with congress decision not to tort suits,it appears that the fda traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation 
moreover,unlike the federal statute at issue in medtronic,the statute before us contains no general clause.see,at.wyeth,supra,at presence of clause could show that congress thought suits posed an obstacle to its objectives furthermore,i have found no convincing reason to believe that removing this particular drug from new hampshire market,or requiring damage payments for it there,would be so harmful that it would seriously undercut the purposes of the federal statutory scheme.post,at.
finally,similarly situated defendants in other cases remain free to argue for obstacle in respect to damage payments or market withdrawal,and demonstrate the type of conflict that,in their particular cases,might create true incompatibility between state and federal regulatory schemes.
for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.

mutual pharmaceutical company,petitioner karen bartlett 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice ginsburg joins,dissenting.
in pliva,mensing,this court expanded the scope of impossibility to immunize generic drug manufacturers from claims.today,the court unnecessarily and unwisely extends its holding in mensing to new hampshire law governing with respect to generic drugs.
the court takes this step by concluding that petitioner mutual pharmaceutical was held liable for a claim in disguise,even though the district court clearly rejected such a claim and instead allowed liability on a distinct theory.see infra,at.of greater consequence,the court appears to justify its revision of respondent karen bartlett claim through an and undefended assumption that federal law gives pharmaceutical companies a right to sell a federally approved drug free from liability.remarkably,the court derives this proposition from a federal law that,in order to protect consumers,prohibits manufacturers from distributing new drugs in commerce without federal regulatory approval,and specifically disavows any intent to displace state law absent a direct and positive conflict.
karen bartlett was grievously injured by a drug that a jury found was unreasonably dangerous.the jury relied upon evidence that the drug posed a higher than normal risk of causing the serious skin reaction that produced her horrific injuries carried other risks and possessed no apparent offsetting benefits compared to similar pain relievers,like aspirin.see supp,nh.the court laments her tragic situation,ante,at,but responsibility for the fact that karen bartlett has been deprived of a remedy for her injuries rests with this court.if our established principles were properly applied in this case,and if new hampshire law were correctly construed,then federal law would pose no barrier to karen bartlett recovery.i dissent.

the court applied both of these principles to the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,ch,stat,as amended,et,in levine,where we held that a state claim against a drug manufacturer was not by federal law,at.tracing the history of federal drug regulation from the federal food and drugs act,stat,up to the fdca and its major amendments,the court explained that federal drug law and state liability have long been understood to operate in tandem to promote consumer safety.see levine,at.that basic principle,which the majority opinion elides,is essential to understanding this case.
the fdca prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any new drug without prior approval from the united states food and drug administration fda.a.and generic drug manufacturers are required to make different showings to receive agency approval in this premarketing review process.see ante,at.but in either case,the fda permission to market a drug has never been regarded as a final stamp of approval of the drug safety.under the fdca,manufacturers,who have greater access to information about their drugs than the fda,levine,at,retain the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the products they sell.in addition to their ongoing obligations to monitor a drug risks and to report adverse drug responses to the fda,see cfr,manufacturers may not sell a drug that is deemed to be misbranded because it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner called for in the drug label.j see a brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief indicating that the misbranding prohibition may apply to a drug that was previously approved for sale when significant new scientific evidence demonstrates that the drug is unsafe.
beyond federal requirements,state common law plays an important complementary role to federal drug regulation.levine,at.federal law in this area was initially intended to supplemen t the protection for consumers already provided by state regulation and liability.at.and as congress enlarged the fda powers,it took care to preserve state law.at.in the amendments to the fdca,which established the fda premarketing review in its modern form,congress adopted a saving clause providing that the amendments should not be construed to invalidate any provision of state law absent a direct and positive conflict.stat.and in the years since,with state suits continu ing unabated fda regulation,levine,at quoting riegel medtronic,ginsburg,dissenting,congress has not enacted a provision for prescription drugs whether or generic even as it enacted such provisions with respect to other products regulated by the fda 
congress preservation of a role for state law generally,and remedies specifically,reflects a realistic understanding of the limitations of ex ante federal review in this context.on its own,even rigorous preapproval clinical testing of drugs is generally incapable of detecting adverse effects that occur infrequently,have long latency periods,or affect subpopulations not included or adequately represented in the studies.kessler vladeck,a critical examination of the fda efforts to preempt claims,geo,see national academies,institute of medicine,the future of drug safety promoting and protecting the health of the public hereinafter future of drug safety discussing limitations inherent to a system of premarket clinical trials.moreover,the fda,which is tasked with monitoring thousands of drugs on the market and considering new drug applications,faces significant resource constraints that limit its ability to protect the public from dangerous drugs.see levine,at,and brief for former fda commissioner donald kennedy et as amici curiae.tort suits can help fill the gaps in federal regulation by serv ing as a catalyst to identify previously unknown drug dangers.bates dow agrosciences llc.
perhaps most significant,state common law provides injured consumers like karen bartlett with an to seek redress that is not available under federal law.u nlike most administrative and legislative regulations,claims necessarily perform an important role in compensating accident victims.sprietsma mercury marine.while the court has not always been consistent on this issue,it has repeatedly cautioned against reading federal statutes to remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured when congress did not provide a federal remedy.silkwood,see,bates,at lohr,at plurality opinion.and in fact,the legislative history of the fdca suggests that congress chose not to create a federal cause of action for damages precisely because it believed that state tort law would allow injured consumers to obtain compensation.see levine,at,and.
in light of this background,mutual should face an uphill climb to show that federal law a new hampshire claim against a generic drug manufacturer for defective design.the majority nevertheless accepts mutual argument that compliance with both federal and state law was a physical impossibility.florida lime avocado growers,paul,see ante,at.but if state and law are properly understood,it is clear that new hampshire claim did not impose a legal obligation that mutual had to violate federal law to satisfy.
impossibility is a demanding defense,at,that requires the defendant to show an irreconcilable conflict between federal and state legal obligations,silkwood,at.the logic underlying true impossibility is that when state and federal law impose irreconcilable affirmative requirements,no detailed inquiry into congressional is necessary because the inference that congress would have intended federal law to displace the conflicting state requirement is inescapable.florida lime,at.so,for example,if federal law requires a particular product label to include a complete list of ingredients while state law specifically forbids that labeling practice,there is little question that state law must yield.felder casey.
the key inquiry for impossibility,then,is to identify whether state and federal law impose directly conflicting affirmative legal obligations such that state law require s the doing of an act which is unlawful under federal law.california fed.sav.loan guerra.impossibility does not exist where the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that the laws of the other sovereign restricts or even prohibits.see barnett bank of marion,nelson,michigan canners freezers,agricultural marketing and bargaining.so,to modify the previous example,if federal law permitted but did not require a labeling practice that state law prohibited,there would be no irreconcilable conflict a manufacturer could comply with the more stringent regulation.and by the same logic,impossibility does not exist where one sovereign laws merely create an incentive to take an action that the other sovereign has not authorized because it is possible to comply with both laws.
of course,there are other types of.courts may find that state laws that incentivize what federal law discourages or forbid what federal law authorizes are for reasons apart from impossibility the state laws may fall within the scope of an express provision,pose an obstacle to federal purposes and objectives,or intrude upon a field that congress intended for federal law to occupy exclusively.see crosby national foreign trade council.but absent a direct conflict between two mutually incompatible legal requirements,there is no impossibility and courts may not automatically assume that congress intended for state law to give way.instead,a more careful inquiry into congressional intent is called for,and that inquiry should be informed by the presumption against.
in keeping with the strict standard for impossibility,cases that actually find on that basis are rare.see abrams,plenary power preemption.mensing is an outlier,as the court found impossibility because a generic drug manufacturer could not strengthen its product label to come into line with a duty to warn without the exercise of judgment by the fda.see,at slip,at.but nothing in mensing,nor any other precedent,dictates finding impossibility here.
to assess whether it is physically impossible for mutual to comply with both federal and state law,it is necessary to identify with precision the relevant legal obligations imposed under new hampshire cause of action.
the majority insists that mutual was required by new hampshire law to strengthen its warning label.in taking this position,the majority effectively bartlett claim as a de facto claim.the majority then relies on that to hold that the jury found mutual liable for failing to fulfill its duty to label sulindac adequately,which mensing forbids because a generic drug manufacturer can not independently alter its safety label.ante,at see mensing,at slip,at.but the majority assertion that mutual was held liable in this case for violating a legal obligation to change its label is inconsistent with both new hampshire state law and the record.
for its part,mutual,in addition to making the argument now embraced by the majority,contends that new hampshire law effectively required it to change the chemical composition of sulindac.mutual claims that it was physically impossible to comply with that duty consistent with federal law because drug manufacturers may not change the chemical composition of their products so as to create new drugs without submitting a new drug application for fda approval.see cfr h,b i.but just as new hampshire law did not impose a legal obligation for mutual to change its label,it also did not mandate that mutual change the drug design.
following blackletter products liability law under of the restatement second of torts hereinafter second restatement,new hampshire recognizes strict liability for three different types of product defects manufacturing defects,design defects,and warning defects.see cheshire medical center grace.because the district court granted mutual summary judgment on bartlett claim,only new hampshire cause of action remains at issue in this case.
a product has a defective design under new hampshire law if it poses unreasonable dangers to consumers.thibault sears,roebuck.to determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous,a jury is asked to make a assessment by considering a nonexhaustive list of factors.see ante,at.in addition,new has specifically rejected the doctrine,advocated by the restatement third of torts products liability b hereinafter third restatement,that a plaintiff must present evidence of a reasonable alternative design to show that a product design is defective.instead,while proof of an alternative design is relevant in a design defect case,it is neither a controlling factor nor an essential element.vautour body masters sports industries.
while some jurisdictions have declined to apply liability to prescription drugs,new hampshire,in common with many other jurisdictions,does subject prescriptions drugs to this distinct form of strict products liability.see,citing brochu ortho pharmaceutical,see also third restatement,comment f collecting cases from other jurisdictions.drug manufacturers in new hampshire have an affirmative defense under comment k to of the second restatement,which exempts u navoidably unsafe products from strict liability if the product is properly manufactured and labeled.as explained by the lower courts in this case,see,at supp,nh,new hampshire takes a approach to comment k under which a defendant seeking to invoke the defense must first show that the product is highly useful and that the imposed by the product could not have been avoided through a feasible alternative design.see brochu,at.comment k did not factor into the jury assessment of liability in this case because mutual abandoned a comment k defense before trial.ante,at,
the claim that was applied to mutual subjects the manufacturer of an unreasonably dangerous product to liability,but it does not require that manufacturer to take any specific action that is forbidden by federal law.specifically,and contrary to the majority,see ante,at,new hampshire law did not require mutual to change its warning label.a drug warning label is just one factor in a nonexclusive list for evaluating whether a drug is unreasonably dangerous,see vautour,at,at,and an adequate label is therefore neither a necessary nor a sufficient for avoiding liability.likewise,new hampshire law imposed no duty on mutual to change sulindac chemical composition.the new hampshire supreme court has held that proof of an alternative design is not an element of a claim,see kelleher marvin lumber cedar,and as the majority recognizes,ante,at,sulindac was not realistically capable of being redesigned anyway because it is a drug 
to be sure,new hampshire claim creates an incentive for drug manufacturers to make changes to its product,including to the drug label,to try to avoid liability.and respondent overstates her case somewhat when she suggests that new hampshire law is purely compensatory.see brief for respondent.as is typically true of regimes,new hampshire law,which mandates compensation only for defective products,serves both compensatory and regulatory purposes.see heath sears,roebuck.but exposure to liability,and the incidental regulatory effects that flow from that exposure,goodyear atomic miller,is not equivalent to a legal mandate for a regulated party to take or refrain from taking a specific action.this difference is a significant one a mandate leaves no choice for a party that wishes to comply with the law,whereas an incentive may only influence a choice.
our cases reflect this distinction.in bates,for,we rejected an argument that claims brought against a pesticide manufacturer were because they would likely induce the manufacturer to change its product label and thus run afoul of an express provision forbidding state labeling requirements that were different or in addition to federal requirements,at.a requirement,we explained,is a rule of law that must be obeyed.at.a n event,such as a jury verdict,that merely motivates an optional decision,does not rise to that level.ibid 
so too here.the fact that imposing strict liability for injuries caused by a defective drug design might make a drug manufacturer want to change its label or design or both does not mean the manufacturer was actually required by state law to take either action.and absent such a legal obligation,the majority impossibility argument does not get off the ground,because there was no state requirement that it was physically impossible for mutual to comply with while also following federal law.the case is therefore unlike mensing,where it was undisputed that applicable state tort law require d a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of its product danger to strengthen its label a requirement that conflicted with federal law preventing the manufacturer from doing so,at,slip,at.new hampshire law did not require to do anything other than to compensate consumers who were injured by an unreasonably dangerous drug.
moreover,the trial record in this case confirms that,to the majority insistence,mutual was not held liable for breach ing its duty to label sulindac adequately.ante,at.
when bartlett filed suit against mutual,she raised distinct claims based on design defect and failure to warn.app.see supp,nh.pursuing both claims was consistent with new hampshire law recognition that design defect and failure to warn claims are separate.leblanc american honda motor.after the district court granted summary judgment to mutual on the claim,the court repeatedly explained that an alleged failure to warn by mutual could not and did not provide the basis for bartlett recovery.see supp,at 
the majority notes that the district court admitted evidence regarding sulindac label.ante,at.but the court did so because the label remained relevant for the more limited purpose of assessing,in combination with other factors,whether sulindac design was defective because the product was unreasonably dangerous.see,at.the district court instructions to the jury adhered to this limited purpose.the court first told the jury to determine whether sulindac was unreasonably dangerous by weighing its danger against its utility.app.the court further instructed the jury that if it determined that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous without reference to the warning label,it could then consider the presence and efficacy of the label to evaluate whether the product was unreasonably dangerous even with its warning.in other words,to hold mutual liable,the jury was required to find that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous despite its warning,not because of it.at.the district court also explained to the jury that because bartlett claim addressed only whether sulindac design was defective,mutual conduct,which included any failure to change its warning,was not relevant to this case.supp,at.
the distinction drawn by the district court between permissible and impermissible uses of evidence regarding sulindac label is faithful to new hampshire law.that law recognizes that the effectiveness of a warning label is just one relevant factor in determining whether a product design is unreasonably dangerous,and that and claims are separate.leblanc,at,at in short,as the district court made clear,mutual was not held liable for failing to change its warning,at.
given the distinction that new hampshire draws between claims and claims,as well as the clear and repeated statements by the trial judge that mutual liability was not predicated on breaching a duty to label sulindac adequately,on what basis does the majority reach a contrary conclusion though the majority insists otherwise,ante,at,it appears to rely principally on an implicit assumption about rights conferred by federal premarket approval under the fdca.after correctly observing that changing sulindac chemical composition would create a new drug that would have to go through its own approval process,the majority reasons that mutual must have been under a duty to change its label because it had no other option to avoid liability while continuing to sell its product.ante,at.but that conclusion is based on a false premise.
a manufacturer of a drug that is unreasonably dangerous under new hampshire law has multiple options it can change the drug design or label in an effort to alter its profile,remove the drug from the market,or pay compensation as a cost of doing business.if federal law or the drug chemical properties take the redesign option off the table,then that does not mean the manufacturer suddenly has a legal obligation under state law to improve the drug label.indeed,such a view of state law makes very little sense here because even if mutual had strengthened its label to fully account for sulindac risks,the company might still have faced liability for having a defective design.see thibault,at,at explaining that strict liability may attach even though there was an adequate warning when a manufacturer can not change the label or when doing so would not make the drug safe,the manufacturer may still choose between exiting the market or continuing to sell while knowing it may have to pay compensation to consumers injured by its product 
from a manufacturer perspective,that may be an choice.but it is a choice that a sovereign state may impose to protect its citizens from dangerous drugs or at least ensure that seriously injured consumers receive compensation.that is,a state may impose such a choice unless the fdca gives manufacturers an absolute right to sell their products free from liability,or state law otherwise stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of federal objectives.crosby,at internal quotation marks omitted.because the majority does not rely on obstacle,it must believe that a manufacturer that received fda premarket approval has a right not only to keep its drug on the market unless and until the fda revokes approval,but also to be free from liability that makes doing so more expensive.that proposition is fundamentally inconsistent with the fdca text,structure,saving clause,and.see supra,at levine,at thomas,concurring in judgment.
it is simply incorrect to say that federal law presupposes that drug manufacturers have a right to continue to sell a drug free from liability once it has been approved.nothing in the language of the fdca,which is framed as a prohibition on distribution without fda approval,see a,suggests such a right.federal law itself bars the sale of previously approved drugs if new information comes to light demonstrating that the drug is dangerous to health and thus misbranded.see a,j see supra,at even outside that scenario,manufacturers regularly take drugs off the market when evidence emerges about a drug risks,particularly when safer drugs that provide the same therapeutic benefits are available according to the fda,while it has formal authority to withdraw approval for a drug based on new adverse information,see e,it is far more common for a manufacturer to stop selling its product voluntarily after the fda advises the manufacturer that the drug is unsafe and that its profile can not be adequately addressed through labeling changes or other measures.see brief.
new hampshire cause of action thus does no more than provide an impetus for an action that is permitted and sometimes encouraged or even required by federal law.
the majority derides any suggestion that mutual ability to stop selling sulindac is relevant to the validity of its impossibility defense.ante,at.but the majority argument is built on the mistaken premise that mutual is legally obligated by new hampshire law to modify its label in a way that federal law forbids.it is not.see supra,at.for that reason,rejecting impossibility here would not render the doctrine a dead letter or all but meaningless.ante,at,quoting mensing,at slip,at.on the other hand,it is the majority that work s a revolution in this court impossibility case law,ante,at,by inferring a requirement from the steps a manufacturer might wish to take to avoid or mitigate its exposure to liability.
not all products can be made safe for sale with an improved warning or a tweak in design.new hampshire,through its law,has made a judgment that some drugs that were initially approved for distribution turn out to be inherently and unreasonably dangerous and should therefore not be sold unless the manufacturer is willing to compensate injured consumers.congressional intent to such a cause of action can not be gleaned from the existence of federal specifications that apply to the product if it is sold.instead,whether new hampshire is depends on assessing whether it poses an obstacle to a federal policy to approve sulindac for use.yet the skips that analysis and instead finds impossibility where it does not exist by relying on a assumption that congress intended for mutual to have a way to continue selling sulindac without incurring liability.see ante,at.
the distinction between impossibility and obstacle is an important one.while obstacle can be abused when courts apply an overly broad conception of the relevant federal purpose to find,see levine,at thomas,concurring in judgment,it is a useful framework for a case like this one because it would at least lead the court to ask the right questions.
for example,properly evaluating the asserted conflict here through the lens of obstacle would allow the court to consider evidence about whether congress intended the fda to make an optimal safety determination and set a maximum safety standard in which case state tort law would undermine the purpose rather than a minimal safety threshold in which case state tort law could supplement it.see,williamson mazda motor of america,slip,at.by contrast,the majority overbroad impossibility framework takes no account of how federal drug safety review actually works.though the majority gestures to the rigorous nature of the fda review of new drug,ante,at,nothing in the majority reasoning turns on how the fda premarketing review operates or on the agency capacity to engage in postmarketing review.
in taking the approach it does,the majority replaces careful assessment of regulatory structure with an ipse dixit that pharmaceutical companies must have a way to escape liability,ante,at,while continuing to sell a drug that received fda approval.as a result,the effectively makes a highly contested policy judgment about the relationship between fda review and state tort law treating the fda as the sole guardian of drug safety without defending its judgment and without whether that is the policy judgment that congress made 
while the majority never addresses obstacle,mutual did argue in the alternative that bartlett cause of action is because it conflicts with the purposes and objectives of the fdca,as supplemented by the act,stat.though it presents a closer question than the impossibility argument on which the majority relies,i would reject mutual obstacle defense as well.
mutual most substantial contention is that new claim frustrates the policy the fdca broader scheme of vesting authority in the fda as an expert agency to determine which drug designs should enter and remain in interstate commerce.the fda,through an amicus brief filed by the united states,generally supports this argument.the fda states that the question whether a is is difficult and close,and it recognizes that s everal factors do weigh in favor of finding no preemption,including the absence of textual support in the fdca for the idea that an approved drug must be made available in any particular state.see brief.but the fda ultimately contends that claims are unless they parallel the fdca misbranding prohibition because the agency that permitting juries to balance the health risks and benefits of an drug would undermine the fda determinations and could reduce access to drugs that the fda has determined are safe and effective.
our cases have given some weight to an agency views about the impact of tort law on federal objectives when the subject matter is technica l and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.levine,at quoting geier american honda motor.but courts do not defe r to an agency conclusion that state law is,at,and the tension that the fda identifies in an effort to justify complete of claims for prescription drugs does not satisfy the high threshold that must be met if a state law is to be for conflicting with the purposes of a federal act,chamber of commerce of united states of america,whiting,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted see silkwood,at.given the fdca core purpose of protecting consumers,our recognition in levine that state tort law generally complements the statute safety goals,the practical limits on the fda ability to monitor and promptly address concerns about drug safety once a drug is in the market,see supra,at,and the absence of any federal remedy for injured consumers,i would reject this broad obstacle argument as well 
the most troubling aspect of the majority decision to once again expand the scope of this court traditionally narrow impossibility doctrine is what it implies about the relationship between federal premarket review and state remedies more generally.central to the majority holding is an assumption that manufacturers must have a way to avoid while keeping particular products in commerce.see ante,at.this assumption,it seems,will always create an automatic conflict between a federal premarket review requirement and liability because premarket review,by definition,prevents manufacturers from unilaterally changing their products designs that is true,for example,of the designs,the chemical composition of drugs under the fdca no less than it is for generic drugs.see ante,at.
if the creation of such an automatic conflict is the ultimate of the majority continued expansion of impossibility,then the result is frankly astonishing.congress adopted the fdca premarketing approval requirement in and then strengthened it in in response to serious episodes involving unsafe drugs.see future of drug safety.yet by the majority lights,the very act of creating that requirement in order to safeguard the consumer,united states sullivan,also created by operation of law a shield for drug manufacturers to avoid paying damages under state laws that are also designed to protect consumers.that is so notwithstanding congress effort to disclaim any intent to all state law.see supra,at.the majority reasoning thus has the perverse effect of granting broad immunity to an entire industry that,in the judgment of congress,needed more stringent regulation.riegel,at ginsburg,dissenting quoting lohr,at plurality opinion.
this expanded notion of impossibility threatens to disturb a considerable amount of state law.the fdca premarket approval process for prescription drugs has provided a model for the regulation of many other products in some statutes,congress has paired premarket regulatory review with express provisions that limit the application of state remedies,including,in some instances,claims for defective product design.see,riegel,at see supra,at,and.in other instances,such as with prescription drugs,it has not.under the majority approach,it appears that claims are categorically displaced either way,and congress efforts to set the boundaries of more precisely were largely academic.this could have serious consequences for product safety.state laws play an important role not only in discovering risks,but also in providing for manufacturers to remove dangerous products from the market promptly.see levine,at bates,at see also conk,is there a design defect in the restatement third of torts products liability yale,the tort system can encourage fda regulatory vigor and competence if manufacturers of products that require preapproval are given de facto immunity from liability,then the public will have to rely exclusively on imperfect federal agencies with limited resources and sometimes limited legal authority to recall approved products.and consumers injured by those products will have no recourse.
the manner in which congress has addressed with respect to vaccines is particularly instructive.v accines have been subject to the same federal premarket approval process as prescription drugs,and prior to congress intervention,compensation for injuries ha d been left largely to the states.bruesewitz wyeth llc,slip,at.in,in response to a rise in tort suits that produced instability in the vaccine market,congress enacted the national childhood vaccine injury act vaccine act,b.the act established a compensation program funded through an excise tax on vaccines to compensate individuals injured or killed by vaccine side effects.the quid pro quo for this system,the court stated in bruesewitz,was the provision of significant protections for vaccine manufacturers.at slip,at.
while members of this court disagreed on the scope of the tort protections the vaccine act was intended to offer,the act history demonstrates that congress is perfectly capable of responding when it believes state tort law may compromise significant federal objectives under a scheme of premarket regulatory review for products it wants to make available.and it illustrates that an important reason to require that preemption decisions be made by congress,rather than by courts on the basis of an expanded implied doctrine,is congress ability to tie its decisions to some alternative means for securing compensation.metzger,federalism and agency reform,colum.by instead reaching out to find in a context where congress never intended it,the majority leaves consumers like karen bartlett to bear enormous losses on their own.
the court recognizes that t his case arises out of tragic circumstances.ante,at.and i do not doubt that members of the majority personally feel sympathy for karen bartlett.but the court solemn affirmation that it merely discharges its duty to follo w the law,ante,at,and gives effect to congress policy judgment,rather than its own,is hard to accept.by once again expanding the scope of impossibility,the court turns congress intent on its head and arrives at a holding that is irreconcilable with our precedents.as a result,the court has left a seriously injured consumer without any remedy despite congress explicit efforts to preserve state liability.
i respectfully dissent.
we can thus save for another day the question whether a true system could give rise to impossibility.as we have noted,most causes of action for negligence and strict liability do not exist merely to spread risk,but rather impose affirmative duties.see riegel medtronic,in medtronic,lohr,five justices concluded that causes of action for negligence and strict liability do impose requirement s and would be by federal requirements specific to a medical device.we adhere to that view at absent other indication,reference to a state requirements includes its duties.as the plurality opinion said in cipollone liggett group,liability is premised on the existence of a legal duty,and a tort judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a obligation 
that mutual liability turned on the adequacy of sulindac warnings is n
