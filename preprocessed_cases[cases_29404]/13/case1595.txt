the new york state office of real property services orps and frank cernese,john bacheller,thomas griffin,and ifigenia brown the individual defendants appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant,denying their motion,based on eleventh amendment immunity,for judgment on the pleadings in a declaratory judgment action brought by csx transportation,csx.csx brought the action to enjoin orps and the individual defendants collectively,the state defendants from assessing,levying,or collecting ad valorem taxes on csx rail transportation property in new york state for the tax year.csx alleges in its complaint that the state defendants methods for assessing,levying,and collecting taxes on its property violates the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of the act or the act.in denying the state defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings,the district court concluded that the act was remedial legislation designed to abrogate eleventh amendment immunity of the states pursuant to congress powers under the fourteenth amendment and that,additionally,jurisdiction over the individual defendants could be maintained under the doctrine established in ex parte young.
for the reasons that follow,we join the three circuit courts of appeal that have considered this issue,and conclude that in passing the act congress abrogated the states eleventh amendment immunity pursuant to its fourteenth amendment equal protection powers,and that jurisdiction over the individual defendants is properly invoked under ex parte young.
background 
proceedings in the district court 
csx operates an interstate railroad comprised of hundreds of predecessor railroads,the oldest of which dates back more than years.csx operates in states,including new york,where it conducts its operations on taxable property in of new york counties.the state defendants are responsible for establishing annual railroad taxation ceilings for the various taxing districts in new york state.
the new york state taxing scheme that is the subject of this appeal has been contested for nearly ten years.on september,the consolidated rail corporation conrail brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against various defendants including the state board of equalization and assessment of the state of new york predecessor to orps and some of its employees collectively the sbea,seeking to enjoin them from imposing state property taxes that were allegedly calculated in violation of the act on railroad properties for the tax year see consol.rail town of hyde park,cir.on january,the district court granted conrail motion for a preliminary injunction,finding,inter alia,a likelihood of success on the merits,and certified the defendant class.id.at.the sbea appealed from the district court orders,and we affirmed the preliminary injunction and certification on january.id.at.thereafter,on november,the district court first reached one of the questions presented here whether the act was a valid abrogation of the states eleventh amendment immunity.the district court held that it was.the court concluded that the abrogation of the states eleventh amendment immunity was properly based on the authority conferred by section of the fourteenth amendment however,that question was never raised on appeal because sometime in the parties settled conrail claims retroactively for tax years through,and prospectively for the tax years through 
thereafter,csx became the successor to a portion of the conrail railroad property that was the subject of the settlement.see csx,state office of real prop,d.pursuant to statute,the sbea was succeeded in by orps,which retained the same powers as the sbea.see real prop.tax.
on february,csx filed suit seeking preliminary and final injunctive relief against the state defendants and a proposed defendant class comprised of all taxing jurisdictions in which csx operates in its complaint,csx alleges that the state defendants have assessed and plan to assess its properties in new york state at a rate at least percent higher than the ratio of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the districts in which it operates,in violation of the act.accordingly,csx sought to enjoin the state defendants and the putative defendant class from assessing or levying taxes against it for the tax year.the state defendants filed their answer on march,raising eleventh amendment immunity as one of their defenses.the following day,the district court certified the defendant class pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.on april,the state defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c on the grounds that the relief sought by csx was barred by the eleventh amendment,and also that ex parte young did not permit suit to be maintained against the individual defendants.on may,the district court held oral argument on the state defendants motion,at which time csx sought by order to show cause a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the state defendants from issuing final certifications of railroad ceilings for the tax year.that same day,the district court granted a temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing on the order to show cause application for a preliminary injunction on september.
in a memorandum and order dated july,the district court denied the state defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings.the district court found that the act was passed in in order to address and concerns that a pattern of discriminatory conduct was evident in the conduct of the states taxation practices with respect to interstate railroad transportation property.csx,d at.accordingly,the district court held that in passing the act,congress had validly abrogated the states eleventh amendment immunity through its enforcement powers under section of the fourteenth amendment.as to the availability of jurisdiction against the individual defendants,the district court explained that the doctrine of ex parte young remains viable despite question ing by some commentators.id.at.the court also found that jurisdiction could be invoked under ex parte young because the individual defendants are quite demonstrably connected to the unlawful act of state discriminatory taxation of railroad real property.id.the district court explained that in hyde park this court held that although as a formal matter each taxing district in new york makes its own determination of the final assessed value of railroad property,realistically,when the state agency determines the railroad ceiling it is making an assessment within the meaning of the act.id.citing hyde park,at.the district court held that such a finding was,b esides its precedential value,law of the case.id.
on august,the state defendants filed a timely appeal,and on september,the district court entered an order continuing the temporary restraining order and adjourning the return date of the preliminary injunction motion until days after entry of the mandate of the united state circuit court of appeals for the second circuit or such other day and time as the court may direct.
ii.orps and taxation of railroad property in new york 
orps is an executive department of the government of the state of new york charged by statute with the administration of various matters pertaining to real property taxation in new york.see real prop.tax.although local property taxes in new york are imposed by individual assessing units orps is empowered with the general supervision of the function of assessing throughout the state.id.e.orps is the successor to the sbea,which was formed in as a temporary commission in order to deal with a legislative concern that the then existing equalization rates had gradually been rendered inaccurate by increases in property values during economic inflation during the aftermath of world war ii.state bd.of equalization and assessment kerwick.the new york legislature reconstituted the sbea as a permanent agency in.town of smithtown moore.
under new york law,railroad property receives a partial tax exemption based on a railroad ceiling.a railroad ceiling is the maximum value on which a tax district may levy real property taxes on railroad real property railroad real property is exempt from ad valorem taxation imposed by assessing units to the extent that its assessed value exceeds the railroad ceiling.see real prop.tax.among its many duties,orps is responsible for determining the ceilings.see id,m.the following procedure is used to determine railroad ceilings for interstate railroad companies.first,orps determines the average railway revenue and expenses.id.a.using those figures,orps determines the ratio of railroad revenues to railroad expenses the ratio.id.b.the amount of the ratio is then used to determine the economic factor,which is calculated on the basis of a sliding scale id.c.next,orps determines the local reproduction cost.id.d.once those figures have been determined,orps multiplies the local reproduction cost by the economic factor.id.the resulting figure is then multiplied by the state equalization rate,which is the percentage of full value at which taxable real property in a county,city,town or village is assessed as determined by the state board.id.see also id.the resulting figure is the railroad ceiling for the assessing district.
iii.the act 
congress passed the act in,following some fifteen years of legislative consideration,to provide the means to rehabilitate and maintain the physical facilities,improve the operations and structure,and restore the financial stability of the railway system of the united states.burlington oklahoma tax comm n,d quoting pub,stat.states were given a grace period,until february,to bring their property taxation systems into compliance with the statutory requirements of the act.id.at.one of the specific aims of the act was to combat what congress determined to be discriminatory of the railroads by the states.see,explaining that railroads are by at least million each year.when drafting the act,congress was aware that the railroads are easy prey for state and local tax assessors in that they are nonvoting,often nonresident,targets for local taxation,who can not easily remove themselves from the locality.dep t of revenue of oregon acf,d internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,congress prohibited states from engaging in certain acts that unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce.b.
simply put,the act prohibits a state or its subdivision from assessing railroad property at a higher percentage of the property true market value than the percentage applied to other commercial and industrial property.id.under the act,a state or its subdivision may not 
assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.
levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under paragraph of this subsection.
levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on rail transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.
impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part.
id.b.the act provides that the federal courts shall have concurrent subject matter jurisdiction with state courts over any violations of the act however,r elief may be granted only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value of rail transportation property exceeds by at least percent the ratio of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.id.c.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we note at the outset that we have jurisdiction over the issues raised on this appeal because an order denying a state claim of eleventh amendment immunity falls under the collateral order doctrine,which allows immediate appellate review in certain circumstances of what would otherwise be a decision.mancuso state thruway authority,cir see also.whether a state is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment is a question of law that we review de novo.cooper,at.
ii.eleventh amendment immunity 
the eleventh amendment provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.in addition to its explicit restriction of suits by citizens of another state,the eleventh amendment has been construed to protect an unconsenting state from suit by its own citizens.see edelman jordan,d hans louisiana.the supreme court has explained that eleventh amendment immunity is an important aspect of our federal system of government in that it assures that each state is a sovereign entity in our federal system and that it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to suit by any individual litigant without the sovereign consent.seminole tribe florida,d.
however,the supreme court teaches that eleventh amendment immunity is not absolute.first,a state may waive its sovereign immunity and agree to be sued in federal court.see atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.such a waiver must be an unequivocal indication that the state intends to consent to federal jurisdiction that otherwise would be barred by the eleventh amendment.id.second,congress may abrogate a state sovereign immunity if it unequivocally expresse s its intent to abrogate the immunity,and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of power.seminole,at.csx does not argue that new york has consented to be sued.csx does argue that in passing the act congress abrogated new york immunity from suit.
to determine whether a federal statute properly subjects a state to suit in federal court,we first apply a simple but stringent test congress may abrogate the states constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.dellmuth muth,d quoting atascadero,at.this requirement is clearly satisfied here because section of the act explicitly vests jurisdiction not only in the state courts,but also in the district court s of the united states to prevent a violation of the act.accordingly,congress intent to abrogate the states immunity is clear.
the parties vehemently contest the answer to our next inquiry whether the act was passed pursuant to a valid exercise of power.the parties opposing positions on this issue can be traced to the supreme court pronouncements in seminole.there,the court held that congress could not abrogate a state eleventh amendment immunity e ven when the constitution vests in congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area because article i of the constitution can not be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.at.seminole made clear that congress may not abrogate state immunity pursuant to its commerce clause powers.see bd.of trustees of of garrett,d.however,seminole recognized that the fourteenth amendment operated to alter the balance between state and federal power achieved by article iii of the constitution and the eleventh amendment,at,and that of the fourteenth amendment allow s congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by the eleventh amendment,id.at.
given the supreme court holding in seminole,it is not surprising that the parties here have starkly opposing positions as to the constitutional authority invoked by congress in passing the act.the state defendants argue that the act was a classic exercise of congress commerce power and was not action taken in response to any record of arbitrary or invidious discrimination by the states against railroads in tax administration,of the kind that would violate the equal protection clause.thus,the state defendants argue that subject matter
