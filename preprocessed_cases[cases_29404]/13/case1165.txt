timothy wrobel appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the western district of new york curtin,dismissing on summary judgment his first amendment claims brought under against his former employer,erie county,and certain employees.because wrobel failed to adduce evidence that his mistreatment was caused by political association or by speech about matters of public concern,we affirm.
wrobel was a longtime employee of erie county highway division.in,a newly elected republican county executive appointed the defendants as wrobel direct and indirect supervisors.over the next eighteen months wrobel with them resulted in harassment of him and his transfer to a faraway workplace.his direct supervisor,defendant douglas naylon,repeatedly referred to employees that predated his tenure as being part of the old regime,and to the office under his supervision as the new regime.following his transfer,wrobel made anonymous complaints to public officials and a confidential report to the fbi,for which he claims he was further persecuted.wrobel complaint alleges retaliation in violation of his first amendment rights to free association and free speech.the thrust of the complaint is that wrobel suffered discrimination because he was apolitical,and not politically aligned with the new regime.because we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that wrobel mistreatment was caused by any political inactivity we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.
background 
timothy wrobel worked as a blacksmith at a highway maintenance facility of the erie county highway department called the aurora barn.in,republican joel giambra succeeded democrat dennis gorski as erie county executive.the new administration hired defendant naylon as the senior highway maintenance engineer at the aurora barn,in charge of activities,including direct oversight of wrobel and the other employees defendant rider was hired to run the entire highway department.
the record on summary judgment is extensive,but the salient facts can be summarized.immediately after the defendants were hired by the county,wrobel and his coworkers clashed with them.in january,wrobel confronted naylon about what he perceived to be rudeness and disrespect.naylon responded that the trouble with the aurora barn was wrobel and other workers from what naylon labeled the old regime,and suggested that wrobel should transfer to another facility.
a few months later,wrobel received written notice to appear for a disciplinary hearing on six charges insubordination stemming from the january confrontation,falsifying his daily reports,leaving the without permission,lateness,excessive breaks,and personal use of his work phone.the upshot of the disciplinary hearing was that rider transferred wrobel to another maintenance facility,the tonawanda plant.the transfer greatly lengthened wrobel commute,and the stress of this ordeal caused him to miss work for several weeks.
although wrobel admitted to some of the misconduct,he grieved the discipline on the ground that it was actually punishment for his friendship with naylon predecessor and that naylon work expectations were unrealistic.an arbitrator ruled for the county,finding that t he grievant seemed determined to function as an independent contractor,and that wrobel justified his occasional tardiness because no one ever complained to him about it.
soon after wrobel transfer,his wife joined with some of his former colleagues to expose naylon and rider mistreatment of county workers,as well as other improper behavior they believed to be taking place in the highway department,such as misusing public funds and operating county equipment while intoxicated.in may,the group sent letters about the aurora barn signed only by concerned erie county employees to the state democratic chairman and the new york state attorney general complaining about the state of affairs at the aurora barn.wrobel wife also followed naylon with a camera to catch him misusing county equipment.in august,wrobel and others met with an fbi agent to float similar allegations about naylon.
wrobel alleges that naylon and rider punished him for speaking out against them.specifically,naylon harassed him,told him to tell his wife to stay away from all county buildings,and accused him of being in contact with a former aurora barn employee.shortly after his transfer to the tonawanda plant,an erie county sheriff questioned wrobel about a theft of wood from the aurora barn,and wrobel alleges that the defendants inspired the inquiry.
during his tenure at the highway department,naylon was overt in his dislike for those who had preceded him in the aurora barn and his desire to purge the facility.early on,naylon asked wrobel,as a year veteran of the highway department,to advise as to who were the good guys and bad guys,who were the employees that do their jobs and who are the goof offs.wrobel demurred and told naylon that he would soon figure it out himself.a few months later,naylon ordered wrobel to tell a retired employee,gary kane,to stop coming by the aurora barn.naylon told wrobel that it does look good for me and joel giambra and the new administration.he retired from the gorski administration,tell him to be on his merry way and enjoy himself.naylon referred to kane as part of an old regime.
two former employees of the aurora barn similarly suffered under naylon management.anthony marchitte was transferred from the aurora barn to the angola barn against his will,after being told the transfer was in his best interests.naylon gloated the fat cat has just begun to sing all you guys are going to be gone things are really going to change around here.wrobel friend timothy elliott was also transferred from the aurora barn in early.before his transfer,naylon called him into his office and told him that everything has to go through us,that was the old regime,this is the new regime,and if you not with us,you against us.
other employees provided similar accounts.paul rebrovich was asked by naylon if he was appointed by gorski,and whether he was backed by the gorski administration or the current administration.rebrovich told him that nobody in his position was appointed by an administration and that he had never been politically active.naylon also boasted to him that,eventually,we going to get our own people in here and get rid of this old regime.
wrobel deposition recounts a single instance in which political affiliation was discussed.on naylon first day on the job,he asked wrobel about his political affiliation,and wrobel told him that he was a republican as was naylon.elliott likewise reported a single instance before his transfer out of aurora,naylon said to him we know you guys are all democrats,hired by the other administration.
wrobel complaint alleged relevant to this appeal that defendants violated his first amendment right to freedom of association by harassing him because of his political association with the previous county administration and first amendment right to freedom of speech by retaliating against him for speaking about matters of public concern taking place within the erie county highway department.an earlier panel of this court found that both claims were adequately pleaded.see wrobel cnty.of erie,cir.after discovery closed,defendants successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground that wrobel had adduced insufficient evidence to raise a question of fact on either claim.
discussion 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see costello city of burlington,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate when the evidence is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.kulak city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
public employees do not surrender their first amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest by virtue of their acceptance of government employment.cobb pozzi,cir citing pickering bd.of,d.the first amendment right extends to associational conduct,including the decision not to support or affiliate with a political party or faction.id.at.c onditioning public employment on the provision of support for the favored political party unquestionably inhibits protected belief and association.rutan republican party of illinois,d internal quotation marks omitted.to succeed on a first amendment claim brought pursuant to section,a plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that the conduct at issue was constitutionally protected,the alleged retaliatory action adversely affected his constitutionally protected conduct,and a causal relationship existed between the constitutionally protected conduct and the retaliatory action.see camacho brandon,cir.
the first amendment is thus violated when state officials engage in quintessential political patronage,as when a county sheriff sought to fire republican deputies to provide jobs to democrats,see elrod burns,d plurality opinion when a public defender sought to dismiss republican assistants based on party affiliation,see branti finkel,d and when a governor was giving permission for the hiring,transferring,promotion,and recalling of only state employees who were democrats,see rutan,at.
the protection of these cases has been extended to politically neutral employees who are treated less favorably than employees politically aligned with those in power,see welch ciampa,cir gann cline,cir galli new jersey meadowlands comm n,cir,as well as to employees who suffer because of their political support of a losing faction of the party in power,see mccloud testa,cir.
however,not every association of a public employee can support a section claim.when employee expression can not be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices,without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the first amendment.connick myers,d.only if an employee speech or associational conduct touches on a matter of public concern can a first amendment claim proceed.cobb,at accord klug chi.sch.reform bd.of,cir boals gray,cir.conduct that falls outside this class of activity is beyond the scope of the first amendment protections for public employee speech.see ezekwo health hosps,cir n ot all speech by a public employee can provide the basis for a constitutional cause of action.the requirement reflects both the historical evolvement of the rights of public employees,and the common sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.connick,at.whether association or speech is on a matter of public concern is a inquiry nevertheless it is a question of law for the court to decide.see lewis cowen,cir.
wrobel characterizes his associational conduct as not pledg ing his support for the giambra administration and cho osing not to affiliate himself politically with it.appellant br.in wrobel first appeal,we decided that retaliation for such conduct,if adequately proven,could give rise to section liability.wrobel.at.accordingly,we now consider only whether the evidence submitted on summary judgment is sufficient to raise a question of material fact,such that a jury could find that wrobel did in fact engage in associational conduct related to a matter of public concern,and that defendants mistreated him as a result of that conduct.
the dispositive issue for wrobel free association claim is the causal relationship between the association identified and his transfer.to prove that his political indifference was the reason naylon and rider mistreated him,he relies principally on naylon references to an old regime and a new regime.assuming that this designation does in fact distinguish between employees brought in by naylon and those already there when he arrived,there is no evidence or available inference that this distinction is political in the sense that it relates to any political,social,or other community concern.see connick,at.wrobel submitted evidence that naylon questioned him about his friends at work,ordered him to tell a friendly former to stay away from the aurora barn,and blamed the old regime for difficulties at the aurora barn.nothing in the record demonstrates that the dysfunction at the aurora barn was related to anyone political association.the record shows instead a toxic form of office politics that,no matter how severe or how reprehensible,does not violate the first amendment.see klug,at.wrobel alleges no more than generalized references to a heightened standard of performance in the wake of a change of political regime.that is simply to be expected when the voters replace one set of managers with another the call it reform.naylon passing references to a new regime and an old regime,without more,can not transform incompetent and management into a violation of the first amendment.
wrobel points to one sentence of timothy elliott affidavit,quoting naylon as stating we know you guys are all democrats,hired by the other administration.this statement is not enough to create an issue of material fact as to whether wrobel was being retaliated against for protected associational conduct naylon knew wrobel to be a republican.and the content of the elliott affidavit renders any inference in wrobel favor even more implausible.naylon also told elliott that we forming a new team and i want to know if you going to be on my team.this invitation is incompatible with the idea that naylon was rejecting employees on the basis of partisan favoritism.
the record does support wrobel assertion that he did not pledge support for or politically align himself with the giambra administration.that association,however,is a non sequitur in the context of this case.wrobel was never asked to donate to,volunteer for,or lend support to any political candidate when naylon was his supervisor.other than being a registered republican the same as naylon and rider,he had no political affiliation or alliance at the office,and never discussed politics with anyone at the office.true,an employee can no more be discriminated against for being apolitical than for being a member of the wrong political party.see morin tormey,cir.however,the record must still support the fact that such a political association exists.wrobel cites no evidence showing that any employee did politically align with or pledge allegiance to the giambra administration,how an employee would do that,or how he would be rewarded for doing so.
there is good reason to hold the plaintiff to his burden of proof in a free association case such as this.new administrations and officials will often be brought into office specifically because of dissatisfaction with the status quo,and may be expected to implement reforms.old employees,especially those in jobs or facilities,will often be let go to make room for employees who are more capable,trusted,or enthusiastic.there is record evidence that naylon and others believed the aurora barn to be troubled.it is to be expected that employees affected by a new regime may resist reform measures regardless of political loyalties.moreover,in a reform context,it is to be expected that employees will be fired,demoted,or transferred soon after the change in administration,with the result that there is temporal proximity between the change in regime and the adverse employment action.
absent evidence that the adverse employment action was politically motivated,the first amendment gives a court no license to intervene in a public workplace whenever a new administration redeploys its workforce.evidence of political motivation can take different forms.in cases of patronage,the record will often reveal that the plaintiffs were replaced by members or supporters of the ascendant party,or treated less favorably.see,elrod,at.this is so even if the associational conduct was the decision not to politically associate.see welch,at plaintiff replaced by vocal supporter of prevailing faction galli,at plaintiff told by superior that her office was letting republicans go,that some democrat obviously wants the spot,and that one has to pay to play with this administration alterations in galli.evidence of poli
