a decade and a half ago,nadia ferran and her son,mark ferran,the ferrans embarked on a campaign against numerous town and county officials and private individuals,contending that the had violated the ferrans constitutional rights by interfering in their use and enjoyment of certain parcels of land they owned in rensselaer county,new york.over the years,in orders dated august,and october,the district court whittled down the parties and claims,a process which culminated in a final order and judgment dated september,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york scullin,granting summary judgment to the remaining and dismissing the action in its entirety.the ferrans appeal from all three orders,as well as a november,denial of their motion for reconsideration.
on appeal,the ferrans have made a number of arguments,many of which they did not raise before the district court.in addition,they have waived their,discrimination,and defamation claims,as they are not raised on appeal.see losacco city of middletown,cir.none of the arguments before us have merit,and we agree in nearly all respects with the district court reasoning disposing of the claims.bearing in mind that we may affirm on any basis for which there is sufficient support in the record,including grounds not relied on by the district court,see shumway united parcel service,cir,we include the following discussion so as to supplement the district court analysis with respect to the substantive due process and petition clause claims against the town of nassau.
background 
in,the ferrans,appearing pro se,filed a complaint against neighbors john richardson,joanne richardson,and janet alleman nadler,as well as the town of nassau the town and town officials,including robert whitney,former town supervisor bernard clifford,then town supervisor george flemings,former town highway superintendent joseph meizenger,then town highway superintendent ruth bridgham,former town attorney and henry goeble,town justice.also named in the complaint were the county of rensselaer the county and the county highway department,as well as county officials ralph colongione,deputy county engineer,and john toma,county highway supervisor and william gonzales,a new york state trooper.the ferrans charged that the,from to,separately and in concert,committed various acts that interfered with their use,possession,and enjoyment of a portion of their acres of land located in the terrace gardens subdivision of the town of nassau,rensselaer county,new york.the parcel of land at issue,marked reserved for parking on a subdivision map of terrace gardens,is approximately feet wide at its northern end,fanning out at its southern end to approximately feet wide where it borders the burden lake shoreline.the western side of the parcel borders van patten road,a public road maintained by the town.
the ferrans complaint asserted the following causes of action an equal protection claim a takings claim under the fifth amendment a due process claim under the fourteenth amendment a claim under the petition clause of the first amendment and a claim of unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment.the complaint also asserted three separate causes of action for conspiracy under a claim under a claim that nadia ferran was discriminated against on the basis of her gender and disability the disability of bereavement and state law claims for slander,defamation,and interruption of the life of a disabled person.these causes of action stemmed from various acts allegedly committed by the.for example,the ferrans asserted that john and joanne richardson,who owned a parcel of land bordering the ferrans reserved for parking area,had encroached upon the ferrans property by parking vehicles and storing firewood there.the ferrans claimed that they had called the police,complained to town officials,and petitioned the town court about the richardsons misuse of their property.instead of resolving the problem,however,the various town and county officials allegedly conspired with the richardsons by responding that the reserved for parking area had been in the public domain for over thirty years.
most relevant to our decision here,the ferrans contended that the town had illegally widened van patten road when it paved the road,thereby encroaching on the reserved for parking parcel.they also contended that town snow plows would sometimes turn around at the lower part of the right of way,using some of the reserved for parking strip of land.in anticipation of a defense of easement,the ferrans argued that such use did not transform that strip of land,or the reserved for parking parcel,into a town road or public easement.in short,they asserted that t he section of van patten road adjacent to the plaintiffs property is not a public highway,nor is any part of plaintiffs parcel adjacent to van patten road a public highway.in addition,without elaborating,the ferrans alleged that all of the had deprived them of their right to petition the state of new york for the redress of grievances.
in,the county,town,and individual filed separate motions to dismiss pursuant to.b and b.the ferrans moved for permission to amend their complaint.the district court granted the motions to dismiss,dismissed the complaint against trooper gonzales for failure to serve him process,and denied the ferrans request for leave to file an amended complaint.the ferrans appealed.we affirmed the lower court dismissal of the ferrans claims as duplicative of their claims,but remanded for further proceedings,holding that the district court had abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs request for leave to file their amended complaint.ferran town of nassau,cir.we directed the district court to consider the threshold issue of whether the ferrans owned the subject properties,suggesting that the court might abstain in order to permit the state law question of what land was conveyed to the ferrans by tax deed to be resolved in state court.id.at.once the state court action was resolved,the ferrans federal action would either become moot or their property rights would be established.if the federal action proceeded,we suggested that the district court might require the ferrans to file an amended complaint before addressing the merits of the action id.we also noted that the statute of limitations had not run on incidents that deprived plaintiffs of their property rights for those incidents that occurred after september.id.
subsequently,the ferrans initiated a state court action to determine their property interests and,in july,the district court stayed the federal court action.the record on appeal,however,contains no information about the ferrans state court suit,such as who they sued and what claims they asserted.as the district court later observed,that state court proceeding was ultimately dismissed for defendants failure to answer and plaintiffs failure to prosecute.given that the state court proceeding had not addressed the ownership issue presented in the federal action,the district court discovery and motion filing deadlines in january.
in may,the ferrans submitted a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of land interest.the county,individual county officials,and janet nadler for summary judgment,and the town and individual town officials for partial summary judgment.
a.the district court august,order and january,hearing 
in denying the ferrans motion for partial summary judgment,the district court pointed out that the town had changed its position in the litigation it no longer asserted an ownership interest in the reserved for parking area.instead,the town claimed an easement under new york highway law.in response,the ferrans conceded that part of van patten road had become a public highway by virtue of its use by the public and maintenance by the town,but charged that the town had 
expanded its maintenance of the road beyond that which is permitted by law,that the road does not extend into the whole of the reserved for parking parcel,and that the neighbors have used the parcel for reasons other than in violation of plaintiffs rights as property owners.
based on these cont
