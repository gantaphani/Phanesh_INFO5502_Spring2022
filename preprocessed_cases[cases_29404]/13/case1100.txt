plaintiffs shawn michael vincent and jimmie johnson et,former new york state state prisoners who brought separate actions in the district court and whose appeals have been consolidated in this court,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york,david larimer,judge,dismissing vincent second amended complaint complaint and jimmie johnson amended complaint complaint collectively the complaints against officials and employees of the new york state department of correctional services docs and the new york state division of parole parole division or division collectively docs and parole officials.the complaints,brought under for damages and declaratory relief,alleged that defendants violated plaintiffs due process rights as announced in hill united states ex rel.wampler.wampler,and described in earley murray,cir.earley i,reh g denied,cir earley ii,cert.denied,d,by administratively imposing and enforcing conditions of supervision on plaintiffs following their release from prison,despite the absence of any order for such supervision by the courts that sentenced plaintiffs for their crimes.the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss the complaints pursuant to.b,ruling that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the unconstitutionality of the administrative imposition of such supervision was not clear prior to earley i,and state cases decided after earley i made it unclear that administrative imposition of such conditions was unconstitutional.plaintiff sean earley,whose appeal was heard in tandem with those of vincent and jimmie johnson,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,frederick scullin,judge,granting summary judgment dismissing,also on the basis of qualified immunity,earley second amended complaint complaint asserting similar claims for damages against most of the same corrections and parole officials.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend principally that the defendant docs and parole officials are not entitled to qualified immunity because earley i determined that the rights asserted by plaintiffs had been sufficiently clearly established decades earlier by wampler.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that earley i,an appeal from the denial of habeas corpus,did not rule that those rights were clearly established by wampler with respect to a defense of qualified immunity but we conclude that earley i itself,decided on june,did clearly establish the unconstitutionality of the administrative imposition or enforcement of postrelease conditions that were not judicially imposed.accordingly,and for the reasons that follow,we vacate so much of the judgments of the district courts as dismissed claims that defendant anthony annucci,docs executive deputy commissioner and counsel,administratively imposed,enforced,or supervised employees who imposed or enforced,such conditions on any plaintiff after that date.we affirm the judgments to the extent that they dismissed plaintiffs claims against the other defendants.
background 
plaintiffs are persons who were convicted of various new york state crimes committed on or after september,were sentenced to prison terms that they served,and were released from prison at various times between and mid.it appears to be undisputed as to each plaintiff that,either during his term of imprisonment or upon his release from prison,he was informed that he was subject to postrelease supervision prs conditions of which he had not been informed by the court and which were not stated in the written order of commitment.most of the plaintiffs were reincarcerated following determinations that they had violated their prs conditions.see part.below.
the named defendants in each of the three complaints collectively the complaints include five docs officials and four parole division officials.the defendant docs officials in addition to annucci are identified as follows brian fischer,commissioner since january,richard desimone,associate counsel in charge of the office of sentencing review lucien leclaire,former acting commissioner from august,to december,and glenn goord,former commissioner from to august.the defendant parole division officials are identified as henry lemons,the division chairman and chief executive officer since february,and three defendants who formerly held those positions george alexander from to robert dennison from to and brion travis from to.the remaining named defendant,bruce yelich,as superintendent of the bare hill correctional facility,is named only in the caption of the vincent complaint and is nowhere mentioned in the body of the complaints.
although some of the defendants were originally sued in both their individual and official capacities,the claims in the vincent and jimmie johnson actions were withdrawn,leaving claims against them in those two actions only in their individual capacities.
postrelease supervision in new york 
in,the new york legislature passed a sentencing reform act or the act commonly known as jenna law which,inter alia,established a scheme of determinate sentencing for violent felony offenders,eliminated parole for all such offenders,and required that determinate terms of imprisonment be followed by periods of mandatory postrelease supervision.people catu,catu.the section of the act at issue here provided in pertinent part that 
e ach determinate sentence also includes,as a part thereof,an additional period of supervision.a violation of any condition of supervision occurring at any time during such period of supervision shall subject the defendant to a further period of imprisonment of at least six months and up to the balance of the remaining period of supervision,not to exceed five years.
laws ch,codified at penal law mckinney emphasis added,amended by laws ch,codified at penal law mckinney requiring that the required prs term be stated by the court when imposing sentence see also id.mckinney,amended by laws ch,codified at penal law mckinney providing,with certain exceptions,a maximum term of five years prs.the legislature intended postrelease supervision to be a distinct but integral part of the determinate sentence,catu,at,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
following the effective date of jenna law and until the revision of in,some judges did not inform defendants who were pleading guilty that they would be subject to prs,a failure that the new york court of appeals in catu ruled unconstitutional,see id.at,at.and in some cases the defendants commitment orders likewise did not mention prs.
docs position in the present actions is that its understanding during the relevant period was that prs was imposed automatically by operation of the act and did not need to be expressly imposed by a sentencing judge.see,january,memorandum of law in support of defendants motion to dismiss vincent complaint at docs position is that it has not added anything to plaintiff sentence docs has simply enforced a consequence of the plaintiff determinant sic sentence which is automatically effectuated pursuant to the penal law.defendants brief in appeal at.thus,docs regularly noted periods of prs in the records of prisoners who had not been expressly sentenced to such a term by the sentencing courts,but who nevertheless should have had such a term imposed under mandatory prs provisions.see generally declaration of anthony annucci dated july,annucci decl,in support of summary judgment against earley.
earley i and ii 
in,following a plea of guilty,earley was sentenced to six years imprisonment.neither prior to the entry of his guilty plea nor at his sentencing was he informed that he was subject to a term of prs,and his commitment order did not refer to prs conditions.docs administratively added a period of prs to his sentence.as detailed in part.below,after his release from prison,earley violated the terms of his prs and was reincarcerated.having challenged the prs provision unsuccessfully in state administrative and judicial proceedings,earley sought federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that the imposition of prs administratively by docs violated his due process rights.although the district court initially denied earley habeas petition,this court in earley i concluded,applying the standard required by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,that clearly established supreme court precedent render ed the prs term added to earley sentence by docs invalid,at.
earley i observed that s eventy years ago,the supreme court established that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is controlling it is this sentence that constitutes the court judgment and authorizes the custody of a defendant.id.at citing wampler.we noted that wampler differed from earley case,in that the condition imposed in wampler was discretionary,whereas state law required that earley be sentenced to a prs term.id.emphasis added.however,we noted that wampler had 
articulate d a broader holding the judgment of the court establishes a defendant sentence,and that sentence may not be increased by an administrator amendment.wampler therefore provides clearly established supreme court precedent supporting earley claim.see also greene united states,d quoting wampler assertion that the only sentence known to the law is the sentence or judgment entered upon the records of the court the only cognizable sentence is the one imposed by the judge.any alteration to that sentence,unless made by a judge in a subsequent proceeding,is of no effect.
earley i,at emphases added.
noting that p supervision,admitting of the possibility of revocation and additional jail time,is considered to be custody,id.citing jones cunningham,d parole satisfies the in custody requirement for habeas petitions,we stated that 
t he sentence imposed by the court on earley was six years in prison.the judgment authorized the state to incarcerate him for six years and no more.any addition to that sentence not imposed by the judge was unlawful.
earley i,at emphasis added.we concluded that t he state court determination that the addition to earley sentence by docs was permissible is therefore contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.id.at.
we rejected the state contention that because prs was mandated by statute it was necessarily part of earley sentence by operation of law.id.noting that new york law provided procedures for correcting sentences that were invalid as a matter of law and that t he state could have moved to correct earley sentence through a judicial proceeding,in his presence,before a court of competent jurisdiction,we stated that 
when docs discovered the oversight made by earley sentencing judge,the proper course would have been to inform the state of the problem,not to modify the sentence unilaterally.
earley i,at.we thus remanded for the district court to grant earley habeas petition,if timely,because we determined that new york modification of earley sentence violate d clearly established federal law.id.at.
in earley ii,we denied the state petition for rehearing which argued that new york law automatically includes a period of prs in every determinate sentence,at,and that new york courts regularly fail to inform defendants of mandatory prs terms but consider them part of those defendants sentence nonetheless,id.at.we reiterated 
when the sentence as imposed by the sentencing judge is purportedly altered to reflect something other than the sentence imposed,the source of that alteration is immaterial.whether it is docs administrators or the operation of new york law that works the alteration,the alteration is of no effect.
id.at emphasis added.
the fact that new york law mandates a different sentence than the one imposed may render the sentence imposed unlawful,but it does not change it.the sentence imposed remains the sentence to be served unless and until it is lawfully modified.
id.emphasis added.
whatever conceptualization has about the function of new york penal law sections and,they can not operate to undermine protections contained in the federal constitution.and as wampler requires the custodial terms of sentences to be explicitly imposed by a judge,any practice to the contrary is simply unconstitutional and can not be upheld.
id.at emphases added.
c.the decisions of the district courts in the present actions 
the complaints alleged,on information and belief,that the docs defendants knew that plaintiffs had not been sentenced by the sentencing courts to prs.vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint.all of the complaints alleged that the docs defendants unlawfully and unconstitutionally devised and promulgated a docs policy of administratively adding a prs period to prisoners records even if the sentencing court had failed to mention prs.see,vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint earley complaint.plaintiffs alleged that the policy was maintained,supervised,and enforced by each of the defendants throughout their respective tenures as state officials.vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint earley complaint.
plaintiffs alleged,on information and belief,that the parole division defendants likewise knew that plaintiffs had not been sentenced by the sentencing courts to prs see vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint earley complaint and that those defendants established and implemented a policy of treating prisoners whose sentences did not include mention of prs as though they had been sentenced to a period of post release supervision by the sentencing court vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint earley complaint.they alleged that each of the parole division defendants enforced this policy during his tenure as the division chairman and chief executive officer.vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint earley complaint.
dismissal of the complaints 
the vincent action and the action by jimmie johnson and nine other plaintiffs,filed in the western district of new york,sought damages and declaratory relief.defendants moved to dismiss the complaints in those actions pursuant to,inter alia.b,principally on the grounds that defendants had no personal involvement in the imposition of prs on the plaintiffs,that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations,that the claims were barred by the eleventh amendment,and that the claims failed because defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court consolidated the cases for purposes of its decision and granted the motions to dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity.
the court looked to the law on this issue as it stood in and before february,by which time prs had been administratively imposed on nine of the ten plaintiffs,and held that the unconstitutionality of docs administrative imposition of prs pursuant to penal law was far from well settled at that time.vincent yelich,d,vincent i.
to the contrary,in the seven years that had passed since penal law enactment,new york appellate courts had consistently and uniformly endorsed the automatic imposition of prs by docs,regardless of whether prs was ever specifically ordered by the sentencing court 
the issue of whether penal law created a prs requirement that could b e applied only by sentencing judges was not addressed at the federal level in this circuit until june.in the matter of earley murray,cir,the second circuit considered the issue for the first time,and held that a term of prs was not enforceable unless it had been pronounced by the sentencing judge on the record.
vincent i,d at.in light of the favorable state case law that existed in new york at the time,the court concluded that a reasonable state official would not have been on notice that the administrative imposition of prs violated plaintiffs rights.id.at.
the district court in vincent i also found that qualified immunity was appropriate for the docs defendants imposition of prs terms on prisoners even after the earley i decision,noting that for two years after the earley federal court case was decided,new york state courts did not always follow its holding and that some instead held that docs could still administratively mandate periods of prs pursuant to jenna law,even in the absence of an explicit imposition of prs by a sentencing judge.vincent i,d at emphasis added.the court found that it was not the earley i decision,but decisions by the new york court of appeals in that established the temporal boundary of qualified immunity for docs officials alleged to have administratively imposed prs.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for all of plaintiffs claims.the court did not address the other grounds asserted by defendants for dismissal.
dismissal of earley complaint 
in earley case,brought in the northern district of new york,defendants similarly moved to dismiss earley complaint pursuant to rules b and arguing principally that earley claims were barred by the eleventh amendment and that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from the claims.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation.as defendants attached documents to their motion to dismiss,the magistrate judge converted the motion to one for summary judgment.
the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity because prs was administratively imposed on earley some six years before earley i was decided.see earley annucci,cv,wl,at.the magistrate judge also recommended that qualified immunity be recognized with respect to earley claim that docs should have removed his prs term in the wake of earley i.the magistrate judge noted that docs had no authority nor affirmative legal duty,much less a clearly established one,to seek to have a defendant resentenced,or to unilaterally revoke the prs it had administratively imposed,until the law was changed in june.wl,at see corr.law d mckinney supp imposing an affirmative duty on the part of docs officials to notify sentencing courts of persons who were not sentenced to prs terms but who should have been so sentenced under.
the district court accepted the magistrate report and recommendation,and granted summary judgment to the defendants.see earley annucci,cv,wl.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend principally that the district court erred in ruling that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the administrative imposition and enforcement of prs terms against plaintiffs,arguing that the right not to have any postrelease supervision imposed except by a judge was clearly established by wampler in,and that earley i stands as the law of this circuit that wampler established the unconstitutionality of any administrative enhancement of a criminal sentence beyond what the sentencing court pronounced brief on appeal at earley brief on appeal at.for the reasons that follow,we reject these characterizations of both wampler and earley i however,we conclude that earley i itself,in june,clearly established that the administrative imposition of prs terms not imposed by the court is unconstitutional.we conclude further,that as to annucci the only defendant discussed in plaintiffs briefs on appeal the dismissals as a matter of law on the basis of qualified immunity on the present record were inappropriate.
principles of qualified immunity 
qualified immunity,an affirmative defense on which the defendant officials bear the burden of proof,see,gomez toledo,d harlow fitzgerald,d sudler city of new york,cir sudler,protects public officials performing discretionary functions from personal liability in a civil suit for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,lore city of syracuse,cir quoting harlow,at.
an objective standard 
a public official,when sued in his individual capacity,is entitled to qualified immunity from a claim for damages if the conduct attributed to him was not prohibited by federal law,see,county of sacramento lewis,d siegert gilley,d or where that official action was so prohibited,if the plaintiff right not to be subjected to such action was not clearly established at the time it was taken,anderson creighton,d quoting harlow,at.a right is clearly established when t he contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.jackler byrne,cir quoting anderson,at,cert.denied.
qualified immunity provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d emphasis added.but the inquiry turn s primarily on objective factors absent extraordinary circumstances,i f the law was clearly established,the immunity defense ordinarily should fail,since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct.harlow,at.
because the immunity not only protects against a judgment for damages but also is in part an entitlement not to be forced to litigate,mitchell forsyth,d forsyth,early resolution of the qualified immunity defense is encouraged,see,harlow,at.where the nonexistence of a constitutional right may be discerned from the face of the complaint,an official defendant sued in his individual capacity may be granted a dismissal on the ground of qualified immunity pursuant to rule b,a decision that we review de novo,accepting as true all material allegations of the complaint,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.see,scott fischer,cir scott see generally ashcroft iqbal,d.where there are no genuinely disputed factual issues material to the qualified immunity defense,a defendant may move for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff claim on that basis.see,forsyth,at.on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we review the record de novo,viewing it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.
when the right at issue here became clearly established 
plaintiffs urge us to rule that the right not to be subjected to prs without having that punishment imposed by the court was established by wampler.see brief on appeal at,earley brief on appeal at.that contention is foreclosed,however,by prior decisions of this court.as discussed in part above,earley i dealt with the aedpa principle that a federal court may not grant habeas unless the state court adjudication of the claim was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d.it was in that context that earley i ruled that the principle that punishment for a crime could not properly be imposed administratively but could only be imposed by the court had been clearly established by the united states supreme court in wampler,see earley i,at.that aedpa question is not the same as whether a federal right is clearly established for purposes of denying an official qualified immunity the conclusion that a legal proposition was clearly established for purposes of its application by professional state court judges does not require a conclusion that it was clearly established in the qualified immunity context,which governs the conduct of government officials who are likely neither lawyers nor legal scholars.scott,at.we thus ruled in scott that earley i holding did not mean that the wampler principle that there was a right not to be subjected to administratively imposed prs was clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,scott,at.indeed,most of the plaintiffs recognize that earley i did not address whether the plaintiff rights were clearly established for purposes of the qualified immunity defense brief on appeal at.scott went on to hold also that wampler itself neither clearly established that right nor was a clear harbinger of that right.see scott,at see also sudler,at we see no reason why wampler,a case that does not on its face mention the constitution,could have given the sudler defendants notice that administrative alteration of a sentence is in violation of an inmate due process rights,any more than it could have given the defendants in scott notice of the same.scott and sudler are the law of this circuit,and a panel of the court has no authority to overrule them.see,e,piesco koch,cir howe commissioner,cir,cert.denied,d.
earley i itself,however,in dealing with the precise conduct at issue in the present cases the administrative imposition of prs on a prisoner who has not had that condition imposed on him by the sentencing court applied wampler and plainly held such an imposition of prs to be unconstitutional.we inferred in earley i that the principles announced in wampler were based in the due process guarantees of the united states constitution,earley i,at see also earley ii,at adher ing to our view that the inclusion of prs in earley sentence when that prs was not included in the sentence imposed at earley sentencing hearing violated his rights under the due process clause of the united states constitution.although we noted in earley i that state law required that earley be sentenced to a prs term,at,we held that,as stated in wampler,it is t he judgment of the court that establishes a defendant sentence,and that sentence may not be increased by an administrator amendment,earley i,at emphasis added.we stated that 
i f,as in wampler,an erroneous order of commitment prepared by the clerk of court with the court knowledge can not alter the sentence imposed by the court,then plainly a later addition to the sentence by an employee of the executive branch can not do it.only the judgment of a court,as expressed through the sentence imposed by a judge,has the power to constrain a person liberty.
id.emphasis added.
thus,having noted that earley prs term had been administratively added by docs rather than imposed by the court,id.at,the earley i court stated that t he sentence imposed by the court on earley was six years in prison.the judgment authorized the state to incarcerate him for six years and no more.any addition to that sentence not imposed by the judge was unlawful,id.at emphasis added see also id.at holding the prs term added to earley sentence by docs invalid id.the state court determination that the addition to earley sentence by docs was permissible is therefore within the meaning of aedpa contrary to clearly established federal law.
we conclude that earley i itself clearly established that where the court has not included prs in a defendant sentence,docs may not add that term without violating federal law.
defendants do not and could not plausibly argue that earley i itself was ambiguous or that annucci who was then docs counsel and deputy commissioner did not understand earley i holding when it was announced.earley,in opposition to summary judgment,submitted to the district court a transcript of the following testimony given by annucci in another case 
q you were aware of the second circuit decision in earley murray at the time it came out in.correct 
q i would assume you did not agree with that decision 
a i think that is a safe assumption.
q but you were aware of it 
q and you were aware that the second circuit indicated that docs did not have the authority to add a period of supervision,if it was not included by the sentencing judge 
a that is correct.
state myers.albany county,hearing transcript,june,myers tr,at emphases added.
instead,defendants argue,as they did in the district courts,that decisions by some of the new york state courts subsequent to earley i cast doubt on earley i holding.we left unanswered in scott w hether earley itself sufficed clearly to establish the unconstitutionality of administratively imposed prs for a reasonable new york state correctional official in light of decisions issued by courts of the new york appellate division that thereafter continued to find the practice constitutional.scott,at.today,we answer scott question in the affirmative.
some state court decisions rejected earley see people edwards,wl,at,quinones state of new york department of corrections,misc d.albany.others distinguished earley i for reasons that do not apply in the instant case.see people thomas,dep t,aff after modification sub nom.people sparber,sparber ii people lingle,dep t,aff after modification sub nom.sparber ii,people sparber,dep t sparber i,aff after modification.at least one was entirely silent on the constitutional issue raised by earley i,instead finding a challenge to the administrative imposition of prs barred on a statutory procedural ground.see garner new york state department of correctional services,dep t garner i,rev,garner ii.however,none of the state court decisions cited by defendants demonstrates any confusion about whether earley i prohibited docs from imposing prs.
defendants thus provide no reason to believe that earley i was unclear in its holding.for a right to be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,it is sufficient if decisions of the supreme court or of the appropriate circuit have defined the contours of the right with reasonable specificity.tellier fields,cir quoting russell coughlin,cir emphasis ours.our decision in earley i did so we stated that new york department of correctional services has no power to alter a sentence,earley i,at emphasis added.
as a general matter,f ederal constitutional standards rather than state law define the requirements of procedural due process t he fact that the state may have specified its own procedures that it may deem adequate for official action,does not settle what protection the federal due process clause requires.russell coughlin,at quoting vitek jones,d.state court decisions that rejected earley i holding could not disestablish the federal right to due process for the purposes of qualified immunity analysis.see,hopkins bonvicino,cir a decision by a state court contrary to a holding of this court can not unsettle or the clarity of federal law because we begin our inquiry by looking to binding precedent and i f the right is clearly established by decisional authority of the supreme court or this circuit,our inquiry should come to an end.emphasis in hopkins other internal quotation marks omitted.because earley i explicit ruling that new york department of correctional services has no power to alter a sentence clearly established the contour of the right plaintiffs seek to vindicate,our inquiry ends there.
the district court in vincent i also found qualified immunity appropriate on the ground that absent contrary direction,state officials are entitled to rely on a presumptively valid state statute until and unless the statute is declared unconstitutional,vincent i,d at quoting vives city of new york,cir.we agree with the principle.but that presumption can not be relied upon once the federal court of appeals for the circuit in which the officials operate has ruled that the exact conduct of the official,undertaken on the basis of the state statute,violates federal law.
although we note that qualified immunity may sometimes be available where a decision of the supreme court or this court has announced a constitutional principle and subsequent cases have differed as to the reach of that holding,see,safford unified school district redding,d,such instances usually involve fact patterns that differ.here,however,the very conduct that is challenged in the present cases is the conduct that was held unconstitutional in earley indeed,it was held unconstitutional with respect to one of the present plaintiffs.
defendants also argue that it did not become clearer to them see defendants brief in appeal at s ome of this confusion was resolved emphasis added defendants brief in earley appeal at same that docs administrative imposition of prs was unlawful until april,when the new york court of appeals decided sparber ii,and garner ii.those cases decided that the administrative imposition of prs was impermissible under new york law.see,sparber ii,at,at,see also id.at,at,noting that the united states court of appeals for the second circuit decision in earley murray,held that docs administrative addition of a prs term not pronounced by the supreme court violated federal due process guarantees id.at.
the fact that it was not until that the new york court of appeals declared the administrative imposition of prs on prisoners who had not been so sentenced judicially to be unlawful under state law,however,did not affect the invalidity of such impositions under federal law,which was announced in earley i in.state and local officials are required to comply not just with state law but with federal law as well.
plaintiffs arguments with regard to annucci 
defendants also argue that this court in scott,and in other cases following scott that were decided by summary order,confirmed state officials entitlement to qualified immunity for claims of wrongful confinement following the improper imposition of prs,defendants brief in appeal at see id.at.we reject the contention that scott affirmance of the dismissal in that case is controlling in the present cases,for insofar as the qualified immunity defense is concerned,the factual allegations in the present cases are significantly different from those in scott,at least as to claims against annucci.
first,in scott the complaint itself did not assert that docs failed to relieve scott of the prs conditions imposed on her in or to remove prs from her record.rather,we noted that 
t he only allegation contained in the complaint that addresses the doc defendants purportedly unconstitutional actions with respect to scott prs is that they adopted,approved,ratified the imposition of mandatory prs on individuals such as plaintiff sentenced to determinate terms of imprisonment in new york state courts but not sentenced to mandatory prs.compl.
scott,at emphases added.we stated that,even read liberally the challenge is directed at the administrative imposition of prs,not the failure to take action to remove it after it was imposed.id.as to the one claim asserted in the scott complaint,qualified immunity was appropriate because doc s practice of administratively imposing prs began shortly after enactment of the prs statute in prs was imposed on scott in,see id.at and,as discussed in part.above,the unlawfulness of docs administrative imposition of prs was not clearly established before the issuance of our decision in earley i,see scott,at.
the complaints in the present cases although flawed as was scott in their challenges to the i adoption of the docs policy differ from scott in that they challenged the enforcement of administratively imposed prs see,vincent complaint,jimmie johnson complaint,earley complaint.
second,scott went on to consider an assertion that was made only in opposition to the motion to dismiss and not in the complaint,that the docs defendants had violated scott due process rights by not taking action to release her from custody after she was returned to prison for prs violations,see at.however,the scott court noted that there were no allegations in the complaint that would support a conclusion that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to known violations of scott rights indeed,scott complaint did not even assert that the doc defendants themselves knew whether her prs had been imposed administratively or judicially.id.at.
here,in contrast to the complaint in scott,the complaints alleged that defendants knew that plaintiffs had not been sentenced to prs by the sentencing court,vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint.plaintiffs here also allege that defendants have continued,beyond the scope of their authority vincent complaint,jimmie johnson complaint,earley complaint,see also earley complaint citing earley i,to enforc e prs while knowing that enforcement deprive s plaintiff of rights secured by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution vincent complaint,see jimmie johnson complaint,earley complaint,see,jimmie johnson complaint,alleging enforcement against various plaintiffs in.
the most glaring difference between scott and the present cases,however,is simply that in scott,annucci was not a defendant.in contrast,all of the present complaints named annucci as one of the defendants and all of the present complaints focused principally on annucci role as docs legal counsel and alleged that he has been and continues to be responsible for ensuring that department of correctional services personnel obey the constitution and laws of the united states.vincent complaint jimmie johnson complaint earley complaint.further,the record,even as modestly developed as it was before the dismissal of earley complaint,contains supporting information as to annucci relevant responsibilities.in the state myers transcript submitted to the district court by earley,annucci testified i n my capacity as the head of counsel office i am responsible for all of the legal services necessary for the operation of the state prison system myers tr.see also annucci decl.in a docs press release submitted to the district court by earley,docs described annucci as having served as the agency chief legal advisor since and as coordinat or of the work of the entire agency with respect to intergovernmental,legislative and various operational and program issues.declaration of wade eaton dated june,exhibit a docs press release at.
although scott concluded with respect to the defendants sued in that case that there was no pleaded basis on which to rule that earley i obligated any of those defendants unilaterally to revoke scott prs,scott,at,we read earley i as affording the state two alternatives.our earley i ruling,in consequence of our conclusion that the administrative imposition of prs by docs was unconstitutional,was that if earley habeas corpus petition was timely,the term of supervision must be excis ed from earley sentence,and earley must be reliev ed of any subsequent penalty or other consequence of its imposition,at emphases added but we added that nothing in our ruling barred the state from,instead,having earley resentenced by a court to include the mandatory prs conditions,see id.in sum,earley,who was then in prison for violating the administratively imposed prs terms,see id.at,was entitled,unless he was resentenced,to be released from docs custody.
we think it clear from these alternatives that,with respect to persons on whom prs had been imposed administratively,the state was required either to have them resentenced by the court for the imposition of prs terms in a constitutional manner or to excise the prs conditions from their records and relieve them of those conditions.indeed,on remand from earley i,the district court,after finding earley habeas petition timely,ordered the required habeas relief,but stayed the judgment for a period of time in order to permit the state court to rectify the constitutional violation by conforming earley sentence to the requirements of new york prs statute.see earley murray,cv,wl,at may.
while we do not suggest that agencies other than docs,such as district attorneys offices,could not seek to have the courts conduct such a permissible resentencing,we think it clear that doc s,which a unconstitutionally imposed prs,b was custodian of the records in which prs was imposed and from which prs was required to be excised in the absence of appropriate resentencing,and c resumed custody of persons who violated the unconstitutionally imposed conditions and were penalized for those violations by reimprisonment,had an obligation to at least attempt to cease its administrative and custodial operations that had been held to violate federal law.
as annucci was coordinat or of the work of the entire docs agency with respect to intergovernmental issues docs press release at,it appears to be among his duties to seek a resolution of the prs issues among docs,the prosecutors,and the courts by attempting,through direct or indirect communication with the courts,to have persons who should,under new york substantive law,have had prs imposed as part of their sentences,resentenced by the court in order to impose those terms in compliance with the due process required by the constitution of the united states.
the present record does not indicate that annucci took prompt action in light of earley i to end its custody of persons who were being unconstitutionally punished for violating prs terms administratively imposed by docs.the allegations of the present complaints,taken as true,show that these plaintiffs had prs imposed on them administratively by docs.and,as set out in part ii.below,at least half of these plaintiffs,as punishment for violations,were reimprisoned after the decision in earley i.it is unclear whether
