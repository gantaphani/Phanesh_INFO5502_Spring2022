michael breen,a police officer in the town of north branford,and the town of north branford the town appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut dominic squatrito,adopting the recommended ruling of united states magistrate judge thomas smith and denying defendants motion for summary judgment.margaret cowan,administrator of the estate of victoria cooper,sued breen and the town pursuant to,alleging that breen used excessive force in fatally shooting cooper.breen and the town moved for summary judgment,arguing that breen was entitled to qualified immunity because when he shot cooper,he had an objectively reasonable belief that his life or person was in danger.the town also argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on cowan monell claims the recommended ruling of magistrate judge smith denied summary judgment to breen and the town,on the ground that there were genuine issues of material fact to be tried as to the circumstances confronting breen when he shot cooper and as to cowan monell theories of liability.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
a.the shooting of cooper 
this suit arises out of events that took place in the early morning hours of july.many of the facts leading up to the shooting are undisputed.that morning,breen was on patrol in his police cruiser.as he passed the xtramart store in north branford,a parked camaro with two occupants aroused his suspicion.breen decided to monitor the vehicle and had its license plate checked by the police dispatcher.the dispatcher reported that the vehicle was registered to john guerrette,who had a prior criminal history.when the camaro left the parking lot,breen followed it eastbound onto route.after noticing some erratic driving,breen turned on his flashing lights,pulled the camaro over onto the shoulder of the road,and parked his police cruiser behind it.at that point route was a road.breen then approached the front passenger side of the vehicle.breen asked the driver,later identified as steven guerrette,to provide his driver license and vehicle registration.guerrette stated that he did not have his license with him,and that the car was registered to his brother.breen then asked the passenger,later identified as victoria cooper,for her license,but she indicated that she was not carrying identification.breen had no further communication with cooper.breen ordered guerrette out of the camaro and asked him to step to the rear of the car.after a search of guerrette revealed that he was carrying a substance that resembled narcotics,breen attempted to arrest him.guerrette,however,broke away and ran easterly along route into a wooded area next to the roadway.breen pursued guerrette and called for backup,but his portable radio was dead.breen eventually lost guerrette in the woods.giving up the chase,breen headed west on route to return to his cruiser.
at this point,the accounts of what happened diverge.according to breen,as he walked back on route to his police cruiser,the camaro came towards him with its headlights on.cooper had moved from the passenger seat and was now driving the car.breen asserts that he waved his arms,signaling the vehicle to stop,but to no avail.he claims that,fearing for his safety,he drew his service weapon and fired twice at the car.the first shot hit the camaro hood.the second shot went through the driver side window,killing cooper.
breen claims that cooper could have avoided him by turning left off the road,or making a.breen also argues that gunshot residue found on the driver side of the camaro shows that breen was very close to the car when he fired the second shot.his expert estimates,from the pattern of broken glass scattered down the road,that the camaro was traveling at about miles per hour at the time of the second shot.
cowan offers a different version of the facts.she claims that the evidence suggests breen was not in danger when he fired the second,fatal shot at cooper.first,cowan points to evidence showing that breen was over to the side of the vehicle,perhaps as far away as feet,when he fired the second shot.this calculation comes from the reconstruction of the scene by the connecticut state police,which showed that breen fired the first shot from a distance of about feet at a angle.the reconstruction also revealed,based on the location of the bullet shells and the pattern of broken window glass,that the camaro was on the far right shoulder of the road when the shots were fired.and breen deposition testimony confirms that the vehicle made no turns to the left or right as it traveled down the roadway.plaintiff cowan claims that the evidence demonstrates that the vehicle was traveling quite slowly as it came towards breen,and may not even have been moving at all.a neighbor who saw the police cruiser out of her window and heard the shots fired said in a deposition that breen was standing in front and to the left of the police cruiser when he fired the shots.from this,cowan argues that breen may have shot cooper before the camaro had moved even a few feet.moreover,according to cowan,the record shows that breen could not have waved at the approaching car.cowan argues that if the camaro were traveling at the speed breen expert estimated to miles per hour the reconstruction evidence shows that it would have covered the distance between where it had been parked and where breen fired the second shot in about six to seconds.cowan contends that in such a short period of time,breen would not have been able to wave his hands,unsnap his holster,draw his firearm,and aim and fire.additionally,in response to breen argument that cooper could have turned left or made a to avoid him,cowan argues that cooper probably did not even see breen,since an optometrist report indicates that cooper had poor night vision and depth perception.
b.the district court denial of summary judgment 
despite the disputed versions of the shooting,breen and the town moved for summary judgment,arguing that the court should follow the analysis set forth in saucier katz,d.breen and the town argued that this analysis would lead the court to conclude that no constitutional violation had occurred and that,in any event,breen was entitled to qualified immunity.defendants also contended that the analysis should proceed under the fourteenth rather than the fourth amendment because there was no seizure in this case.additionally,the town argued that it was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff cowan monell claims,which were based on two theories of liability the town failed to train breen properly and the town double taps policy,encouraging police officers always to shoot twice,violated cooper constitutional rights.
magistrate judge smith,in his recommended ruling,did not address whether analysis should proceed under the fourteenth or fourth amendment,nor did he follow the steps set forth in saucier.instead,he held that there were disputed issues that precluded summary judgment 
where the officer was standing,whether it was in the zone of danger,the speed and velocity of the camaro,and the reasonableness vel non of the officer alleged belief that he was in danger are issues which,among others,preclude summary judgment.any decision on the defense of qualified immunity necessarily must await the presentation of evidence to the jury.
with respect to the monell claims,the magistrate judge ruled that cowan theories of liability presented genuine issues of material fact for a jury.judge squatrito,in his order,adopted the recommended ruling without engaging in the saucier analysis or determining whether the case should proceed under the fourth or fourteenth amendment.this appeal by breen and the town followed.
ii.discussion 
to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must show that there are no genuine issues of material fact,and that when any disputed facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the party,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.kerman city of new york,cir.breen argues to us that he was entitled to summary judgment because,based on the undisputed facts in the case,no constitutional violation occurred since his conduct in these circumstances was objectively reasonable and in any event,he was entitled to qualified immunity because he reasonably believed that his conduct was lawful.breen also contends that the failure of both the magistrate judge and the district judge to conduct a saucier analysis on the qualified immunity defense mandates reversal and remand.the town argues that judgment should be entered in its favor because if breen is not liable,it can not be held liable either.
cowan argues first that we do not have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.on the merits,cowan contends that the evidence is disputed,and assuming her version of the facts and construing all inferences in her favor,as we must on this interlocutory appeal from a denial of defendants motion for summary judgment,a reasonable juror could conclude that breen use of force was objectively unreasonable.cowan also claims that the failure of the magistrate and the district judge to conduct a full saucier analysis does not constitute reversible error.
we consider each of these arguments in turn,reviewing the district court decision to deny summary judgment de novo.see kerman,at.
jurisdiction over interlocutory appeal 
ordinarily,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable because such a decision is not a final judgment.ex rel.estate of vargo,cir.but interlocutory appeals are encouraged in qualified immunity cases because,as the supreme court has emphasized,the qualified immunity issue should be resolved early in the proceedings since qualified immunity protects an officer from suit.saucier,at.the denial of a motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity is thus immediately appealable,but only to the extent that the district court denial turns on an issue of law.see behrens pelletier,d johnson jones,d martinez simonetti,cir.
cowan argues that we do not have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal because the district court denial of summary judgment was not based on an issue of law,but was based on a determination that genuine issues of material fact existed.however,even where the district court rules that material disputes of fact preclude summary judgment on qualified immunity,we may still exercise interlocutory jurisdiction if the defendant contests the existence of a dispute or the materiality thereof,or contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity even under plaintiff version of the facts.tierney davidson,cir see,at salim proulx,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction over the appeal to the extent it is based on either the undisputed facts or the version of the facts presented by cowan,and we will disregard any disputed facts or facts that contradict cowan version of the events.see,at 
b.the qualified immunity test 
in saucier katz,at,the supreme court made clear that in excessive force cases,claims of qualified immunity should be evaluated in the following manner.the threshold question is whether the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show a constitutional violation.id.at.hope pelzer,d.the inquiry is whether the alleged use of excessive force was objectively reasonable.see graham connor,d salim,at.thus,claims that an officer made a reasonable mistake of fact that justified the use of force are considered at this stage of the analysis.stephenson doe,cir.if the plaintiff fails to establish a constitutional violation,the qualified immunity inquiry ends and the plaintiff may not recover.saucier,at.if,however,a constitutional violation can be shown,the court must then determine whether the constitutional right was clearly established at the time of the constitutional violation.id.this inquiry focuses on whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.resolution of this inquiry is purely legal in that it depends upon whether the law put the officer on notice that his conduct would be clearly unlawful.stephenson,at we have said that the ultimate legal determination of whether qualified immunity attaches to a law enforcement agent actions is a question of law better left for the court to decide.quoting warren dwyer,cir.this inquiry adds a further dimension to the qualified immunity analysis by acknowledging that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct.saucier,at.and it ensures that all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law are protected from suit.malley briggs,d.we use saucier as a guide as we turn to the merits of breen appeal.
c.the merits of breen appeal 
breen argues that no constitutional violation occurred,and that even if there was a constitutional violation,he is entitled to qualified immunity.as explained above,whether a constitutional violation occurred focuses on whether the officer conduct was objectively reasonable.thus,if the analysis focuses on whether an officer made a reasonable mistake of fact that justified his conduct,what is being examined is whether there was a constitutional violation,not whether the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.saucier,at.stephenson,at.whether the officer is entitled to qualified immunity is resolved by the latter part of the saucier analysis,which looks at an officer mistake as to what the law requires,saucier,at.stephenson,at.thus,when breen argues that his conduct was objectively reasonable,appellant br.at,his contention is that there was no constitutional violation.when he argues instead that even if there was a constitutional violation he is entitled to qualified immunity,then his contention must be that his belief that his conduct was lawful was reasonable.see stephenson,at qualified immunity is a difficult concept it looks to the reasonableness of an officer belief that he acted lawfully after the officer is found to have been unreasonable in his conduct.
did breen violate cooper constitutional rights 
on the initial inquiry of whether a constitutional violation occurred,an officer decision to use deadly force is objectively reasonable only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others,at see tennessee garner,d where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others,the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.the reasonableness of the officer decision depends only upon the officer knowledge of circumstances immediately prior to and at the moment that he made the decision to employ deadly force.salim,at.in this case,resolution of whether a constitutional violation occurred centers on whether at the moment breen decided to fire at the camaro,he reasonably believed that the approaching vehicle put his life or person in danger breen argues that at the moment just prior to pulling the trigger,the undisputed facts demonstrate that he reasonably believed that his life was in danger,appellant br.at,and that therefore there was,as a matter of law,no constitutional violation.but in order to accept breen argument that,as a matter of law,his actions were objectively reasonable,one would have to accept,as a matter of fact,that the camaro was bearing down on him as he waved his hands,signaling cooper to stop.such facts are in dispute.
although breen purports to rely only on the undisputed evidence in demonstrating that there was no constitutional violation of cooper rights,his brief on appeal is replete with his own versions of the events,at as already noted,to the extent breen version of the events is disputed by cowan,breen version forms no proper basis for this appeal.id.instead,to review the district court interlocutory ruling,where the versions of the facts differ,we must consider cowan version and make all permissible inferences in her favor.
as discussed,cowan presents evidence that the camaro cooper was driving was traveling slowly that breen was not in front of the vehicle but substantially off to its side when he fired the second,fatal shot that he did not wave his ha
