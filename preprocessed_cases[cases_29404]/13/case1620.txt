after receiving anonymous allegations that an employee reasonably suspected to be gary leventhal was neglecting his duties in the accounting bureau of the new york state department of transportation dot,dot investigators,without leventhal consent,printed out a list of the file names found on leventhal office computer.the list of file names contained evidence that certain software was loaded on leventhal computer.this led to additional searches confirming that leventhal had a personal tax preparation program on his office computer and to disciplinary charges against leventhal for misconduct.after settling the disciplinary charges,leventhal sued,challenging the legality of the searches and of two employment actions taken against him.
we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants,its denial of leventhal cross motion for summary judgment,and its dismissal of the complaint.even though,based on the particular facts of this case,leventhal had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his computer,the searches were reasonable in light of the dot need to investigate the allegations of leventhal misconduct as balanced against the modest intrusion caused by the searches.with respect to the challenged employment actions,leventhal constitutional due process rights were not violated by his loss of a provisional job appointment and his failure to receive a discretionary salary increase because neither involved property or liberty interests protected by the fourteenth amendment.because we find that the dot did not violate leventhal fourth or fourteenth amendment rights,there is no need for us to address whether defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit.
background 
leventhal began his career at the dot in.at the time of the searches in question,leventhal had risen to the position of principal accountant in the accounting bureau of the dot,a grade position.in,and for several previous years,leventhal maintained a private tax practice while employed at the dot.he received dot approval to make up on weekends or after normal work hours any time he missed because of his outside employment.in order to receive approval for this arrangement,leventhal declared that his outside employment would not interfere with the complete and proper execution of my duties with the department of transportation.
dot policies and procedures 
the dot had a written policy prohibiting theft.the policy broadly defined theft to include 
improper use of state equipment,material or vehicles.examples include but are not limited to conducting personal business on state time using state equipment,material or vehicles for personal business improper use of the mail,copiers,fax machines,personal computers,lincs codes or telephones and time spent on business related activities during the workday.
during the dot interrogation of leventhal after the searches of his office computer,leventhal acknowledged that using dot equipment for private purposes was a violation of dot policies.
the dot also had an unwritten rule that only standard dot software could be loaded on dot computers.although this rule was never officially promulgated as a dot policy,leventhal remarked during his interrogation that the stated policy was that employees were not to have personal software on a dot computer without permission.nevertheless,it was known that the staff of the accounting bureau had loaded unlicensed copies of software on dot computers and used the software to perform activities due,at least in part,to the dot inability to purchase needed software for its employees.the dot also had an official policy restricting office internet access to dot business.
in july,the dot circulated a memo from ann snow,the network administrator for the budget and finance division,which stated that only original,licensed copies of software could be installed on dot computers.following the distribution of this memo,however,leventhal supervisors discussed their difficulties in complying with the memo because of the department dependance upon the use of unlicensed software.leventhal immediate supervisor at the time,john chevalier,instructed his subordinates,including leventhal,that they could continue to use software for departmental business.
dot computers were accessible,for certain limited purposes,by those other than their normal users.the computer support staff of the dot engaged in troubleshooting and the upgrading of individual computers.during these maintenance operations,it was possible for the computer staff to observe whether dot software had been loaded on an individual computer.dot computers were also occasionally accessed without the user knowledge to retrieve a needed document,sometimes bypassing a password prompt to obtain access.the computer staff of the dot provided technical support for leventhal dot computer upon his request three or four times between and,and once,after hours,without his request,in order to change the name of the server.
b.the anonymous letter to the inspector general 
on october,the new york state office of the inspector general referred to the dot an anonymous letter it had received complaining of abuses at the dot accounting bureau.this letter described specific employees by reference to their salary grades,genders,and job titles,without providing names.the letter made certain allegations concerning a grade employee.leventhal was the only grade employee in the office at that time and,therefore,the dot investigators inferred that the grade employee described in the letter was leventhal.the relevant portion of the letter states 
the abuse of time and power is so far out of line with the intended functions of the bureau that to cite all specifics would be an endless task.the day to day operation of this bureau is a slap in the face to all good state workers.you have to see this place to believe it.i will cite a few examples.a grade who is late everyday.the majority of his time is spent on business related phone calls or talking to other personnel about personal computers.he is only in the office half the time he is either sick or on vacation half the time of a grade is spent playing computer games and talking on the phone to his family or talking sports to one his subordinates,the guy who sleeps at his desk a grade with an apparent alcohol problem who is so incompetent that his supervisor allows him to sleep at his desk.the grade is aware of this problem.when the grade is not sleeping he is playing computer games or drafting up letters which are typed by another grade,who is barely able to function at an entry level clerical position and the sad part is that management knows what is going on although they would deny it if you asked them i think its sic time for some new leadership in the bureau.
c.the dot searches 
lawrence knapek,the assistant commissioner of the dot for the office of budget and finance,met with john samaniuk,the acting director of the office of internal audit and investigations,and gary cuyler,the chief investigator for that office,to discuss how to respond to the allegations made in the letter.they decided that the office of internal audit and investigation would conduct an investigation employing such techniques as reviewing telephone records,reviewing computer records,internet logs,that kind of thing.a computer review was ordered for all of the employees who could be identified from the letter.this involved printing out a list of file names found on these dot computers to determine whether any contained software.after business hours on october,the investigators entered leventhal office through an open door,turned on his dot computer,and reviewed the directories of files on the computer hard drive.there was no password to gain access to leventhal computer,but once the machine was turned on,some of the menu selections that appeared were.in order to perform their search,the investigators may have used a,a disk which allows the computer to start up without encountering the menus normally found there.
having located the computer directories,the investigators printed out a list of the file names to enable the later identification of the programs loaded on leventhal computer without having to open each program.this included a printout of the names of the hidden files on leventhal computer.these hidden directories,the investigators found,contained morph,a type of drawing program and ppu,a program suspected of containing tax software because of file names such as,and.on the non hidden directories,the investigators found other software,including the programs prodigy,quicken,and lotus suite although one part of lotus suite was standard dot software at the time.over the next two months,the investigators reviewed the computers of other management personnel of the accounting bureau,including the accounting bureau director,john chevalier,and three grade employees,glenn walker,john defrancesco,and herbert whitmarsh.
in february,dot management and investigators met to examine the results from these searches.assistant dot commissioner knapek attended the meeting and,aware of leventhal private tax practice,was particularly interested in confirming the investigators suspicion that leventhal had loaded tax software on his dot office computer.they decided to conduct a further search of leventhal computer to determine with greater certainty whether the ppu directory they had discovered during the first search was part of a tax preparation program.investigators reexamined the computer in leventhal office once in february and twice in april.during these subsequent searches,they copied the morph and ppu directories onto a laptop computer,obtained additional printouts of the file directories,and opened a few files to examine their contents.in the first april search,an investigator noticed that some items had been added to the ppu directory since the previous search,indicating recent activity.the ppu directory was later identified as belonging to pencil pushers,a tax preparation program.
on may,shortly after informing leventhal that he was under investigation and that the computer in his office would be confiscated,the director of the dot employee relations bureau observed leventhal appearing to delete items from his computer directories.leventhal was then interrogated.he admitted to belonging to a group that had jointly purchased a single copy of the pencil pushers software that was then copied onto his computer and the computers of other members of the group.leventhal also admitted that he had printed out up to five personal income tax returns from the computer in his dot office.
d.the disciplinary proceeding against leventhal 
in september,the dot brought disciplinary charges against leventhal under civ.serv.law charging six grounds of misconduct or incompetence the dot designated a private attorney as a hearing officer to take evidence and make recommendations to the commissioner of the dot,who would then review these recommendations and issue a decision in conformity with civ.serv.law.the hearing officer began by holding a hearing concerning the admissibility of the evidence obtained during the dot searches.on may,the hearing officer determined that the evidence acquired during the computer searches should be suppressed,finding that it had been obtained in violation of leventhal fourth amendment rights.the hearing officer notified the dot commissioner of his decision.in response,the commissioner instructed the hearing officer to continue to take evidence,including all of the evidence obtained through the computer searches,and to forward to him the complete record,together with all of the hearing officer recommendations.the hearing officer refused to comply with the request that he make the evidence from the searches part of the record.three months later,on october,leventhal settled with the dot.as part of the settlement,the dot agreed to withdraw all disciplinary charges except that of lateness,to which leventhal pleaded guilty.as a result,leventhal was penalized thirty work days leave without pay.
between the time of the dot searches of leventhal office computer and the time leventhal was charged with misconduct,leventhal was transferred from his position as principal accountant,a grade position,to a position as the supervisor of agency accounts,a grade position.the dot claims that this move was not precipitated by the disciplinary proceedings against leventhal.leventhal promotion to his grade position from a grade position as supervisor of agency accounts,was contingent on the ability of the person who had provisionally moved out of leventhal grade position,john chevalier,to retain the next highest position.chevalier then failed to win permanent assignment to his position and,consequently,was moved back to the grade position,forcing leventhal back down to his former grade position.leventhal claims,however,that but for the disciplinary proceedings,the dot would have created a special position,akin to a grade position,for chevalier,allowing leventhal to retain his grade position.
in addition,on september,the dot notified leventhal that,due to the disciplinary charges pending against him,he would not be granted the salary increase provided to most other management employees.at the option of the director of the budget,this salary increase could,by law,be withheld from any employee to reflect substandard job performance or when the increase was otherwise inappropriate.laws ch.leventhal claims that he was denied this salary increase in retaliation for contesting the disciplinary charges against him.
leventhal suit against the dot 
four days after he settled the dot disciplinary charges,leventhal filed this action in united states district court for the northern district of new york norman mordue,judge.in his complaint,leventhal alleged,under fourth amendment violations arising out of the computer searches and fourteenth amendment due process violations resulting from his demotion and the denial of the salary increase 
as a preliminary matter,the district court determined that the hearing officer finding of a fourth amendment violation did not have preclusive effect on these proceedings.regarding the propriety of the searches,the court found that leventhal could not reasonably expect complete privacy in the contents of his computer because it was reasonable to expect that other dot employees might view the directory structure and other contents of his computer in his absence.turning to the justification for the governmental intrusion,the district court concluded that the allegations in the anonymous letter were sufficient to give rise to the reasonable suspicion that leventhal was engaging in his private tax preparation business during work hours and that he might be using his computer in connection with that business and that an examination of the directory of the computer would produce evidence of misconduct.on this basis,the court found that the scope of the initial search was reasonable and that the evidence discovered thereby justified the searches that followed.the district court rejected leventhal due process challenges to the dot failure to award him the salary increase and his demotion to a grade position,reasoning that leventhal had no legal entitlement to either benefit.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews the grant of defendants motion for summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to leventhal as the party.see tenenbaum williams,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c,and,therefore,the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.a fact is material for these purposes if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.
leventhal fourth amendment claim 
the preclusive effect of the hearing officer ruling 
absent specific statutory guidance from congress,the preclusive effect of prior unreviewed state administrative determinations upon a subsequent suit in federal court is a matter of federal common law.see of elliott,d fashioning common law rules for issue preclusion in suit under.when federal common law gives preclusive effect in federal court to a state administrative determination,that prior determination has the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the state courts.id.at.
in this case,we need not reach the issue of whether federal common law would give preclusive effect to this state administrative determination because,even if it did,the action by the hearing officer would not have preclusive effect under new york law under new york law,a state agency determination is given preclusive effect in a subsequent state court proceedings only when,inter alia,the identical issue,see allied chem.niagara mohawk power,has been decided in the prior action.schwartz public adm r of the bronx.in this case,the hearing officer conclusion that leventhal fourth amendment rights were violated does not have preclusive effect because the issue was not decided in the agency proceeding.leventhal and the dot settled the disciplinary action before the hearing had concluded and the hearing officer final recommendations had been forwarded to the dot commissioner for review and decision.civ.serv.law.even if the hearing officer were to have completed taking the evidence and had offered recommendations,only the dot commissioner can make the agency determination.see simpson wolansky,t he findings of the hearing officer in a civ.serv.law proceeding are not conclusive and may be overruled by the official upon whom has been imposed the power to remove or mete out the discipline.although leventhal points to one case indicating that a hearing officer receives and rules on evidence,keeps a record of the proceeding,and makes a recommendation to the disciplinary authority,anderson dolce,emphasis added,the same case notes that t he disciplinary authority is not bound by the hearing officer recommendation.id.at.
public employer searches in government workplaces 
t he fourth amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches conducted by the government,even when the government acts as an employer.treasury employees union von raab,d.the special needs of public employers may,however,allow them to dispense with the probable cause and warrant requirements when conducting workplace searches related to investigations of misconduct.see ortega,d plurality opinion id.at.scalia,concurring.in these situations,the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches is enforced by a careful balancing of governmental and private interests.new jersey,d discussing the reasonableness of a search in the absence of a warrant and probable cause.a public employer search of an area in which an employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy is reasonable when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of its purpose,at.plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted.
we begin by inquiring whether the conduct at issue infringed an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable.id.at.plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted.without a reasonable expectation of privacy,a workplace search by a public employer will not violate the fourth amendment,regardless of the search nature and scope.the workplace conditions can be such that an employee expectation of privacy in a certain area is diminished.see id.at.plurality opinion recognizing that offices that are continually entered by fellow employees and other visitors during the workday for conferences,consultations,and other visits,can be so open to fellow employees or the public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable.id.at.blackman,dissenting i n certain situations,the operational realities of the workplace may remove some expectation of privacy on the part of the employee.on the facts of,the entire court found a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the office desk and file cabinets in which the plaintiff had maintained his personal correspondence,medical files,correspondence from private patients unconnected with his employment,personal financial records,teaching aids and notes,and personal gifts and mementos.id.at.plurality opinion id.at.scalia,concurring id.at.blackmun,dissenting.in finding that the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of privacy,the plurality noted that there was no evidence that the employer had established a reasonable regulation or policy discouraging employees from storing personal papers and effects in their desks or file cabinets.id.at.plurality opinion.
leventhal expectation of privacy 
we hold,based on the particular facts of this case,that leventhal had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer.we make this assessment in the context of the employment relation,id.at.plurality opinion,after considering what access other employees or the public had to leventhal office.
leventhal occupied a private office with a door.he had exclusive use of the desk,filing cabinet,and computer in his office.leventhal did not share use of his computer with other employees in the accounting bureau nor was there evidence that visitors or the public had access to his computer.
we are aware that p ublic employees expectations of privacy in their offices,desks,and file cabinets,like similar expectations of employees in the private sector,may be reduced by virtue of actual office practices and procedures,or by legitimate regulation.id.construing the evidence in favor of leventhal,as we must in reviewing this grant of summary judgment against him,we do not find that the dot either had a general practice of routinely conducting searches of office computers or had placed leventhal on notice that he should have no expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer.united states simons,cir finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in internet use when employer known policy allowed monitoring of all file transfers,all websites visited,and all messages sheppard beerman,cir finding no legitimate expectation of privacy in office,desk,and file cabinets in light of the unique relationship between a judge and her law clerk necessitating a distinctive open access to documents.
viewing the dot policy in the light most favorable to leventhal,we find that it did not prohibit the mere storage of personal materials in his office computer.rather,the policy prohibited using state equipment for personal business without defining further these terms.john samaniuk,acting director of the dot office of internal audits and investigations,testified at leventhal disciplinary hearing that an employee would not violate state policies by keeping a personal checkbook in an office drawer,even though it would take up space there.under the circumstances presented here,we can not say that the same policy prohibited leventhal from storing personal items in his office computer.see,at.plurality opinion finding a reasonable expectation of privacy at least in an office desk and file cabinets.
although the dot technical support staff had access to all computers in the dot offices,their maintenance of these computers was normally announced and the one example in the record of an unannounced visit to leventhal computer was only to change the name of a server.dot personnel might also need,at times,to search for a document in an unattended computer,but there was no evidence that these searches were frequent,widespread,or extensive enough to constitute an atmosphere so open to fellow employees or the public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable.id.at.plurality opinion.this type of infrequent and selective search for maintenance purposes or to retrieve a needed document,justified by reference to the special needs of employers to pursue legitimate objectives,does not destroy any underlying expectation of privacy that an employee could otherwise possess in the contents of an office computer.the supreme court has concluded that c onstitutional protection against unreasonable searches by the government does not disappear merely because the government has the
