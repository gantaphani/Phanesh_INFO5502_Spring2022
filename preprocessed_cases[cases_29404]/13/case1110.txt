plaintiff appellant the national organization for marriage nom appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york arcara,dismissing its amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction.contrary to the district court,we hold that nom pleaded a ripe case or controversy necessary to confer article iii jurisdiction.prudential considerations related to ripeness do not bar review.moreover,the case is not moot.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court dismissing the case,and remand for the district court to consider,in the first instance,whether to dismiss nom complaint on the merits.
background 
on september,nom filed its complaint in federal district court seeking a declaratory judgment that new york election law,which defines the term political committee for the purposes of state elections,violates the first amendment to the united states constitution.nom also requested a preliminary and a permanent injunction barring the enforcement of the law.in the complaint,which named as defendants four members of the new york state board of elections in their official capacity,nom identified itself as a nonsectarian,and corporation.although the complaint itself did not describe nom mission,an exhibit attached to the complaint explained that nom is dedicated to opposing marriage.in furtherance of that goal,nom asserted that it would seek,in september and october,to engage in multiple forms of speech in new york,including direct mailings and television,radio,and internet advertisements nom alleged that the threat of being labeled a political committee chilled this form of protected speech.defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing inter alia that nom claim was not ripe because the board of elections had not yet threatened any enforcement of the challenged election law provisions.
nom,in response,filed a more developed amended complaint.the amended complaint alleged that nom sought in september and would seek in october to directly advocate,by various means,for the election of certain candidates for state wide political office.nom further asserted that it intended to engage in materially similar speech in materially similar situations in the future.although nom disclaimed any intention to coordinate its express advocacy with any candidate or candidate committee or political party,or to contribute to any of these entities,nom maintained that its express advocacy for candidates could render it a political committee for the purposes of.
section provides,in full,that 
political committee means any corporation aiding or promoting and any committee,political club or combination of one or more persons operating or cooperating to aid or to promote the success or defeat of a political party or principle,or of any ballot proposal or to aid or take part in the election or defeat of a candidate for public office or to aid or take part in the election or defeat of a candidate for nomination at a primary election or convention,including all proceedings prior to such primary election,or of a candidate for any party position voted for at a primary election,or to aid or defeat the nomination by petition of an independent candidate for public office but nothing in this article shall apply to any committee or organization for the discussion or advancement of political questions or principles without connection with any vote or to a national committee organized for the election of presidential or candidates provided,however,that a person or corporation making a contribution or contributions to a candidate or a political committee which has filed pursuant to new york election law shall not,by that fact alone,be deemed to be a political committee as herein defined.
according to the amended complaint,and confirmed by affidavits the defendants filed in connection with their opposition to nom motion for a preliminary injunction,political committees must file a registration statement and designate a treasurer,see law maintain certain financial records,see,and make periodic reports based on these records to the board of elections disclosing,inter alia,contributions received and expenditures made,see id.nom feared that if it failed to comply with these provisions of new york law,it would be subject to state civil and criminal liability.nom also asserted without explanation that new york law chills it from proceeding with its speech.as with the first complaint,nom attached numerous exhibits to its complaint showing the type of mailings and broadcasts nom wanted to propagate,declaring that it would engage in these activities only if the district c ourt grants the requested relief.
the district court accepted nom amended complaint as a superseding pleading pursuant to.a and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.the district court observed that the complaint did not allege that nom had tried to ascertain its status with the board of elections,nor that the board had attempted to enforce the political committee definition of against nom.in the district court view,this meant nom claims were not ripe because it had no actual and fear that the law w ould be enforced against it.the court concluded by surmising at least a notable chance that nom could avoid the political committee designation altogether by virtue of the savings clause of,which exempts entities not involved with elections 
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court determination that it lacks jurisdiction on ripeness grounds.connecticut duncan,cir a district court ripeness determination is a legal determination subject to de novo review.nutritional health alliance shalala,cir ripeness is a constitutional prerequisite to exercise of jurisdiction by the federal courts.in addition,we have an independent duty to consider other aspects of jurisdiction nostra sponte.see kalson paterson,cir the fact that neither party raised a jurisdictional issue on appeal is of no matter we are obligated to determine whether jurisdiction exists nostra sponte.
to be justiciable,a cause of action must be ripe it must present a real,substantial controversy,not a mere hypothetical question.amsat cable cablevision of,cir.ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing.thomas union carbide agric.prods,d.a claim is not ripe if it depends upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.id.at.the doctrine major purpose is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.
the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the doctrine implicates two distinct conceptual jurisdictional criteria.simmonds ins,cir.
both criteria are concerned with whether a case has been brought prematurely,but they protect against prematureness in different ways and for different reasons.the first of these ripeness requirements has as its source the case or controversy clause of article iii of the constitution,and hence goes,in a fundamental way,to the existence of jurisdiction.the second is a more flexible doctrine of judicial prudence,and constitutes an important exception to the usual rule that where jurisdiction exists a federal court must exercise it.
these two forms of ripeness are not coextensive in purpose.constitutional ripeness is a doctrine that,like standing,is a limitation on the power of the judiciary.it prevents courts from declaring the meaning of the law in a vacuum and from constructing generalized legal rules unless the resolution of an actual dispute requires it.but when a court declares that a case is not prudentially ripe,it means that the case will be better decided later and that the parties will not have constitutional rights undermined by the delay.it does not mean that the case is not a real or concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns of the parties within the meaning of article ii i prudential ripeness is,then,a tool that courts may use to enhance the accuracy of their decisions and to avoid becoming embroiled in adjudications that may later turn out to be unnecessary or may require premature examination of,especially,constitutional issues that time may make easier or less controversial.

constitutional ripeness 
often,the best way to think of constitutional ripeness is as a specific application of the actual injury aspect of article iii standing.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotation marks,citations,alterations,and footnotes omitted.constitutional ripeness,in other words,is really just about the first lujan factor to say a plaintiff claim is constitutionally unripe is to say the plaintiff claimed injury,if any,is not actual or imminent,but instead conjectural or hypothetical.see id.at see also new york civil liberties union grandeau,cir standing and ripeness are closely related doctrines that overlap most notably in the shared requirement that the plaintiff injury be imminent rather than conjectural or hypothetical.quotation marks and alterations omitted ross bank of,usa,cir because the ripeness and standing doctrines overlap,claims that were sufficiently actual and imminent to establish article iii standing also were ripe for adjudication,not merely speculative or hypothetical 
despite the language of lujan and similar cases,however,we assess first amendment claims,such as the ones nom brings,under somewhat relaxed standing and ripeness rules.a plaintiff must allege something more than an abstract,subjective fear that his rights are chilled in order to establish a case or controversy.see laird tatum,d.but a real and imminent fear of such chilling is enough.as the eleventh circuit has explained,without the possibility of challenges,plaintiffs contesting statutes or regulations on first amendment grounds face an unattractive set of options if they are barred from bringing a facial challenge refraining from activity they believe the first amendment protects,or risk civil or criminal penalties for violating the challenged law.league of prof l lobbyists,meggs,cir.
this distinction explains our holding in vermont right to life committee,sorrell,cir.in that case,vermont statutory provisions required political advertisements to contain certain disclosures and mandated that expenditures for some mass media activities be reported to the state.id.at.the plaintiff,a nonprofit organization,brought suit under,seeking a declaratory judgment that the provisions were facially unconstitutional under the first amendment and seeking an injunction barring the defendants,a group of state officials sued in their official capacities,from enforcing the law.id.when it filed suit,the plaintiff had not been charged with violating any of the challenged provisions.id.at.the plaintiff believed,however,that its advocacy activities did not comply with the law,and it maintained that it would cease its behavior unless the provisions were declared unconstitutional.id.we acknowledged that the usual standing rules applied,but,citing supreme court precedent,we also recognized that a plaintiff bringing a facial challenge against a statute need not demonstrate to a certainty that it will be prosecuted under the statute to show injury,but only that it has an actual and fear that the law will be enforced against it.id.at omitted.the alleged danger of the statute is,in large measure,one of a harm that can be realized even without an actual prosecution.id.quotation marks and alterations omitted.when the plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder,that plaintiff should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.id.quoting babbitt united farm workers union,d.
in vermont right to life committee,it did not matter that the law at issue imposed only civil,and not criminal,liability.id.the fear of civil penalties can be as inhibiting of speech as can trepidation in the face of threatened criminal prosecution.nor did it make a difference that the state denied that the plaintiff actually was subject to the challenged law.id.what mattered was that the plaintiff faced a credible threat that the law would be enforced against it.id.that was enough to give standing.
this case is no different from vermont right to life committee,and nom claims are ripe.attached to nom complaint was an example of a radio advertisement nom wanted to broadcast in new york 
think legalizing marriage does affect your family 
legalizing gay marriage has consequences for kids.massachusetts schools teach second graders that boys can marry other boys.a california public school took first graders to a wedding,calling it a teachable moment.
kids have enough to deal with already,without pushing gay marriage on them.and it not just kids who face the consequences.
the rights of people who think marriage means a man and a woman will no longer matter we all have to accept marriage whether we like it or not.
carl paladi no knows that in these troubled times in new york,we do have time to push gay marriage on new york families.
this election day,vote for carl paladi n o for governor.
as the election approaches,tell your family and friends to vote for carl paladi no.he stand up for marriage between one man and one woman.
paid for by national organization for marriage 
comparing that proposed advertisement with the plain text of,which says,among other things,that a political committee is an organization working to promote the success or defeat of a political party or principle,or of any ballot proposal or to aid or take part in the election or defeat of a candidate for public office,nom plausibly contends that it would have been a political committee under new york law if it had aired its commercials during the fall of.
in holding nom claimed injury was too remote,the district court relied in part on the savings clause of.it reasoned that the provision exempting any committee or organization for the discussion or advancement of political questions or principles without connection with any vote or to a national committee organized for the election of presidential or candidates meant that nom had a notable chance of avoiding enforcement.but nom complaint contends,and the advertisements attached to its complaint demonstrate,that it wanted expressly to connect its speech to particular candidates and elections.we thus give credence to nom assertion that it fears it is a political committee under new york law,which chills nom from proceeding with its speech.that is enough to make the complaint ripe.
prudential ripeness 
having dismissed the case on constitutional ripeness grounds,the district court had no occasion to consider defendants prudential ripeness arguments.we consider them briefly.
to determine whether to abstain from a case on prudential ripeness grounds,we proceed with a inquiry,requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.grandeau,at quotation marks and citation omitted the fitness analysis is concerned with whether the issues sought to be adjudicated are contingent on future events or may never occur.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted.in assessing this possibility of hardship,we ask whether the challenged action creates a direct and immediate dilemma for the parties.id.at.
assessment of both factors counsels against abstention.although the factual record is not yet fully developed,the dispute primarily presents legal questions and t
