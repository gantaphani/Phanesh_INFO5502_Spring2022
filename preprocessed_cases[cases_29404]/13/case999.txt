raymond smith smith appeals the district court grant of summary judgment and dismissal of his first amendment employment retaliation case.the district court held that the record failed to demonstrate a causal connection between smith protected speech and the suffolk county police department department adverse employment actions.on appeal,smith argues that the record contains evidence connecting smith protected speech to the adverse employment actions sufficient to give rise to genuine questions of material fact,and that the fail to proffer evidence warranting summary judgment on the basis that those adverse actions would have occurred absent smith protected speech.we conclude that because smith is correct on both points,the district court erred in granting summary judgment.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.
factual background 
smith worked for the department from until his retirement in.smith rose to the rank of lieutenant,where his duties included supervising a squad of officers,planning community events,responding to complaints,coordinating with other squads and precincts,preparing computerized crime reports,and conducting motor patrols.
smith was investigated,warned,or otherwise disciplined for misconduct related to the use of his on several occasions leading up to the incidents at issue.in,after it was discovered that smith had installed a modem on a computer without authorization,he was warned not to install,reconfigure,or tamper with department programs or computers.in,after investigating an incident of computer tampering that had prevented other users from accessing his computer,the department reprimanded smith for computer misuse.smith was issued a written directive to read and familiarize himself with the department computer policy.the directive included the explicit policy statements that department computers are for official use only,use of any department information or equipment for personal use or gain is strictly prohibited,and internet access that is made available is for department use only.six years later,in,it was discovered that smith had used a computer to make flyers for a fantasy baseball league.although the department found this to be a minor indiscretion and did not take formal disciplinary action,it was recommended that smith receive guidance regarding the use and misuse of department equipment.
the events giving rise to the case now on appeal were set in motion on july,when smith was required to appear and present certain documents at a new york state department of motor vehicles hearing dmv hearing related to an arrest that he conducted.smith failed to appear on time,and when the department asked about his delay,smith claimed that while preparing for the hearing,he was forced to search for and review his case notes on his computer because they were not in the usual file.the department conducted a forensic examination of smith computer to verify his excuse.
the examination revealed that smith had repeatedly,and without authorization,communicated by email with a number of representatives of the information media,as well as others,about matters pertaining to departmental business.this communication began in and continued throughout,when smith began corresponding with cnn commentator jeffrey toobin about the case in which martin tankleff was convicted for the murder of his parents,only to be exonerated in after serving seventeen years in prison.in a tip emailed to toobin,smith contended that the homicide detective may have helped plan the murder and orchestrated a,that the district attorney appeared to have an ethical conflict and was protecting the actual murderers,and that there was a history of documented abuses committed by the suffolk county police homicide squad.the examination also revealed that in may smith exchanged emails with newsday correspondent christine armario expressing concern that the department policy of arresting unlicensed drivers led to ethnic discrimination.in these instances and others,smith signed his emails in his official capacity as lieutenant raymond smith,sixth precinct.
on january,the department transferred smith to an administrative,position working in an office without a computer.the new position precluded him from earning overtime or night shift pay,and he suffered a ten percent pay cut because he was no longer permitted to work the more lucrative midnight shift.
following negotiations with smith union representative,the department served smith with two disciplinary charges on january,both related to his emails to armario.charge two was for conduct unbecoming an officer and alleged that smith used his departmental computer and email to improperly communicate with the media regarding department policy in a manner tending to bring discredit to the police department.the following day,smith was suspended for thirty days without pay.on february,smith was served with notice of additional disciplinary charges for various violations of the department rules and procedures,including missing the dmv hearing,expressing his personal opinion in a manner tending to discredit the department,sending discrediting the department,using departmental email to conduct business,accessing related websites,using profanity in his emails,and failing to refer media inquiries to the department public information section.upon returning to work in early march,smith was transferred to a different administrative position.he decided to retire voluntarily at the end of april rather than face further disciplinary proceedings.
in march,smith filed his complaint in this case alleging under that defendants suffolk county and county police commissioner richard dormer defendants retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment right to freedom of speech.smith also brought a claim for violation of article,section of the new york state constitution.the alleged retaliatory acts included investigation into his personal affairs,serving him with disciplinary charges,reassigning him to a administrative position,suspending him without pay,and eventually forcing his retirement.
ii.legal framework governing first amendment retaliation claims 
to survive summary judgment on a first amendment retaliation claim,a public employee must establish a prima facie case by bring ing forth evidence showing that he has engaged in protected first amendment activity,he suffered an adverse employment action,and there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.dillon morano,cir.
as relevant here,the first amendment protects speech uttered by an employee in his or her capacity as a citizen regarding a matter of public concern.lane franks.to demonstrate a causal connection a plaintiff must show that the protected speech was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment action.cioffi averill park cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a plaintiff may establish causation either directly through a showing of retaliatory animus,or indirectly through a showing that the protected activity was followed closely by the adverse action.cobb pozzi,cir internal citation omitted.since a direct showing requires plaintiff to provide tangible proof of retaliatory animus,conclusory assertions of retaliatory motive are insufficient.id.
once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie retaliation claim,a government defendant may still receive summary judgment if it establishes its entitlement to a relevant defense.anemone metro.transp,cir.the supreme court identified one such defense in mount healthy city school district board of education doyle.because protected speech could not substantially cause an adverse action if the employer would have taken that action in any event,nagle marron,cir,once the employee has established a prima facie case,the employer may still be entitled to summary judgment based on the mount healthy defense by demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same adverse employment action even in the absence of the protected conduct.morris lindau,cir quoting mount healthy,at,abrogated on other grounds by burlington santa fe.ry.white,see also anemone,at.
a government employer may also challenge and,if successful,avoid liability under the balancing test established in pickering board of education,which safeguards the government interest as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees,piscottano murphy,cir quoting pickering,at.under pickering,defendants bear the burden of demonstrating that the plaintiff expression was likely to disrupt the government activities and that the harm caused by the disruption outweighs the value of the plaintiff expression.anemone,at quoting skehan vill.of mamaroneck,cir,overruled on other grounds by appel spiridon,cir.defendants need not present evidence that such harm or disruption which may include having the judgment and professionalism of the agency brought into serious disrepute has in fact occurred,but only that it made a reasonable determination that the employer speech creates the potential for such harms.piscottano,at.
iii.procedural history 
defendants moved for complete summary judgment,and smith filed a for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.in a written order resolving both motions,the district court lindsay,reviewed the elements of smith prima facie case.smith cnty.of suffolk,wl.the court determined that smith communications to newsday and cnn constituted speech made in his capacity as a citizen on a matter of public concern,and as such were protected under the first amendment.the court also found that smith suffered adverse employment actions including the initiation of disciplinary proceedings,his reassignment and reduction in pay,and the suspension without pay.the court held,however,that smith failed to demonstrate a sufficient connection between his speech and the adverse actions he suffered.
the court also stated in a footnote that although it need not reach the issue,defendants would likely succeed on the mount healthy defense by showing that they would have taken the same actions even if smith had not sent the media emails.id.at.the court outlined but did not apply the pickering test,id.at,nor hint at defendants likelihood of success on that defense.
the court granted defendants motion as to smith federal claim,dismissed the state claim without prejudice to renewing it in state court,and denied smith motion for partial summary judgment.
iv.scope of the appeal 
given the district court holdings,the arguments advanced on appeal,and the evidence proffered to support those arguments,the issues before us are few and narrowly drawn.the scope of this appeal is therefore most effectively captured by initially identifying and declining to address the issues that fall outside its boundaries.
first,we note with interest that defendants do not or otherwise challenge the district court rulings that by speaking on a matter of public concern in his capacity as a citizen,rather than an employee,smith had engaged in activity protected by the first amendment,and smith suffered adverse employment actions.since the defendants do not now contest these two elements of smith prima facie case,we will not address the district court conclusions with respect to them.
the district court outlined the pickering test.because it held,however,that there was no causal connection between smith engaging in protected speech and the adverse employment actions,and therefore no prima facie case of retaliation,it did not conduct a pickering analysis.on appeal,defendants only mention pickering in passing.while the facts of this case including the charges filed against smith and the departmental policies upon which they were based appear to implicate a pickering defense,without a decision below with respect to that defense or an argument on appeal advancing that defense,we have no basis on which to address that issue.the defendants burden in this regard is not ours to meet,and the current posture of this case places any pickering determination outside the province of this court.
the district court also touched upon qualified immunity in a footnote,suggesting that it provided an additional ground for granting summary judgment in favor of defendants because t he record is simply devoid of any evidence supporting smith claim that he was disciplined for reasons other than violating departmental policy with respect to computer usage.smith,wl,at.defendants raise qualified immunity on appeal,arguing that since there is no prima facie case there can be no constitutional violation.because we hold that smith did in fact establish a prima facie case and because qualified immunity was not dispositive below nor sufficiently briefed on appeal,a decision regarding the applicability of qualified immunity by this court at this time is also inappropriate.
we begin our analysis,therefore,at the third and final prima facie element whether there is a causal connection between what the district court identified as smith protected speech and the adverse actions he suffered.we will then address an ostensible mount healthy defense since the district court suggested the likely outcome of its analysis of that issue and because both parties raise and brief that issue on appeal 
discussion 
smith argues that the district court erred in ruling that the evidence did not demonstrate a sufficient causal connection between his protected speech and the adverse employment actions he suffered.smith also challenges the court statement that the defendants would likely succeed on their mount healthy defense.defendants counter that smith failed to present evidence establishing a causal connection and that the court aptly noted that even if smith established a prima facie case,they would have been entitled to the mount healthy defense.
standard of review 
we review de novo orders granting summary judgment to determine whether,as the movant contends,there was no genuine issue as to any material fact such that the movant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see miller wolpoff abramson,cir.we resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.lederman new york city dep t of parks recreation,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.summary judgment is appropriate when the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio.
causal connection 
smith challenges the district court decision on grounds that he presented both direct evidence of retaliatory intent and indirect evidence of temporal proximity between his protected speech and the adverse employment actions,and of disparate treatment the court did not address direct evidence of retaliatory intent beyond stating that smith had not offered any.smith,wl at.we disagree.the plain language of several of the disciplinary charges at the heart of the adverse actions directly implicates not only the fact that smith had engaged in protected speech,but also the content of that speech.charge of the january,notice of charges,and charges,and of the february,notice of charges are related to individual emails smith sent to cnn and newsday reporters.those charges state that smith commented on department policy in a manner tending to bring discredit to the police department.the department thereby both characterized the content of the speech and cited that characterization as the basis for several disciplinary charges.various internal department memoranda reveal similar direct evidence of a causal connection.for example,a march internal affairs bureau iab memorandum stated that in the emails discovered through the forensic exam,smith had nothing positive to say about the conduct of department business conversely,the nature of many of these emails was such that they tended to bring discredit to the department.
given the plain language of the charges against smith and the internal memoranda,a reasonable juror could conclude that the department actions were motivated,at least in part,by a retaliatory animus.smith has presented direct evidence,which,if credited by a jury,could prove a causal con
