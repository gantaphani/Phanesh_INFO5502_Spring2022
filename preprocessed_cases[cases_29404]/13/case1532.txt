plaintiffs,thomas spargo spargo,an elected new york state judge,and two of his political supporters,jane mcnally mcnally and peter kermani kermani,bring first amendment and equal protection challenges to three specific new york rules of judicial conduct directs judges to maintain high standards of conduct to preserve the integrity and independence of the judiciary a which instructs judges to avoid the appearance of impropriety by act ing at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and a c g and a a which prohibit incumbent judges and judicial candidates from engaging in partisan political activities that are unrelated to their own campaign for judicial office and which require all judicial candidates to maintain the dignity appropriate to judicial office.
after the new york state commission on judicial conduct commission,the official agency responsible for enforcing new york judicial conduct rules see const.art.vi,charged spargo with five counts of judicial misconduct,plaintiffs filed suit under,alleging that the judicial conduct rules at issue violated their first amendment and equal protection rights and seeking to enjoin the commission from proceeding with the pending disciplinary proceedings against spargo or otherwise enforcing the challenged rules.relying on the supreme court decision in republican party of minnesota white,d concluding that a minnesota canon of judicial conduct that prohibited judicial candidates from announcing their views on disputed legal or political issues violated the first amendment as a restriction on core political speech,the united states district court for the northern district of new york david hurd,judge declared,a,a c g and a a facially unconstitutional and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing the challenged provisions.see spargo state comm on judicial conduct,d.
on appeal,defendants and amici curiae urge us to reverse the district court on the merits,arguing that the challenged judicial conduct rules are narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest in preserving the reality as well as the appearance of judicial independence and impartiality.however,because state disciplinary proceedings were pending against spargo at the time the federal suit was filed,this case raises the threshold question of whether the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiffs suit in deference to the ongoing disciplinary proceeding.see generally younger harris,d cautioning that federal courts should generally refrain from enjoining pending state court proceedings.defendants accordingly focus their arguments on the question of who should have the first opportunity to decide the plaintiffs constitutional claims,arguing that the pending state disciplinary proceeding provides spargo with a fully adequate forum to raise his constitutional challenges and that principles of federalism and comity mandate that the district court abstain from deciding spargo claims and the interrelated claims of mcnally and kermani.
citing concerns as to whether spargo could seek mandatory review of the commission decision before the new york court of appeals,the district court declined to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over spargo claims under younger.see spargo,d at.the district court further found no basis to abstain from hearing the claims of mcnally and kermani,as neither was a party to the pending disciplinary proceeding against spargo.see id.at.as we explain more fully below,because the new york court of appeals has subsequently confirmed that its review of the commission disciplinary decisions is mandatory,see in re raab,per curiam in re watson,per curiam,erasing any doubt as to spargo ability to seek judicial review of his constitutional claims,and because the claims of all three plaintiffs are inextricably intertwined,we hold that proper deference to new york paramount interest in regulating its own judicial system mandates the exercise of younger abstention over plaintiffs claims.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and injunction of the district court and remand with instruction to the district court to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the plaintiffs action.
background 
this case arises from an investigation involving plaintiff thomas spargo potential violation of several judicial conduct rules.the commission initiated the investigation into spargo campaign conduct and political activity in december while spargo was serving as an elected town justice for the town of berne in albany county,new york.while the investigation was pending,spargo ran successfully for the position of justice of the supreme court in the third judicial district of new york,the position which he currently holds.eventually the commission investigation expanded to include allegations that spargo authorized inappropriate payments of to two political supporters 
on january,the commission served spargo with a formal written complaint,charging spargo with four counts of judicial misconduct.charge i alleges that spargo failed to observe high standards of conduct failed to act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and failed to maintain the dignity appropriate to judicial office,in violation of,a,and a a,by offering items of value such as cider and donuts to induce voters to vote for him during his campaign for town justice.charge ii alleges that spargo failed to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety and failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,in violation of and a,by accepting the albany county district as a client in connection with the contested election for district attorney,notwithstanding the fact that the district attorney office regularly appeared in criminal cases before spargo as a sitting town justice.charge ii also alleges that spargo violated and a by presiding over criminal cases prosecuted by the albany county district attorney office without disclosing to defense counsel that spargo had previously represented the district attorney and that the district attorney campaign committee still owed spargo in legal fees.
charges iii and iv allege that spargo violated a prohibitions on partisan political activity by attending governmental sessions for the recount of presidential votes during the november florida recount as an observer for the republican party and the presidential campaign participat ing in a loud and obstructive demonstration against the recount process outside the offices of the county board of elections in an attempt to disrupt the recount process and serving as the keynote speaker at the annual monroe county conservative party dinner,a fundraising event for the conservative party.
on may,spargo was served with a supplemental complaint charging him with additional violations of,and a a for allegedly authorizing improper payments to two consultants involved in his campaign for supreme court justice.the supplemental complaint charges that spargo authorized his judicial campaign committee to pay mcnally,although mcnally had agreed to volunteer her services to spargo election campaign without pay,for consulting services purportedly rendered on october,the same day that mcnally nominated spargo as the democratic party candidate for supreme court justice.similarly,the supplemental complaint alleges that spargo authorized a second payment from his campaign committee to empire strategy consultants,the principal of which is thomas connolly,the rensselaer county independence party chairman and a delegate to the independence party judicial nominating convention,after connolly supported and worked for spargo nomination as the independence party candidate on october,notwithstanding that neither spargo nor spargo campaign was legally obligated to pay any money to connolly or to empire strategy consultants.
in his answers to the commission complaints,spargo asserted as an affirmative defense that his campaign activities were constitutionally protected and that the judicial conduct rules that he was charged with violating were overly broad and unduly vague in violation of the first amendment as well as the constitution of the state of new york.on july,the commission designated a referee to conduct a hearing and prepare a report on the misconduct charges see jud.law authorizing the commission to appoint a referee to conduct hearings on judicial misconduct complaints.the hearing was scheduled for october.however,shortly before the hearing was to commence,spargo unsuccessfully requested an adjournment.
on october,immediately following the denial of the adjournment and only four days before the disciplinary hearing was scheduled to begin,plaintiffs filed suit in federal court bringing facial and constitutional challenges to,a,a c g and a a.in their complaint,plaintiffs assert that t he purpose of this action is to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief,declaring the challenged rules of judicial conduct unconstitutional,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendment s to the united states constitution and article i,and of the new york state constitution.plaintiffs also sought to obtain a permanent injunction barring defendants from pursuing the pending disciplinary charges against spargo.
in support of their independent first amendment claims,mcnally and kermani both allege that they have been adversely affected by the defendants actions in pursuing judicial misconduct charges against spargo.mcnally alleges that the threat of sanctions against spargo and other judicial candidates whom mcnally may support in the future impedes her freedom of speech,including her ability and desire to nominate and show support for particular candidates as a delegate to future democratic judicial nominating conventions.similarly,kermani contends that he is adversely affected because,as a member and chairman of the republican party,he is restrained from associating with spargo out of concern that the association would adversely impact spargo.kermani also alleges that he has declined to invite spargo to address the republican party,despite a desire to do so,out of concern that such activity would result in additional charges being brought against spargo.
in expedited proceedings before the district court,plaintiffs obtained a temporary restraining order barring the commission from taking any further disciplinary action against spargo.deeming the matters in dispute to be strictly questions of law,the district court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with a trial on the merits of plaintiffs first amendment and equal protection claims.on february,the district court issued its order and decision,declaring the challenged judicial conduct rules facially unconstitutional and permanently enjoining defendants from enforcing the challenged rules.see spargo,d at.
in reaching its decision,the district court acknowledged that t here is a strong federal policy against interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.id.at quoting middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.however,the district court determined that younger abstention did not extend to mcnally and kermani constitutional claims as neither was a party to the pending disciplinary proceeding against spargo,or otherwise subject to the commission authority,and mcnally and kermani would therefore have no opportunity to raise their claims in spargo disciplinary proceeding.see id.at.as for spargo himself,the district court determined that while the other prerequisites for younger abstention were present,younger did not apply because the pending disciplinary proceedings failed to provide spargo with an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional challenges.see id.at.
first,the district court expressed concern that spargo constitutional claims would go unheard if the pending misconduct charges were found to be unsubstantiated or if the commission declined to pursue the charges for other reasons.see id.at.second,the district court noted that it was unclear under state law,see jud.law whether spargo could seek mandatory review of the commission disciplinary determination before the new york court of appeals or whether such review was discretionary.see spargo,d at third,the district court questioned whether c onsideration of the validity of the judicial conduct rules themselves is outside the scope of the commission authority despite any constitutional defense that might be raised by a judge charged with violating the rules.id.at.finally,the district court observed that the new york court of appeals would review the c ommission findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the record of the proceedings before the commission.id.quoting jud.law with emphasis omitted.noting that a disciplinary hearing is not the equivalent of a full trial,where the rules of evidence apply,and that the commission need not provide extensive analysis in rejecting proffered constitutional defenses,the district court worried that the resulting administrative record would be too spare and scant to permit adequate appellate review.see id.
on the merits of plaintiffs claims,the district court agreed that the judicial conduct rules restricting partisan political activity,a c g and a a,imposed a prior restraint on protected speech.see id.at.relying heavily on the supreme court decision in republican party of minnesota white,d,the district court concluded that the rules were not narrowly tailored to serve the state interest in maintaining and promoting an independent judiciary see spargo,d at.although new york does not impose the same restrictions on judicial candidates the district court reasoned that the challenged provisions of imposed even broader restrictions,e ssentially prohibit ing judges and judicial candidates from engaging in any political activity except their own judicial campaign.id.at.the district court further rejected defendants argument that the political activity restrictions are narrowly tailored to advance the compelling state interest in preserving judicial independence,reasoning that judicial candidates may have been active in politics prior to seeking judicial office,and t here is no support for the proposition that participation in political activity,which the rules do not address,impedes the making of independent judgments any less than current participation in some political activity.id.the district court also reasoned that judicial bias could be effectively remedied through voluntary recusal instead of broad restrictions on political speech and activity.see id.at.
as for and a,which affirmatively direct judges and judicial candidates to observe high standards of conduct and act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,the district court held that both provisions were void for vagueness,because the provisions failed to give adequate notice of the specific activity prohibited and consequently were likely to chill protected activity.see id.at.finally,although the district court ruled for plaintiffs on their first amendment challenge,it rejected plaintiffs parallel equal protection claim,explaining that new york could impose special restrictions on the speech of judicial candidates,because j udicial candidates and candidates for other public office are not similarly situated.id.at.
the parties now appeal.defendants argue that the district court should have abstained from hearing plaintiffs suit in deference to the pending disciplinary proceeding against spargo,plaintiffs mcnally and kermani lack article iii standing to bring independent constitutional claims because their allegations of injury are too conclusory,and the district court erred in analyzing the merits of plaintiffs first amendment challenge.plaintiffs have filed a on the denial of their equal protection claim.
while the appeal was pending the new york court of appeals issued two decisions that erased any doubt as to the mandatory nature of its review of commission disciplinary decisions.see raab,at,noting that the commission determination is reviewable as of right watson,at,stating that p etitioner appeals to this court as of right.moreover,raab and watson confirm that judges and judicial candidates subject to disciplinary proceedings have the opportunity to raise first amendment challenges before the court of appeals.see raab,at,distinguishing the supreme court decision in white and concluding that the restrictions on partisan political activity contained in a c h are narrowly tailored to address the state compelling interests in preventing political bias and corruption and the appearance of such corruption watson,at,considering but rejecting first amendment challenge to a d i ban on the making of pledges or promises by judicial candidates.
we conclude that in declining to abstain under younger the district court placed too much weight on the uncertainty of state procedures for raising constitutional claims in disciplinary proceedings.in addition,we recognize that the court of appeals has subsequently clarified the scope of available review of constitutional challenges to the judicial conduct rules.while the opinions in raab and watson were not available at the time the district court issued its decision,they now make explicit that plaintiffs have a sufficient opportunity to raise their constitutional claims during the course of state proceedings,and this precludes the district court from exercising jurisdiction over a parallel action that seeks to disrupt the state proceeding.finally,we find that abstention applies to the derivative claims of plaintiffs mcnally and kermani,as their first amendment interests are inextricably intertwined with the first amendment interests asserted by spargo.
in deciding this case on abstention grounds,we are sensitive to the importance of the free speech issues raised on appeal and emphasize that our decision should not be read as revealing any view on the merits of plaintiffs claims.as amici curiae point out,all fifty states have adopted codes of judicial conduct,containing provisions identical,or substantially similar,to the judicial conduct rules challenged in this case.moreover,like new york,see const.art.vi,the majority of states in this country have adopted a system of judicial elections,raising potential concerns about how broadly the speech of elected judicial and judicial candidates may be restricted.see white,at,concurring.accordingly,any ruling on the merits of plaintiffs first amendment challenge may have widespread influence and impact.that being the case,our ruling does not deny plaintiffs the opportunity to raise their constitutional challenge we simply direct plaintiffs to the alternative state forum where proceedings have already begun.it is to the state commission on judicial conduct and the new york court of appeals that plaintiffs must make their arguments,and to which other interested parties must look,for further guidance and development of the law in the context of this controversy.beyond that,the parties have available whatever review the supreme court opts to offer them.guido calabresi,federal and state courts restoring a workable balance,madison lecture.
discussion 
as a threshold matter,because defendants raise both standing and abstention concerns,and because we have an independent obligation to ensure that standing exists,see pub.interest research group whitman,cir,we must determine whether we may decide the case on younger grounds without confirming the existence of constitutional standing.steel citizens for a better environment,d,directs federal courts to resolve questions of article iii jurisdiction before reaching the merits of a plaintiff claim.while dismissal or a stay of claims is mandatory when the requirements for younger abstention are satisfied,see diamond d constr.mcgowan,cir,younger is not a jurisdictional bar based on article iii requirements,but instead a prudential limitation on the court exercise of jurisdiction grounded in equitable considerations of comity.see,benavidez eu,cir younger abstention is not jurisdictional,but reflects a court prudential decision not to exercise jurisdiction which it in fact possesses.emphasis in original schachter whalen,cir per curiam younger abstention goes to the exercise of equity jurisdiction,not to the jurisdiction of the federal district court as such to hear the case.
despite the prudential nature of the abstention inquiry,we may still proceed to decide a case under younger without addressing the plaintiffs constitutional standing to bring suit.as the supreme court clarified in ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d,steel does not mandate a strict sequencing of jurisdictional issues,as it does not violate separation of powers principles to dismiss an action on a ground before finding jurisdiction.thus,while steel may bar the exercise of hypothetical jurisdiction to dismiss on the merits of a claim ruhrgas reaffirms the inherent flexibility that federal courts exercise to choose among threshold grounds for disposing of a case without reaching the merits.id.at.accordingly,we may decide that abstention is proper under younger without deciding whether plaintiffs have demonstrated article iii.see id.citing ellis dyson,d.
younger abstention 
we review the district court younger analysis de novo,see diamond d,at,and begin by analyzing the underlying principles and policies that dictate deference towards pending state proceedings.as the supreme court emphasized in younger harris,federal courts should generally refrain from enjoining or otherwise interfering in ongoing state proceedings.this principle of abstention is grounded in interrelated principles of comity and federalism.see schlagler phillips,cir.both considerations require federal courts to be cognizant that the national government will fare best if the states and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.younger,at.our federalism in its ideal form,as the supreme court explained in younger,strives towards a system in which there is sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both state and national governments,and in which the national government,anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests,always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the states.id.in recognition of this balance of interests,younger generally prohibits courts from taking jurisdiction over federal constitutional claims that involve or call into question ongoing state proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary friction.diamond d,at.giving states the first opportunity to correct their own mistakes when there is an ongoing state proceeding serves the vital purpose of reaffirm ing the competence of the state courts,and acknowledging the dignity of states as sovereigns in our federal system.id.at.
younger itself involved a first amendment challenge to a pending state criminal proceeding.however,the same comity and federalism concerns are equally applicable to state administrative proceedings in which important state interests are vindicated.ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d.accordingly,younger abstention is mandatory when there is a pending state proceeding,that implicates an important state interest,and the state proceeding affords the federal plaintiff an adequate opportunity for judicial review of his or her federal constitutional claims see diamond d,at.
in this case,there is no dispute that the first two requirements for younger abstention are satisfied.plaintiffs filed suit after the commission initiated a disciplinary proceeding against spargo,a proceeding that undeniably implicates a vital state interest.indeed,few interests can be considered more central than a state interest in regulating its own judicial system.see landmark communications,virginia,d stewart,concurring in the judgment emphasizing that t here could hardly be a higher governmental interest than a state interest in the quality of its judiciary pincham.judicial inquiry,cir.recognizing that the state has a vital interest in preserving a fair and impartial judiciary,cert.denied,d anonymous ass of the bar of the city of new york,cir.noting that i t would appear axiomatic that the effective functioning of any court depends upon its ability to command respect not only from those licensed to practice before it but also from the public at large,cert.denied,d.
plaintiffs primarily argue that abstention is inappropriate,because there is no opportunity for spargo to meaningfully pursue his constitutional claims in the pending disciplinary proceeding,and because mcnally and kermani are not party to any pending commission proceeding or other state action.in analyzing plaintiffs arguments against abstention,we note that the underlying facts and claims in this case are strikingly similar to the facts and issues raised in middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar ass n,d,the seminal supreme court case that first clearly extended younger to state administrative proceedings.in middlesex,plaintiffs brought a federal action,alleging that several attorney disciplinary rules promulgated by the new jersey supreme court violated the first amendment.prior to the initiation of the federal action,one of the plaintiffs,lennox hinds hinds,a practicing new jersey attorney,was formally charged with violating the disciplinary rules by a county ethics committee after he allegedly made statements disparaging the judicial system during the course of a criminal trial.see id.at.instead of answering the charges,hinds filed suit in federal court along with other plaintiff legal organizations,claiming that the new jersey disciplinary rules violated the first amendment and were facially overbroad and vague.see id.at.the district court dismissed the suit under younger,but a divided panel of the third circuit reversed,concluding that abstention was improper because the state disciplinary proceedings did not provide plaintiffs with a meaningful opportunity to adjudicate their constitutional claims.see garden state bar ass n,at.
in rejecting the application of younger,the third circuit focused on the fact that the state disciplinary proceedings were nonadjudicative in nature,and primarily designed to elicit facts,not legal arguments,id.at,and concluded that even if hinds could raise a constitutional challenge during his pending disciplinary proceedings,new jersey 
rules made no provision for the filing of an opinion by the district ethics committee or the disciplinary review board and hence t he very privacy of the proceeding militate d against a meaningful constitutional adjudication,since the determination would not provide any remedy against the chill which the rules and the filing of charges allegedly created in the minds of other members of the new jersey bar.
id.on petition for rehearing petitioner attached an affidavit from the clerk of the new jersey supreme court which stated that the new jersey supreme court would directly consider hinds constitutional challenges and that the court would also consider whether such a procedure should be made explicit in the supreme court rules.middlesex county ethics,at.however,the third circuit panel declined to alter its original decision,reasoning that it was not established that hinds could have obtained such judicial review when the federal complaint was filed,and that,in any event,such discretionary action by the new jersey supreme court was not sufficient to trigger mandatory abstention.see garden state bar ass middlesex county ethics,cir.
the supreme court reversed,noting that the importance of the state interest in maintaining and assuring the professional conduct of the attorneys it licenses calls younger abstention into play,and concluding that s o long as the constitutional claims of plaintiffs can be determined in the state proceedings the federal courts should abstain.middlesex county ethics,at.the supreme court decision further emphasized that in conducting the younger inquiry,considerations of comity preclude any presumption that the state courts will not safeguard federal constitutional rights.see id.at.noting that abstention is based on the fundamental principle that parties should assert any available constitutional defenses in state proceedings unless it is plainly apparent that they are barred from raising such constitutional claims,the supreme court placed the burden of establishing the inadequacy of state proceedings squarely on the party seeking to avoid abstention.see id.at.
in addition,while the supreme court in middlesex acknowledged that whether hinds could seek judicial review of his constitutional claims during the course of state proceedings was initially unclear,the court also recognized that the new jersey supreme court had subsequently considered hinds claims sua sponte and formally amended its rules to permit interlocutory review of constitutional challenges to attorney disciplinary proceedings.see id.at.concluding that t here was no reason for the federal courts to ignore subsequent development s demonstrating that hinds had had an opportunity to raise his constitutional claims during the course of state proceedings,the supreme court held that the mandatory abstention applied to hinds first amendment claims.see id.at.
adequate opportunity to raise constitutional claims in state proceedings 
here,as in middlesex,abstention largely turns on the question of whether spargo has an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional claims in the pending state proceeding.on appeal,despite the intervening decisions by the new york court of appeals,plaintiffs still contend that state law does not clearly grant the commission jurisdiction to consider constitutional arguments or provide for mandatory review of the commission disciplinary decisions by the court of appeals.plaintiffs also argue that abstention would still be unwarranted,even if the commission were willing to consider spargo constitutional claims,because the misconduct charges against spargo could be dismissed on alternate grounds,leaving the constitutionality of the challenged judicial conduct rules still in question,the commission may choose to summarily reject spargo constitutional claims,effectively limiting spargo ability to seek meaningful review before the court of appeals,and the commission decision will remain confidential,and thus have limited precedential value even if spargo prevails on his constitutional challenges.
none of these arguments have any merit given middlesex unequivocal statement that abstention is appropriate where the plaintiff has an opportunity to raise and have timely decided by a competent state tribunal the constitutional claims at issue in the federal suit.middlesex county ethics,at.quoting gibson berryhill,d see also juidice vail,d reasoning that where it is abundantly clear that appellees had an opportunity to present their federal claims in the state proceedings n o more is required to invoke younger abstention.more importantly,under younger,any uncertainties as to the scope of state proceedings or the availability of state remedies are generally resolved in favor of abstention.see butler.judicial inquiry comm n,cir concluding that abstention was required even without authoritative guidance as to whether plaintiff could raise his first amendment claims in the pending state judicial discipline proceeding.
accordingly,to avoid abstention,plaintiffs must demonstrate that state law bars the effective consideration of their constitutional claims.see middlesex county ethics,at.where pending administrative proceedings implicate important state interests,a federal court should abstain unless state law clearly bars the interposition of the constitutional claims quoting moore sims,d ohio civil rights comm n,at.holding that abstention was mandatory where plaintiff could cite no state authority preventing judicial review of his constitutional claims kirschner klemons,cir to establish the inadequacy of state remedies,the plaintiff must show that the state laws,procedures,or practices would prevent his effective interposition of his federal contentions.in this case,the district court declined to abstain,noting that defendants had failed to cite any cases in which the commission or the court of appeals had ever addressed a constitutional challenge to the judicial conduct rules.see spargo,d at.however,under younger,it is the plaintiff burden to demonstrate that state remedies are inadequate,and defendants need not establish that state law definitively permits the interposition of constitutional claims.
in opposition to abstention,the plaintiffs have merely pointed to potential ambiguities in state statutes and regulations.but in applying younger,federal courts may not assume that state judges will interpret ambiguities in state procedural law to bar presentation of federal claims.pennzoil texaco,d.even if we accept that no other constitutional challenges to the new york judicial conduct rules have ever been addressed,in the history of state proceedings as the district court found,see spargo,d at,plaintiffs have not pointed to any state law or firmly established state practice that would effectively bar spargo from asserting constitutional defenses to the commission disciplinary charges 
in addition,as in middlesex,any doubts about the commission willingness to consider constitutional challenges or the availability of judicial review have been resolved pending appeal,and there is no reason for this court to ignore the new york court of appeals subsequent decisions in in re raab,per curiam and in re watson,per curiam,both of which unambiguously affirm that the commission will consider first amendment arguments and,further,establish that sanctioned judges may seek mandatory review of the commission decision before the court of appeals such ability to raise constitutional claims in subsequent judicial review of an underlying administrative proceeding is sufficient to provide plaintiffs with a meaningful opportunity to seek effective relief through state proceedings and bar federal courts from taking jurisdiction over the same claims while the state proceeding is pending see ohio civil rights comm n,at.cullen fliegner,cir.
significantly,this conclusion is not altered by the fact that spargo disciplinary charges may be dismissed on other grounds,such as for lack of substantial evidence,or by the fact that the court of appeals may choose to narrowly construe the judicial conduct rules to avoid a potential constitutional confrontation,as the plaintiffs suggest.the relevant question under younger is whether the state procedural remedies could provide the relief sought not whether the state will provide the constitutional ruling which the plaintiff seeks.kirschner,at emphasis added noting that it was irrelevant to the application of younger that plaintiff constitutional claims had not been addressed by the appellate division where the appellate division found for plaintiff on alternate grounds.indeed,insisting on the priority of federal constitutional claims would undermine the considerations of comity and deference that underlie younger.as the supreme court has explained,an important reason for younger abstention is to avoid unwarranted determination of federal constitutional questions where it is possible that state courts may resolve the case on state law grounds without reaching the federal constitutional questions.pennzoil,at.younger abstention in situations like this offers the opportunity for narrowing constructions that might obviate the constitutional problem and intelligently mediate federal constitutional concerns and state interests.id.at.quoting moore sims,at.see also yamaha motor,stroud,cir noting that c omity favors permitting the state court system to decide issues of state statutory law,and abstention is called for when it is possible that the state court might interpret the underlying law in such a way as to foreclose the need to review at least some of the plaintiff federal claims,and indicating that t his rationale applies with even more force when abstention might allow the federal court to avoid unnecessary constitutional questions thus,the argument that spargo disciplinary proceeding could be resolved on alternative grounds,without deciding the constitutional issues raised in the federal suit,actually weighs in favor of,and not against,the exercise of abstention 
plaintiffs also challenge the adequacy of state proceedings,because the commission findings are kept confidential unless a sanctioned judge requests further review by the court of appeals,see jud.law,and the commission has no obligation to issue a full decision should it reach the merits of spargo constitutional challenge.in assessing these arguments,we begin by noting that the record gives us no reason to question the ability of either the commission or the court of appeals to fully and fairly address spargo constitutional claims despite plaintiffs intimations to the contrary.in addition,while plaintiffs point to procedural differences between the state administrative process and federal litigation,younger implicitly recognizes that states may adopt a variety of different procedures to resolve legal disputes,yet it directs federal courts to defer to state procedures,leaving state institutions free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.younger,at.moreover,similar arguments about the adequacy of state proceedings were rejected by the supreme court in middlesex,a case which also involved a disciplinary hearing before a state ethics committee whose primary mission was.see middlesex county ethics,at.the supreme court determined that the availability of further judicial review before the state highest court triggered mandatory abstention under younger although the ethics committee was not required to issue a formal written opinion of its disciplinary decision and proceedings before the committee were confidential.see id.at.
we emphasize that younger merely presupposes that the plaintiff be able to interpose his federal defense in the state court it does not additionally require all procedures for the interposition of the federal defense to be as advantageous in the state court as in the federal action.kirschner,at see also brooks new hampshire supreme court,cir rejecting plaintiff argument that a state attorney discipline proceeding is less than adequate because of its confidential character,and noting that the supreme court has never suggested that having an adequate opportunity to present a federal claim requires that the parallel state proceeding be open to the public.in sum,while spargo may prefer a federal forum,he may pursue his constitutional claims in state proceedings,and therefore,the district court should have abstained.see foster children bush,cir.concluding that i n determining whether the state remedies are adequate the relevant question is not whether the state courts can do all that plaintiffs wish but rather whether plaintiffs may pursue their federal claims in state proceedings internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied sub nom.reggie bush,d.
in so holding,we do not ignore the importance of the first amendment interests at stake or disregard the costs of delay in postponing a decision on the merits.however,younger itself warns that the existence of a chilling effect,even in the area of first amendment rights,is not a sufficient basis,in and of itself,for prohibiting state action.younger,at.accordingly,while we recognize that abstention may impose significant costs,the costs of duplication and delay caused by younger,for your eyes alone,city of columbus,cir,must be balanced against the risk of undue interference and unnecessary conflict with state proceedings.younger,at.rejecting notion that federalism contemplates the centralization of control over every important issue in the federal courts.consequently,while the significance of the first amendment interests at stake may play a role in younger analysis,in this case,where the requirements for abstention are clearly satisfied,and spargo can seek timely review before the new york court of appeals,the first amendment concerns raised by the plaintiffs do not justify any exception to ordinary younger principles 
abstention over the related claims of 
in support of the district court decision,plaintiffs also argue that younger does not permissibly extend to the claims of mcnally and kermani as neither was a party to the ongoing disciplinary proceeding against question that the supreme court left unresolved in middlesex.see middlesex county ethics,at.noting that i t is not clear whether the court of appeals decided whether abstention would be proper as to the plaintiff organizations who are not parties to the state disciplinary proceedings,and leav ing this issue to the court of appeals on remand.as we explain more fully below,we reject plaintiffs attempt to apply younger in a mechanical fashion and find under the circumstances of this case that the legal interests of mcnally and kermani are sufficiently intertwined with those of spargo to make abstention applicable to all of the plaintiffs claims.see generally doran salem inn,d warning that while plaintiffs should not automatically be thrown into the same hopper for younger purposes,there may plainly be some circumstances in which legally distinct parties are so closely related that they should all be subject to the younger considerations which govern any one of them.
as the supreme court has recognized,in certain circumstances,younger may apply to the claims of who are not directly involved in any pending state proceeding.for example,in hicks miranda,d,the supreme court held that younger barred the claims of two theater owners who sought to enjoin enforcement of a state obscenity statute.although no state proceedings were pending against the theater owners at the time the federal complaint was filed,criminal charges had been filed against two employees of the theater,and authorities had seized four copies of the allegedly obscene film.the court concluded that younger could not be avoided under these circumstances,because the interests of the theater owners and the employees were intertwined,and the federal action sought to interfere with the pending state prosecution.id.
this principle was reaffirmed in doran salem inn,d,where the supreme court reiterated that there may be some circumstances where plaintiffs are so closely related that abstention will be warranted although not all plaintiffs are subject to the pending state proceeding.doran involved a suit by three bar owners who sought to enjoin enforcement of a local ordinance prohibiting topless dancing.see id.at.although all three bar owners had similar business interests and were represented by the same counsel,only one of the owners had been criminally prosecuted in state court.see id.at.because,the plaintiffs were otherwise unrelated in terms of ownership,control,and management,the court declined to apply younger to the two bar owners who had not been subject to state prosecution.see id.at.
while both hicks and doran arguably focus on the fact of joint ownership and control,neither decision limits the application of younger to cases where the parties are financially related or linked by mutual management.courts have consistently recognized that while c ongruence of interests is not enough,by itself,to warrant abstention,where the plaintiffs interests are so inextricably intertwined that direct interference with the state court proceeding is inevitable,younger may extend to bar the claims of plaintiffs who are not party to the pending state proceeding.see,green city of tucson,cir en banc see also cedar rapids cellular,miller,cir noting that for younger purposes,the parties in federal and state court need not be identical where the interests of the parties seeking relief in federal court are closely related to those of the parties in pending state proceedings and where the federal action seeks to interfere with pending state proceedings internal quotation marks omitted.
in applying younger to,courts should be sensitive to the fact that,abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the narrow exception,not the rule,cecos int l,jorling,cir,and that there is no doctrine requiring abstention merely because resolution of a federal question may result in the overturning of a state policy.zablocki redhail,d see also green,at warning that younger abstention is not intended to cut a broad swath through the fabric of federal jurisdiction,relegating parties to state court whenever state court litigation could resolve a federal question robinson stovall,cir.unit a noting that e xcept in extraordinary circumstances,a civil rights plaintiff ability to sue to vindicate his rights in federal court is not affected by the simultaneous pendency of a state prosecution against someone else unless the federal plaintiff seeks to directly enjoin the pending state prosecution.
although plaintiffs may seek the same relief,parallel challenges to the constitutionality of a state statute or policy are typically not barred by younger absent other factors indicating that the plaintiffs interests are legally interwoven or interconnected.see generally steffel thompson,d plaintiff was not barred from seeking federal declaratory relief,where only his companion had been arrested for distributing handbills,and no state criminal proceeding was pending against plaintiff at the time the federal complaint was filed casa marie,at noting that unrelated,legally distinct parties may mount separate but simultaneous legal challenges to the constitutionality of a state statute in this case,however,mcnally and kermani do not assert independent first amendment rights,nor do they bring truly separate challenges to the judicial conduct rules.
because the judicial conduct rules apply only to judges and judicial candidates,mcnally and kermani are not directly regulated by the challenged rules.instead,mcnally and kermani claim standing to bring suit based on their interest in receiving political speech from judges and judicial candidates and in associating politically with elected judges without the restrictions imposed by the conduct rules.while it is that the first amendment protects not only the right to engage in protected speech,but also the right to receive such speech,see.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d noting that where a willing speaker exists,first amendment protection extends to both the source as well as the recipient of the protected communication,it remains true that the rights of the recipients of speech such as mcnally and kermani derive in the first instance from the primary rights of the speaker.see in re app.of dow jones,cir,cert.denied sub nom.dow jones simon,d,los angeles branch jones,cir,cert.denied,d.
as a result,mcnally and kermani may claim no greater first amendment protection than spargo,and their s uccess on the merits is entirely derivative of whatever rights that spargo may have to engage in the prohibited speech and political activity see in re app.of dow jones,at explaining that plaintiff news agencies right to receive speech does not enlarge the rights of those directly subject to the challenged restraining order jones,at concluding that voter plaintiffs,as recipients of campaign speech,have no greater rights than the candidates to have candidates publish statements,and plaintiffs status as voters in an election does not extend their first amendment rights to include a more general right to receive publicly funded campaign speech.because mcnally and kermani could have a protected interest in hearing spargo speak and in associating politically with spargo only if spargo has an underlying first amendment right to engage in such speech and political activity,the legal analysis of the plaintiffs claims are unavoidably intertwined and inseparable.mcnally and kermani claims are largely the of spargo first amendment challenge,and it would be impossible for the district court to analyze plaintiffs claims independently without first analyzing spargo constitutional right to engage in the charged conduct,a matter which,under younger,must be resolved in the pending state disciplinary proceeding.
because plaintiffs claims are essentially derivative,this case presents one of the narrow circumstances in which younger may properly extend to bar claims of who are not directly involved in the pending state action allee medrano,d burger,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part reasoning that younger abstention should also apply to a union first amendment claims,where the union is seeking to assert the interests of members prosecuted
