after the census,arizona independent redistricting commission commission,comprising two republicans,two democrats,and one independent,redrew arizona legislative districts,with guidance from legal counsel,mapping specialists,a statistician,and a voting rights act specialist.the initial plan had a maximum population deviation from absolute equality of districts of,but the commission adopted a revised plan with an deviation on a vote,with the republican members dissenting.after the department of justice approved the revised plan as consistent with the voting rights act,appellants filed suit,claiming that the plan population variations were inconsistent with the fourteenth amendment.a federal district court entered judgment for the commission,concluding that the deviations were primarily a result of efforts to comply with the voting rights act even though partisanship played some role.
held the district court did not err in upholding arizona redistricting plan.
a the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause requires states to make an honest and good faith effort to construct legislative districts as nearly of equal population as is practicable,reynolds sims,but mathematical perfection is not required.deviations may be justified by legitimate considerations,at,including traditional districting principles such as compactness and contiguity,shaw reno,as well as a state interest in maintaining the integrity of political subdivisions,mahan howell,a competitive balance among political parties,gaffney cummings,and,before shelby county holder,compliance with of the voting rights act.it was proper for the commission to proceed on the last basis here.in addition,minor deviations from mathematical equality deviations under,brown thomson,do not,by themselves,make out a prima facie case of invidious discrimination under the fourteenth amendment requiring justification by the state,gaffney,supra,at.because the deviation here is under,appellants can not rely upon the numbers to show a constitutional violation.instead,they must show that it is more probable than not that the deviation reflects the predominance of illegitimate reapportionment factors rather than legitimate considerations.
b appellants have failed to meet that burden here,where the record supports the district court conclusion that the deviations predominantly reflected commission efforts to achieve compliance with the voting rights act,not to secure political advantage for the democratic party.to meet the voting rights act nonretrogression requirement,a new plan,when compared to the current plan benchmark plan,must not diminish the number of districts in which minority groups can elect their preferred candidates of choice districts.a state can obtain legal assurance that it has satisfied this requirement if it submits its proposed plan to the justice department and the department does not object to the plan.the record shows that the commission redrew the initial map to ensure that the plan had districts,the same number as the benchmark plan.but after a statistician reported that the justice department still might not agree with the plan,the commission changed additional boundaries,causing district,a republican leaning district,to become more politically competitive.because this record well supports the district court finding that the commission was trying to comply with the voting rights act,appellants have not shown that it is more probable than not that illegitimate considerations were the predominant motivation for the deviations.they have thus failed to show that the plan violates the equal protection clause.
c appellants additional arguments are unpersuasive.while arizona districts may be somewhat underpopulated and its districts somewhat overpopulated,these variations may reflect only the tendency of arizona minority populations to vote disproportionately for democrats and thus can be explained by the commission efforts to maintain at least districts.cox larios,in which the court affirmed a district court conclusion that a georgia reapportionment plan violated the equal protection clause where its deviation,though less than,resulted from the use of illegitimate factors,is inapposite because appellants have not carried their burden of showing the use of illegitimate factors here.and because shelby county was decided after arizona plan was created,it has no bearing on the issue whether the state attempt to comply with the voting rights act is a legitimate state interest.

on appeal from the united states district court for the district of arizona 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
appellants,a group of arizona voters,challenge a plan for the state legislature on the ground that the plan districts are insufficiently equal in population.see reynolds sims.because the maximum population deviation between the largest and the smallest district is less than,the appellants can not simply rely upon the numbers to show that the plan violates the constitution.see brown thomson.nor have appellants adequately supported their contentions with other evidence.we consequently affirm a federal district court decision upholding the plan.
in,arizona voters,using the initiative process,amended the arizona constitution to provide for an independent redistricting commission.see arizona state legislature arizona independent redistricting comm n,slip,at upholding the amendment as consistent with federal constitutional and statutory law.each decade,the arizona commission on appellate court appointments creates three slates of individuals one slate of republicans,one slate of democrats,and one slate of individuals not affiliated with any political party.the majority and minority leader of the arizona legislature each select one redistricting commission member from the first two lists.these four selected individuals in turn choose one member from the third,nonpartisan list.see,art.iv,pt.thus,the membership of the commission consists of two republicans,two democrats,and one independent.
after each decennial census,the commission redraws arizona legislative districts.the first step in the process is to create districts of equal population in a pattern across the state.it then adjusts the grid to the extent practicable in order to take into account the need for population equality to maintain geographic compactness and continuity to show respect for communities of interest to follow locality boundaries and to use visible geographic features and undivided tracts.b e.the commission will favo r political competitive ness as long as its efforts to do so create no significant detriment to the other goals.f.finally,it must adjust boundaries as necessary to comply with the federal constitution and with the federal voting rights act.a.
after the census,the legislative leadership selected the commission two republican and two democratic members,who in turn selected an independent member,colleen mathis.mathis was then elected chairwoman.the commission hired two counsel,one of whom they thought of as leaning democrat and one as leaning republican.it also hired consultants,including mapping specialists,a statistician,and a voting rights act specialist.with the help of its staff,it drew an initial plan,based upon the gridlike map,with district boundaries that produced a maximum population deviation calculated as the difference between the most populated and least populated district of.after changing several boundaries,including those of districts,and,the commission adopted a revised plan by a vote of to,with the two republican members voting against it.in late april,the department of justice approved
