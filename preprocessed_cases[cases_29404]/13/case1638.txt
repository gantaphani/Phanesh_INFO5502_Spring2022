the government appeals from judge stanton order vacating the convictions and sentence of petitioner douglas rega,pursuant to.see rega united states,civ,wl,rega ii.the district court concluded that rega did not receive the constitutionally required effective assistance of counsel because his attorney prevented him from testifying on his own behalf.see rega united states,cr,wl,at,rega i.the district court further concluded that there was a reasonable probability that the failure to testify adversely affected the outcome of rega trial.see rega ii,wl,at.
we hold that there is no reasonable probability that rega testimony would have altered the outcome of his trial.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
rega and were charged with violating the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,c d,and various other federal laws through their involvement in the activities of a racketeering enterprise known as the demeo crew,a component of the gambino organized crime family.rega was also charged with various substantive offenses that need not be detailed.
rega alleged role in the enterprise was to supply the demeo crew with pornographic films,which the crew then sold for a large profit.the government further alleged that rega paid the demeo crew to kill his uncle,fred todaro,who also was in the pornography business,because of a dispute over the building in which they duplicated films.according to the government,rega had todaro killed to gain control of the building,which could at the time be profitably converted into apartments.
after a trial before judge broderick rega was convicted on all counts.in october,judge broderick sentenced rega to forty years imprisonment.on direct appeal,we affirmed rega conviction.see united states dinome,cir united states dinome,cir unpublished summary order rejecting rega claims that evidence was improperly admitted and legally insufficient,counsel was ineffective,and government remarks during summation were prejudicial.
in,rega filed the present petition alleging,inter alia,that his counsel refused to let him testify and therefore provided constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment relying primarily on affidavits submitted by rega trial counsel,judge stanton concluded that rega was not adequately informed of his right to testify see rega i,wl,at.initially,the district court also held that rega had not shown that he had been prejudiced by this omission because,by his own description,his testimony would either have duplicated evidence admitted at trial or was otherwise insufficient to affect the outcome of the trial.see id.at.however,the court denied the petition without prejudice,allowing rega to submit additional papers with regard to the probability that his testimony would have altered the result.see id.at.rega thereafter amplified his proposed testimony.based on the new submission,the district court decided that rega had shown a reasonable probability that,had he testified,he would have been acquitted.see rega ii,wl,at.
the district court found that rega testimony would have undermined the government case in five specific ways that we discuss in detail infra,and that o ne can not assess with certainty the degree to which would have impeached rega defense.id.at.the court acknowledged that defense counsel believed that it was highly inadvisable for rega to testify because his testimony would open the door for the government to introduce rega previous conviction for pornography and audiotapes of conversations between rega and his mother in which rega repeatedly expressed his hostility to todaro along with threats to harm him.the district court found that the pornography conviction would not have been mortal to rega defense,because rega explained that he was convicted only because he was the film laboratory manager and that he had no knowledge of the nature of the films duplicated.as to the tapes,the district court concluded that t he jury may see them as merely an extravagant,private of steam.id.the court therefore granted the petition.see id.at.
this appeal followed.we granted a stay of the district court order pending appeal.
discussion 
a defendant in a criminal case has the constitutional right to testify on his own behalf,see rock arkansas,d,and we have held that a trial counsel duty of effective assistance includes the responsibility to advise the defendant concerning the exercise of this constitutional right,brown artuz,cir.to bring a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel under the sixth amendment,however,a defendant must show not only counsel deficient performance,but also a reasonable probability that the deficiency prejudiced the outcome.see strickland washington,d defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,see flores demskie,cir,cert.denied,d zovluck united states,cir,and its decision to grant the petition de novo,see mask mcginnis,cir,petition for cert.filed.we conclude that it was clear error for the district court to find a reasonable probability that rega proposed testimony would have altered the outcome of the trial.
our analysis will begin with a description of the government case against rega.we will then outline rega proposed testimony and its effect in opening the door to further prosecution evidence.finally,we will discuss the five specific areas of rega proposed testimony relied upon by the district court in concluding that there was a reasonable probability that such testimony would have led to an acquittal.
at trial,the government produced ample evidence of rega involvement in duplicating pornographic films,storing them in his mother house,and then distributing them to the demeo crew.todaro operated a film laboratory out of a building that he originally owned.rega had worked for,or with,todaro for many years,and todaro was also involved in pornographic film trafficking.the evidence was somewhat unclear as to whether rega similar activities were in conjunction with todaro,an independent venture,or a combination thereof.
the government offered extensive evidence of a dispute between rega and todaro over control of the building.there was testimony that todaro had transferred title to the business and the building to rega,or to some entity or person under rega control,in order to hide assets temporarily during todaro divorce proceedings.after todaro divorce,however,rega refused to return the building and business to todaro because rega had come upon a profitable opportunity to convert the building into apartments.todaro brought a lawsuit contesting rights of possession claiming to be a tenant of the building and of the film equipment in it.the lawsuit,which ended after todaro disappeared as a result of his murder,was portrayed by the government as threatening rega plans.
there was much evidence that rega dispute with todaro was not limited to the mounting of legal claims and defenses.at one point,rega,who was shown to have been involved in violent acts and to have carried firearms,told todaro son that if his father continued to seek control of the building,the father would get hurt.witnesses also testified that rega sought out todaro at rega aunt house and beat todaro while attempting to kidnap him.there was further evidence,including statements by rega himself,that rega paid the demeo crew to murder todaro.
rega submissions in response to the court invitation to provide more detail cover some pages.in his proposed testimony,he denied any involvement in the pornographic film business,while conceding that todaro might have been so involved without rega knowledge.
he described his relationship with todaro as friendly,albeit at times difficult because of todaro serious personal and financial difficulties,as to which rega offered advice and aid.he also described his differences with his uncle solely as the result of todaro lack of management skills and growing irrationality.rega stated that th
