opinion of the court 
a medical professional charged with assessing the clinical progress of a civilly committed sexually violent predator considered this detainee first amendment activities in connection with her recommendation that he not advance to the next phase of his treatment program.on interlocutory appeal,we are asked to determine whether the medical professional has qualified immunity from the resulting first amendment retaliation claim.because the detainee has pleaded facts reflecting that the medical professional based her recommendation on the medically relevant collateral consequences of his protected activity,but has not sufficiently pleaded that the recommendation was based on the protected activity itself,the detainee has not alleged the necessary causation to state a prima facie case of retaliation.accordingly,we will reverse and remand.
appellant debra roquet is a psychologist at the special treatment unit stu in avenel,new jersey,where lorenzo oliver,a sexually violent predator with a long history of convictions for both sexual and offenses,has been civilly committed to state custody for treatment pursuant to the sexually violent predator act,stat.ann.to.at the stu,treatment takes place in five phases,culminating in the detainee conditional discharge into the community on successful completion of the program.at least once a year,the treatment progress review committee tprc interviews each detainee individually and considers a broad range of materials including reports from and interviews with representatives of the detainee multidisciplinary treatment team in order to formulate a recommendation to the clinical assessment review committee carp about whether the patient should progress to the next step in the treatment program.
roquet was one of two members of the tprc and,on its behalf,wrote an report the tprc report that described oliver condition and recommended that he remain in phase two of treatment.the tprc report recognized that this was not consistent with the recommendation of oliver treatment team,which had suggested that he advance to phase three of treatment,but concluded that oliver had not fully met the treatment goals consistent with completion of phase.app.carp approved the tprc recommendation and oliver thus remained in phase two.
the tprc report set forth oliver statutorily defined mental abnormalities,noting that he suffers from,among other things,paraphilia and antisocial personality disorder.in addition to providing a detailed overview of oliver sexual and offenses,diagnostic history,and clinical treatment,the report summarized the results of the tprc interview with oliver,including that i n general,it appears that he denies,minimizes or justifies much of his documented offense history,app,and that h e did not demonstrate remorse for his crimes or empathy for his victims,app.the report noted that when asked to clarify his version of his offense history,oliver was confusing and ultimately evasive.app.at one point h e acknowledged that he enjoyed the rapes,app,and at another point he stated that h e never had a rape fantasy or did not remember if he had,app.the report also included the following comment 
t he panel observed that oliver earlier asserted that he did not regularly participate in one recommended treatment component because he was too busy.he protested,stating that he is fully participating in treatment but he is constantly writing for other people.he has written t housands of pages in days.this is because there are paralegals here for people.he said that he does this because he wants to help people.
the report concluded with a section entitled clinic formulation and treatment recommendations,which discussed the tprc assessment of oliver progress and made recommendations for the coming year.this section contained the following passages 
note that oliver is highly legalistic and knowledgeable,having received training to enable him to help other prisoners with legal matters while incarcerated.oliver also has a history of pro se representation in the community.he reports that he gets satisfaction from helping others however he has a history of abusing the use of his knowledge by charging fees for services,both in prison and in the stu.
oliver continues to be legalistically focused,although he has managed to keep that out of his focus in group most of the time.he continued to dedicate a great deal of time and energy to his role as paralegal providing services to other residents and he also produces a newsletter.as he advances in treatment,oliver may need to examine whether this focus deflects from a focus on treatment or whether it is in any other way.it is of some concern that he reported problems with officers as result sic of these activities given that oliver has an institutional history of conflicts with doc when he was at avenel that ultimately took precedence over participation in the treatment program.the tprc wants to see that he is not headed in the same direction at the stu.
proceeding pro se,oliver filed a complaint in the district of new jersey asserting five causes of action,only one of which is relevant to this appeal oliver alleged based on the tprc report that roquet violated his first amendment right of free speech by refusing to recommend him for phase three treatment in retaliation for his participation in legal activities of two general types those he conducted on his own behalf,and those he conducted on behalf of other stu residents.
roquet moved to dismiss the complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure but did not then assert a qualified immunity defense.the district court denied the motion to dismiss as to oliver first amendment retaliation claim concluding that oliver had alleged sufficient facts to allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that his protected conduct was a motivating factor in roquet decision not to promote him to phase three.oliver roquet,wl,at.roquet did not appeal that decision.
with permission from the district court,oliver filed an amended complaint,which roquet again moved to dismiss.this time,roquet did assert a qualified immunity defense,which the district court declined to consider as rule g bars a party from raising a defense or objection in a successive motion under rule that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.oliver roquet,wl,at.the district court thus denied roquet motion to dismiss,but explained that roquet could raise a qualified immunity defense in a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule c or a motion for summary judgment pursuant to rule a.id.at.
roquet did not appeal those rulings but instead her qualified immunity defense in a motion for summary judgment.oliver responded by requesting discovery concerning that defense,a request the district court construed as a motion to defer the summary judgment motion and to allow discovery under rule d.although the district court acknowledged that courts have a preference for resolving questions of qualified immunity before discovery is ordered,it concluded that in this particular case,without any discovery,this pro se plaintiff would be foreclosed from being able to show that there is a question of fact as to whether defendant knowingly violated his right to free speech.app.the district court therefore denied roquet motion for summary judgment without prejudice,instructed the parties to meet and confer on discovery issues,and noted that roquet would be permitted to her motion after discovery.roquet timely answered oliver amended complaint and filed this appeal,and we appointed amicus curiae to assist oliver in appellate proceedings 
we exercise plenary review over a district court denial of summary judgment.levy sterling holding,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.gonzalez amr,cir.we review a district court decision to grant discovery under rule d for abuse of discretion.murphy millennium radio,cir.
we begin by addressing whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.because we conclude we do,we then consider whether the district court properly ordered discovery instead of granting summary judgment to roquet based on her qualified immunity claim.
government officials are entitled to qualified immunity insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.sharp johnson,cir.quoting pearson callahan.when the defense of qualified immunity is raised and denied,a defendant is generally entitled to an immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine so long as the denial turns on an issue of law.walker horn,cir.
here,the district court said it was not denying qualified immunity,but rather was postponing its decision because,without discovery,oliver would be foreclosed from being able to show that there is a question of fact as to whether defendant knowingly violated his right to free speech.app.in light of that ruling,oliver and amicus argue we lack jurisdiction over roquet appeal because roquet did not timely raise qualified immunity roquet defense of qualified immunity has not been denied and even if roquet qualified immunity defense were denied,it was denied on a factual,not legal,basis.none of these arguments withstand scrutiny.
first,although amicus makes much of the fact that roquet did not assert qualified immunity in her first motion to dismiss,there is no firm rule as to when a defendant must raise this affirmative defense,sharp,at,and the defense is not necessarily waived by a defendant who raises it later in the case,eddy water power,cir.indeed,it may be raised even after trial if the plaintiff suffers no prejudice.sharp,at.thus,roquet failure to assert qualified immunity at an earlier stage does not divest us of jurisdiction over her immediate appeal 
second,qualified immunity may be denied,giving rise to appellate jurisdiction,not only where the denial is express.in in re montgomery county,this court joined numerous other courts of appeals in holding that a district court implicit denial of the appellants immunity claims is sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction.wright montgomery cty.in re montgomery cty,cir.see also brown armenti,cir.even though a district court does not explicitly address the immunity claims in denying summary judgment,we nonetheless have jurisdiction to review the implied denial of those claims.and qualified immunity may be implicitly denied when a government official otherwise entitled to immunity is nonetheless subjected to the burdens of such pretrial matters as discovery.behrens pelletier,internal quotation marks omitted.that is,unless the plaintiff allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law,a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery,mitchell forsyth,and a refusal to dismiss is a ruling conclusive as to this right,for which immediate appeal must be available,behrens,at see also anderson creighton,concluding that if the actions alleged are actions that a reasonable officer could have believed lawful then the officer is entitled to dismissal prior to discovery.
third,roquet qualified immunity defense was not denied on a factual basis but rather on an appealable legal ground.as explained above,the district court granted discovery,reasoning that without it oliver would be foreclosed from being able to show that there is a question of fact as to whether roquet knowingly violated his right to free speech.app.this ruling may be separated into legal and factual components.eddy,at.the factual component,apparent on the face of the order,pertains to the question of whether roquet violation of oliver right to free speech was knowing.but the legal component,implicit in that ruling,is the district court conclusion that oliver had adequately pleaded such a violation and that the right violated was then clearly established.sharp,at quoting pearson,at.if oliver complaint did not satisfy that legal component,then roquet was entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law,the district court denial of summary judgment was erroneous,and its decision to grant discovery under rule d was necessarily an abuse of discretion 
having satisfied any concern as to our jurisdiction,we turn to the question of whether roquet was entitled to qualified immunity.
we start by considering whether oliver has sufficiently alleged a violation of his first amendment rights.this analysis requires us to outline the elements a plaintiff must plead to a state a claim for relief.bistrian levi,cir.we will then peel away those allegations that are no more than conclusions and thus not entitled to the assumption of truth,and assuming the veracity of the factual allegations that remain,determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.id.quoting ashcroft iqbal.
mindful of the differences between the incarcerated and the civilly confined we are nonetheless persuaded that prisoner retaliation actions are an appropriate starting point for our analysis of the elements of oliver cause of action.retaliating against a prisoner for the exercise of his constitutional rights is unconstitutional,bistrian,at,and this is of course no less true where the retaliation is directed against a civilly committed person,see disability rights,comm r,dep t of human,cir.c ommitted individuals are entitled to at least as much constitutional protection in this context as prisoners.youngberg romeo,if it is cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions,it must be unconstitutional to confine the involuntarily committed who may not be punished at all in unsafe conditions.
to state a first amendment retaliation claim,a prisoner plaintiff must allege that the conduct which led to the alleged retaliation was constitutionally protected that he suffered some adverse action at the hands of the prison officials and a causal link between the exercise of his constitutional rights and the adverse action taken against him,or more specifically,that his constitutionally protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to take that action.rauser horn,cir.once the prisoner has made his prima facie case,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.id.at.
in this case,the parties dispute what is required under the causation prong of the rauser test and whether oliver has alleged facts giving rise to the inference that his protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision not to advance him the challenge here is that,although oliver makes the conclusory allegation in his complaint that he suffered an adverse action based on his protected activity,the facts that oliver alleges to support that causal link are drawn from the tprc report,and nothing in the report which we may consider in its entirety in this context as a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint,in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.emphasis omitted suggests that oliver litigation activity itself was the basis of roquet recommendation rather,on its face,the report reflects that,to the extent roquet considered oliver litigation activity in recommending against his advancement,it was only to note that certain problematic behaviors on which the recommendation was based including oliver being distracted from his treatment,his manipulative behavior,and his hostile relationship with stu staff manifested themselves in oliver litigation activities.
oliver does not argue that it was impermissible for roquet to base her recommendation on those behaviors instead,his argument seems to be that because the report reflects that roquet identified his litigation activity as associated with those behaviors,oliver has sufficiently pleaded causation.in other words,oliver contends that by alleging a medical professional considered protected activity at all,even if only as a symptom of or giving rise to medically relevant behaviors,a plaintiff can satisfy rauser causation prong at the pleading stage.that can not be,and is not,the law.to understand why more is needed in this context,we briefly review the supreme court and our jurisprudence related to this causation question.
we derived the rauser framework,in significant part,from mount healthy board of education doyle,the supreme court decision on retaliation claims arising in the public employment context.the tests developed by the court in mount healthy and our court in rauser to assess retaliation claims reflect the premise that protected activity is virtually never a permissible basis for state employees to take adverse action,much the way protected characteristics like race or sex are presumptively invalid bases for state action in the discrimination context.see,mcdonnell douglas green,pivirotto innovative,cir.see also wilkie robbins,drawing a parallel between the methods for identifying the presence of an illicit reason established by the supreme court in the retaliation and discrimination contexts.because it is generally impermissible for a state actor to hinge an adverse decision on such an activity or characteristic,any consideration of the activity or characteristic in the process leading to the adverse action is,in the normal course,sufficient to satisfy the causation element of a prima facie retaliation or discrimination case.see,healthy,at pryor collegiate athletic ass,cir.
this premise makes sense in most cases,as there is rarely a valid reason for a state actor to even consider a person protected activity or characteristics like race and gender when evaluating if an adverse action is appropriate.the supreme court has acknowledged,however,that there will be exceptions to this general rule,and that allegations of mere consideration of protected activity will not always be enough to plead causation in a retaliation case.instead,as the court explained in hartman moore,the necessary proof of a connection between the protected activity and the adverse action will depend on the circumstances.
when evaluating what allegations will satisfy this requirement,we also must consider the pleading standards set forth in bell atlantic corporation twombly,and ashcroft iqbal.that is,a plaintiff allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,twombly,at,and must reflect more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully,iqbal,at.a plaintiff bare assertions amount ing to nothing more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a constitutional retaliation claim,will not suffice.id at quoting twombly,at.
with these standards in mind,it is clear that,in the context of a retaliation claim against a mental health professional at a state institution,a prima facie showing of causation requires more than the allegation that the professional based a medical decision on symptomology that happened to relate in some way to a patient protected activity.there must be particular facts alleged that allow the court to reasonably infer it is the protected activity itself,and not simply medically relevant behavior associated with that activity,that formed the basis of the defendant adverse action.this is so because a medical professional holistic approach to diagnosing a patient mental health will sometimes require consideration of his otherwise protected speech and conduct to evaluate any adverse consequences they are having on his treatment.framed in terms of the rauser test and the relevant pleading standards,an assertion by a mental health detainee that his treating psychologist retaliated against him,based only on the factual allegation that the psychologist considered the effect his first amendment activity was having on his treatment,would not support the inference that retaliation was the substantial or motivating factor for the psychologist recommendation.
suppose,for example,that a psychologist ordered continued detention and treatment of a detainee with paranoid schizophrenia based,among other things,on her observation that the detainee obsessive filing of complaints alleging conspiracy theories was symptomatic of continued paranoia and had consumed his time to the exclusion of therapeutic activities.we could hardly say the psychologist consideration of the detainee protected activity to the extent the psychologist simply noted its association with the symptomology on which her medical decision was based was sufficient alone to plead causation and to create an inference of retaliation.indeed,to conclude otherwise would create a perverse incentive for psychologists to ignore medically relevant detainee behaviors simply because those behaviors coincidentally involve conduct protected by the first amendment.as demonstrated by this example,the mere allegation that a mental health professional considered a patient protected activity to be associated in some way with the medically relevant conduct on which the adverse action,on its face,was based will not raise the patient right to relief above the speculative level.twombly,at.
our holding is also supported by the supreme court repeated admonitions that we owe deference to medical professionals in both the prison and civil commitment contexts.see washington harper,parham.most notably,in youngberg romeo,because of the special expertise of medical professionals regarding those institutionally committed to their care and the need to minimize interference by the federal judiciary with the internal operations of state institutions the supreme court stressed judicial deference to their treatment decisions and expressed concerns about imposing upon them standards that would force them to make judgments in the shadow of legal liability.id.at.to determine whether intellectually disabled individuals who have been involuntarily committed can recover damages against doctors and other experts responsible for their treatment,the court ultimately held in that case that medical professionals decisions are presumptively valid and liability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment,practice,or standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.id.at.requiring that a prima facie case of retaliation involve more than just the allegation that a psychologist took account of facially relevant medical behaviors including those associated in some way with a patient protected activity is consistent with the presumptive validity we accord to these professionals medical judgment.
this requirement for pleading causation in the context of a mental health professional clinical decisions also aligns with new jersey legitimate state interest in providing appropriate rehabilitation to sexually violent offenders.new jersey statutory system is designed to balance the rights of the individual with the purpose of ensuring that the person participates in necessary treatment and that the person does not represent a risk to public safety.stat.ann.c.the same provision that charges the stu with provid ing or arrang ing for custodial care of sexually violent predators specifies that the rights and rules of conduct applicable to a person subject to involuntary commitment as a sexually violent predator are to be established by regulations that specifically address the differing needs and specific characteristics of,and treatment protocols related to,sexually violent predators.id.a,d.in short,the constitutional rights of those committed under the state statute are not absolute but are subject to treatment protocols designed to ensure fulfillment of the objectives of their commitment and rehabilitation.to hold that a prima facie case of retaliation could be established merely by alleging that a medical professional considered the effect a detainee protected activity was having on his treatment would motivate those responsible for administering this system to refrain from addressing behavior often pertinent to a detainee treatment and would undercut new jersey legitimate interest in rehabilitating its sexually violent offenders.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that in order to satisfy the third element
