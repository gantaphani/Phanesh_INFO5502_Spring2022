in response to plaintiffs freedom of information act foia request for all records in the central database of defendant office of personnel management opm,opm withheld from disclosure the names and information of over federal employees.in a pair of orders,the united states district court for the northern district of new york norman mordue,granted in part and denied in part each side motion for summary judgment resolving the applicability of foia personal privacy exemption exemption,b.the district court ruled that opm could withhold all employee names,but that only some of the information could be withheld.we agree that the names could be withheld,but conclude that opm was entitled to withhold all of the information.
background 
plaintiffs susan long and david burnham are professors at syracuse university and of the transactional records access clearinghouse trac,a,research,and distribution organization affiliated with the university.trac stated purpose is to provide the public and oversight institutions with comprehensive information about federal staffing,spending,and the enforcement activities of the federal government.
among other techniques,plaintiffs use foia to get records and data from opm central personnel data file cpdf,a database of approximately data elements,or fields,concerning the federal civilian workforce opm static files have information about federal employees at a particular moment in time its dynamic files record personnel actions over intervals.covered agencies submit quarterly data to opm,which stores it in the cpdf.in addition to each employee name,the cpdf other fields include salary history,duty station,occupation,work schedule,and veteran status.
for a time,opm provided plaintiffs with all the data fields contained in the cpdf,including those associated with the civilian workforce of the department of defense dod near,plaintiffs requested cpdf records for that year.in february,opm told plaintiffs it would be applying a datarelease policy to their request.the upshot of this new policy is that opm redacted the names and information for over federal employees,the majority of whom were civilian dod employees the information withheld includes six data elements organizational component code,duty post,bargaining unit,statistical area,combined statistical area,and locality pay,which together disclose only the city and county where the employee works,but not the street address.for some employees whose information was redacted,opm nevertheless indicated whether they worked within the washington,metropolitan area.
opm withheld names and at least some information for i all employees in what it deemed to be five sensitive federal agencies bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf,drug enforcement agency dea,dod,secret service,and united states mint and ii for those employees across all federal agencies who are in sensitive occupation categories,police,criminal investigating,nuclear engineering,game law enforcement 
the policy change was.according to the affidavit of opm foia officer,gary lukowski,the events of september,particularly the attack on the a subsequent anthrax attack caused opm to review the vulnerability of the federal workforce to harassment and attack.opm new policy was in part motivated by a similar change in policy undertaken by the dod in the immediate aftermath of september opm also attributes its change in policy to an outcry by a number of individuals and federal agencies in response to a washington post feature that provided online access to the cpdf,which allowed anyone to search for federal employees by name,federal agency,or locality.
to justify withholding the names and information,opm invoked exemption of foia,which protects from disclosure personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.plaintiffs unsuccessfully grieved some of the decisions through opm.
this suit seeks disclosure of the information withheld.on for summary judgment,the district court ruled that opm properly redacted the names and duty stations for federal employees in the five sensitive agencies and four of the sensitive occupations general national resources and biological science plant protection and quarantine hearings and appeals and border patrol.see long office of pers.mgmt.long i,civ,wl,at.after further briefing,the court ruled that opm also properly withheld the names of federal employees in the remaining occupations,see long office of personnel mgmt.long ii,civ,wl,at,but that exemption did not allow withholding of information for the remaining sensitive occupations,id.at.the parties.
discussion 
foia was enacted to promote honest and open government,grand cent,cuomo,cir,and to ensure public access to information created by the government in order to hold the governors accountable to the governed,tigue dep t of justice,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it strongly favors a policy of disclosure and requires the government to disclose its records unless its documents fall within one of the specific,enumerated exemptions set forth in the act.council of la raza dep t of justice,cir internal citation omitted.foia exemptions are construed narrowly,and a court is to resolve all doubts in favor of disclosure.see grand cent,at.the government bears the burden of establishing that any claimed exemption applies.council of la raza,at.
foia exemption permits federal agencies to withhold from disclosure personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.to determine whether a federal agency may withhold information pursuant to exemption,we first determine whether the information is kept in personnel or medical files or similar files.see dep t of state.post.if so,we balance the public need for the information against the individual privacy interest to determine whether the disclosure of the names would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.wood fbi,cir quoting b accord dep t of state ray.
in resolving summary judgment motions in a foia case,a district court proceeds primarily by affidavits in lieu of other documentary or testimonial evidence,as we have explained 
in order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a foia case,the defending agency has the burden of showing that its search was adequate and that any withheld documents fall within an exemption to the foia.affidavits or declarations supplying facts indicating that the agency has conducted a thorough search and giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption are sufficient to sustain the agency burden.affidavits submitted by an agency are accorded a presumption of good faith accordingly,discovery relating to the agency search and the exemptions it claims for withholding records generally is unnecessary if the agency submissions are adequate on their face.when this is the case,the district court may forgo discovery and award summary judgment on the basis of affidavits.
carney dep t of justice,cir internal quotation marks,footnote,and citations omitted.neither party contends that the record in the district court was deficient.accordingly,we now undertake the same analysis for each category of withheld information,reviewing the district court judgment de novo,see council of la raza,at 
the district court ruled that the names of the federal employees in the five sensitive agencies and sensitive occupations were properly withheld because opm had demonstrated that disclosure of employee names could subject them to harassment or attack.long i,wl,at long ii,wl,at.we conclude that the public interests weighing in favor of disclosure are few and weak,and are clearly outweighed by the employees privacy interests.
plaintiffs contend that federal employees interest in their names is m inimal or n on e xistent,and can not outweigh the public interest in disclosure appellants br.the balancing analysis for foia exemption requires that we first determine whether disclosure of the files would compromise a substantial,as opposed to de minimis,privacy interest,because if no significant privacy interest is implicated foia demands disclosure.multi ag media llc dep t of,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted accord fed.labor relations auth.dep t of veterans affairs,cir.but the bar is low foia requires only a measurable interest in privacy to trigger the application of the disclosure balancing tests.fed.labor relations auth.dep t of veterans affairs,at.
the analysis is context specific.names and other identifying information do not always present a significant threat to an individual privacy interest.wood,at emphasis added accord ray,at we emphasize,however,that we are not implying that disclosure of a list of names and other identifying information is inherently and always a significant threat to the privacy of the individuals on the list.w hether disclosure of a list of names is a significant or a de minimis threat depends upon the characteristic s revealed by virtue of being on the particular list,and the consequences likely to ensue.ray,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
it is not uncommon for courts to recognize a privacy interest in a federal employee work status as opposed to some more intimate detail if the occupation alone could subject the employee to harassment or attack.courts have recognized,for example,a privacy interest in the names of employees who worked on the regulatory approval of a controversial drug,see judicial watch,fda,and of law enforcement agents who participated in an investigation,see wood,at nix united states,cir.
the record on appeal persuades us that the federal employees in both the sensitive agencies and the sensitive occupations have a cognizable privacy interest in keeping their names from being disclosed wholesale.michael donley,the director of administration and management at dod attests that withholding of employee names is one of many security measures instituted after the attack on the pentagon on september to make it as difficult as possible for adversaries to collect valuable information that will enable them to carry out attacks on dod personnel.moreover,disclosure of names could permit the targeting of individual federal employees and their families outside the workplace.lukowski,opm foia officer,explains many of the agencies deal with national security,homeland security,or law enforcement,and the mission and nature of the work performed by those agencies rendered not only individuals in specific occupations within the agencies,but any employee in the agency,vulnerable to harassment or attack.opm submissions sufficiently demonstrate that,by and large,federal employees in the sensitive agencies and occupations face an increased risk of harassment or attack.
plaintiffs interpose two further objections.first,they point out that,under law developed in another circuit,exemption is not a blanket exemption,baez dep t of justice,or a categorical rule,armstrong exec.office of the president,protecting the names of federal law enforcement officers.neither case implies that employees have no privacy interest in their names.baez held that names could be withheld because the public had no interest in obtaining the names at issue,and implied that employees enjoy at least a minimal privacy interest in their names.see baez,at.the ruling in armstrong is that the exemption inquiry does not end whenever a privacy interest has been identified,but that the privacy interest must be weighed against the public interest in disclosure.armstrong,at.
second,plaintiffs challenge the withholding of information by category of employee,rather than.this argument is not serious.plaintiffs seek millions upon millions of data elements.foia does not require an agency to mobilize its full resources for compliance with foia requests.in cases in which considerably smaller amounts of records have been sought,withholding based upon general characteristics of classes of people or employees has been found compliant.see,dep t of def.fed.labor relations,sustaining withholding of names and contact information for entire class of employees without individual inquiry ass of retired fed.emps.horner,recognizing privacy interest in list of names of retired and disabled federal employees without individual inquiry.
the privacy interest must be weighed against the public interest that would be advanced by disclosure.see fed.labor rel.auth.dep t of veterans affairs,at o nce a more than de minimis privacy interest is implicated the competing interests at stake must be balanced in order to decide whether disclosure is permitted under foia.the only public interest cognizable under foia is the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of press,bibles or.natural desert ass n,identifying relevant public interest as extent to which disclosure of the information sought would shed light on an agency performance of its statutory duties or otherwise let citizens know what their government is up to internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in many contexts,federal courts have observed that disclosure of individual employee names tells nothing about what the government is up to.see fed.labor relations auth.dep t of veterans affairs,at schwarz dep t of treasury,d,disclosure of names of federal employees would not contribute to the public understanding of government functions.voinche fbi,there is no reason to believe that the public will obtain a better understanding of the workings of various agencies by learning the identifies of federal employees.other cases allow for a possible public interest in identifying specific federal employees but that the interest is slight,and in each case was substantially outweighed by the threat to the employee personal privacy.see wood,at authorizing,under exemption,redaction of the names of fbi employees who participated in investigation because public interest was insufficiently furthered relative to the potential for harassment judicial watch,at permitting fda to withhold pursuant to exemption names of employees and outsiders who worked on regulatory approval of abortion pill fed.labor relations auth.dep t of commerce,permitting agency to keep private under exemption list of employees who received positive commendation.
plaintiffs posit a strong public interest in knowing employee names because government work is done by people.but if that were weighed in the balance of the exemption inquiry,little would be left to foia protection for personal privacy.see fed.labor relations auth.dep t of veterans affairs,at compelling disclosure of personal information,that has no relationship to an agency activities,on so attenuated a basis would inevitably result in the disclosure of virtually all personal information,thereby effectively eviscerating the protections of privacy provided by exemption.whether the public has an interest in the identity of federal workers,and to what extent,depends on circumstances,including whether the information sought sheds light on government activity.see wood,at perlman dep t of justice,cir,vacated,reinstated after remand,cir.
plaintiffs point to ways in which they or the media have used the names of federal employees obtained from the cpdf to inform themselves about what their government is up to.specifically,they cite disparities in the rates at which individual immigration judges grant and deny asylum requests high turnover rates at particular agencies agency employees who wrongfully benefit from agency programs and access to employees in order to uncover agency malfeasance.appellants br.
such inquiries may be interesting,but they do not illustrate how the disclosure of names serves the purposes of foia.first,the disposition data for individual immigration judges are available even though the judges names are withheld,because opm has now replaced employee names with unique identifiers second,an employee name may be useful for investigating the behavior of individual employees but courts have been skeptical of recognizing a public interest in this derivative use of information,which is indirect and speculative.see associated press dep t of,
