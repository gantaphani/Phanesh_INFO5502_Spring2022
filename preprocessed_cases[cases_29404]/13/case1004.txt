daniel golodner and security technology systems sts brought suit under alleging that the city of new london the city and two city officials,martin berliner and robert myers appellants,retaliated against golodner for exercising his rights under the first amendment when he filed an earlier lawsuit against the city and several of its police officers golodner i.appellants sought summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill,denied the motion,holding that the complaint in golodner i constituted speech on a matter of public concern protected under the first amendment,and that golodner right to engage in this form of speech was clearly established at the time of the alleged retaliation.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment and remand this case for continued proceedings.
background 
in august,golodner and timothy ackert founded sts,a limited liability company that offers security services.in,sts entered into a contract with the city to provide various services to several buildings.the contract expired in april.at that time,the city notified golodner that it would continue to use sts services.the parties characterized their relationship after the contract expired as ad hoc,with services provided on an basis.defendants rule statement of undisputed facts,golodner city of new london,cv,ecf.
in august,golodner filed his complaint in golodner i in the united states district court for the district of connecticut against the city and seven of its police officers.the claims in golodner i arose from disputes that golodner had with his neighbors and the fact that he was arrested multiple times as a result of those disputes.golodner claimed that because those arrests were not supported by probable cause,the officers had denied him his right to be free from equal protection of the law sic,his right to be free to petition for redress of grievances and his right to be free from false arrest in violation of the constitution.complaint,golodner city of new london,cv,ecf.his complaint identified the arresting officers and the individual instances that gave rise to the alleged constitutional violations.in effect,golodner asserted that two factors motivated the arresting officers a constitutionally impermissible policy promulgated by the city and malice directed at him personally.
as to the first factor,golodner alleged that the police officers were carrying out an unconstitutional policy of arresting sets of witnesses policy.paragraph of the golodner i complaint states 
upon information and belief,the new london police department maintains a community policing program.as part of this program,the department instructs its officers to maintain a visible role in the community.officers are also trained that in the context of neighbor disputes officers are as a matter of course to arrest both the complaining witness and the person against whom a complaint is made when charges are mere misdemeanors or hate crimes.this policy is designed to deter citizens from making complaints about one another so as to avoid the time and expense of processing minor criminal complaints.
id.the complaint contains two additional references to this policy.in paragraph,golodner alleges that as a result of the policy,on occasions when his complaints about his neighbors could not be ignored,he was arrested each and every time the police arrested a neighbor as a result of his complaint.id.in paragraph,he alleges that t he city policy of arresting both the complaining witness and the person complained about in the context of a neighborhood dispute results in a denial of equal protection of the law.id.
golodner theory based on the second alleged motivating factor was the fact that he had previously made complaints about police misconduct to the new london police department.id.golodner claimed that because the officers harbored actual malice against him and did not want to have anything to do with him,they disregarded his complaints concerning disputes he had with his neighbors,id,and further because the officers knew that he had previously complained about police misconduct to their superiors at the new london police department,they were inspired by a malicious intent to retaliate against him for having complained against a brother officer.id.he asserted that his arrests based on this motive were unsupported by probable cause.id.
in golodner i,golodner sought,inter alia,compensation for the emotional distress suffered,loss of work time,expense of hiring an attorney to defend against the arrests,and the loss of those rights guaranteed under the first,fourth and fourteenth amendments.id.he did not seek any form of injunctive relief.
the city attorney notified the city council and the city manager,martin berliner,of the golodner i lawsuit in october.in,while golodner i was proceeding,berliner and robert myers,the city interim director of public works,considered other security system providers to handle the systems in the city buildings.myers informed golodner in july or august of that the city was evaluating bids from other vendors and requested a detailed accounting of the services sts provided as well as the cost of those services.golodner supplied myers with the requested information including an addendum that set out a bid for the total cost of proposed services.three other companies submitted bids.myers ultimately awarded the contract to integrated security solutions,due in part to the fact that it was the lowest overall bidder.in november,myers informed golodner that the city would no longer be using sts as its security system provider.
in april,golodner filed his complaint in this case alleging,inter alia,that the individual defendants had retaliated against him in violation of the first amendment golodner asserts that the defendants solicitation of bids,termination of sts as the city security service provider,and decision to award the contract to his competitor were done in retaliation for his having filed golodner i.in october,berliner and myers moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,arguing principally that because the speech embodied in golodner i did not implicate a matter of public concern,it is not protected by the first amendment.the district court denied the motion on the record during a motion hearing and the individual defendants timely filed this interlocutory appeal.
discussion 
berliner and myers contend they are immune from suit because the basis of their alleged retaliation,the golodner i lawsuit,does not constitute speech on a matter of public concern by an employee and therefore is not subject to first amendment protection.in the alternative,they argue that should we find the speech to be protected under the first amendment,the basis in case law for that determination was not clearly established at the time of the alleged retaliatory conduct.
we review de novo a decision by a district court to deny summary judgment on the basis that a public official is not entitled to qualified immunity.faghri of,cir see also moore andreno,cir.in an interlocutory appeal challenging a district court determination that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity,we have jurisdiction to decide the appeal to the extent that the decision turns on an issue of law.mitchell forsyth,see locurto safir,f d,cir a denial by a district court of a claim of qualified the extent that it turns on an issue of law is a collateral order subject to immediate appeal.we are without jurisdiction to review a denial of a claim of qualified immunity that turns on disputed issues of fact,johnson jones,and must assume all factual disputes in favor of the,ross breslin,cir.
our analysis of this issue is guided by two questions first,whether the facts show that the defendants conduct violated plaintiff s constitutional rights,and second,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant s actions.zalaski city of hartford,cir see also luna pico,cir holding that state officials do not assume civil liability for actions performed in the course of their duties if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known internal quotation marks omitted.if we answer either question in the negative,qualified immunity attaches.we may address these questions in either order,pearson callahan,holding that courts have discretion to decide which of the two prongs of analysis to tackle first,and begin here by determining whether,under the facts as alleged by golodner the individual defendants conduct violated a constitutional right.
as a threshold matter,we must identify the universe of facts available to us in our inquiry concerning whether the first amendment applies to the employee at issue.the first amendment protects a public employee right,in certain circumstances,to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.garcetti ceballos.in connick myers,the supreme court clarified that w hether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.ruotolo city of new york,cir lewis cowen,cir see also lane franks.the speaker motive is a factor to consider but is not dispositive in determining whether his or her speech addresses a matter of public concern.sousa roque,cir citing reuland hynes,cir.
the basis for the defendants argument that golodner i did not address a matter of public concern is their equating the term whole record as used in connick with the full record,including the final disposition of golodner i,the case that served as a vehicle for and constituted the speech now at issue specifically,defendants argue that connick and its progeny require that we not limit our review to the golodner i complaint but instead view the entire record of that litigation,including golodner opposition to the motion for summary judgment and this court analysis in its summary order affirming the district court judgment dismissing the case.defendants contend that these filings and court decisions,which do not mention the policy,demonstrate that golodner motive was personal rather than public in nature.the defendants position,however,is untenable.the defendants solicitation and selection of an alternative security service provider are the actions golodner claims are retaliatory.when those actions occurred in,the complaint in golodner i was the only substantive expression that golodner had filed in that lawsuit.put another way,the complaint constituted the only speech that had been uttered at the time of the government actions.neither golodner response to the summary judgment motion nor,certainly,this court summary order affirming the dismissal of golodner i was in existence.the practical effect of adopting defendants position,therefore,would be to impute to government of developments bearing on the characterization of speech that postdate the actors alleged retaliation.neither the law nor common sense supports such an approach,particularly when evaluating speech in the context of qualified immunity.none of the cases defendants cite extends connick whole record review to materials submitted or speech uttered after the alleged retaliatory action,either explicitly or implicitly.see connick,ruotolo,lewis.nor do they interpret whole record to include portions of the district court record for a lawsuit that constitutes the speech at the heart of a retaliation claim temporally disconnected from and not limited by the occurrence of the alleged retaliatory acts.
by its very nature,qualified immunity hinges on a snapshot of the factual and legal circumstances at the time of the alleged violation.while this temporal element is most commonly raised in the context of the legal,or clearly established,prong,see,nagle marron,cir,the unique circumstances of this case require us to apply a similar principle when analyzing the factual prong in order to avoid a result that is both nonsensical and contrary to the basic underpinnings of qualified immunity.courts properly determine whether the speech at issue touches on a matter of public concern by reviewing only the speech cognizable by the alleged offenders prior to and at the moment of the alleged violation.insofar as the defendants attempt to rely upon subsequent litigation developments in golodner i,those circumstances and any potential resolution of the claims in that suit had yet to occur when the defendants opted to consider and choose a different security services provider.our review must be limited,therefore,to golodner speech at the time martin and berliner acted in the golodner i complaint.
our resolution of the qualified immunity issue thus hinges on whether the golodner i complaint addresses a matter of public concern or is merely related to personal grievances,reuland,at,which is a question of law for the court to decide in light of the content,form,and context of a given statement,ruotolo,at.generally speaking,a matter of public concern relates to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.sousa,at quoting connick,at internal brackets omitted see also lane.at.in examining whether speech is on a matter of public concern,we consider the motive of the speaker,reuland,at,cognizant that speech on a purely private matter does not pertain to a matter of public concern and,conversely,that an individual motivated by a personal grievance can simultaneously speak on a matter affecting the public at large,sousa,at.in that vein,we have held that matters implicate the public interest when the plaintiff wanted to debate issues of discrimination,that the plaintiff suit sought relief against pervasive or systemic misconduct by a public agency or public officials,or that the plaintiff suit was part of an overall effort to correct allegedly unlawful practices or bring them to public attention.huth haslun,cir internal citation,quotation marks,and ellipses omitted.
the defendants contend that the golodner i complaint does not raise a matter of public concern,citing ruotolo,another case in which the plaintiff speech took the form of a lawsuit.in ruotolo we characterized the specific speech at the heart of the plaintiff retaliation claim as bearing upon the circumstances and perquisites of his employment,such as reassignment,transfer,time off,and discipline.id.at.looking to the complaint in the previous lawsuit,we determined that it enumerated adverse career,financial and emotional effects the plaintiff suffered personally,and that t he relief sought is also almost entirely personal to the plaintiff,including compensatory damages and an injunction relating to the plaintiff employment records.id.because those issues inherently constituted personal grievances,we concluded that they did not rise to the level of public concern.id.at.in this type of case,our discussion of what constitutes speech on a purely private matter,lewis,at,has always been closely tethered to an individual employee conditions of employment in ruotolo,we stated that a generalized public interest in the fair or proper treatment of public employees is not enough to transform a personal grievance related to the conditions of one employment into a matter of public concern.at.speech that,at its heart,is limited to such grievances does not implicate the first amendment.put simply,the first amendment does not protect all private ventings of disgruntled public employees.singer ferro,cir.
by contrast,golodner speech in the golodner i complaint is of a fundamentally different nature.it is wholly unrelated to any personal grievances as to the conditions of golodner employment.nor has it anything to do with sts or golodner contractual relationship with the city.rather,the golodner i complaint represents golodner attempt to vindicate his constitutional rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments in the face of alleged police misconduct directed against him as a private citizen.
as to the claims in the golodner i complaint regarding the policy,it is axiomatic that misconduct within a police department implicates a matter of public concern,especially when it is traceable to potentially unconstitutional policies.huth,
