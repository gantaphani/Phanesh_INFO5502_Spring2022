the patient protection and affordable care act grew out of a long history of failed health insurance reform.in the,several states sought to expand access to coverage by imposing a pair of insurance market regulations a guaranteed issue requirement,which bars insurers from denying coverage to any person because of his health,and a community rating requirement,which bars insurers from charging a person higher premiums for the same reason.the reforms achieved the goal of expanding access to coverage,but they also encouraged people to wait until they got sick to buy insurance.the result was an economic death spiral premiums rose,the number of people buying insurance declined,and insurers left the market entirely.in,however,massachusetts discovered a way to make the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements work by requiring individuals to buy insurance and by providing tax credits to certain individuals to make insurance more affordable.the combination of these three reforms insurance market regulations,a coverage mandate,and tax credits enabled massachusetts to drastically reduce its uninsured rate.
the affordable care act adopts a version of the three key reforms that made the massachusetts system successful.first,the act adopts the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.second,the act generally requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the irs,unless the cost of buying insurance would exceed eight percent of that individual income.and third,the act seeks to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes between percent and percent of the federal poverty line.
in addition to those three reforms,the act requires the creation of an exchange in each state basically,a marketplace that allows people to compare and purchase insurance plans.the act gives each state the opportunity to establish its own exchange,but provides that the federal government will establish such exchange if the state does not.relatedly,the act provides that tax credits shall be allowed for any applicable taxpayer,a,but only if the taxpayer has enrolled in an insurance plan through an exchange established by the state under,b c.an irs regulation interprets that language as making tax credits available on an exchange,cfr,regardless of whether the exchange is established and operated by a state or by hhs,cfr.
petitioners are four individuals who live in virginia,which has a federal exchange.they do not wish to purchase health insurance.in their view,virginia exchange does not qualify as an exchange established by the state under,so they should not receive any tax credits.that would make the cost of buying insurance more than eight percent of petitioners income,exempting them from the act coverage requirement.as a result of the irs rule,however,petitioners would receive tax credits.that would make the cost of buying insurance less than eight percent of their income,which would subject them to the act coverage requirement.
petitioners challenged the irs rule in federal district court.the district court dismissed the suit,holding that the act unambiguously made tax credits available to individuals enrolled through a federal exchange.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed.the fourth circuit viewed the act as ambiguous,and deferred to the irs interpretation under chevron natural resources defense council.
held section tax credits are available to individuals in states that have a federal exchange.
a when analyzing an agency interpretation of a statute,this court often applies the framework announced in chevron.but chevron does not provide the appropriate framework here.the tax credits are one of the act key reforms and whether they are available on federal exchanges is a question of deep economic and political significance had congress wished to assign that question to an agency,it surely would have done so expressly.and it is especially unlikely that congress would have delegated this decision to the irs,which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort.
it is instead the court task to determine the correct reading of section.if the statutory language is plain,the court must enforce it according to its terms.but oftentimes the meaning or ambiguity of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.so when deciding whether the language is plain,the court must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco.
b when read in context,the phrase an exchange established by the state under is properly viewed as ambiguous.the phrase may be limited in its reach to state exchanges.but it could also refer to all exchanges both state and federal for purposes of the tax credits.if a state chooses not to follow the directive in section to establish an exchange,the act tells the secretary of health and human services to establish such exchange.and by using the words such exchange,the act indicates that state and federal exchanges should be the same.but state and federal exchanges would differ in a fundamental way if tax credits were available only on state exchanges one type of exchange would help make insurance more affordable by providing billions of dollars to the states citizens the other type of exchange would not.several other provisions in the act,section i b requirement that all exchanges create outreach programs to distribute fair and impartial information concerning the availability of premium tax credits under section would make little sense if tax credits were not available on federal exchanges.
the argument that the phrase established by the state would be superfluous if congress meant to extend tax credits to both state and federal exchanges is unpersuasive.this court preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.lamie united states trustee.and rigorous application of that canon does not seem a particularly useful guide to a fair construction of the affordable care act,which contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.the court nevertheless must do its best,bearing in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.utility air regulatory group epa.
c given that the text is ambiguous,the court must look to the broader structure of the act to determine whether one of section permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.united sav.of timbers of inwood forest associates.
here,the statutory scheme compels the court to reject petitioners interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange,and likely create the very death spirals that congress designed the act to avoid.under petitioners reading,the act would not work in a state with a federal exchange.as they see it,one of the act three major reforms the tax credits would not apply.and a second major reform the coverage requirement would not apply in a meaningful way,because so many individuals would be exempt from the requirement without the tax credits.if petitioners are right,therefore,only one of the act three major reforms would apply in states with a federal exchange.the combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a state individual insurance market into a death spiral.it is implausible that congress meant the act to operate in this manner.congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every state in the nation,but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits.it thus stands to reason that congress meant for those provisions to apply in every state as well.
d the structure of section itself also suggests that tax credits are not limited to state exchanges.together,section a,which allows tax credits for any applicable taxpayer,and section c,which defines that term as someone with a household income between percent and percent of the federal poverty line,appear to make anyone in the specified income range eligible for a tax credit.according to petitioners,however,those provisions are an empty promise in states with a federal exchange.in their view,an applicable taxpayer in such a state would be eligible for a tax credit,but the amount of that tax credit would always be zero because of two provisions buried deep within the tax code.that argument fails because congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.whitman american trucking.
e petitioners arguments are strong,but the act context and structure compel the conclusion that section allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any exchange created under the act.those credits are necessary for the federal exchanges to function like their state exchange counterparts,and to avoid the type of calamitous result that congress plainly meant to avoid.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the patient protection and affordable care act adopts a series of interlocking reforms designed to expand coverage in the individual health insurance market.first,the act bars insurers from taking a person health into account when deciding whether to sell health insurance or how much to charge.second,the act generally requires each person to maintain insurance coverage or make a payment to the internal revenue service.and third,the act gives tax credits to certain people to make insurance more affordable.
in addition to those reforms,the act requires the creation of an exchange in each state basically,a marketplace that allows people to compare and purchase insurance plans.the act gives each state the opportunity to establish its own exchange,but provides that the federal government will establish the exchange if the state does not.
this case is about whether the act interlocking reforms apply equally in each state no matter who establishes the state exchange.specifically,the question presented is whether the act tax credits are available in states that have a federal exchange.
the patient protection and affordable care act,stat,grew out of a long history of failed health insurance reform.in the,several states began experimenting with ways to expand people access to coverage.one common approach was to impose a pair of insurance market regulations a guaranteed issue requirement,which barred insurers from denying coverage to any person because of his health,and a community rating requirement,which barred insurers from charging a person higher premiums for the same reason.together,those requirements were designed to ensure that anyone who wanted to buy health insurance could do so.
the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements achieved that goal,but they had an unintended consequence they encouraged people to wait until they got sick to buy insurance.why buy insurance coverage when you are healthy,if you can buy the same coverage for the same price when you become ill this consequence known as adverse selection led to a second insurers were forced to increase premiums to account for the fact that,more and more,it was the sick rather than the healthy who were buying insurance.and that consequence fed back into the first as the cost of insurance rose,even more people waited until they became ill to buy it.
this led to an economic death spiral.as premiums rose higher and higher,and the number of people buying insurance sank lower and lower,insurers began to leave the market entirely.as a result,the number of people without insurance increased dramatically.
this cycle happened repeatedly during the.for example,in,the state of washington reformed its individual insurance market by adopting the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.over the next three years,premiums rose by percent and the number of people enrolled fell by percent.by,of the state private insurers had left the market,and the remaining two had announced their intention to do so.brief for america health insurance plans as amicus curiae.
for another example,also in,new york adopted the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.over the next few years,some major insurers in the individual market raised premiums by roughly percent.by,these reforms had effectively eliminated the commercial individual indemnity market in new york with the largest individual health insurer exiting the market.wachenheim leida,the impact of guaranteed issue and community rating reforms on states individual insurance markets.
in,massachusetts adopted the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements and experienced similar results.but in,massachusetts added two more reforms the commonwealth required individuals to buy insurance or pay a penalty,and it gave tax credits to certain individuals to ensure that they could afford the insurance they were required to buy.brief for bipartisan economic scholars as amici curiae.the combination of these three reforms insurance market regulations,a coverage mandate,and tax credits reduced the uninsured rate in massachusetts to percent,by far the lowest in the nation.hearing on examining individual state experiences with health care reform coverage initiatives in the context of national reform before the senate committee on health,education,labor,and pensions.
the affordable care act adopts a version of the three key reforms that made the massachusetts system successful.first,the act adopts the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.the act provides that each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual market in a state must accept every individual in the state that applies for such coverage.a.the act also bars insurers from charging higher premiums on the basis of a person health.
second,the act generally requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the irs.congress recognized that,without an incentive,many individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed care.i.so congress adopted a coverage requirement to minimize this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals,which will lower health insurance premiums.ibid.in congress view,that coverage requirement was essential to creating effective health insurance markets.ibid.congress also provided an exemption from the coverage requirement for anyone who has to spend more than eight percent of his income on health insurance.e a,e b ii.
third,the act seeks to make insurance more affordable by giving refundable tax credits to individuals with household incomes between percent and percent of the federal poverty line.individuals who meet the act requirements may purchase insurance with the tax credits,which are provided in advance directly to the individual insurer.
these three reforms are closely intertwined.as noted,congress found that the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements would not work without the coverage requirement.i.and the coverage requirement would not work without the tax credits.the reason is that,without the tax credits,the cost of buying insurance would exceed eight percent of income for a large number of individuals,which would exempt them from the coverage requirement.given the relationship between these three reforms,the act provided that they should take effect on the same day january.see affordable care act,redesignated,stat,e,d,at.
in addition to those three reforms,the act requires the creation of an exchange in each state where people can shop for insurance,usually online.b.an exchange may be created in one of two ways.first,the act provides that e ach state shall establish an american health benefit exchange for the state.ibid.second,if a state nonetheless chooses not to establish its own exchange,the act provides that the secretary of health and human services shall establish and operate such exchange within the state.c.
the issue in this case is whether the act tax credits are available in states that have a federal exchange rather than a state exchange.the act initially provides that tax credits shall be allowed for any applicable taxpayer.a.the act then provides that the amount of the tax credit depends in part on whether the taxpayer has enrolled in an insurance plan through an exchange established by the state under section of the patient protection and affordable care act hereinafter.b c emphasis added.
the irs addressed the availability of tax credits by promulgating a rule that made them available on both state and federal exchanges.fed.reg.as relevant here,the irs rule provides that a taxpayer is eligible for a tax credit if he enrolled in an insurance plan through an exchange,cfr,which is defined as an exchange serving the individual market regardless of whether the exchange is established and operated by a state or by hhs,cfr.at this point,states and the district of columbia have established their own exchanges the other states have elected to have hhs do so.
petitioners are four individuals who live in virginia,which has a federal exchange.they do not wish to purchase health insurance.in their view,virginia exchange does not qualify as an exchange established by the state under,so they should not receive any tax credits.that would make the cost of buying insurance more than eight percent of their income,which would exempt them from the act coverage requirement.e.
under the irs rule,however,virginia exchange would qualify as an exchange established by the state under,so petitioners would receive tax credits.that would make the cost of buying insurance less than eight percent of petitioners income,which would subject them to the act coverage requirement.the irs rule therefore requires petitioners to either buy health insurance they do not want,or make a payment to the irs.
petitioners challenged the irs rule in federal district court.the district court dismissed the suit,holding that the act unambiguously made tax credits available to individuals enrolled through a federal exchange.king sebelius,supp.ed.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed.the fourth circuit viewed the act as ambiguous and subject to at least two different interpretations.at.the court therefore deferred to the irs interpretation under chevron natural resources defense council,at.
the same day that the fourth circuit issued its decision,the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the irs rule in a different case,holding that the act unambiguously restricts the tax credits to state exchanges.halbig burwell.we granted certiorari in the present case.
the affordable care act addresses tax credits in what is now section of the internal revenue code.that section provides in the case of an applicable taxpayer,there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle an amount equal to the premium assistance credit amount.a.section then defines the term premium assistance credit amount as the sum of the premium assistance amounts determined under paragraph with respect to all coverage months of the taxpayer occurring during the taxable year.b emphasis added.section goes on to define the two italicized terms premium assistance amount and coverage month in part by referring to an insurance plan that is enrolled in through an exchange established by the state under.b a,c a i.
the parties dispute whether section authorizes tax credits for individuals who enroll in an insurance plan through a federal exchange.petitioners argue that a federal exchange is not an exchange established by the state under,and that the irs rule therefore contradicts section.brief for petitioners.the government responds that the irs rule is lawful because the phrase an exchange established by the state under should be read to include federal exchanges.brief for respondents.
when analyzing an agency interpretation of a statute,we often apply the framework announced in chevron.under that framework,we ask whether the statute is ambiguous and,if so,whether the agency interpretation is reasonable,at.this approach is premised on the theory that a statute ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps.fda brown williamson tobacco.in extraordinary cases,however,there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that congress has intended such an implicit delegation.ibid.
this is one of those cases.the tax credits are among the act key reforms,involving billions of dollars in spending each year and affecting the price of health insurance for millions of people.whether those credits are available on federal exchanges is thus a question of deep economic and political significance that is central to this statutory scheme had congress wished to assign that question to an agency,it surely would have done so expressly.utility air regulatory group epa,slip,at quoting brown williamson,at.it is especially unlikely that congress would have delegated this decision to the irs,which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort.see gonzales oregon.this is not a case for the irs.
it is instead our task to determine the correct reading of section.if the statutory language is plain,we must enforce it according to its terms.hardt reliance standard life ins.but oftentimes the meaning or ambiguity of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.brown williamson,at.so when deciding whether the language is plain,we must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.at internal quotation marks omitted.our duty,after all,is to construe statutes,not isolated provisions.graham county soil and water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,internal quotation marks omitted.
we begin with the text of section.as relevant here,section allows an individual to receive tax credits only if the individual enrolls in an insurance plan through an exchange established by the state under.in other words,three things must be true first,the individual must enroll in an insurance plan through an exchange.second,that exchange must be established by the state.and third,that exchange must be established under.we address each requirement in turn.
first,all parties agree that a federal exchange qualifies as an exchange for purposes of section.see brief for petitioners brief for respondents.section provides that e ach state shall establish an american health benefit exchange for the state.b.although phrased as a requirement,the act gives the states flexibility by allowing them to elect whether they want to establish an exchange.b.if the state chooses not to do so,section provides that the secretary shall establish and operate such exchange within the state.c emphasis added.
by using the phrase such exchange,section instructs the secretary to establish and operate the same exchange that the state was directed to establish under section.see black law dictionary ed.defining such as that or those having just been mentioned in other words,state exchanges and federal exchanges are equivalent they must meet the same requirements,perform the same functions,and serve the same purposes.although state and federal exchanges are established by different sovereigns,sections and do not suggest that they differ in any meaningful way.a federal exchange therefore counts as an exchange under section.
second,we must determine whether a federal exchange is established by the state for purposes of section.at the outset,it might seem that a federal exchange can not fulfill this requirement.after all,the act defines state to mean each of the states and the district of columbia a definition that does not include the federal government.d.but when read in context,with a view to its place in the overall statutory scheme,the meaning of the phrase established by the state is not so clear.brown williamson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
after telling each state to establish an exchange,section provides that all exchanges shall make available qualified health plans to qualified individuals.d a.section then defines the term qualified individual in part as an individual who resides in the state that established the exchange.f a.and that a problem if we give the phrase the state that established the exchange its most natural meaning,there would be no qualified individuals on federal exchanges.but the act clearly contemplates that there will be qualified individuals on every exchange.as we just mentioned,the act requires all exchanges to make available qualified health plans to qualified individuals something an exchange could not do if there were no such individuals.d a.and the act tells the exchange,in deciding which health plans to offer,to consider the interests of qualified individuals in the state or states in which such exchange operates again,something the exchange could not do if qualified individuals did not exist.e b.this problem arises repeatedly throughout the act.see,b allowing a state to create one exchange for providing services to both qualified individuals and qualified small employers,rather than creating separate exchanges for those two groups 
these provisions suggest that the act may not always use the phrase established by the state in its most natural sense.thus,the meaning of that phrase may not be as clear as it appears when read out of context.
third,we must determine whether a federal exchange is established under.this too might seem a requirement that a federal exchange can not fulfill,because it is section that tells the secretary when to establish and operate such exchange.but here again,the way different provisions in the statute interact suggests otherwise.
the act defines the term exchange to mean an american health benefit exchange established under section.d.if we import that definition into section,the act tells the secretary to establish and operate such american health benefit exchange established under section.that suggests that section authorizes the secretary to establish an exchange under section,not or not only under section.otherwise,the federal exchange,by definition,would not be an exchange at all.see halbig,at acknowledging that the secretary establishes federal exchanges under section.
this interpretation of under fits best with the statutory context.all of the requirements that an exchange must meet are in section,so it is sensible to regard all exchanges as established under that provision.in addition,every time the act uses the word exchange,the definitional provision requires that we substitute the phrase exchange established under section.if federal exchanges were not established under section,therefore,literally none of the act requirements would apply to them.finally,the act repeatedly uses the phrase established under in situations where it would make no sense to distinguish between state and federal exchanges.see,f a,supp.i the term qualified benefit shall not include any qualified health plan offered through an exchange established under b b iii i ed.requiring insurers to report whether each insurance plan they provided is a qualified health plan offered through an exchange established under a federal exchange may therefore be considered one established under.
the upshot of all this is that the phrase an exchange established by the state under is properly viewed as ambiguous.the phrase may be limited in its reach to state exchanges.but it is also possible that the phrase refers to all exchanges both state and federal at least for purposes of the tax credits.if a state chooses not to follow the directive in section that it establish an exchange,the act tells the secretary to establish such exchange.and by using the words such exchange,the act indicates that state and federal exchanges should be the same.but state and federal exchanges would differ in a fundamental way if tax credits were available only on state exchanges one type of exchange would help make insurance more affordable by providing billions of dollars to the states citizens the other type of exchange would not 
the conclusion that section is ambiguous is further supported by several provisions that assume tax credits will be available on both state and federal exchanges.for example,the act requires all exchanges to create outreach programs that must distribute fair and impartial information concerning the availability of premium tax credits under section.i b.the act also requires all exchanges to establish and make available by electronic means a calculator to determine the actual cost of coverage after the application of any premium tax credit under section.d g.and the act requires all exchanges to report to the treasury secretary information about each health plan they sell,including the aggregate amount of any advance payment of such credit,a ny information necessary to determine eligibility for,and the amount of,such credit,and any i nformation necessary to determine whether a taxpayer has received excess advance payments.f.if tax credits were not available on federal exchanges,these provisions would make little sense.
petitioners and the dissent respond that the words established by the state would be unnecessary if congress meant to extend tax credits to both state and federal exchanges.brief for petitioners post,at.but our preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.lamie united states trustee,see also marx general revenue,slip,at the canon against surplusage is not an absolute rule and specifically with respect to this act,rigorous application of the canon does not seem a particularly useful guide to a fair construction of the statute.
the affordable care act contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting.to cite just one,the act creates three separate section.see stat.several features of the act passage contributed to that unfortunate reality.congress wrote key parts of the act behind closed doors,rather than through the traditional legislative process.cannan,a legislative history of the affordable care act how legislative procedure shapes legislative history,lib.and congress passed much of the act using a complicated budgetary procedure known as reconciliation,which limited opportunities for debate and amendment,and bypassed the senate normal filibuster requirement,at.as a result,the act does not reflect the type of care and deliberation that one might expect of such significant legislation.frankfurter,some reflections on the reading of statutes,colum,describing a cartoon in which a senator tells his colleagues i admit this new bill is too complicated to understand.we just have to pass it to find out what it means.
anyway,we must do our best,bearing in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.util ity air regulatory group,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.after reading section along with other related provisions in the act,we can not conclude that the phrase an exchange established by the state under section is unambiguous.
given that the text is ambiguous,we must turn to the broader structure of the act to determine the meaning of section.a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.united sav.of timbers of inwood forest associates.here,the statutory scheme compels us to reject petitioners interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange,and likely create the very death spirals that congress designed the act to avoid.see new york state of social servs.dublino,we can not interpret federal statutes to negate their own stated purposes.
as discussed above,congress based the affordable care act on three major reforms first,the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements second,a requirement that individuals maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the irs and third,the tax credits for individuals with household incomes between percent and percent of the federal poverty line.in a state that establishes its own exchange,these three reforms work together to expand insurance coverage.the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements ensure that anyone can buy insurance the coverage requirement creates an incentive for people to do so before they get sick and the tax credits it is hoped make insurance more affordable.together,those reforms minimize adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals,which will lower health insurance premiums.i.
under petitioners reading,however,the act would operate quite differently in a state with a federal exchange.as they see it,one of the act three major reforms the tax credits would not apply.and a second major reform the coverage requirement would not apply in a meaningful way.as explained earlier,the coverage requirement applies only when the cost of buying health insurance minus the amount of the tax credits is less than eight percent of an individual income.e a,e b ii.so without the tax credits,the coverage requirement would apply to fewer individuals.and it would be a lot fewer.in,approximately percent of people who bought insurance on a federal exchange did so with tax credits,and virtually all of those people would become exempt.hhs,burke,misra,sheingold,premium affordability,competition,and choice in the health insurance marketplace brief for bipartisan economic scholars as amici curiae.if petitioners are right,therefore,only one of the act three major reforms would apply in states with a federal exchange.
the combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a state individual insurance market into a death spiral.one study predicts that premiums would increase by percent and enrollment would decrease by percent.saltzman eibner,the effect of eliminating the affordable care act tax credits in federally facilitated marketplaces.another study predicts that premiums would increase by percent and enrollment would decrease by percent.blumberg,buettgens,holahan,the implications of a supreme court finding for the plaintiff in king burwell million more uninsured and higher premiums.and those effects would not be limited to individuals who purchase insurance on the exchanges.because the act requires insurers to treat the entire individual market as a single risk pool,c,premiums outside the exchange would rise along with those inside the exchange.brief for bipartisan economic scholars as amici curiae.
it is implausible that congress meant the act to operate in this manner.see national federation of independent business sebelius,scalia,kennedy,thomas,and alito,dissenting slip,at without the federal subsidies the exchanges would not operate as congress intended and may not operate at all.congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every state in the nation.but those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and the tax credits.so it stands to reason that congress meant for those provisions to apply in every state as well 
petitioners respond that congress was not worried about the effects of withholding tax credits from states with federal exchanges because congress evidently believed it was offering states a deal they would not refuse.brief for petitioners.congress may have been wrong about the states willingness to establish their own exchanges,petitioners continue,but that does not allow this court to rewrite the act to fix that problem.that is particularly true,petitioners conclude,because the states likely would have created their own exchanges in the absence of the irs rule,which eliminated any incentive that the states had to do so,at.
section refutes the argument that congress believed it was offering the states a deal they would not refuse.that section provides that,if a state elects not to establish an exchange,the secretary shall establish and operate such exchange within the state.c a.the whole point of that provision is to create a federal fallback in case a state chooses not to establish its own exchange.contrary to petitioners argument,congress did not believe it was offering states a deal they would not refuse it expressly addressed what would happen if a state did refuse the deal.
finally,the structure of section itself suggests that tax credits are not limited to state exchanges.section a initially provides that tax credits shall be allowed for any applicable taxpayer.section c then defines an applicable taxpayer as someone who among other things has a household income between percent and percent of the federal poverty line.together,these two provisions appear to make anyone in the specified income range eligible to receive a tax credit.
according to petitioners,however,those provisions are an empty promise in states with a federal exchange.in their view,an applicable taxpayer in such a state would be eligible for a tax credit but the amount of that tax credit would always be zero.and that is because diving several layers down into the tax code section says that the amount of the tax credits shall be an amount equal to the premium assistance credit amount,a and then says that the term premium assistance credit amount means the sum of the premium assistance amounts determined under paragraph with respect to all coverage months of the taxpayer occurring during the taxable year,b and then says that the term premium assistance amount is tied to the amount of the monthly premium for insurance purchased on an exchange established by the state under,b and then says that the term coverage month means any month in which the taxpayer has insurance through an exchange established by the state under,c a i.
we have held that congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.whitman american trucking.but in petitioners view,congress made the viability of the entire affordable care act turn on the ultimate ancillary provision a section of the tax code.we doubt that is what congress meant to do.had congress meant to limit tax credits to state exchanges,it likely would have done so in the definition of applicable taxpayer or in some other prominent manner.it would not have used such a winding path of provisions about the amount of the credit 
petitioners arguments about the plain meaning of section are strong.but while the meaning of the phrase an exchange established by the state under may seem plain when viewed in isolation,such a reading turns out to be untenable in light of the statute as a whole.department of revenue of acf industries.in this instance,the context and structure of the act compel us to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.
reliance on context and structure in statutory interpretation is a subtle business,calling for great wariness lest what professes to be mere rendering becomes creation and attempted interpretation of legislation becomes legislation itself.palmer massachusetts.for the reasons we have given,however,such reliance is appropriate in this case,and leads us to conclude that section allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any exchange created under the act.those credits are necessary for the federal exchanges to function like their state exchange counterparts,and to avoid the type of calamitous result that congress plainly meant to avoid.
in a democracy,the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the people.our role is more confined to say what the law is.marbury madison,cranch.that is easier in some cases than in others.but in every case we must respect the role of the legislature,and take care not to undo what it has done.a fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.
congress passed the affordable care act to improve health insurance markets,not to destroy them.if at all possible,we must interpret the act in a way that is consistent with the former,and avoids the latter.section can fairly be read consistent with what we see as congress plan,and that is the reading we adopt.

this case requires us to decide whether someone who buys insurance on an exchange established by the secretary gets tax credits.you would think the answer would be obvious so obvious there would hardly be a need for the supreme court to hear a case about it.in order to receive any money under,an individual must enroll in an insurance plan through an exchange established by the state.the secretary of health and human services is not a state.so an exchange established by the secretary is not an exchange established by the state which means people who buy health insurance through such an exchange get no money under.
words no longer have meaning if an exchange that is not established by a state is established by the state.it is hard to come up with a clearer way to limit tax credits to state exchanges than to use the words established by the state.and it is hard to come up with a reason to include the words by the state other than the purpose of limiting credits to state exchanges.t he plain,obvious,and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious,narrow,hidden sense that nothing but the exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity and study of an acute and powerful intellect would discover.lynch,internal quotation marks omitted.under all the usual rules of interpretation,in short,the government should lose this case.but normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present court the affordable care act must be saved.
the court interprets to award tax credits on both federal and state exchanges.it accepts that the most natural sense of the phrase exchange established by the state is an exchange established by a state.ante,at.understatement,thy name is an opinion on the affordable care act yet the opinion continues,with no semblance of shame,that it is also possible that the phrase refers to all exchanges both state and federal.ante,at.impossible possibility,thy name is an opinion on the affordable care act the court claims that the context and structure of the act compel it to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.ante,at.
i wholeheartedly agree with the court that sound interpretation requires paying attention to the whole law,not homing in on isolated words or even isolated sections.context always matters.let us not forget,however,why context matters it is a tool for understanding the terms of the law,not an excuse for rewriting them.
any effort to understand rather than to rewrite a law must accept and apply the presumption that lawmakers use words in their natural and ordinary signification.pensacola telegraph western union telegraph.ordinary connotation does not always prevail,but the more unnatural the proposed interpretation of a law,the more compelling the contextual evidence must be to show that it is correct.today interpretation is not merely unnatural it is unheard of.who would ever have dreamt that exchange established by the state means exchange established by the state or the federal government little short of an express statutory definition could justify adopting this singular reading.yet the only pertinent definition here provides that state means each of the states and the district of columbia.d.because the secretary is neither one of the states nor the district of columbia,that definition positively contradicts the eccentric theory that an exchange established by the secretary has been established by the state.
far from offering the overwhelming evidence of meaning needed to justify the court interpretation,other contextual clues undermine it at every turn.to begin with,other parts of the act sharply distinguish between the establishment of an exchange by a state and the establishment of an exchange by the federal government.the states authority to set up exchanges comes from one provision,b the secretary authority comes from an entirely different provision,c.funding for states to establish exchanges comes from one part of the law,a funding for the secretary to establish exchanges comes from an entirely different part of the law.states generally run exchanges the secretary generally runs federally created exchanges.b c.and the secretary authority to set up an exchange in a state depends upon the state f ailure to establish an exchange.c emphasis added.provisions such as these destroy any pretense that a federal exchange is in some sense also established by a state.
reading the rest of the act also confirms that,as relevant here,there are only two ways to set up an exchange in a state establishment by a state and establishment by the secretary.b,c.so saying that an exchange established by the federal government is established by the state goes beyond giving words bizarre meanings it leaves the limiting phrase by the state with no operative effect at all.that is a stark violation of the elementary principle that requires an interpreter to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.montclair ramsdell.in weighing this argument,it is well to remember the difference between giving a term a meaning that duplicates another part of the law,and giving a term no meaning at all.lawmakers sometimes repeat themselves whether out of a desire to add emphasis,a sense of caution,or a lawyerly penchant for doublets aid and abet,cease and desist,null and void.lawmakers do not,however,tend to use terms that have no operation at all.marbury madison,cranch.so while the rule against treating a term as a redundancy is far from categorical,the rule against treating it as a nullity is as close to absolute as interpretive principles get.the court reading does not merely give by the state a duplicative effect it causes the phrase to have no effect whatever.
making matters worse,the reader of the whole act will come across a number of provisions beyond that refer to the establishment of exchanges by states.adopting the court interpretation means nullifying the term by the state not just once,but again and again throughout the act.consider for the moment only those parts of the act that mention an exchange established by the state in connection with tax credits 
the formula for calculating the amount of the tax credit,as already explained,twice mentions an exchange established by the state.b a,c a i.
the act directs states to screen children for eligibility for tax credits under section and for any other assistance or subsidies available for coverage obtained through an exchange established by the state.b b c.
the act requires an exchange established by the state to use a secure electronic interface to determine eligibility for among other things tax credits.b d.
the act authorizes an exchange established by the state to make arrangements under which other state agencies determine whether a state resident is eligible for tax credits under section.b.
the act directs states to operate web sites that allow anyone who is eligible to receive tax credits under section to compare insurance plans offered through an exchange established by the state.b.
one of the act provisions addresses the enrollment of certain children in health plans offered through an exchange established by the state and then discusses the eligibility of these children for tax credits.d b.
it is bad enough for a court to cross out by the state once.but seven times 
congress did not,by the way,repeat exchange established by the state under by rote throughout the act.quite the contrary,clause after clause of the law uses a more general term such as exchange or exchange established under.see,k.it is common sense that any speaker who says exchange some of the time,but exchange established by the state the rest of the time,probably means something by the contrast.
equating establishment by the state with establishment by the federal government makes nonsense of other parts of the act.the act requires states to ensure on pain of losing medicaid funding that any exchange established by the state uses a secure electronic interface to determine an individual eligibility for various benefits including tax credits.b d.how could a state control the type of electronic interface used by a federal exchange the act allows a state to control contracting decisions made by an exchange established by the state.f.why would a state get to control the contracting decisions of a federal exchange the act also provides assistance to states to establish american health benefit exchanges and directs the secretary to renew this funding if the state is making progress toward establishing an exchange.a.does a state that refuses to set up an exchange still receive this funding,on the premise that exchanges established by the federal government are really established by states it is presumably in order to avoid these questions that the court concludes that federal exchanges count as state exchanges only for purposes of the tax credits.ante,at.contrivance,thy name is an opinion on the affordable care act 
it is probably piling on to add that the congress that wrote the affordable care act knew how to equate two different types of exchanges when it wanted to do so.the act includes a clause providing that a territory that establishes an exchange shall be treated as a state for certain purposes.a emphasis added.tellingly,it does not include a comparable clause providing that the secretary shall be treated as a state for purposes of when she establishes an exchange.
faced with overwhelming confirmation that exchange established by the state means what it looks like it means,the court comes up with argument after feeble argument to support its contrary interpretation.none of its tries comes close to establishing the implausible conclusion that congress used by the state to mean by the state or not by the state.
the court emphasizes that if a state does not set up an exchange,the secretary must establish such exchange.c.it claims that the word such implies that federal and state exchanges are the same.ante,at.to see the error in this reasoning,one need only consider a parallel provision from our constitution the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations.art.i,cl.emphasis added.just as the affordable care act directs states to establish exchanges while allowing the secretary to establish such exchange as a fallback,the elections clause directs state legislatures to prescribe election regulations while allowing congress to make such regulations as a fallback.would anybody refer to an election regulation made by congress as a regulation prescribed by the state legislature would anybody say that a federal election law and a state election law are in all respects equivalent of course not.the word such does not help the court one whit.the court argument also overlooks the rudimentary principle that a specific provision governs a general one.even if it were true that the term such exchange in c implies that federal and state exchanges are the same in general,the term established by the state in makes plain that they differ when it comes to tax credits in particular.
the court next bit of interpretive involves other parts of the act that purportedly presuppose the availability of tax credits on both federal and state exchanges.ante,at.it is curious that the court is willing to subordinate the express words of the section that grants tax credits to the mere implications of other provisions with only tangential connections to tax credits.one would think that interpretation would work the other way around.in any event,each of the provisions mentioned by the court is perfectly consistent with limiting tax credits to state exchanges.one of them says that the minimum functions of an exchange include alongside several tasks that have nothing to do with tax credits setting up an electronic calculator that shows the actual cost of coverage after the application of any premium tax credit.d g.what stops a federal exchange electronic calculator from telling a customer that his tax credit is zero another provision requires an exchange outreach program to educate the public about health plans,to facilitate enrollment,and to distribute fair and impartial information about enrollment and the availability of premium tax credits.i b.what stops a federal exchange outreach program from fairly and impartially telling customers that no tax credits are available a third provision requires an exchange to report information about each insurance plan sold including level of coverage,premium,name of the insured,and amount of any advance payment of the tax credit.f.what stops a federal exchange report from confirming that no tax credits have been paid out 
the court persists that these provisions would make little sense if no tax credits were available on federal exchanges.ante,at.even if that observation were true,it would show only oddity,not ambiguity.laws often include unusual or mismatched provisions.the affordable care act spans pages it would be amazing if its provisions all lined up perfectly with each other.this court does not revise legislation just because the text as written creates an apparent anomaly.michigan bay mills indian community,slip,at.at any rate,the provisions cited by the court are not particularly unusual.each requires an exchange to perform a standardized series of tasks,some aspects of which relate in some way to tax credits.it is entirely natural for slight mismatches to occur when,as here,lawmakers draft a single statutory provision to cover different kinds of situations.robers united states,slip,at.lawmakers need not,and often do not,write extra language specifically exempting,phrase by phrase,applications in respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed.ibid.
roaming even farther afield from,the court turns to the act provisions about qualified individuals.ante,at.qualified individuals receive favored treatment on exchanges,although customers who are not qualified individuals may also shop there.see halbig burwell,cadc.the court claims that the act must equate federal and state establishment of exchanges when it defines a qualified individual as someone who among other things lives in the state that established the exchange,f a.otherwise,the court says,there would be no qualified individuals on federal exchanges,contradicting for example the provision requiring every exchange to take the interests of qualified individuals into account when selecting health plans.ante,at quoting e b.pure applesauce.imagine that a university sends around a bulletin reminding every professor to take the interests of graduate students into account when setting office hours,but that some professors teach only undergraduates.would anybody reason that the bulletin implicitly presupposes that every professor has graduate students,so that graduate students must really mean graduate or undergraduate students surely not.just as one naturally reads instructions about graduate students to be inapplicable to the extent a particular professor has no such students,so too would one naturally read instructions about qualified individuals to be inapplicable to the extent a particular exchange has no such individuals.there is no need to rewrite the term state that established the exchange in the definition of qualified individual,much less a need to rewrite the separate term exchange established by the state in a separate part of the act.
least convincing of all,however,is the court attempt to uncover support for its interpretation in the structure of section itself.ante,at.the court finds it strange that congress limited the tax credit to state exchanges in the formula for calculating the amount of the credit,rather than in the provision defining the range of taxpayers eligible for the credit.had the court bothered to look at the rest of the tax code,it would have seen that the structure it finds strange is in fact quite common.consider,for example,the many provisions that initially make taxpayers of all incomes eligible for a tax credit,only to provide later that the amount of the credit is zero if the taxpayer income exceeds a specified threshold.see,child tax credit tax credit tax credit.or consider,for an even closer parallel,a neighboring provision that initially makes taxpayers of all states eligible for a credit,only to provide later that the amount of the credit may be zero if the taxpayer state does not satisfy certain requirements.see tax credit.one begins to get the sense that the court insistence on reading things in context applies to established by the state,but to nothing else.
for what it is worth,lawmakers usually draft provisions the way they do,the way they drafted because the mechanics of the credit require it.many americans move to new states in the middle of the year.mentioning state exchanges in the definition of coverage month rather than as the court proposes in the provisions concerning taxpayers eligibility for the credit accounts for taxpayers who live in a state with a state exchange for a part of the year,but a state with a federal exchange for the rest of the year.in addition,awards a credit with respect to insurance plans which cover the taxpayer,the taxpayer spouse,or any dependent of the taxpayer and which were enrolled in through an exchange established by the state.b a emphasis added.if congress had mentioned state exchanges in the provisions discussing taxpayers eligibility for the credit,a taxpayer who buys insurance from a federal exchange would get no money,even if he has a spouse or dependent who buys insurance from a state exchange say a child attending college in a different state.it thus makes perfect sense for exchange established by the state to appear where it does,rather than where the court suggests.even if that were not so,of course,its location would not make it any less clear.
the court has not come close to presenting the compelling contextual case necessary to justify departing from the ordinary meaning of the terms of the law.quite the contrary,context only underscores the outlandishness of the court interpretation.reading the act as a whole leaves no doubt about the matter exchange established by the state means what it looks like it means.
for its next defense of the indefensible,the court turns to the affordable care act design and purposes.as relevant here,the act makes three major reforms.the and requirements prohibit insurers from considering a customer health when deciding whether to sell insurance and how much to charge,its famous individual mandate requires everyone to maintain insurance coverage or to pay what the act calls a penalty,b,and what we have nonetheless called a tax,see national federation of independent business sebelius,slip,at and its tax credits help make insurance more affordable.the court reasons that congress intended these three reforms to work together to expand insurance coverage and because the first two apply in every state,so must the third.ante,at.
this reasoning suffers from no shortage of flaws.to begin with,even the most formidable argument concerning the statute purposes could not overcome the clarity of the statute text.kloeckner solis,slip,at.statutory design and purpose matter only to the extent they help clarify an otherwise ambiguous provision.could anyone maintain with a straight face that is unclear to mention just the highlights,the court interpretation clashes with a statutory definition,renders words inoperative in at least seven separate provisions of the act,overlooks the contrast between provisions that say exchange and those that say exchange established by the state,gives the same phrase one meaning for purposes of tax credits but an entirely different meaning for other purposes,and let us not forget contradicts the ordinary meaning of the words congress used.on the other side of the ledger,the court has come up with nothing more than a general provision that turns out to be controlled by a specific one,a handful of clauses that are consistent with either understanding of establishment by the state,and a resemblance between the provision and the rest of the tax code.if that is all it takes to make something ambiguous,everything is ambiguous.
having gone wrong in consulting statutory purpose at all,the court goes wrong again in analyzing it.the purposes of a law must be collected chiefly from its words,not from extrinsic circumstances.sturges crowninshield,wheat,marshall.only by concentrating on the law terms can a judge hope to uncover the scheme of the statute,rather than some other scheme that the judge thinks desirable.like it or not,the express terms of the affordable care act make only two of the three reforms mentioned by the court applicable in states that do not establish exchanges.it is perfectly possible for them to operate independently of tax credits.the and requirements continue to ensure that insurance companies treat all customers the same no matter their health,and the individual mandate continues to encourage people to maintain coverage,lest they be taxed.
the court protests that without the tax credits,the number of people covered by the individual mandate shrinks,and without a broadly applicable individual mandate the and requirements would destabilize the individual insurance market.ante,at.if true,these projections would show only that the statutory scheme contains a flaw they would not show that the statute means the opposite of what it says.moreover,it is a flaw that appeared as well in other parts of the act.a different title established a insurance program with and requirements,but without an individual mandate or subsidies,stat.this program never came into effect only because congress,in response to actuarial analyses predicting that the program would be fiscally unsustainable,repealed the provision in.halbig,at.how could the court say that congress would never dream of combining and requirements with a narrow individual mandate,when it combined those requirements with no individual mandate in the context of insurance 
similarly,the department of health and human services originally interpreted the act to i
