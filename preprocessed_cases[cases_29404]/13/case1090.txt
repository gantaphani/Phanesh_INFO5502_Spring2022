this case asks us to decide when a statement in a scientific article reporting research results can give rise to claims of false advertising under the lanham act,deceptive practices under new york general business law,and the torts of injurious falsehood and interference with prospective economic advantage.we conclude that,as a matter of law,statements of scientific conclusions about unsettled matters of scientific debate can not give rise to liability for damages sounding in defamation.we further conclude that the secondary distribution of excerpts of such an article can not give rise to liability,so long as the excerpts do not mislead a reader about the conclusions of the article.
background 
the following factual background is taken from the complaint,whose allegations we accept as true,and from the materials referenced in the complaint.plaintiff ony,ony and defendant chiesi farmaceutici,chiesi are two of the biggest producers of surfactants,biological substances that line the surface of human lungs.surfactants are critical to lung function they facilitate the transfer of oxygen from inhaled air into the blood stream although the human body naturally produces surfactants,prematurely born infants often produce inadequate surfactant levels.infants with such a deficiency are at a higher risk for lung collapse and respiratory distress syndrome rds,a condition that can result in respiratory failure and death.the surfactants produced and sold by,among others,ony and chiesi are the primary treatment for rds.the fda has approved three surfactants for treatment of rds in neonatal infants.ony produces one derived from bovine lung surfactant that bears the trade name infasurf.chiesi produces a competing surfactant derived from porcine lung mince that goes by curosurf.chiesi,an italian pharmaceutical firm,contracts with its cornerstone therapeutics,cornerstone to distribute and market curosurf in the united states.
the parties vigorously contest the relative effectiveness of their products in the marketplace,in the scientific literature,and in the instant lawsuit.the parties agree that two variables are particularly relevant to this comparison mortality rate and length of stay.mortality rate means the percentage of infants treated with a particular surfactant who do not survive.length of stay refers to the amount of time an infant remains in the hospital for treatment.these two variables are not entirely independent in some cases the length of stay is shortened by death,which is reflected in the mortality rate.put differently,some of the same causes of increased mortality rate low birth weight,shorter gestational period also cause shorter lengths of stay.conversely,infants with shorter hospitalization might have had less serious medical conditions from the beginning,independent of treatment variables.at the same time,a particularly effective drug may both reduce mortality rate and shorten length of stay.
in,as part of its effort to promote and sell curosurf,chiesi hired defendant premier,premier to build a database and conduct a study of the relative effectiveness of the different surfactants.premier engaged one of its employees,frank ernst,to carry out the necessary technical work.chiesi then hired several medical doctors,including defendants rangasamy ramanathan,jatinder bhatia,and krishnamurthy sekar the physician defendants,to present findings based on premier database at various medical conferences.specifically,the physician defendants presented findings at the may annual meeting of the pediatric academic societies that curosurf was associated with a lower mortality rate than either infasurf or survanta.at the october annual meeting of the european pediatric society,the physician defendants,along with ernst and others,presented additional findings specifically,they presented evidence showing that curosurf was associated with a shorter length of stay than either infasurf or survanta.despite the differences between the data presented at the two conferences,both presentations were based on the same data set,namely the one compiled by premier and ernst.
in,the physician defendants,along with ernst,eventually decided to publish some of the findings from the same data set in a journal.they submitted their article to the journal of perinatology,the leading journal in the field of neonatology,which is the study of newborn infants the article was published in the september,volume of the journal after being peer reviewed by two anonymous referees.see ramanathan et,mortality in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome treated with poractant alfa,calfactant or beractant a retrospective study,perinatology.
according to ony,the article contains five distinct incorrect statements of fact about the relative effectiveness of curosurf versus infasurf that infasurf was associated with a greater likelihood of death than curosurf that curosurf treatment for rds was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of death when compared with infasurf that the authors model found infasurf to be associated with a significantly greater likelihood of death than curosurf that the authors study showed a significant greater likelihood of death with infasurf than curosurf and the summary concluding sentence 
in conclusion,this large retrospective study of preterm infants with rds found lower mortality among infants who received curosurf,compared with infants who received either infasurf or survanta,even after adjusting for patient characteristics such as gestational age and birth weight,and after accounting for hospital characteristics and center effects.
proposed am.compl.plaintiff also alleges that the circumstances surrounding the article publication were unusual bhatia is an associate editor,and sekar is a member of the editorial board,of the journal of perinatology.plaintiff alleged in its complaint that one of the two peer reviewers objected to its publication,but the other peer reviewer recommended the article for publication,and the editor in chief broke the tie.plaintiff does not allege,however,that the publication of the article based on the affirmative opinions of one reviewer and the editor in chief was a departure from accepted or customary procedure.further,the article was published in an open access format,which allows it to be viewed electronically by the general public without paying the typically applicable fee or ordering a subscription the fees associated with such publication were paid by chiesi and cornerstone.
the article conclusions were not unqualified.the authors considered the objection that the retrospective nature of the study might cause a disparity between the groups included in the study.more specifically,the authors noted that the article finding may most likely be due to different surfactant doses administered to the infants included in the database,because curosurf was,on average,prescribed in higher doses than its competitors.finally,the authors disclosed that the study was sponsored by chiesi,that ernst was an employee of premier,that chiesi hired premier to conduct the study,and that all three physician defendants had served as consultants to chiesi.
plaintiff primary objection to the substance of the article scientific methodology is that the authors omitted any mention of the data,despite the fact that they had presented such data at the october conference.because an important determinant of mortality rate is the health of the infants in the sample,plaintiff contends that the omission of data was intentional and designed to mask the fact that the neonatal infants treated with curosurf had a greater ex ante chance of survival than did the group treated with infasurf.if the data had been included,plaintiff alleges,it would be obvious to readers that the differences in the results were a result of differences in the groups of patients treated,not of any differences in the effect of the particular lung surfactant administered.appellant br.at.plaintiff also objects to the authors failure to cite articles with different primary conclusions,although such contradictory authority was known to them,and to the use of retrospectiv
