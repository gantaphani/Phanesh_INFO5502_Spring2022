the officers charged betts under new york law with assault in the third degree,harassment in the second degree and resisting arrest.eventually the state court dismissed these charges with prejudice.

dismissal of betts claims 
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint under.b de novo and,in doing so,we view the pleadings in the light most favorable to,and draw all reasonable inference in favor of,the party.doe,at internal quotation marks omitted.
false arrest,false imprisonment,and malicious prosecution 
probable cause is a complete defense to a constitutional claim of false arrest,singer fulton cnty.sheriff,cir,and false imprisonment,zanghi vill.of old brookville,cir.and continuing probable cause is a complete defense to a constitutional claim of malicious prosecution.kinzer jackson,cir stating that probable cause is a defense to a claim of malicious prosecution if it is not later nullified by information establishing the defendant innocence.probable cause exists when one has knowledge of,or reasonably trustworthy information as to,facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.williams town of greenburgh,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.

even in the absence of probable cause,a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity where her conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,or it was objectively reasonable for her to believe that her actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act.jenkins city of new york,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.plaintiff false arrest,false imprisonment,and malicious prosecution claims therefore turn on whether the defendant officers probable cause determination was objectively reasonable that is,whether there was arguable probable cause to arrest.id.for the following reasons,we agree with the district court that the arresting officers had arguable probable cause and were entitled to qualified immunity.
as betts alleged in his complaint,shearman called the police and reported that betts had,among other things,assaulted her.betts also alleged that once the officers arrived at the apartment,shearman again accused betts of assault and harassment,although it is unclear from the complaint whether shearman made this allegation before or after allegedly being coached by the officers to lie.
in any event,officers rodriguez and doe responded to a domestic disturbance based on shearman report over the phone that she had been assaulted and found betts locked in a bedroom.betts alleged,and now argues,that the officers had reason to doubt shearman credibility because she was visibly intoxicated and had made false accusations against betts in the past,and because there was a lack of physical evidence to support an assault charge.
