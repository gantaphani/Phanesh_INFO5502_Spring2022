this case is yet another act in the drama involving patients,their health care providers,and their health care benefit plans.the question presented is whether a health care provider breach of contract and claims against a benefit plan established pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,are completely preempted by federal law under the test for erisa preemption established in aetna health davila.we hold an health care provider may receive a valid assignment of rights from an erisa plan beneficiary pursuant to erisa a b the provision setting forth erisa civil enforcement scheme where a provider claim involves the right to payment and not simply the amount or execution of that is,where the claim implicates coverage and benefit determinations as set forth by the terms of the erisa benefit plan,and not simply the contractually correct payment amount or the proper execution of the monetary that claim constitutes a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to erisa a b and in the instant case,at least some of plaintiff claims for reimbursement are completely preempted by federal law furthermore,the remaining claims are properly subject to the district court supplemental jurisdiction.
background 
montefiore medical center montefiore or plaintiff is a hospital in the bronx,new york.between may and august,montefiore provided medical services to beneficiaries of local welfare fund the fund,an employee benefit plan governed by erisa.the fund provides health care coverage to individuals who work in covered employment,as defined by the fund,and to their eligible dependents collectively,the beneficiaries or members of the fund.the coverage that the fund offers is paid directly from contributions it receives from employers,who are obliged by their collective bargaining agreements with teamsters local the union to make specified contributions to the fund on behalf of their covered employees.as required by erisa and department of labor regulations,the fund plan description the plan sets forth the eligibility requirements for coverage,the nature of benefits provided,limitations on those benefits,services covered,and the procedures for claiming benefits and appealing claim denials.
under the plan,beneficiaries may obtain medical services in one of two ways.first,they may visit a health care provider who is in the network of providers with whom the fund has specially contracted to provide services to its members an provider.second,beneficiaries may visit a health care provider who is not in the fund network an provider.when fund members obtain services from an provider,they pay a small or fee or pay nothing at all,and the fund reimburses the remaining cost for services directly to the provider.when fund members obtain services from an provider,the member is responsible for paying the provider himself,and thereafter may seek reimbursement for covered services from the fund.
the plan generally sets forth the beneficiary,and other rates of payment,but it does not establish a rate or schedule at which or providers will be reimbursed by the plan.for example,the plan provides that a beneficiary is responsible for paying a fee for maternity care,but it does not establish a ceiling or other limitation on the fee that a provider of maternity care may charge in order to qualify for reimbursement of the remaining cost.these types of limitations are usually set by separate agreements between providers and their preferred provider organizations ppos or between ppos and the erisa benefit plan,as explained below.
at all relevant times,montefiore was an provider of the plan by virtue of its membership in two ppos.montefiore contracted with horizon healthcare insurance company of new york horizon,from april until january,and preferred choice management systems,magnacare magnacare,from january,through march,the date montefiore filed its complaint in this action.these ppos entered into agreements with the fund to provide eligible plan beneficiaries with access to the ppos participating hospitals,including montefiore.
montefiore and the other providers,in turn,entered into agreements with the ppos to provide health care services to beneficiaries of the plan at reimbursement rates,which rates were typically discounted from the providers usual and customary rates.the fund contracts with horizon and magnacare established the specific rates and terms under which the fund would reimburse the providers for services.these contracts also included many to the terms of the beneficiaries benefit agreement with the fund,the plan 
on march,montefiore filed a complaint against teamsters local et defendants in new york state court seeking payment for over million in medical services provided to plan beneficiaries that the fund had allegedly failed to reimburse.on its face,the complaint alleged,inter alia,claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.on march,defendants removed the action to the district court,alleging that the claims fell within the civil enforcement provisions of erisa and were therefore completely preempted by federal law.see a.on june,montefiore moved to remand the case to state court 
on november,the district court issued its opinion order denying plaintiff motion to remand to the state court and holding,pursuant to the supreme court decision in davila,that montefiore had standing as an assignee of the plan participants and beneficiaries to bring a claim under the civil enforcement provision of erisa,and that there wa s no independent duty implicated by defendants actions.accordingly,the district court concluded that montefiore claims were completely preempted by erisa and removal was proper.observing that the second circuit has not yet determined whether an provider such as montefiore has standing under erisa,the district court sua sponte certified its order for interlocutory appeal.
this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
a party seeking removal bears the burden of showing that federal jurisdiction is proper.cal.pub.emps.ret.worldcom,cir.a civil claim filed in state court can only be removed to federal court if the district court would have had original jurisdiction to hear the claim.see a.under the complaint rule,federal subject matter jurisdiction typically exists only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law,and not simply when federal preemption might be invoked as a defense to liability.metro.life ins.taylor.however,a corollary of the complaint rule provides that congress may so completely a particular area of law that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.id.at accord in re wtc disaster site,cir complete preemption permits removal of a lawsuit to federal court based upon the concept that where there is complete preemption,only a federal claim exists.where congress has clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action removable to federal court,the federal courts must honor that intent.alterations and quotation marks omitted.
the district court held,and defendants assert on appeal,that notwithstanding the complaint express references to state claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment,plaintiff claims are completely preempted by erisa and are therefore removable to federal court.we review de novo a district court conclusions regarding its subject matter jurisdiction.devlin transp.commc ns int l union,cir.
iii.the davila test 
erisa was enacted to protect participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries by establishing uniform regulations for such plans and providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.b.among other things,erisa creates a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that completely preempts any cause of action that duplicates,supplements,or supplants an erisa remedy.davila,at see also paneccasio unisource worldwide,cir the purpose of erisa preemption is to ensure that all covered benefit plans will be governed by unified federal law franciscan skemp healthcare,cent.states joint bd.health welfare trust fund,cir explaining that complete preemption under erisa is really a jurisdictional rather than a preemption doctrine,as it confers exclusive federal jurisdiction in certain instances where congress intended the scope of a federal law to be so broad as to entirely replace any claim.the erisa civil enforcement scheme is set forth in a,see note,ante,and provides,inter alia,that a plan participant or beneficiary may bring an action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.erisa a b,a b.therefore,if montefiore claims fall within the scope of a b,as defendants urge and plaintiffs deny,those claims are preempted by erisa.
in davila,the supreme court established a test to determine whether a claim falls within the scope of a b.davila,at internal citation omitted.specifically,claims are completely preempted by erisa if they are brought i by an individual who at some point in time,could have brought his claim under erisa a b,and ii under circumstances in which there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions.id.the test is conjunctive a cause of action is preempted only if both prongs of the test are satisfied.see borrero united healthcare of,cir marin hosp.modesto empire traction,cir.
we now turn to consider each prong of this test.
davila prong one 
there is potential for confusion regarding the proper sequence of analysis under davila.specifically,in situations in which a party seeks remand to a state court,it easy to overlook the distinction between claims brought solely pursuant to an independent duty that has nothing to do with erisa,and claims which could have been brought under erisa,but also rest on an other independent legal duty that is implicated by the defendant actions.the former fails to satisfy the first prong of davila because it does not state a colorable claim for benefits,firestone tire rubber bruch,and therefore could not have been brought under erisa,and the latter fails to satisfy the second prong of davila.at.
accordingly,we can avoid this problem by expressly disaggregating the first prong of davila.first,we consider whether the plaintiff is the type of party that can bring a claim pursuant to a b and second,we consider whether the actual claim that the plaintiff asserts can be construed as a colorable claim for benefits pursuant to a b.marin,at holding,pursuant to the first prong of davila,that although plan beneficiaries had validly assigned their erisa claims to the provider hospital,the actual claim brought by the hospital was based upon a separate contractual obligation.after we have considered the two steps of the first prong,we will turn to the second prong to determine whether there is an independent legal duty that is implicated by the defendant actions.davila,at.
i davila prong one step one 
as explained above,a b provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary of an erisa plan to enforce certain rights under that plan pursuant to erisa.see a b emphasis supplied.generally,a is narrowly construed to permit only the enumerated parties to sue directly for relief.see franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust for,accord chemung canal trust sovran,cir.however,we have carv ed out a narrow exception to the erisa standing requirements to grant standing to healthcare providers to whom a beneficiary has assigned his claim in exchange for health care.simon,cir accord tango transp.healthcare fin,cir collecting cases see also pascack valley,local ufcw welfare reimbursement plan,cir almost every circuit to have considered the question has held that a health care provider can assert a claim under a where a beneficiary or participant has assigned to the provider that individual right to benefits under the plan.
here,each of the reimbursement forms that provide the basis for montefiore suit contain a y for yes in the space certifying that the patient has assigned his claim to the hospital.accordingly,pursuant to our holding in simon,the first step of the first prong of the davila test is satisfied montefiore is a health care provider to whom beneficiaries of the plan have assigned their claims,and therefore is the type of party that can bring a claim against the fund regarding benefits pursuant to a b 
that said,montefiore vigorously contests the notion that it obtained valid assignments,arguing that an attempt to assign erisa benefits to an provider is a nullity.in support of its argument,montefiore relies upon dicta in sewell benefits fund for heatlh human,app x,cir,a summary order in which we stated 
where the patient receives services from a participating provider,it is not clear that the patient has anything to assign because the patient is entitled only to healthcare at no cost,not reimbursement.if the participant or beneficiary has no right to payment to assign to the participating provider,it is doubtful that the narrow exception for healthcare providers to erisa otherwise stringent standing requirement would apply.
as the district court correctly observed in its opinion order of november,these stray comments are neither binding precedent nor even the holding of the case in which they appear.but more importantly,they do not accurately reflect the nature of the legal right at issue here.
the right to health care at no cost or at less cost,where a or fee is involved is made possible only by arrangements to have one health care provider reimbursed for the balance of the fee for services.indeed,the difference between receiving health care at no cost and receiving direct reimbursement of one costs is largely one of form,rather than of substance.this reality,in and of itself,is sufficient to support our holding that patients may assign their rights to providers.however,even if we assume for the sake of argument that a provider would continue to provide medical services to beneficiaries at low or no cost despite an inability to enforce beneficiaries rights under erisa quite an assumption the fact remains that beneficiaries arguably would be liable for whatever costs the provider is unable to recover from a benefit plan,and would have a right to reimbursement of those costs pursuant to erisa and to the terms of the plan.
for example,montefiore contract with magnacare expressly permits montefiore to obtain payment by billing or,if necessary,by suit directly from patients in the event that montefiore does not receive payment from the fund.as montefiore counsel conceded at oral argument,in the event that a patient is charged or sued by montefiore,his right to reimbursement from the fund is a right that the patient may assign to montefiore.
montefiore contract with horizon,on the other hand,is silent as to whether montefiore can seek full reimbursement directly from patients however,even under that contract,patients are likely to be held liable for the services they received it does not take a stretch of the imagination to expect that a patient who receives medical care will be required to pay for it see cagle bruner,cir if can not receive a valid assignment so that they may sue the erisa plan for payment,they will bill the participant or beneficiary directly for the insured medical bills,and the participant or beneficiary will be required to bring suit against the benefit plan when claims go unpaid.on the other hand,if can sue for payment of benefits,an assignment will transfer the burden of bringing suit from plan participants and beneficiaries to providers,who are better situated and financed to pursue an action for benefits owed for their services.for these reasons,the interests of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries are better served by allowing to sue erisa plans.citations omitted hermann hosp.meba med.benefits plan,cir many providers seek assignments of benefits to avoid billing the beneficiary directly and upsetting his finances and to reduce the risk of.if their status as assignees does not entitle them to federal standing against the plan,providers would either have to rely on the beneficiary to maintain an erisa suit,or they would have to sue the beneficiary.
accordingly,plaintiff montefiore argu
