respondent castleman moved to dismiss his indictment under g,which forbids the possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.he argued that his previous conviction for intentionally or knowingly caus ing bodily injury to the mother of his child,app,did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because it did not involve the use or attempted use of physical force,a a ii.the district court agreed,reasoning that physical force must entail violent contact and that one can cause bodily injury without violent contact,by poisoning.the sixth circuit affirmed on a different rationale.it held that the degree of physical force required for a conviction to constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is the same as that required for a violent felony under the armed career criminal act acca,e b i namely,violent force and that castleman could have been convicted for causing slight injury by nonviolent conduct.
held castleman conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
a section g physical force requirement is satisfied by the degree of force that supports a battery conviction namely,offensive touching.congress presumably intends to incorporate the meaning of terms that it uses,and nothing suggests congress intended otherwise here.the sixth circuit relied upon johnson united states,in which the meaning of force was found to be a comical misfit,at,when read into acca violent felony definition.but johnson resolves this case in the government favor the very reasons for rejecting the meaning in johnson are reasons to embrace it here.first,whereas it was unlikely that congress meant to incorporate in acca violent felony definition a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,at,it is likely that congress meant to incorporate the meaning of force in defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.second,whereas the word violent or violence standing alone connotes a substantial degree of force,at,that is not true of domestic violence,which is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as violent in a nondomestic context.third,whereas this court has hesitated to apply acca to crimes which,though dangerous,are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels armed career criminals,begay united states,there is no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together with others whom g disqualifies from gun ownership.in addition,a contrary reading would have made g inoperative in at least ten states when it was enacted.
b under this definition of physical force,castleman conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.the application of the modified categorical approach consulting castleman state indictment to determine whether his conviction entailed the elements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense is straightforward.castleman pleaded guilty to intentionally or knowingly caus ing bodily injury to the mother of his child,and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.first,a bodily injury must result from physical force.the concept of force encompasses even its indirect application,making it impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the sense.second,the knowing or intentional application of force is a use of force.leocal ashcroft,distinguished.
c castleman claims that legislative history,the rule of lenity,and the canon of constitutional avoidance weigh against this court interpretation of g,but his arguments are unpersuasive.

justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
recognizing that f irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination,united states hayes,congress forbade the possession of firearms by anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.g.the respondent,james alvin castleman,pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense of having intentionally or knowingly cause d bodily injury to the mother of his child.app.the question before us is whether this conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.we hold that it does.
this country witnesses more than a million acts of domestic violence,and hundreds of deaths from domestic violence,each year see georgia randolph.domestic violence often escalates in severity over time,see brief for major cities chiefs association et as amici curiae brief for national network to end domestic violence et as amici curiae,and the presence of a firearm increases the likelihood that it will escalate to homicide,see,at campbell et,assessing risk factors for intimate partner homicide,doj,nat.institute of justice,when a gun was in the house,an abused woman was times more likely than other abused women to be killed a ll too often,as one senator noted during the debate over g,the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun.cong.rec.statement of wellstone.
congress enacted g,in light of these sobering facts,to close a dangerous loophole in the gun control laws while felons had long been barred from possessing guns,many perpetrators of domestic violence are convicted only of misdemeanors.hayes,at.section g provides,as relevant,that any person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence may not possess in or affecting commerc e any firearm or ammunition.with exceptions that do not apply here,the statute defines a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as 
an offense that i is a misdemeanor under federal,state,or tribal law and ii has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force,or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,committed by a current or former spouse,parent,or guardian of the victim,by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common,by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse,parent,or guardian,or by a person similarly situated to a spouse,parent,or guardian of the victim.a a.
this case concerns the meaning of one phrase in this definition the use of physical force.
in,castleman was charged in a tennessee court with having intentionally or knowingly cause d bodily injury to the mother of his child,in violation of.code ann.b supp.app.he pleaded guilty,at.
in,federal authorities learned that castleman was selling firearms on the black market.a grand jury in the western district of tennessee indicted him on two counts of violating g and on other charges not relevant here,at.
castleman moved to dismiss the g charges,arguing that his tennessee conviction did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because it did not ha ve,as an element,the use of physical force,a a ii.the district court agreed,on the theory that the use of physical force for g purposes must entail violent contact with the victim.app.to pet.for cert.the court held that a conviction under the relevant tennessee statute can not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because one can cause bodily injury without violent contact for example,by deceiving the victim into drinking a poisoned beverage.at.
a divided panel of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed,by different reasoning.the majority held that the degree of physical force required by a a ii is the same as required by e b i,which defines violent felony.at.applying our decision in johnson united states,which held that e b i requires violent force,at,the majority held that castleman conviction did not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because castleman could have been convicted for caus ing a slight,nonserious physical injury with conduct that can not be described as violent.at.judge mckeague dissented,arguing both that the majority erred in extending johnson definition of a violent felony to the context of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and that,in any event,castleman conviction satisfied the johnson standard,at.
the sixth circuit decision deepened a split of authority among the courts of appeals.compare,united states nason,g encompass es crimes characterized by the application of any physical force with united states belless,g covers only the violent use of force we granted certiorari to resolve this split,and now reverse the sixth circuit judgment.
it is a settled principle of interpretation that,absent other indication,congress intends to incorporate the meaning of the terms it uses.sekhar united states,slip,at.seeing no other indication here,we hold that congress incorporated the meaning of force namely,offensive touching in a a definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
johnson resolves this case in the government favor not,as the sixth circuit held,in castleman.in johnson,we considered whether a battery conviction was a violent felony under the armed career criminal act acca,e.as here,acca defines such a crime as one that has as an element the use of physical force,e b i.we began by observing that at common law,the element of force in the crime of battery was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.at citing blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england and we recognized the general rule that a term of art should be given its established meaning,except where that meaning does not fit.at.we declined to read the meaning of force into acca definition of a violent felony,because we found it a comical misfit with the defined term.at see united states stevens,a n unclear definitional phrase may take meaning from the term to be defined in defining a violent felony,we held,the phrase physical force must mea n violent force.johnson,at.but here,the meaning of force fits perfectly the very reasons we gave for rejecting that meaning in defining a violent felony are reasons to embrace it in defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
first,because perpetrators of domestic violence are routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault or battery laws,hayes,at,it makes sense for congress to have classified as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence the type of conduct that supports a battery conviction.whereas it was unlikely that congress meant to incorporate in the definition of a violent felony a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor,johnson,at,it is likely that congress meant to incorporate that meaning of force in defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
second,whereas the word violent or violence standing alone connotes a substantial degree of force,at that is not true of domestic violence.domestic violence is not merely a type of violence it is a term of art encompassing acts that one might not characterize as violent in a nondomestic context.see brief for national network to end domestic violence et as amici curiae doj,office on violence against women,domestic violence defining physical forms of domestic violence to include h itting,slapping,shoving,grabbing,pinching,biting,and hair pulling online at.indeed,most physical assaults committed against women and men by intimates are relatively minor and consist of pushing,grabbing,shoving,slapping,and hitting.doj,tjaden thoennes,extent,nature and consequences of intimate partner violence.
minor uses of force may not constitute violence in the generic sense.for example,in an opinion that we cited with approval in johnson,the seventh circuit noted that it was hard to describe as violence a squeeze of the arm that causes a bruise.flores ashcroft.but an act of this nature is easy to describe as domestic violence,when the accumulation of such acts over time can subject one intimate partner to the other control.if a seemingly minor act like this draws the attention of authorities and leads to a successful prosecution for a misdemeanor offense,it does not offend common sense or the english language to characterize the resulting conviction as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
justice scalia concurrence discounts our reference to definitions of domestic violence,including those used by the organizations most directly engaged with the problem and thus most aware of its dimensions.see post,at.it is important to keep in mind,however,that the operative phrase we are construing is not domestic violence it is physical force.a a.physical force has a presumptive meaning,and the question is simply whether that presumptive meaning makes sense in defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
a third reason for distinguishing johnson definition of physical force is that unlike in johnson where a determination that the defendant crime was a violent felony would have classified him as an armed career criminal the statute here groups those convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence with others whose conduct does not warrant such a designation.section g bars gun possession by anyone addicted to any controlled substance,g by most people who have been admitted to the united states under a nonimmigrant visa,g b by anyone who has renounced united states citizenship,g and by anyone subject to a domestic restraining order,g.whereas we have hesitated as in johnson to apply the armed career criminal act to crimes which,though dangerous,are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels armed career criminals,begay united states,we see no anomaly in grouping domestic abusers convicted of generic assault or battery offenses together with the others whom g disqualifies from gun ownership.
an additional reason to read the statute as we do is that a contrary reading would have rendered g inoperative in many states at the time of its enactment.the assault or battery laws under which domestic abusers were routinely prosecuted when congress enacted g,and under which many are still prosecuted today,hayes,at,fall generally into two categories those that prohibit both offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury,and those that prohibit only the latter.see brief for united states.whether or not the causation of bodily injury necessarily entails violent force a question we do not reach mere offensive touching does not.see johnson,at.so if offensive touching did not constitute force under a a,then g would have been ineffectual in at least states home to nearly thirty percent of the nation at the time of its enactment.see post,at,and scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment acknowledging that g would have been inapplicable in california and nine other states if it did not encompass offensive touching app.to brief for united states listing statutes prohibiting both offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury,only some of which are divisible hayes,at rejecting an interpretation under which g would have been a dead letter in some of the states from the very moment of its enactment 
in sum,johnson requires that we attribute the meaning of force to a a definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as an offense that has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force.we therefore hold that the requirement of physical force is satisfied,for purposes of g,by the degree of force that supports a battery conviction.
applying this definition of physical force,we conclude that castleman conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.in doing so,we follow the analytic approach of taylor united states,and shepard united states.we begin with taylor categorical approach,under which we look to the statute of castleman conviction to determine whether that conviction necessarily ha d,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force,or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,a a.
the tennessee statute under which castleman was convicted made it a crime to commi t an assault against a family or household member in castleman case,the mother of his child.code ann.b.a provision incorporated by reference,defined three types of assault i ntentionally,knowingly or recklessly caus ing bodily injury to another i ntentionally or knowingly caus ing another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury or i ntentionally or knowingly caus ing physical contact with another in a manner that a reasonable person would regard as extremely offensive or provocative.a.
it does not appear that every type of assault defined by necessarily involves the use or attempted use of physical force,or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,a a.a threat under may not necessarily involve a deadly weapon,and the merely reckless causation of bodily injury under may not be a use of force 
but we need not decide whether a domestic assault conviction in tennessee categorically constitutes a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,because the parties do not contest that is a divisible statute,descamps united states,slip,at.we may accordingly apply the modified categorical approach,consulting the indictment to which castleman pleaded guilty in order to determine whether his conviction did entail the elements necessary to constitute the generic federal offense,at slip,at see shepard,at.here,that analysis is straightforward castleman pleaded guilty to having intentionally or knowingly cause d bodily injury to the mother of his child,app,and the knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involves the use of physical force.
first,a bodily injury must result from physical force.under tennessee law,bodily injury is a broad term it includes a cut,abrasion,bruise,burn or disfigurement physical pain or temporary illness or impairment of the function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty.code ann.a.justice sca lia concurrence suggests that these forms of injury necessitate violent force,under johnson definition of that phrase.post,at.but whether or not that is so a question we do not decide these forms of injury do necessitate force in the sense.
the district court thought otherwise,reasoning that one can cause bodily injury without the use of physical force for example,by deceiving the victim into drinking a poisoned beverage,without making contact of any kind.app.to pet.for cert.but as we explained in johnson,physical force is simply force exerted by and through concrete bodies,as opposed to intellectual force or emotional force.at.and the concept of force encompasses even its indirect application.force in this sense describ es one of the elements of the crime of battery,at,and t he force used in battery need not be applied directly to the body of the victim.lafave,criminal law b ed.a battery may be committed by administering a poison or by infecting with a disease,or even by resort to some intangible substance,such as a laser beam.ibid.footnote omitted citing state monroe,poison state lankford,disease adams commonwealth.app,laser beam.it is impossible to cause bodily injury without applying force in the sense.
second,the knowing or intentional application of force is a use of force.castleman is correct that under leocal ashcroft,the word use conveys the idea that the thing used here,physical force has been made the user instrument.brief for respondent.but he errs in arguing that although p oison may have forceful physical properties as a matter of organic chemistry,no one would say that a poisoner ploys force or carries out a purpose by means of force when he or she sprinkles poison in a victim drink,ibid.the use of force in castleman example is not the act of sprinkl ing the poison it is the act of employing poison knowingly as a device to cause physical harm.that the harm occurs indirectly,rather than directly as with a kick or punch,does not matter.under castleman logic,after all,one could say that pulling the trigger on a gun is not a use of force because it is the bullet,not the trigger,that actually strikes the victim.leocal held that the use of force must entail a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct,at it did not hold that the word use somehow alters the meaning of force.
because castleman indictment makes clear that the use of physical force was an element of his conviction,that conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
we are not persuaded by castleman nontextual arguments against our interpretation of g.
first,castleman invokes g legislative history to suggest that congress could not have intended for the provision to apply to acts involving minimal force.but to the extent that legislative history can aid in the interpretation of this statute,castleman reliance on it is unpersuasive.
castleman begins by observing that during the debate over g,several senators argued that the provision would help to prevent gun violence by perpetrators of severe domestic abuse.senator lautenberg referred to serious spousal or child abuse and to violent individuals senator hutchison to people who batter their wives senator wellstone to people who brutalize their wives or children and senator feinstein to severe and recurring domestic violence.cong.rec.but as we noted above,see supra,at,the impetus of g was that even perpetrators of severe domestic violence are often convicted under generally applicable assault or battery laws.hayes,at.so nothing about these senators isolated references to severe domestic violence suggests that they would not have wanted g to apply to a misdemeanor assault conviction like castleman.
castleman next observes that g is the product of a legislative compromise.the provision originally barred gun possession for any crime of domestic violence,defined as any felony or misdemeanor crime of violence,regardless of length,term,or manner of punishment.cong.rec.congress rewrote the provision to require the use of physical force in response to the concern that the term crime of violence was too broad,and could be interpreted to include an act such as cutting up a credit card with a pair of scissors,at.see hayes,at.castleman would have us conclude that congress thus meant to narrow the scope of the statute to convictions based on especially severe conduct.brief for respondent.but all congress meant to do was address the fear that g might be triggered by offenses in which no force at all was directed at a person.as senator lautenberg noted,the revised text was not only more precise than the original but also probably broader.cong.rec.
we are similarly unmoved by castleman invocation of the rule of lenity.castleman is correct that our construction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for fair warning.crandon united states.but the rule of lenity only applies if,after considering text,structure,history,and purpose,there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,such that the court must simply guess as to what congress intended.barber thomas,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.that is not the case here.
finally,castleman suggests in a single paragraph that we should read g narrowly because it implicates his constitutional right to keep and bear arms.but castleman has not challenged the constitutionality of g,either on its face or as applied to him,and the meaning of the statute is sufficiently clear that we need not indulge castleman cursory nod to constitutional avoidance concerns.
castleman conviction for having intentionally or knowingly cause d bodily injury to the mother of his child qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit is therefore reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
opinion of scalia,
united states,petitioner james alvin castleman 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i agree with the court that intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to a family member has,as an element,the use of physical force,a a ii,and thus constitutes a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,g.i write separately,however,because i reach that conclusion on narrower grounds.
our decision in johnson united states,is the natural place to begin.johnson is significant here because it concluded that the phrase physical force means violent force that is,force capable of caus ing physical pain or injury to another person.at second emphasis added.this is an easy case if the phrase physical force has the same meaning in a a ii,the provision that defines misdemeanor crime of domestic violence for purposes of g,as it does in e b ii,the provision interpreted in johnson,since it is impossible to cause bodily injury without using force capable of producing that result.
there are good reasons to give the phrase johnson interpretation.one is the presumption of consistent usage the rule of thumb that a term generally means the same thing each time it is used.although the presumption is most commonly applied to terms appearing in the same enactment,ibp,alvarez,it is equally relevant when congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes,smith city of jackson,plurality opinion see also northcross board of ed.of memphis city schools,per curiam.this case is a textbook candidate for application of the branch of the rule.the physical force clauses at issue here and in johnson are worded in nearly identical fashion the former defines a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as an offense that has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force,a a ii,while the latter defines a violent felony as an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,e b i.and both statutes are designed to promote public safety by deterring a class of criminals from possessing firearms.
respondent arguments fail to overcome the presumption of consistent usage.in respondent view,physical force can not mean any force that produces any pain or bodily injury,brief for respondent,because a a ii defines a violent crime and one can inflict all sorts of minor injuries bruises,paper cuts,by engaging in nonviolent behavior.respondent therefore reasons that a a ii requires force capable of inflicting serious bodily injury.that requirement is more demanding than both of the plausible meanings of physical force we identified in johnson offensive touching which johnson rejected and force capable of causing physical pain or injury,serious or otherwise.see,at.it would be surpassing strange to read a statute defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as requiring greater force than the similarly worded statute in johnson,which defined a violent felony,and respondent does not make a convincing case for taking that extraordinary step.
for these reasons,i would give physical force the same meaning in a a ii as in johnson.the rest of the analysis is straightforward.because intentionally or knowingly caus ing bodily injury,app,categorically involves the use of force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,at,respondent conviction qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under g i would reverse the judgment below on that basis and remand for further proceedings.
unfortunately,the court bypasses that narrower interpretation of a a ii in favor of a much broader one that treats any offensive touching,no matter how slight,as sufficient.that expansive definition can not be squared with relevant precedent or statutory text.
we have twice addressed the meaning of physical force in the context of provisions that define a class of violent crimes.both times,we concluded that physical force means violent force.in johnson,we thought it clear that in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony,the phrase physical force means violent force.at.and we held that offensive touching the same type of force the court today holds does constitute physical force is not sufficiently violent to satisfy the armed career criminal act physical force requirement.see,at.our analysis in johnson was premised in large part on our earlier interpretation of the generic federal crime of violence statute.in leocal ashcroft,we observed that a which defines a crime of violence as an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another comprehends a category of violent,active crimes.the textual similarity between a a ii physical force clause and the clauses at issue in johnson and leocal thus raises the question why should the same meaning not apply here 
the court gives four responses that merit discussion,none of which withstands scrutiny.first,the court invokes the settled principle of interpretation that,absent other indication,congress intends to incorporate the meaning of the terms it uses.ante,at quoting sekhar united states,slip,at.that principle is of limited relevance,since the presumption of consistent statutory meaning is precisely other indication that a a ii does not incorporate the meaning.anyway,a more accurate formulation of the principle cited by the court is that when a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source,whether the common law or other legislation,it brings the old soil with it.sekhar,supra,at slip,at quoting frankfurter,some reflections on the reading of statutes,colum,emphasis added.section a a ii was enacted after the statutes involved in johnson and leocal and its physical force clause is quite obviously modeled on theirs.
second,the court asserts that any interpretation of physical force that excludes offensive touching would have rendered g inoperative in many states at the time of its enactment.ante,at.but there is no interpretive principle to the effect that statutes must be given their broadest possible application,and g without offensive touching would have had application in of the states.although domestic violence was routinely prosecuted under misdemeanor assault or battery statutes when congress enacted g,united states hayes,and such statutes generally prohibited both offensive touching and the causation of bodily injury or only the latter,ante,at,it does not follow that interpreting physical force to mean violent force would have rendered g a practical nullity.to the contrary,g would have worked perfectly well in of the states that had misdemeanor assault or battery statutes at the time of g enactment.at that point,states had statutes that covered infliction of bodily injury but not offensive touching and more had statutes that prohibited both of types of conduct,but did so in a divisible manner thus making it possible to identify the basis for a conviction by inspecting charging documents and similar materials,see descamps united states,slip,at that leaves only states whose misdemeanor assault or battery statutes prohibited offensive touching,and were framed in such a way that offensive touching was indivisible from physical violence the fact that g would not have applied immediately in states is hardly enough to trigger the presumption against ineffectiveness the idea that congress presumably does not enact useless laws.compare hayes,supra,at rejecting an interpretation that supposedly would have rendered g a dead letter in some of the states i think it far more plausible that congress enacted a statute that covered convictions in of the states,and left it to the handful of nonconforming states to change their laws as some have,than that congress adopted a meaning of domestic violence that included the slightest unwanted touching.
third,the court seizes on the one and only meaningful distinction between a a ii and the other provisions referred to above that it defines a violent misdemeanor rather than a violent felony or an undifferentiated crime of violence.ante,at.we properly take account of the term being defined when interpreting an unclear definitional phrase.united states stevens,but see babbitt sweet home chapter,comm
