opinion of the court 
appellees maureen and john mirabella petitioned their local government for assistance in a dispute with their neighbors and,at the same time,threatened the local government with litigation.a local official responded,via email,by barring the mirabellas from communicating directly with any members of the local government,other than its counsel.local officials also threatened to move for sanctions against the mirabellas for frivolous litigation if they filed suit.
the mirabellas allege that the government officials violated their first amendment rights in two ways by retaliating against the mirabellas for the exercise of their first amendment rights and by violating the mirabellas first amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances.as to these claims,the district court denied the defendants motions to dismiss and denied qualified immunity.the government officials now appeal on qualified immunity grounds.for the reasons below,we conclude that the mirabellas have adequately alleged both a retaliation claim and a violation of their right to petition.the rights allegedly violated,however,were not clearly established for the purpose of qualified immunity.therefore,we are constrained to reverse.
this case arises out of a dispute between the mirabellas and their neighbors regarding a public wetlands abutting their properties.the wetlands is owned by montgomery township,pennsylvania.the mirabellas allege that their neighbors extended their backyards into the public wetlands by attempting to fence in the open space,placing playground equipment there and landscaping it.
the mirabellas complained to the township,which removed the fence,required the neighbors to move their playground equipment and initially required the neighbors to stop landscaping the open space.nevertheless,the mirabellas allege,the neighbors continued to cut and clear the open space using driving mowers,weed whackers,push mowers,chainsaws and other means.app.the mirabellas continued to complain about this,but the township ultimately reversed course and gave the neighbors permission to mow the open space.
the mirabellas viewed the township response as overly permissive and environmentally destructive.for these reasons,the mirabellas who are both attorneys notified the township board of supervisors by email that they intended to sue their neighbors for encroachment and destruction of the open space.app.the mirabellas protested the board failure to protect our natural open spaces,which put them in the position of having to sue neighbors in order to see that our environment is preserved.id.the mirabellas further stated that as the owner of the open space,the township will be an indispensable party in this litigation.id.walsh and mcdonnell interpreted this as a threat that the mirabellas would sue the township.
on the same day the mirabellas ostensibly threatened litigation,the township responded.appellant joseph walsh,chairperson of the board of supervisors,wrote to the montgomery township solicitor and copied the mirabellas.walsh wrote that i f the township is sued by the mirabellas make sure our insurance counsel motions the court for sanctions as they have no standing to file such a frivolous action.app.another member of the board of supervisors,appellant jeffrey mcdonnell,concurred later that evening.he wrote i agree.i would also suggest our attorney put them on notice now that we will seek san c tions so there no surprise.app.
john mirabella replied within minutes defending the potential lawsuit as.he requested that the board of supervisors provide any legal authority to support the board decision and your claim that we do not have standing.app.
later that night,at,walsh replied from his iphone.walsh email later an impetus for the mirabellas first amendment claims stated 
dear mr.mirabella and his wife attorney.please direct all further communications to the township attorney.please never contact me,the board of supervisors or the township employees directly.do not call me at work,email me at work or speak to me in public or private.the dye is caste sic.
app.emphasis added.walsh copied this no contact email to numerous township officials,including the board of supervisors,township manager,planning and zoning director and members of the police department.
thereafter,the mirabellas attended one meeting of the board of supervisors,at which they allegedly protested the destruction of the open space and expressed their dismay and anger over walsh and mcdonnell emails.app.
the mirabellas filed this lawsuit under,alleging,inter alia,violations of their first amendment rights.the defendants filed motions to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,in which they asserted a qualified immunity defense.the district court dismissed all of the mirabellas claims except for certain first amendment claims against walsh and mcdonnell.
in its opinion,the district court construed the mirabellas surviving first amendment claims as alleging two violations retaliation against the mirabellas for the exercise of their first amendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances and a direct violation of the mirabellas first amendment right to petition the government.as to both claims,the district court found that the mirabellas had pled a constitutional violation.the district court denied qualified immunity via a very brief analysis.walsh and mcdonnell now appeal,alleging that they are entitled to qualified immunity on both claims.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the district court denial of qualified immunity under and the collateral order doctrine.sch.dist.of,cir.the qualified immunity issue before us is solely a question of law and is,therefore,immediately appealable as a final order.zaloga borough of moosic,cir.we exercise plenary review,at.as this is an appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss,we accept the allegations in the complaint as true.mammaro new jersey div.of child prot.permanency,cir.
qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.ashcroft,citation omitted.a government official conduct violates clearly established law when,at the time of the challenged conduct,t he contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.id.at alterations in original quoting anderson creighton.
to determine if a right is clearly established,we first look for supreme court precedent.mammaro,at.if there is none,we may rely on a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority in the court s of appeals.id.quoting taylor barkes,per curiam.a lthough earlier cases involving fundamentally similar facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,they are not necessary to such a finding,at quoting hope pelzer.
we exercise our discretion to decide which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis to address first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.pearson callahan.for reasons of constitutional avoidance,we may begin by determining whether a right was clearly established.camreta greene.yet in other cases following the sequence defining constitutional rights and only then conferring immunity is sometimes beneficial to clarify the legal standards governing public officials.id.at.
in the mirabellas case,we exercise our discretion to follow the sequence.we do so in order to guide local officials in safeguarding the first amendment rights of constituents in challenging circumstances when the government constituents are also litigation adversaries.see am.canoe ass n,city of albans,supp.observing that the g overnment remains the servant of the people,even when citizens are litigating against it.
the mirabellas allege in the first of two claims on appeal that local officials walsh and mcdonnell retaliated against them for the exercise of their first amendment rights.we conclude that the mirabellas have pled a retaliation claim based upon walsh no contact email,but not walsh and mcdonnell threat that they would move for litigation sanctions.as to the second prong of qualified immunity,we conclude that the right was not clearly established.
official reprisal for protected speech offends the constitution because it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right.hartman moore,citation omitted.to plead retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights,a plaintiff must allege constitutionally protected conduct,retaliatory action sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights,and a causal link between the constitutionally protected conduct and the retaliatory action.thomas indep,cir.citation omitted see also mack warden loretto fci,cir.applying this test to a claim of retaliation for the exercise of the right to petition.
the first element of the mirabellas retaliation claim is straightforward.the parties do not dispute that the mirabellas exercised their first amendment rights both their right to free speech and their right to petition the government for redress of grievances.the mirabellas engaged in constitutionally protected speech and petitioning when they protested the township failure to protect the open space and threatened litigation.both the free speech clause and the petition clause protect personal expression both expression generally and expression directed towards the government for the specific purpose of asking it to right a wrong.mack,at 
as to the second element of the retaliation claim,the parties dispute whether there was a retaliatory act sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness.thomas,at.we conclude that walsh no contact email met this standard,but that walsh and mcdonnell threat that they would move for litigation sanctions did not 
as a preliminary matter,we reject walsh and mcdonnell argument that the second element can not be satisfied because the mirabellas were undeterred in the exercise of their constitutional rights and,for example,attended one meeting of the board of supervisors after walsh sent the no contact email.this argument fails because whether an act is retaliatory is an objective question.bistrian levi,cir.we ask whether the act would deter a person of ordinary firmness,not whether the plaintiff was deterred.there is good reason for such a rule we will not reward government officials for picking on unusually hardy speakers.at the same time,we recognize that government officials should not be liable when the plaintiff is unreasonably bennett hendrix,cir.citation omitted.we now consider the two retaliatory acts alleged.
the first allegedly retaliatory act is walsh no contact email.in this email,walsh prohibited the mirabellas from contacting government employees,as follows please direct all further communications to the township attorney.please never contact me,the board of supervisors or the township employees directly.do not call me at work,email me at work or speak to me in public or private.the dye is caste sic.app.construing all inferences in favor of the mirabellas,we agree with the district court that this email is significantly more than a direction to contact the town attorney regarding the threatened lawsuit.this is a complete prohibition against plaintiffs contacting town officials and employees for any reason.app.in short,walsh barred the mirabellas from communicating directly with their local government,for any reason,indefinitely.this prohibition was sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his constitutional rights.thomas,at.
in concluding that walsh no contact email was retaliatory,we draw upon and distinguish a similar first amendment retaliation case decided by the second circuit.in tuccio marconi,a real estate developer filed a lawsuit against a town where he sought to do business,cir.because of this pending lawsuit,town officials refused to meet with the developer in person,and advised him to communicate with them in writing.the developer then filed a second lawsuit,alleging that the town officials refusal to meet with him was retaliatory.after a trial on the retaliation claim,judgment was entered for the town and the second circuit affirmed.the second circuit held that the town decision not to meet with the developer a litigation adversary was not a retaliatory act.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,tuccio emphasized that the developer had no business with the town other than the lawsuit.id.at.tuccio further explained that the result might be different if the prohibition had been implemented in a manner that effectively denied tuccio access to permits or opportunities to do business with the town,but that the trial record demonstrated that this had not occurred.id.
the result is different in the mirabellas case,because unlike the developer in tuccio,the mirabellas have alleged business with their local government.id.the mirabellas live in montgomery township and have alleged a myriad of interests,for which they may petition the township.walsh email bars the mirabellas from communicating with township employees about any topic,not only the threatened litigation,as to which limits on communication might have been prudent.id.at.thus,we conclude that walsh no contact email was a retaliatory act 
the mirabellas also allege that both walsh and mcdonnell retaliated against them by stating that if the mirabellas sued the township,the township would move for sanctions for frivolous litigation.significantly,this alleged act of retaliation is a particular kind one taking the form of the official own speech.mclaughlin watson,cir.quoting suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir.see also zaloga,at.in such circumstances we employ a more specific test to determine whether the official speech amounts to a retaliatory act.we ask whether there was a threat,coercion,or intimidation,intimating that punishment,sanction,or adverse regulatory action will follow.mclaughlin,at quoting suarez,at.
this standard is not met by walsh and mcdonnell statements that if the mirabellas sued the township,they would move a court for sanctions.in such statements,the quantum of governmental authority brought to bear was minimal.maxwell borough of new hope,cir.see also novoselsky brown,cir.holding that there was no retaliatory act where government official filed an attorney disciplinary complaint against the plaintiff and publicly accused him of litigiousness.as such,the mirabellas retaliation claim must succeed,if at all,on walsh no contact email,not the threat of motioning for litigation sanctions.
the third element of a retaliation claim requires a causal link between a plaintiff constitutionally protected activity and the retaliatory act.thomas,at.the required link is causation.hartman,at.a ny plaintiff charging official retaliatory action must prove the elements of retaliatory animus as the cause of injury,and the defendant will have the opportunity to respond to a prima facie case by showing that the action would have been taken anyway,independently of any retaliatory animus.id.at.one method of proving a causal link,applicable here,is unusually suggestive temporal proximity.lauren deflaminis,cir.the mirabellas have alleged such a causal link.on the very same day that the mirabellas emailed the township to protest its treatment of the open space,and to threaten litigation,walsh responded with the no contact email 
although this would normally be enough to carry a complaint across the starting line in the face of a rule b motion,we must address one.maloy,cir.walsh argues that there is another explanation that is so obviously correct as to render the charge of improper motivation implausible.id.citation omitted see also george rehiel,cir.holding that there was an alternative explanation airline security that was obvious on the fact of the complaint.specifically,walsh contends that his email was merely a demand that the mirabellas both attorneys follow the no contact rule of the pennsylvania rules of professional conduct.this argument fails because walsh prohibition swept far more broadly than the rule.
rule of the rules of professional conduct provides that a lawyer,representing a client,shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.this prohibition is narrower than walsh no contact email,for at least three reasons rule is limited to the subject of the representation is limited to a person represented by counsel in the matter and contains an authorized by law exception,which safeguards expression.see also,cmt.walsh no contact email contained none of these three limitations 
thus,we reject walsh attempt to justify his email by reference to rule.the mirabellas have pled causation,the final element of their first amendment retaliation claim.
having held that the mirabellas adequately alleged a first amendment retaliation claim based upon walsh no contact email,our inquiry is not complete.we must nevertheless determine whether the right was clearly established under the second prong of qualified immunity.
in this analysis we are mindful that we must not define clearly established law at a high level of generality,at.more specifically,the supreme court has given us guidance on defining a right in the first amendment retaliation context.in reichle howards,the supreme court clarified that it is too broad to define the right as the right to be free from retaliation for one speech.conversely,reichle held that is proper to define a right as the right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable cause.id.
reichle is directly applicable to the mirabellas retaliation claim.as in reichle,the disputed issue here is whether it was clearly established that the defendant act was retaliatory paralleling reichle,we define the right at issue as the right to be free from a retaliatory restriction on communication with one government,when the plaintiff has threatened or engaged in litigation against the government.
this right was not clearly established when walsh sent the no contact email.the mirabellas have identified neither supreme court precedent nor a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority.mammaro,at citation omitted.the closest case we have identified,tuccio,held that the refusal of town officials to meet with a litigation adversary did not amount to first amendment retaliation.tuccio,at.thus,walsh is entitled to qualified immunity on the mirabellas first amendment retaliation claim.
the mirabellas also assert a direct violation of their first amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances,again based upon walsh no contact email.we conclude that the mirabellas have pled a constitutional violation,but that the right was not clearly established for qualified immunity purposes.
the first amendment of the united states constitution provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances.const.amend.i.these two guarantees are known,respectively,as the speech clause and the petition clause.
the right to petition the government is one of the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the bill of rights.be k constr.nlrb,quoting united mine workers of,dist.state bar ass n.the very idea of a government,republican in form,implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.united states cruikshank.petitioning serves numerous,fundamental interests of petitioners and the government alike.it is essential to freedom,liberty and.borough of duryea guarnieri,see also mcdonald smith.petitions contribute to the public airing of disputes,the evolution of the law,and the use of government as an alternative to force.be k,at.
in borough of duryea guarnieri,the supreme court recently renewed its petition clause jurisprudence,with a focus on the historical underpinnings of the right.at see also ronald krotoszynski,reclaiming the petition clause chronicling the history of petitioning in the united states,including its importance in the abolitionist movement.the supreme court described the special concerns of the petition clause,as compared to the speech clause,as follows the right to petition allows citizens to express their ideas,hopes,and concerns to their government and their elected representatives,whereas the right to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is integral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole realm of ideas and human affairs.id.at emphasis added.
a petition may undoubtedly consist of a personal grievance addressed to the government.id.at.but p etitions to the government assume an added dimension when they seek to advance political,social,or other ideas of interest to the community as a whole.id.at.a petition need not take a specific form,and may include an oral grievance.mack,at citation omitted.
a petition enjoys constitutional protection whether it is addressed,as here,to a local government,or to a state or national government.see,naacp claiborne hardware,petition and boycott directed at county officials brown louisiana,protest of segregated public library holzemer city of memphis,cir.oral request to city councilperson van deelen johnson,cir.appeal of county property tax assessment.a petition may be directed towards any department of government,including the courts.guarnieri,at be k,at see also anderson davila,at holding that the right to petition includes actions taken in anticipation of litigation.
at the same time,the right to petition is not u nrestrained,guarnieri,at,or absolute,mcdonald,at.for example,the supreme court has held that petitions to the president that contain intentional and reckless falsehoods do not enjoy constitutional protection.mcdonald,at citation omitted.accordingly,we may ask whether the government may nevertheless burden the right to petition,given countervailing government interests.be k,at.
to balance such competing interests,courts have generally applied speech clause precedent,rather than any freestanding petition clause doctrine guarnieri,at acknowledging this trend see also galena leone,cir.considering speech and petition claims as one eichenlaub twp.of indiana,cir.same.but guarnieri clarified that we can not do so automatically.for while the right to petition and the right to free speech share substantial common ground,they are not identical in their mandate or their purpose and effect.guarnieri,at.accordingly,the supreme court cautioned that speech clause precedents do not necessarily and in every case resolve petition clause claims.id.despite this guidance,however,guarnieri did apply speech clause precedent,rather than forge new ground under the petition clause.id.at.
with this background in mind,we turn to the mirabellas claim that walsh violated their right to petition by prohibiting them from contacting any township employees,other than its counsel.to answer this question,we will apply free speech precedent,as the supreme court did in guarnieri.id.we conclude that this is appropriate given the extensive common ground of the two rights,and the supreme court own example.id.at.as such,our analysis would be identical if the mirabellas had framed their argument as a free speech claim,rather than a violation of their right to petition the government.
drawing upon free speech precedent,the mirabellas encourage us to apply a test that is highly deferential to their first amendment rights,on at least two theories.first,the mirabellas assert that walsh email is a restriction on their speech.for the advancement of multijurisdiction practice naamjp castille,cir.explaining that restrictions on speech are subject to heightened scrutiny when they reflect preferences.second,the mirabellas assert that walsh email is a restriction on their political speech.see citizens united fec.
we decline to determine whether these theories apply.rather,we will assume for the sake of argument that walsh no contact email is a,time,place or
