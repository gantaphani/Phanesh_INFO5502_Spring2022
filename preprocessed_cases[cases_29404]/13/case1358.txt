the state has long had the power to forfeit property used for criminal purposes,but the power pedigree does not excuse the city of new york continued use of antiquated rules to govern its exercise.where the federal government once sought to seize distilleries without a hearing because its need for funds was urgent,springer united states,the city now seeks to preclude ford motor credit company ford motor credit from participating in forfeiture proceedings because the city is in no hurry.this it may not do.we therefore affirm the district court considered judgment in all respects.
background 
city of new york has authorized its police department to seize any motor vehicle that is suspected of having been used as a means of committing crime or employed in aid or furtherance of crime,city admin.code b,as the first step toward obtaining title to the vehicle through civil forfeiture,krimstock kelly krimstock i,cir.shortly after the city seizes a vehicle,and after affording notice of the seizure to various interested parties,including in many cases the holder of a security interest in the vehicle,the vehicle owner or driver is given an opportunity to test the probable validity of the city deprivation of the vehicle pending adjudication of the city forfeiture case.krimstock i,at.if the city also wishes to retain the vehicle as arrest evidence or trial evidence pending conclusion of a criminal proceeding,see krimstock kelly krimstock iii cir,it may do so,see krimstock iii,at city admin.code g a.
after what is now termed a krimstock hearing,if the city can justify the continued retention of a seized vehicle,either because it is likely to prevail in the eventual forfeiture action or because it wishes to retain the vehicle as evidence against the owner or driver,it generally does not press further for forfeiture until the district attorney office notifies the city that a criminal case against the vehicle owner or driver will not be brought or has been concluded d providing a method for obtaining a district attorney release county of nassau canavan,discussing a similar nassau county ordinance and noting that the forfeiture action may not be finally resolved for many months or years,particularly because upon motion of the county,the action must be stayed during the pendency of the underlying criminal case.at that point,a claimant may demand a seized vehicle return.see.the term claimant shall mean only the person from whose person or possession the vehicle was taken or obtained.id.if no claimant demands the vehicle return within days of the conclusion of the criminal case,t he vehicle may be disposed of by the police property clerk at his leisure.id.e ii id.c providing that a demand is only timely if made within days after the termination of criminal proceedings.
if,on the other hand,a claimant demands the vehicle return,the city must institute a forfeiture action within days.id.a while only the vehicle owner driver is a claimant,see id,any party,including a lienholder,is not a lawful claimant if associated with criminal conduct involving use of the vehicle and thereby precluded from recovering the vehicle,see city admin.code e one who suffered his vehicle to be used in committing a crime is not a lawful claimant id.one who derives his or her claim in any manner from someone who is not a lawful claimant is also not a lawful claimant krimstock i,at nn.the city must afford all claimants and any other interested persons notice of and an opportunity to be heard in the forfeiture proceeding.see b.however,only a lawful claimant is entitled to the return of a vehicle seized by the police 
if the city can show by a preponderance of the evidence that it is entitled to forfeit the vehicle,see it is connected with criminal activity,thus precluding the existence of a lawful claimant to the may sell the vehicle at auction.if a third party has a security interest in the vehicle,the city will remit ninety percent of the auction proceeds to that party.ford motor credit city police dep t,d.however,in order to obtain these funds,that person must submit an auction proceeds claim form and execute a general release with indemnification agreement.id.
the forfeiture seizure to considerable time.see id.at in some instances,the property clerk held vehicles for extended periods of time without instituting forfeiture proceedings or selling vehicles as abandoned see also prop.clerk duck jae lee,misc d.during that time,the value of a seized vehicle often decreases considerably.krimstock i,at l oss is felt as a vehicle continues to depreciate in value as it stands idle in the police lot.
ford motor credit levies a barrage of challenges to the rules governing forfeiture proceedings.ford motor credit principally complains that the city has refused to consider secured creditors as claimants or their analogue although they are in many cases not lawful claimants thus precluding them from triggering the city duty to initiate a forfeiture action within days and that the city has refused to consider secured creditors as interested persons entitled to notice of and an opportunity to be heard in forfeiture proceedings.citing mathews eldridge,d,ford motor credit argues that by refusing to permit it to expedite and participate in the forfeiture process,the city has deprived it of property without due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment.the district court for the southern district of new york sidney stein,judge entered summary judgment in ford motor credit favor on these claims it held that i ford credit is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard in any forfeiture action commenced by the city concerning a vehicle in which ford credit holds a valid security interest and ii the city must commence a forfeiture action within a reasonable time upon a demand for a seized vehicle from ford credit when ford credit holds a valid security interest in that vehicle.ford motor credit,d at.the city appealed,and we now affirm.
application of the due process clause 
in adjudicating due process claims,we consider two distinct issues whether plaintiffs possess a liberty or property interest protected by the due process clause and,if so,whether existing state procedures are constitutionally adequate.kapps wing,cir.the city relies on several cases to argue that ford motor credit lacks a property interest in a seized vehicle distinct from its interest in ninety percent of the proceeds from its eventual,sale supplemented,to be sure,by any deficiency judgment ford motor credit may obtain against the vehicle owner.see,prop.clerk molomo,ford ha s no present possessory right in the vehicle,and its remedy is to receive the proceeds from the city forfeiture sale and to seek any deficiency against the debtor.prop.clerk foley,same prop.clerk aquino,we disagree that ford motor credit only cognizable property interest is in a vehicle sale proceeds.for the three reasons that follow,we conclude that ford motor credit also has a property interest in the present value of a seized vehicle.
first,a security interest is indisputably a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.see,mennonite bd.of missions adams,d united states trails way,cir united states,cir.a secured creditor has two rights the contractual right to repayment of the debt owed and the property right to the collateral that secures the debt in the event of.see armstrong united states,d.thus,while ford motor credit may conceivably protect its contractual right to repayment by seeking ninety percent of the proceeds from a vehicle sale,the city delays impair ford motor credit property right,which is in the collateral seized vehicle.armstrong,at.holding that a valid takings clause claim lay where plaintiffs liens remained in effect but were unenforceable against the collateral following forfeiture see also matagorda county law,cir unmitigated delay,coupled with diminishment of distinct expectations,may,at some point,infringe on the entire bundle of rights emphasis omitted.just as in winston city of new york,where we held that teachers had a property interest in the present value of their pensions,so too,ford motor credit has a property
