this appeal raises a issue that was expressly anticipated in ricci destefano,and which has arisen in the aftermath of that case.
the city of new haven and the new haven civil service board csb,which administer the city firefighter promotion exams,had been concerned that white candidates had outperformed minority candidates on the exams.the city feared that certifying the results would trigger liability under title vii.after several tense public hearings concerning certification,the csb ultimately discarded the results.
in ricci,eighteen firefighters seventeen white and one hispanic alleged that the csb refusal to certify the results constituted disparate treatment under title vii.at.the supreme court agreed,notwithstanding the city countervailing concern about liability.such concern,the court held,can excuse an otherwise impermissible action only if supported by a strong basis in evidence that the employer would have faced liability had it acted otherwise.id.at.
unusually,the court reversed the challenged judgment rather than vacating it,which prevented the city from adducing evidence to satisfy the newly imposed strong basis standard.instead,the city was ordered to certify the results.id.at.presciently,the court anticipated a challenge to the city compliance with the order 
our holding today clarifies how title vii applies to resolve competing expectations under the and provisions.if,after it certifies the test results,the city faces a suit,then in light of our holding today it should be clear that the city would avoid liability based on the strong basis in evidence that,had it not certified the results,it would have been subject to liability.
briscoe brings the anticipated lawsuit,alleging that the weighting of the written and oral sections of the test and,respectively,as dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the city and the firefighters union,id.at was arbitrary and unrelated to job requirements.he asserts that the industry norm for such weighting was oral under that scoring,he was promotable.he seeks primarily to enjoin the city from using the weighting,and eligibility for promotion to lieutenant with retroactive pay and seniority,without displacing any of the ricci plaintiffs who were promoted.
the city argued in the district court that the supreme court decision in ricci precludes the plaintiff title vii claim.def.mot.to dis.at.the court apparently agreed,granting the city motion to dismiss on preclusion grounds 
what the court held in ricci and what it said in doing so squarely forecloses briscoe claims.the supreme court remanded ricci with directions that the exam results be certified.that has been done and promotions have been made accordingly.briscoe can not now raise a disparate impact claim with respect to those same exam results.
briscoe city of new haven,cv,dist.lexis,at.july.the court acknowledged that its ruling may deny briscoe his day in court,but felt obliged to effect its interpretation of the supreme court mandate 
if,as he contends,briscoe is denied his day in court or is bound by a decision in a case to which he was not a party,it is because the supreme court decided as much,and this court is bound by the decisions of the high court.
id.at.had briscoe wished to protect his rights,the court reasoned,he should have timely intervened in ricci id.at.
curiously,the city now rejects the preclusion theory it argued in the district court.appellee br.at the only one raising claim preclusion is briscoe.the amended complaint was dismissed not because it was legally precluded but because disparate treatment liability was already found.footnote added.it argues instead that ricci strong basis in evidence test for a claim applies equally to a claim id.at.based on that premise,the city argues that it had a strong basis in evidence that it was facing liability.id.at.the evidence cited by the city is the ricci decision itself,id.at,in which the court concluded that failing to certify the exam results constituted under title vii.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of an action under.b for failure to state a claim.selevan thruway,cir.we consider the preclusion and ricci arguments in turn.
the district court ascribed preclusive effect to the sentence in ricci that predicted a claim,even though the wording did not expressly invoke preclusion.the district court theory is inconsistent with principles of nonparty preclusion.
the general principle in anglo american jurisprudence is that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.hansberry lee.the law therefore avoids impos ing upon any person absolutely entitled to a hearing the burden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a stranger.chase bank norwalk.
though hardly in doubt,th is rule against nonparty preclusion is subject to exceptions.taylor sturgell.taylor enumerated the six recognized categories of nonparty preclusion,id.at,but rejected in that case an exception for instances of virtual representation.we therefore consult these six categories the preclusive effects of a judgment in a case decided by a federal court should be determined according to the established grounds for nonparty preclusion described in taylor.id.at.the city does not cite taylor,and does not argue that this case fits any of the recognized exceptions.in any event,it does not 
first,briscoe did not agree to be bound by the determination of the issues in ricci.second,no preexisting substantive legal relationship existed between the city and briscoe that is akin to a bailee and bailor or assignee and assignor.third,briscoe was not adequately represented by the city in ricci,because their interests are widely divergent.fourth,briscoe did not assume control over the ricci litigation,or have the opportunity to present proofs and argument.fifth,briscoe is not avoiding preclusive force by relitigating through a proxy.sixth,no special statutory scheme such as bankruptcy or probate is present.even if title vii is considered a special statutory scheme,the city has not complied with the statute preclusion provision,as discussed below.see taylor,at.
the unavailability of nonparty preclusion is a recurring problem in title vii litigation.in martin wilks,a group of white firefighters challenged the city of birmingham acquiescence to a series of consent decrees that settled a title vii lawsuit,brought by the naacp and several black firefighters,alleging racially discriminatory hiring practices.id.at.the consent decrees set forth an extensive remedial scheme,including annual and goals for hiring black firefighters.id.at.when the city altered its hiring practices accordingly,the plaintiffs in martin alleged that the city compliance with the decrees amounted to discriminatory treatment under title vii,id.at the city argued that the suit was an impermissible collateral attack on the decrees.id.at.
underscoring the historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court,the supreme court held that the consent decrees were not preclusive because the plaintiffs were not parties to the original action.id.at,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.rejecting the city argument that the white firefighters should have protected their rights by intervening in the original suit,the court ruled that a party seeking a judgment binding on another can not obligate that person to intervene he must be joined.id.at.the court placed the burden on the parties of a lawsuit who presumably know better than anyone else the nature and scope of relief sought in the action,and at whose expense such relief might be granted to bring in additional parties when necessary.id.at.
the martin court thus upheld the general rule that a person can not be deprived of his legal rights in a proceeding to which he is not a party.id.at.
in evident recognition that martin hindered the finality of title vii dispositions,congress created a way by which litigants can bind certain nonparties who would otherwise stay on the sidelines.see n.under n,an employment practice that implements and is within the scope of a title vii litigated or consent judgment or order may not be challenged by a person who had actual notice of the proposed judgment or order and a reasonable opportunity to present objections to such judgment or order by a future date certain.see n a,b i the intent of n is to protect valid decrees from subsequent attack by individuals who were fully apprised of their interest in litigation and given an opportunity to participate,but who declined that opportunity.cong.rec.
it can not be said that briscoe had a reasonable opportunity to present objections to the ricci judgment,within the meaning of n.the requirement for an opportunity to present objections by a future date certain suggests a formal process.compliance is therefore usually,if not always,secured through notice and a fairness hearing.see,brennan city bd.of,cir the parties moved the district court to hold a fairness hearing at which objections to the agreement would be heard.citing n sims montgomery cnty.comm n,d,t he notice and fairness hearing were sufficient under the civil rights act of.citing n.but there was no fairness hearing in ricci the defendants were awarded summary judgment by the district court,and the case was not revived until the supreme court mandated entry of judgment in favor of the ricci plaintiffs.
in any event,the city has abandoned the argument it made below that the ricci proceedings satisfied n.see appellee br.at neither martin nor n are relevant to the present case.section n therefore does not insulate the city certification of the test results.
for these reasons,under supreme court precedent,briscoe claim is not precluded by ricci notwithstanding briscoe knowledge that the proceedings were pending and his failure to timely intervene.we are skeptical that the court would use one sentence in ricci to silently revise preclusion principles that were unanimously reaffirmed just over a year before in taylor.
the city primary argument is for a broad,reading of ricci strong basis in evidence standard.the argument requires us to consider this standard for the first time 
the parties agree that ricci established a new standard for claims a claim is avoidable based on concerns about liability only if there was a strong basis in evidence of such liability.ricci.at.late in the opinion,however,the court contemplated the reverse scenario avoid ance of a suit 
if,after it certifies the test results,the city faces a suit,then in light of our holding today it should be clear that the city would avoid liability based on the strong basis in evidence that,had it not certified the results,it would have been subject to liability.
the city characterizes this one sentence of dicta as establishing a symmetrical companion to ricci earlier holding that an employer may avoid claims based on a strong basis in evidence of disparateimpact liability.that is,the city argues that an employer may defeat a claim if it had a strong basis in evidence that it would have been subject to disparatetreatment liability.the city argues that briscoe suit was properly dismissed not because it was precluded but because the supreme court ricci mandate itself supplied the strong basis in evidence of liability for not certifying the results.
the dicta contemplating a standard symmetrical to the standard established in the holding is perhaps attributable to a simple logical error.the sentence does not present a holding but rather a apparent logical truth derived from the holding i n light of our holding today it should be clear that the city would avoid liability based on the strong basis in evidence that,had it not certified the results,it would have been subject to liability.at emphasis added.when simplified into a conditional statement,this conclusion resembles the converse of and shares some of the language from the only express holding in ricci.at we hold only that,under title vii,before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact,the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to liability if it fails to take the,discriminatory action,but it has no actual logical relationship to the holding.
in any event,we see no way to reconcile the dicta,on which the city argument relies,with either the court actual holding in ricci or,fundamental principles of title vii law 
first,all other indications in the opinion are of a holding limited to formulation of a standard for disparatetreatment liability 
we hold only that,under title vii,before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact,the employer must have a strong basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to liability if it fails to take the,discriminatory action.
id.at emphasis added.the city argument finds arguable support in wording that leads up to this holding set out in the margin but the context discusses r estricting an employer ability to discard test results and is thus limited to the express holding in any event,the court precise formulation of its holding corroborated elsewhere in the majority opinion and by concurring and dissenting supersedes any dicta arguably to the contrary.
second,the question that ricci answers for claims has already been answered for claims of disparate impact.clarification was needed,which ricci supplied,as to when an act that would otherwise trigger liability is excusable due to concern over disparate impact.this is because the subsection that governs claims,a,provides no clarification as to what informs the discriminatory intent or motive analysis.see watson fort worth bank trust.but the corresponding question for a claim when an employment practice that would otherwise trigger liability is excusable due to concern over disparate treatment is answered by the statutory definition of the claim conduct that is job related and consistent with business necessity is permissible even if it causes a disparate impact unless there is an alternative employment practice that would reduce the disparate impact,which the employer refuses to adopt.k.there is no need to stretch ricci to muddle that which is already clear.
third and relatedly,these parameters are statutory unlike the contours of a claim,which are predominantly supplied by case law.we would expect that any holding that is meant to shape the contours of a claim would cite and quote the statute,and discuss the interplay between the text and the new principle.we would also expect the pronounced that has accompanied previous revisions of settled principles.see,e,wards cove packing atonio.
fourth,it is difficult to see how a strong basis in evidence can be established for a claim.the city avoids the issue by the narrow argument that a court judgment satisfies this burden but it fails to consider what would suffice other than a court mandate.and the city argument,framed that way,differs little from nonparty preclusion,which is plagued by the issues discussed above.yet it is hard to see how one can adduce a strong basis in evidence that oneself will later act with discriminatory intent or motive.see watson,at.showings other than a court mandate are conceivable but they would be fiendishly complicated,and therefore unsuitable for a standard.in contrast,the strong basis in evidence standard that the majority opinion in ricci explicitly establishes to evaluate whether an employer can engage in disparate treatment employs the quantitative metrics of law.unlike liability,in which intent is a core consideration and for which consistent standards are simply impractical,liability involves quantitative metrics that resonate with an objective strong basis in evidence standard.see gulino state educ.dep t,cir.
fifth,the strong basis in evidence standard,which the majority opinion in ricci expressly applies to claims under title vii.at,was borrowed from equal protection case law that analyzed laws with classifications based on race,id.at see,richmond croson,and thus neatly extends to statutory claims for intentional discrimination.in contrast,neutral laws wi
