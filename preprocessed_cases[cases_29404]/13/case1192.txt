in response to the september,terrorist attacks the federal government initiated a classified operation known as the terrorist finance tracking program tftp.id.through the tftp,operated by the central intelligence agency cia and overseen by the united states treasury department treasury,the government was granted access to swift records by administrative subpoenas issued by the office of foreign asset control ofac.id.the information requested by the subpoenas allowed the government to search swift data for people and institutions suspected of having ties to terrorists.id.ex.
swift,however,was unable to comply with ofac initial subpoenas because it could not extract the particular information requested from its broad database.id.as a consequence,and notwithstanding that swift was aware the government was seeking access only to information indicating ties to terrorism,swift offered to give the government all the data.id.this prompted negotiations concerning the appropriate scope of the disclosure of swift data and the extent that privacy safeguards should be implemented to protect the rights of swift customers.id.ex.a,
over time the ofac narrowed the scope of the subpoenas,both with respect to the geographical areas targeted and the type of data requested,and safeguards were instituted to help ensure the data accessed by the government was indeed linked to matters legitimately the subject of terrorism investigations id.ex.a.while the tftp has allowed counterterrorism authorities to gain access to millions of records of transactions routed through swift,government investigators have used the data to do at least tens of thousands,maybe hundreds of thousands of searches of people and institutions suspected of having ties to terrorists.id.ex 
following its discovery of the tftp,filed its complaint in against three swift entities the united states treasury department,the cia,and eleven current or former federal officials.the complaint asserts claims against all defendants under the first and fourth amendments to the united states constitution and under the right to financial privacy act,as well as under state constitutions and various,consumer protection,and deceptive trade practices laws.additionally,the complaint alleges contract and claims against swift.in support of these claims the complaint contains three principal allegations first,amidax used the swift network to complete international financial transactions,compl.second,swift turned over its entire database to the government pursuant to the tftp,compl.and third,swift turned over records of amidax transactions to the government,compl.amidax attached a number of exhibits to the complaint,including two new york times articles dated june and june,that brought to light the tftp as well as a dvd of a press conference held by treasury on june,to explain the program.in response,swift and the federal defendants moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

after thus framing the standing issue and assuming for the purposes of the motion that amidax data was contained in the swift database,the district court concluded that the entirety of the complaint,including the exhibits attached thereto,fatally undermines the allegation that the government obtained the entire swift database.id.at.furthermore,the court concluded that amidax has not made any showing that the government is now,or ever was,in possession of its financial information.id.at.accordingly,the court held that because amidax complaint is premised upon conjecture and does not allege a concrete and particularized injury,amidax has failed to allege an injury in fact and therefore lacks standing to sue.id.the court subsequently denied amidax request to conduct jurisdictional discovery as well as its request for leave to amend its complaint.id.at.
on march,amidax filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure e and b and rule of the local rules of the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of new york,alleging several errors on the part of the district court.the court denied the motion on april,concluding,inter alia,that it did not err in declining to permit jurisdictional discovery because amidax mere speculation that it might have suffered a constitutional injury does not entitle it to obtain sensitive discovery from either swift or the government.amidax trading grp.scrl,civ,dist.lexis,at s.this appeal followed.
