this appeal raises three questions did the district court lose jurisdiction to award attorneys fees after the complaint had been dismissed and a notice of appeal filed was the defendants motion for attorneys fees timely and was the complaint so utterly lacking in merit as to be frivolous thereby justifying an award of attorneys fees to the defendants 
plaintiffs,holders of insurance policies,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,granting attorneys fees to the prevailing defendants,the metropolitan life insurance company and metlife,together,metlife.
plaintiffs sued metlife under,arguing that the conversion of metlife from a mutual to a stock life insurance company in accordance with new york insurance law violated numerous constitutional rights.the district court dismissed the case for failure to state a claim,and this court affirmed the dismissal.tancredi metro.life ins,d,aff,cir.metlife then moved for attorneys fees.the district court granted the motion,holding that plaintiffs claims were frivolous.tancredi metro.life ins,d.
we hold that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction to award attorneys fees.although we can not resolve on the record whether the district court properly considered metlife untimely motion for attorneys fees,we conclude that the district court misinterpreted the standard for extending the time to make a fee motion.on the merits,we conclude that the court abused its discretion by granting attorneys fees because the allegation of state action,although indeed meritless,was not frivolous.thus,we reverse the judgment granting attorneys fees to metlife.
background 
familiarity with the facts of this case,as set forth in our prior decision,tancredi metropolitan life insurance,cir,is assumed.we repeat only those facts relevant to this appeal.
in april,metropolitan life insurance company converted from an mutual to a modern stock insurance company pursuant to new york insurance law.the plan obviously affected policyholders interests in metlife,converting them to cash,policy credits,or stock in the new metlife,a delaware holding company.
the conversion was initiated by metlife board of directors,and it received the required approval of of the voting policyholders.it was also approved by the new york superintendent of insurance who found,after conducting a hearing,that the reorganization plan was fair and equitable to policyholders.indeed,percent of voting policyholders supported the plan.upon the superintendent approval,the conversion became effective in april.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiff policyholders bottomed their claim against metlife on the contention that the conversion violated their rights under the united states constitution takings clause,due process clause,and commerce and contracts clauses of article i.the complaint alleged that metlife acted under color of state law by receiving the official sanction of the superintendent of insurance and by reorganizing pursuant to new york insurance law.
metlife moved to dismiss under.b for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion,holding that tancredi and speidel failed to allege state action and,in the alternative,that their substantive constitutional claims lacked merit.tancredi,d at.the final judgment dismissing the action was entered on july.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on july.
as the prevailing party,metlife moved on august,for attorneys fees in the district court pursuant to b.this was seven days beyond the deadline set by.d b.metlife did not make a formal showing of excusable neglect under.b to justify the extension of time.on october,the district court denied the fee motion without prejudice to renewing the motion after the disposition of the appeal on the merits.the court conceded that metlife motion was untimely,but directed that a ny such renewed motion shall be filed no later than fourteen calendar days following the entry of the appellate mandate on this court,the district court docket.
on january,a panel of this court affirmed the district court dismissal,holding that metlife was not a state actor because mere approval or acquiescence of a state official does not sufficiently intertwine the official with corporate management to cloak the entire enterprise with state actor status.tancredi,at.this court issued a mandate on february,which was then entered on the docket of the district court on february.in accordance with the district court october,order,metlife renewed its motion for attorneys fees in the district court on march.metlife did not request attorneys fees for the appeal.
in opposing metlife renewed fee motion,plaintiffs argued that the district court lost jurisdiction over the initial fee motion when plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal even if there were jurisdiction,the initial motion was untimely,and metlife did not qualify for an extension of time and their complaint was not frivolous and thus did not justify an award of attorneys fees.
rejecting plaintiffs contentions,the district court granted metlife motion for attorneys fees.tancredi,d at.the court found that the filing of a notice of appeal did not divest the court of jurisdiction to consider fee awards.id.at.the court also held that the extension of time complied with rule and rule.id.at.specifically,the court held that under rule,district courts have discretion to fix the timing of attorneys fees motions,before or after the fourteen day period expires,without regard to rule b and its requirement of demonstrating excusable neglect.id.at.
on the substantive issue,judge kaplan observed that while he had never before granted attorneys fees to a prevailing defendant under,the frivolity of plaintiffs action was so patent that it abused the litigation system and warranted an award of fees.id.at.the court found the action to be frivolous i n view of the fact that proof of state action was an indispensable prerequisite to success and that there was no colorable basis for supposing that this prerequisite could be satisfied.id.
the precise calculation of fees was referred to magistrate judge francis.although metlife asked for,it was awarded only,based on plaintiffs ability to pay.
tancredi and speidel now appeal the judgment awarding to metlife.they raise the same arguments made in the district court.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
plaintiffs first argue that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over metlife attorneys fees motion because the underlying action failed under the substantiality doctrine and alternatively even if the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims,it lost jurisdiction after the dismissal of the complaint and the filing of a notice of appeal.we disagree.the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over metlife motion for attorneys fees.
substantiality doctrine 
under the substantiality doctrine,federal courts are without power to entertain claims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit.hagans lavine,d quoting newburyport water newburyport.claims are deemed insubstantial only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous previous decisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial.id.at.
turning this doctrine on its to their own contend that if the complaint was as frivolous as the district court found it,then the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the motion for attorneys fees.metlife responds that there is nothing in hagans to suggest that the supreme court intended to preclude an award of attorneys fees in cases where the district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
we reject plaintiffs argument.the district court and a prior panel of this court properly exercised jurisdiction over plaintiffs underlying complaint.tancredi metro.life ins,d,aff,cir.in dismissing,and affirming the dismissal of,plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim,both the district court and this court implicitly recognized subject matter jurisdiction.i
