respondent hoeper was a pilot for petitioner air wisconsin airlines.when air wisconsin stopped flying from hoeper home base on aircraft that he was certified to fly,he needed to become certified on a different type of aircraft to keep his job.after hoeper failed in his first three attempts to gain certification,air wisconsin agreed to give him a fourth and final chance.but he performed poorly during a required training session in a simulator.hoeper responded angrily to this failure raising his voice,tossing his headset,using profanity,and accusing the instructor of railroading the situation.
the instructor called an air wisconsin manager,who booked hoeper on a flight from the test location to hoeper home in denver.several hours later,the manager discussed hoeper behavior with other airline officials.the officials discussed hoeper outburst,his impending termination,the history of assaults by disgruntled airline employees,and the chance that because hoeper was a federal flight deck officer ffdo,permitted to carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation,f he might be armed.at the end of the meeting,an airline executive made the decision to notify the transportation security administration tsa of the situation.the manager who had received the initial report from hoeper instructor made the call to the tsa.during that call,according to the jury,he made two statements first,that hoeper was an ffdo who may be armed and that the airline was concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm and second,that an u nstable pilot in the ffdo program was terminated today.in response,the tsa removed hoeper from his plane,searched him,and questioned him about the location of his gun.hoeper eventually boarded a later flight to denver,and air wisconsin fired him the next day.
hoeper sued for defamation in colorado state court.air wisconsin moved for summary judgment and later for a directed verdict,relying on the aviation and transportation security act atsa,which grants airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior,a,except where such disclosure is made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false,inaccurate,or misleading or made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure,b.the trial court denied the motions and submitted the atsa immunity question to the jury.the jury found for hoeper on the defamation claim.the state supreme court affirmed.it held that the trial court erred in submitting the immunity question to the jury but that the error was harmless.laboring under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for atsa immunity if they are made recklessly,the court held that air wisconsin was not entitled to immunity because its statements to the tsa were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.
atsa immunity may not be denied to materially true statements.
a the atsa immunity exception is patterned after the actual malice standard of new york times sullivan,which requires material falsity.see,masson new yorker magazine.because the material falsity requirement was settled when the atsa was enacted,congress presumably meant to incorporate it into the atsa immunity exception and did not mean to deny atsa immunity to true statements made recklessly.this presumption is not rebutted by other indicia of statutory meaning.section b requires falsity,and b simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones.denying immunity for substantially true reports,on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth,would defeat the purpose of atsa immunity to ensure that air carriers and their employees do not hesitate to provide the tsa with needed information.
b hoeper arguments that the state supreme court judgment should be affirmed notwithstanding its misapprehension of atsa immunity standard are unpersuasive.hoeper claims that air wisconsin did not argue the truth of its statements in asserting immunity,but air wisconsin contended in the state court that atsa immunity exception incorporates the new york times actual malice standard,which requires material falsity.and the state supreme court did not perform the requisite analysis of material falsity in finding the record sufficient to support the defamation verdict.a court deferential review of jury findings can not substitute for its own analysis of the record the jury was instructed only to determine falsity,not materiality and applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to atsa immunity.
under the correct material falsity analysis,air wisconsin is entitled to immunity as a matter of law.
a in the defamation context,a materially false statement is one that would have a different effect on the mind of the reader or listener from that which the truth would have produced.masson,at.this standard suffices in the atsa context as well,so long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer.for purposes of atsa immunity,a falsehood can not be material absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.
b viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to hoeper,the court concludes as a matter of law that any falsehoods in air wisconsin statement to the tsa were not material.first,the court rejects hoeper argument that air wisconsin should have qualified its statement that hoeper was an ffdo who may be armed by noting that it had no reason to think he actually was armed.to the extent that air wisconsin statement could have been confusing,any such confusion is immaterial,as a reasonable tsa officer having been told that hoeper was an ffdo who was upset about losing his job would have wanted to investigate whether he was armed.to demand more precise wording would vitiate the purpose of atsa immunity to encourage air carriers and their employees,often in situations and with little time to their diction,to provide the tsa immediately with information about potential threats.second,air wisconsin statement that hoeper was terminated today was not materially false.while hoeper had not actually been fired at the time of the statement,everyone involved knew that his firing was imminent.no reasonable tsa officer would care whether an angry,potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.finally,although the details of hoeper behavior during the simulator session may be disputed,it would have been correct even under hoeper version of the facts for air wisconsin to report that hoeper blew up during the test.from a reasonable security officer perspective,there is no material difference between a statement that hoeper had blown up in a professional setting and a statement that he was unstable.air wisconsin related statement that it was concerned about hoeper mental stability is no more troubling.many of the officials who attended the meeting at airline headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of mental stability,but it would be inconsistent with the atsa text and purpose to expose air wisconsin to liability because the manager who placed the call to the tsa could have chosen a slightly better phrase to articulate the airline concern.a statement that would otherwise qualify for atsa immunity can not lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision,so long as the gist of the statement is accurate,masson,at.

air wisconsin airlines corporation,petitioner william hoeper 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the supreme court of colorado 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
in,congress created the transportation security administration tsa to assess and manage threats against air travel.aviation and transportation security act atsa,et.to ensure that the tsa would be informed of potential threats,congress gave airlines and their employees immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior.a.but this immunity does not attach to any disclosure made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false,inaccurate,or misleading or any disclosure made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.b.
the question before us is whether atsa immunity may be denied under b without a determination that a disclosure was materially false.we hold that it may not.because the state courts made no such determination,and because any falsehood in the disclosure here would not have affected a reasonable security officer assessment of the supposed threat,we reverse the judgment of the colorado supreme court.
william hoeper joined air wisconsin airlines corporation as a pilot in.but by late,air wisconsin had stopped operating flights from denver,hoeper home base,on any type of aircraft for which he was certified.to continue flying for air wisconsin out of denver,hoeper needed to gain certification on the british aerospace,an aircraft he had not flown.
hoeper failed in his first three attempts to pass a proficiency test.after the third failure,as he later acknowledged at trial,his employment was at air wisconsin discretion.app.but he and air wisconsin entered into an agreement to afford him one more opportunity to pass the proficiency check.at.the agreement left little doubt that hoeper would lose his job if he failed again.
in december,hoeper flew from denver to virginia for simulator training as part of this final test.during the training,hoeper failed to cope with a challenging scenario created by the instructor,mark schuerman,and the simulator showed the engines flam ing out due to a loss of fuel.app.as schuerman began to tell hoeper that he should know better,hoeper responded angrily.he later described what happened 
at this point,that it.i take my headset off and i toss it up on the glare shield schuerman and i exchanged words at the same elevated decibel level.mine went something like this this is a bunch of shit.i sorry.you are railroading the situation and it not realistic.at.
when hoeper announced that he wanted to call the legal department of the pilots union,schuerman ended the session so that hoeper could do so.schuerman then reported hoeper behavior to patrick doyle,the manager of the fleet.doyle booked hoeper on a united airlines flight back to denver.
several hours after schuerman report,doyle discussed the situation at air wisconsin headquarters with the airline vice president of operations,kevin laware its managing director of flight operations,scott orozco and its assistant chief pilot,robert frisch.laware later explained the accretion of his concerns about what hoeper might do next.he regarded hoeper behavior in the simulator as a fairly significant outburst,of a sort that he had seen before.at.and he knew it was a given that hoeper employment was going to be terminated as a result of his failure to complete the simulator training,at.
then,laware testified,orozco mentioned that hoeper was a federal flight deck officer ffdo.the ffdo program allows the government to deputize volunteer pilots of air carriers to defend the flight decks of aircraft against acts of criminal violence or air piracy.a.ffdos are permitted to carry a firearm while engaged in providing air transportation.f.hoeper had become an ffdo earlier in and had been issued a firearm.he was not allowed to carry the firearm during his trip to the training facility,because he was not engaged in providing air transportation,ibid.but according to one official at the meeting,the denver airport security procedures made it possible for crew members to bypass screening,so that hoeper could have carried his gun despite the rule.indeed,frisch later testified that he was aware of one incident in which an air wisconsin pilot had come to training with his ffdo weapon.app.on the basis of this information,laware concluded,there was no way to confirm whether hoeper had his weapon with him,even though by policy,he was not supposed to have it with him.at.
finally,laware testified,he and the other air wisconsin officials discussed two prior episodes in which disgruntled airline employees had lashed out violently,at.in one incident,a fedex flight engineer under investigation for misconduct entered the cockpit of a fedex flight and began attacking the crew with a hammer before being subdued.united states calloway.in another,a recently fired ticket agent brought a gun onto a pacific southwest airlines flight and shot his former supervisor and the crew,leading to a fatal crash.malnic,report confirms that gunman caused crash of psa jet,times.
in light of all this hoeper anger,his impending termination,the chance that he might be armed,and the history of assaults by disgruntled airline employees laware decided that the airline need ed to make a call to the tsa,to let the authorities know the status of the situation.app.
doyle offered to make the call.according to the jury,he made two statements to the tsa first,that hoeper was an ffdo who may be armed and that the airline was concerned about his mental stability and the whereabouts of his firearm and second,that an u nstable pilot in the ffdo program was terminated today.app.to pet.for cert.the latter statement appears in the record as the subject line of an internal tsa,summarizing the call from doyle.app.
the tsa responded to the call by ordering that hoeper plane return to the gate.officers boarded the plane,removed hoeper,searched him,and questioned him about the location of his gun.when hoeper stated that the gun was at his home in denver,a federal agent went there to retrieve it.
later that day,hoeper boarded a return flight to denver.air wisconsin fired him the following day.
hoeper sued air wisconsin in colorado state court on several claims,including defamation air wisconsin moved for summary judgment on the basis of atsa immunity but the trial court denied it,ruling that the jury was entitled to find the facts pertinent to immunity.the case went to trial,and the court denied air wisconsin motion for a directed verdict on the same basis.it submitted the question of atsa immunity to the jury,with the instruction following the language of b that immunity would not apply if hoeper had proved that air wisconsin made the disclosure to the tsa with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false,inaccurate,or misleading or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity.app.the jury instructions did not state that atsa immunity protects materially true statements.
the jury found for hoeper on the defamation claim and awarded him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the court reduced the latter award to,for a total judgment of just under million,plus costs.
the colorado court of appeals affirmed.it held that the trial court properly submitted the atsa immunity issue to the jury,that the record supports the jury rejection of immunity,and that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury defamation verdict,at.
the colorado supreme court affirmed.wl.it began by holding,contrary to the lower courts,that immunity under the atsa is a question of law to be determined by the trial court before trial.at.but it concluded that the trial court error in submitting immunity to the jury was harmless because air wisconsin is not entitled to immunity.at.in a key footnote,the court stated in our determination of immunity under the atsa,we need not,and therefore do not,decide whether the statements were true or false.rather,we conclude that air wisconsin made the statements with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity.at.the court thus appears to have labored under the assumption that even true statements do not qualify for atsa immunity if they are made recklessly.
applying this standard,and giving no weight to the jury finding s,the court held that a lthough the events at the training may have warranted a report to tsa,air wisconsin statements overstated those events to such a degree that they were made with reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.at.the court opined that air wisconsin would likely be immune under the atsa if doyle had reported that hoeper was an air wisconsin employee,that he knew he would be terminated soon,that he had acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier and blew up at test administrators,and that he was an ffdo pilot.at.but because doyle actually told tsa that he believed hoeper to be mentally unstable that hoeper had been terminated earlier that day and that hoeper may have been armed,at,the court determined that his statements went well beyond the facts and did not qualify for immunity,at.the court went on to conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury defamation verdict.
justice eid,joined by two others,dissented in part.she agreed with the majority holding that immunity is an issue for the court,not the jury.but she reasoned that air wisconsin was entitled to immunity because its statements to the tsa were substantially true.at.
we granted certiorari to decide w hether atsa immunity may be denied without a determination that the air carrier disclosure was materially false.
congress patterned the exception to atsa immunity after the actual malice standard of new york times sullivan,and we have long held that actual malice requires material falsity.because we presume that congress meant to incorporate the settled meaning of actual malice when it incorporated the language of that standard,we hold that a statement otherwise eligible for atsa immunity may not be denied immunity unless the statement is materially false.
in new york times,we held that under the first amendment,a public official can not recover for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice that is,with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.at.congress borrowed this exact language in denying atsa immunity to any disclosure made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false,inaccurate,or misleading or any disclosure made with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.b.
one could in principle construe the language of the actual malice standard to cover true statements made recklessly.but we have long held,to the contrary,that actual malice entails falsity.see,philadelphia newspapers,hepps,a s one might expect given the language of the court in new york times,a plaintiff must show the falsity of the statements at issue in order to prevail in a suit for defamation citation omitted garrison louisiana,we held in new york times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false 
indeed,we have required more than mere falsity to establish actual malice the falsity must be material.masson new yorker magazine.as we explained in masson,m inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as the substance,the gist,the sting,of the libelous charge be justified.ibid.a statement is not considered false unless it would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.ibid.quoting sack,libel,slander,and related problems.
these holdings were settled when congress enacted the atsa,and we therefore presume that congress meant to adopt the material falsity requirement when it incorporated the actual malice standard into the atsa immunity exception.i t is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that,when congress employs a term of art,it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it is taken.faa cooper,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.the actual malice standard does not cover materially true statements made recklessly,so we presume that congress did not mean to deny atsa immunity to such statements.
other indicia of statutory meaning could rebut this presumption,but here,they do not.first,the atsa text favors a falsity requirement.the first subsection of b requires falsity,as a true disclosure can not have been made with actual knowledge that it was false.the only question is whether the second subsection which denies immunity to any disclosure made with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity similarly requires falsity.we conclude that it does.the second subsection simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to reckless ones,ensuring that an air carrier can not avoid liability for a baseless report by sticking its head in the sand to avoid actual knowledge that its statements are false.t he defense of truth,even if not explicitly recognized,is implicit in a standard of recovery that rests on knowing or reckless disregard of the truth.cox broadcasting cohn,powell,concurring.
a material falsity requirement also serves the purpose of atsa immunity.the atsa shifted from airlines to the tsa the responsibility for assessing and investigating possible threats to airline security.wl,eid,concurring in part and dissenting in part.in directing the tsa to receive,assess,and distribute intelligence information related to transportation security,f,congress wanted to ensure that air carriers and their employees would not hesitate to provide the tsa with the information it needed.this is the purpose of the immunity provision,evident both from its context and from the title of the statutory section that contained it encouraging airline employees to report suspicious activities.atsa,stat.capitalization and boldface type omitted.it would defeat this purpose to deny immunity for substantially true reports,on the theory that the person making the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of its truth.such a rule would restore the state of affairs,in which air carriers bore the responsibility to investigate and verify potential threats.
we therefore hold that atsa immunity may not be denied under b to materially true statements.this interpretation of the statute is clear enough that hoeper effectively concedes it.see brief for respondent acknowledging that if the colorado supreme court actually said an airline may be denied atsa immunity for reporting true information,then the court was likely wrong hoeper does point out in a footnote that given congress desire to deny immunity to bad actors,and given that the vast majority of reckless statements will not turn out to be true,congress could have quite reasonably chosen to deny the special privilege of atsa immunity to all reckless speakers,even those whose statements turned out to be true,at.but although congress could have made this choice,nothing about the statute text or purpose suggests that it actually did.instead,congress chose to model the exception to atsa immunity after a standard we have long construed to require material falsity.
we are not persuaded by hoeper arguments that we should affirm the judgment of the colorado supreme court notwithstanding its misapprehension of the atsa immunity standard.
hoeper first argues that air wisconsin forfeited the claim that it is entitled to immunity because its statements were materially true.his premise is that air wisconsin argued the truth of its statements only in challenging the evidentiary basis for the defamation verdict,not in asserting immunity.but air wisconsin brief before the colorado supreme court argued that the exception to atsa immunity appears to incorporate the new york times actual malice standard,which as we have explained requires material falsity.petitioner opening brief in.
hoeper next argues that the colorado supreme court performed the requisite analysis of material falsity,albeit in the context of finding the record sufficient to support the jury defamation verdict.for several reasons,however,this analysis does not suffice for us to affirm the denial of atsa immunity.first,to the extent that the immunity determination belongs to the court as the colorado supreme court held a court deferential review of jury findings can not substitute for its own analysis of the record.second,the jury here did not find that any falsity in air wisconsin statements was material,because the trial court instructed it only to determine whether o ne or more of th e statements was false,app,without addressing materiality.third,applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim is quite different from applying it to atsa immunity.in both contexts,a materially false statement is one that would have a different effect on the mind of the reader or listener from that which the truth would have produced.masson,at.but the identity of the relevant reader or listener varies according to the context.in determining whether a falsehood is material to a defamation claim,we care whether it affects the subject reputation in the community.in the context of determining atsa immunity,by contrast,we care whether a falsehood affects the authorities perception of and response to a given threat 
finally,the colorado supreme court analysis of material falsity was erroneous.we turn next to explaining why,by applying the atsa immunity standard to the facts of this case 
we begin by addressing how to determine the materiality of a false statement in the atsa context.as we noted earlier,a materially false statement is generally one that would have a different effect on the mind of the reader or listener from that which the truth would have produced.ibid.the parties quibble over whether atsa immunity requires some special version of this standard,but they more or less agree as do we that the usual standard suffices as long as the hypothetical reader or listener is a security officer.
a further question is what it means for a statement to produce a different effect on the mind of a security officer from that which the truth would have produced.in defamation law,the reputational harm caused by a false statement is its effect on a reader or listener mind.but contrary to the position of hoeper counsel at oral argument,tr.of oral arg,courts can not decide whether a false statement produced a different effect on the mind of a hypothetical tsa officer without considering the effect of that statement on tsa behavior.after all,the whole reason the tsa considers threat reports is to determine and execute a response.
a plaintiff seeking to defeat atsa immunity need not show precisely what a particular official or federal agency would have done in a counterfactual scenario.brief for united states as amicus curiae.such a showing would be impossible given the need to maintain secrecy regarding airline security operations.brief for respondent.but any falsehood can not be material,for purposes of atsa immunity,absent a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would consider it important in determining a response to the supposed threat.tsc industries,northway,an omission in a proxy solicitation is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote this standard is an objective one,involving the hypothetical significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable security official,rather than the actual significance of that fact to a particular security official,at.
we apply the material falsity standard to the facts of this case.in doing so,we neither embrace nor reject the colorado supreme court unanimous holding that immunity under the atsa is a question of law to be determined by the trial court before trial.wl,see,at eid,concurring in part and dissenting in part agreeing with majority.rather,we conclude that even if a jury were to find the historical facts in the manner most favorable to hoeper,air wisconsin is entitled to atsa immunity as a matter of law.
we begin with air wisconsin statement that hoeper was an ffdo who may be armed.app.to pet.for cert.hoeper can not dispute the literal truth of this statement he was an ffdo,and because ffdos possess weapons,any ffdo may be armed.hoeper argues only that to avoid any misinterpretation,air wisconsin should have qualified the statement by adding that it had no reason to think he was actually carrying his gun during the trip to virginia,especially because he was not allowed to do so under f we agree that air wisconsin statement could have been misinterpreted by some,but we reject hoeper argument for two reasons.first,any confusion of the nature that hoeper suggests would have been immaterial a reasonable tsa officer,having been told only that hoeper was an ffdo and that he was upset about losing his job,would have wanted to investigate whether hoeper was carrying his gun.second,to accept hoeper demand for such precise wording would vitiate the purpose of atsa immunity to encourage air carriers and their employees,often in situations and with little time to their diction,to provide the tsa immediately with information about potential threats.baggage handlers,flight attendants,gate agents,and other airline employees who report suspicious behavior to the tsa should not face financial ruin if,in the heat of a potential threat,they fail to choose their words with exacting care 
we next consider air wisconsin statement that hoeper was terminated today.app.to pet.for cert.when air wisconsin made that statement,hoeper had not yet been fired.but everyone knew the firing was almost certainly imminent.hoeper acknowledged that his employment was at air wisconsin discretion after his third failed test,app,and the agreement between him and air wisconsin stated that his fourth attempt to pass the test would be his final one,at.no reasonable tsa officer would care whether an angry,potentially armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was about to meet that fate.
finally,we consider air wisconsin statements that hoeper was u nstable and that it was concerned about his mental stability.app.to pet.for cert.although the details of hoeper behavior during the simulator session may be disputed,hoeper himself testified that he had become visibly angry he decided that it,he removed his headset and toss ed it,and he accused the instructor at an elevated decibel level,and with an expletive of railroading the situation.app.it would surely have been correct,then,for air wisconsin to report that hoeper blew up during the test.wl.the question is whether,from the perspective of a reasonable security officer,there is any material difference between a statement that hoeper had just blown up in a professional setting and a statement that he was u nstable.we think not.
we are no more troubled by air wisconsin related statement that it was concerned about hoeper mental stability.hoeper is correct that many of the air wisconsin officials who attended the meeting at headquarters might not have framed their concerns in terms of mental stability.laware,for instance,testified that t hose were the words that he would have anticipated when he directed doyle to call the tsa.app.but the officials who attended the meeting did harbor concerns about hoeper mental state they knew he had just blown up,and they worried about what he might do next.it would be inconsistent with the atsa text and purpose to expose air wisconsin to liability because its employee could have chosen a slightly better phrase than mental stability to articulate its concern.just as m inor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity in the defamation context,so long as the substance,the gist,the sting,of the libelous charge be justified,masson,at,a statement that would otherwise qualify for atsa immunity can not lose that immunity because of some minor imprecision,so long as the gist of the statement is accurate.doyle statements to the tsa accurately conveyed the gist of the situation it is irrelevant whether trained lawyers or judges might with the luxury of time have chosen more precise words.
hoeper overarching
