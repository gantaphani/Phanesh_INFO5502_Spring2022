the court has held that the second amendment extends,prima facie,to all instruments that constitute bearable arms,even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding,district of columbia heller,and that this second amendment right is fully applicable to the states,mcdonald chicago.in this case,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts upheld a massachusetts law prohibiting the possession of stun guns after examining whether a stun gun is the type of weapon contemplated by congress in as being protected by the second amendment.
the court offered three explanations to support its holding that the second amendment does not extend to stun guns.first,the court explained that stun guns are not protected because they were not in common use at the time of the second amendment enactment.at,at.this is inconsistent with heller clear statement that the second amendment extends to arms that were not in existence at the time of the founding.at.
the court next asked whether stun guns are dangerous per se at common law and unusual,at,at,in an attempt to apply one important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms,heller,at see ibid.referring to the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons in so doing,the court concluded that stun guns are unusual because they are a thoroughly modern invention.at,at.by equating unusual with in common use at the time of the second amendment enactment,the court second explanation is the same as the first it is inconsistent with heller for the same reason.
finally,the court used a contemporary lens and found nothing in the record to suggest that stun guns are readily adaptable to use in the military.at,at.but heller rejected the proposition that only those weapons useful in warfare are protected.at.
for these three reasons,the explanation the massachusetts court offered for upholding the law contradicts this court precedent.consequently,the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.the judgment of the supreme judicial court of massachusetts is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

decided march,
justice alito,with whom justice thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.
after a bad altercation with an abusive boyfriend put her in the hospital,jaime caetano found herself homeless and in fear for her life.tr,july.she obtained multiple restraining orders against her abuser,but they proved futile.so when a friend offered her a stun gun for against her former boy friend,caetano accepted the weapon.
it is a good thing she did.one night after leaving work,caetano found her waiting for her outside.tr.he started screaming that she was not gon na expletive deleted work at this place any more because she should be home with the kids they had together.ibid.caetano abuser towered over her by nearly a foot and outweighed her by close to pounds.but she did need physical strength to protect herself.she stood her ground,displayed the stun gun,and announced i not gon na take this anymore.i do wan na have to use the stun gun on you,but if you do leave me alone,i gon na have to.at.the gambit worked.the got scared and he left her alone.at.
it is settled that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms that applies against both the federal government and the states.district of columbia heller,mcdonald chicago.that right vindicates the basic right of individual.at see heller,supra,at.caetano encounter with her violent illustrates the connection between those fundamental rights by arming herself,caetano was able to protect against a physical threat that restraining orders had proved useless to prevent.and,commendably,she did so by using a weapon that posed little,if any,danger of permanently harming either herself or the father of her children.
under massachusetts law,however,caetano mere possession of the stun gun that may have saved her life made her a criminal.see.laws,ch.when police later discovered the weapon,she was arrested,tried,and convicted.the massachusetts supreme judicial court affirmed the conviction,holding that a stun gun is not the type of weapon that is eligible for second amendment protection because it was not in common use at the time of the second amendment enactment.at,at.
this reasoning defies our decision in heller,which rejected as bordering on the frivolous the argument that only those arms in existence in the century are protected by the second amendment.at.the decision below also does a grave disservice to vulnerable individuals like caetano who must defend themselves because the state will not.
the events leading to caetano prosecution occurred sometime after the confrontation between her and her.in september,police officers responded to a reported shoplifting at an ashland,massachusetts,supermarket.the store manager had detained a suspect,but he identified caetano and another person in the parking lot as potential accomplices.police approached the two and obtained caetano consent to search her purse.they found no evidence of shoplifting,but saw caetano stun gun.caetano explained to the officers that she had acquired the weapon to defend herself against a violent.
the officers believed caetano,but they arrested her for violating.laws,ch,which bans entirely the possession of an electrical weapon,at,at when caetano moved to dismiss the charge on second amendment grounds,the trial court denied the motion.
a subsequent bench trial established the following undisputed facts.the parties stipulated that caetano possessed the stun gun and that the weapon fell within the statute prohibition the commonwealth also did not challenge caetano testimony that she possessed the weapon to defend herself against the violent.indeed,the prosecutor urged the court to believe the defendant.tr.the trial court nonetheless found caetano guilty,and she appealed to the massachusetts supreme judicial court.
the supreme judicial court rejected caetano second amendment claim,holding that a stun gun is not the type of weapon that is eligible for second amendment protection.at,at.the court reasoned that stun guns are unprotected because they were not in common use at the time of enactment of the second amendment,at,at quoting heller,supra,at,and because they fall within the traditional prohibition against carrying dangerous and unusual weapons,at,at citing heller,supra,at.
although the supreme judicial court professed to apply heller,each step of its analysis defied heller reasoning.
the state court repeatedly framed the question before it as whether a particular weapon was in common use at the time of enactment of the second amendment.at,at see also,at,at.in heller,we emphatically rejected such a formulation.we found the argument that only those arms in existence in the century are protected by the second amendment not merely wrong,but bordering on the frivolous.at.instead,we held that the second amendment extends,prima facie,to all instruments that constitute bearable arms,even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.ibid.emphasis added it is hard to imagine language speaking more directly to the point.yet the supreme judicial court did not so much as mention it.
instead,the court seized on language,originating in united states miller,that the sorts of weapons protected were those in common use at the time.at,at quoting heller,supra,at,in turn quoting miller,supra,at.that quotation does not mean,as the court below thought,that only weapons popular in are covered by the second amendment.it simply reflects the reality that the militia consisted of citizens who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty,heller,at,and that the second amendment accordingly guarantees the right to carry weapons typically possessed by citizens for lawful purposes,at.while stun guns were not in existence at the end of the century,the same is true for the weapons most commonly used today for,namely,revolvers and semiautomatic pistols.revolvers were virtually unknown until well into the century and semiautomatic pistols were not invented until near the end of that century electronic stun guns are no more exempt from the second amendment protections,simply because they were unknown to the first congress,than electronic communications are exempt from the first amendment,or electronic imaging devices are exempt from the fourth amendment,at citing reno american civil liberties union,and kyllo united states.as heller aptly put it we do not interpret constitutional rights that way.at.
the supreme judicial court holding that stun guns may be banned as dangerous and unusual weapons fares no better.as the per curiam opinion recognizes,this is a conjunctive test a weapon may not be banned unless it is both dangerous and unusual.because the court rejects the lower court conclusion that stun guns are unusual,it does not need to consider the lower court conclusion that they are also dangerous.see ante,at.but make no mistake the decision below gravely erred on both grounds.
as to dangerous,the court below held that a weapon is dangerous per se if it is designed and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm and for the purpose of bodily assault or defense.at,at quoting commonwealth appleby.that test may be appropriate for applying statutes criminalizing assault with a dangerous weapon.see,at.but it can not be used to identify arms that fall outside the second amendment.first,the relative dangerousness of a weapon is irrelevant when the weapon belongs to a class of arms commonly used for lawful purposes.see heller,supra,at contrasting dangerous and unusual weapons that may be banned with protected weapons in common use at the time second,even in cases where dangerousness might be relevant,the supreme judicial court test sweeps far too broadly.heller defined the arms covered by the second amendment to include any thing that a man wears for his defence,or takes into his hands,or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.at.under the decision below,however,virtually every covered arm would qualify as dangerous.
were there any doubt on this point,one need only look at the court first example of dangerous per se weapons firearms.at,at.if heller tells us anything,it is that firearms can not be categorically prohibited just because they are dangerous,at.a fortiori,stun guns that the commonwealth own witness described as force,tr,can not be banned on that basis.
the supreme judicial court conclusion that stun guns are unusual rested largely on its premise that one must ask whether a weapon was commonly used in.see,at,at.as already discussed,that is simply wrong.see supra,at.
the court also opined that a weapon unusualness depends on whether it is a weapon of warfare to be used by the militia.at,at.it asserted that we followed such an approach in miller and approved its use in heller.at,at.but heller actually said that it would be a startling reading of miller to conclude that only those weapons useful in warfare are protected.at.instead,miller and heller recognized that militia members traditionally reported for duty carrying the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home,and that the second amendment therefore protects such weapons as a class,regardless of any particular weapon suitability for military use,at see,at.indeed,heller acknowledged that advancements in military technology might render many commonly owned weapons ineffective in warfare,at.but such modern developments can not change our interpretation of the right.ibid.
in any event,the supreme judicial court assumption that stun guns are unsuited for militia or military use is untenable.section allows law enforcement and correctional officers to carry stun guns and tasers,presumably for such purposes as nonlethal crowd control.subduing members of a mob is little different from suppress ing insurrections,a traditional role of the militia,art.i,cl.see also ibid.militia may be called forth to execute the laws of the union additionally,several branches of the armed services equip troops with electrical stun weapons to incapacitate a target without permanent injury or known side effects.army,project manager close combat systems,pd combat munitions launched electrode stun device lesd,all internet materials as last visited,see marine corps administrative message,marine corps guidance for use of tasers,news messages messagesdisplay.aspx joint weapons directorate,weapons nlw reference book department of defense report stating that m ultiple services employ tasers.
as the foregoing makes clear,the pertinent second amendment inquiry is whether stun guns are commonly possessed by citizens for lawful purposes today.the supreme judicial court offered only a cursory discussion of that question,noting that the number of tasers and stun guns is dwarfed by the number of firearms.at,at.this observation may be true,but it is beside the point.otherwise,a state would be free to ban all weapons except handguns,because handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by americans for in the home.heller,supra,at.
the more relevant statistic is that h undreds of thousands of tasers and stun guns have been sold to private citizens,who it appears may lawfully possess them in states.people yanna.app,holding michigan stun gun ban unconstitutional see volokh,nonlethal,almost entirely nonlethal weapons,and the rights to keep and bear arms and defend life,stan,citing stun gun bans in seven states.stat.supp.amended wisconsin law permitting stun gun possession see also brief in opposition acknowledging that approximately civilians owned stun guns as of.while less popular than handguns,stun guns are widely owned and accepted as a legitimate means of across the country.massachusetts categorical ban of such weapons therefore violates the second amendment.
the lower court ill treatment of heller can not stand.the reasoning of the massachusetts court poses a grave threat to the fundamental right of.the supreme judicial court suggested that caetano could have simply gotten a firearm to defend herself,at,at.but the right to bear other weapons is no answer to a ban on the possession of protected arms.heller,at.moreover,a weapon is an effective means of only if one is prepared to use it,and it is presumptuous to tell caetano she should have been ready to shoot the father of her two young children if she wanted to protect herself.courts should not be in the business of demanding that citizens use more force for than they are comfortable wielding 
countless people may have reservations about using deadly force,whether for moral,religious,or emotional reasons or simply out of fear of killing the wrong person.see brief for arming women against rape endangerment as amicus curiae.however,is a basic right.mcdonald,at.i am not prepared to say that a state may force an individual to choose between exercising that right and following her conscience,at least where both can be accommodated by a weapon already in widespread use across the nation.
a state most basic responsibility is to keep its people safe.the commonwealth of massachusetts was either unable or unwilling to do what was necessary to protect jaime caetano,so she was forced to protect herself.to make matters worse,the commonwealth chose to deploy its prosecutorial resources to prosecute and convict her of a criminal offense for arming herself with a nonlethal weapon that may well have saved her life.the supreme judicial court then affirmed her conviction on the flimsiest of grounds.this court grudging per curiam now sends the case back to that same court.and the consequences for caetano may prove more tragic still,as her conviction likely bars her from ever bearing arms for.see pet.for cert.
if the fundamental right of does not protect caetano,then the safety of all americans is left to the mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about disarming the people than about keeping them safe.
