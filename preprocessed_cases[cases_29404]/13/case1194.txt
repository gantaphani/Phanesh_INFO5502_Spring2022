in this case,in which a jury found defendant joseph thorn guilty on one count of money laundering conspiracy,see a a i,h,and nine counts of clean air act violations,see c,the parties from an amended judgment of conviction entered on december,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,judge,which vacated the money laundering count pursuant to in light of the supreme court definition of proceeds in united states santos,d,and resentenced thorn to months imprisonment on the remaining clean air act counts.the united states submits that thorn sufficiency challenge to proof of proceeds was barred from collateral review by his failure to raise the point on direct appeal.it also argues that,in any event,santos holding does not apply in this case.thorn maintains that the district court correctly vacated the money laundering count of conviction.nevertheless,he argues that the imposition of a total month prison sentence on the remaining clean air act counts of conviction,for which he had previously been sentenced to a total of months imprisonment,violates the double jeopardy clause and his right to due process.
for the reasons stated herein,we conclude that thorn sufficiency challenge to the proof of proceeds was procedurally barred from collateral attack and,thus,his conviction for money laundering conspiracy should not have been vacated.this renders the parties remaining arguments moot.accordingly,we vacate the amended judgment of december,and order that the amended judgment of october,be reinstated.
background 
this is the third occasion on which this court reviews from thorn conviction for money laundering and clear air act violations.because we assume familiarity with our two prior decisions,see united states thorn,cir united states thorn,cir,we here discuss only those facts relevant to resolution of this appeal.
a.the charged crimes 
at a trial in,the government demonstrated that thorn violated the clean air act and federal prohibition on money laundering by using his business,a environmental services,a,to operate a fraudulent scheme whereby he won bids to remove asbestos,removed that asbestos through unsafe and unlawful means,falsely represented to customers and the united states government that a had performed the contracted work in compliance with federal and state law,and ultimately used money obtained from such projects to conduct further illegal abatement operations.with specific reference to the money laundering count,dawn dayter,a office manager,testified that money generated from existing illegal abatements would be used to finance the next project.at thomas perrault,a general manager,detailed thorn practice of entering low contract bids premised on a cheap and illegal rip and skip method of removing asbestos,and explained how a generated profits and secured more contracts through that strategy,id.at and brian wolcott,an a employee,testified that it was thorn who instructed him and other workers to rip and skip the asbestos,which they routinely did,id.at.further,a accounting records showed that the company earned profits from its fraudulent asbestos abatements,and thorn himself confirmed that profitability,testifying that a grew almost geometrically every year.id.at see generally united states thorn,at.
b.the judgments of conviction 
the initial judgment of conviction,entered on november,sentenced thorn to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each of the nine clean air act counts and a concurrent month term on the money laundering count.the district court explained that it departed from what it determined was the applicable sentencing guidelines range of to months imprisonment because the conduct supporting thorn money laundering conviction was outside the heartland of that crime.on the parties,this court disagreed both with the district court calculation of the applicable guidelines range and the ground for its heartland departure decision.see united thorn,at.accordingly,the case was remanded for resentencing.see id.at.
an amended judgment of conviction,entered on september,sentenced thorn to concurrent month prison terms on the nine clean air act counts and a concurrent month prison term for money laundering.the district court explained that it was departing from the recalculated guidelines prison range of to months reflecting a enhancement for creating a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury,see b because thorn money laundering was not critical to the underlying fraud scheme.on,this court again identified error in the district court guidelines calculation and in its ground for departure,and remanded for resentencing.see united states thorn,at.
on remand,the district court recalculated thorn guidelines to reflect an enhancement for abuse of a position of trust,see,and to withdraw its previous departure from thorn criminal history category of ii,resulting in a guidelines prison range of to months.exercising its discretion to impose a sentence,the district court stated that it disapproved of the money laundering charge and intended to treat the defendant conduct as an attempt to defraud his customers rather than as a money laundering conspiracy,tr.at.the amended judgment,entered on october,sentenced thorn to concurrent month prison terms on the clean air act counts and a concurrent month term on the money laundering conspiracy.
thorn motion 
on january,thorn filed a motion to vacate his money laundering conviction for insufficient proof that the charged financial transactions involved proceeds as that term was defined by the supreme court in united states santos,d.in santos,the supreme court ruled that a defendant who had used the gross receipts of an illegal lottery operation to pay his winners and runners could not be convicted of money laundering under a a i because the statutory term proceeds referenced only net profits,not gross receipts.at plurality opinion.in a concurring opinion,justice stevens,the fifth member of the santos majority,declined to pick a single definition of proceeds applicable to every unlawful activity.id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment.he concluded instead that when the predicate crime was gambling,t he consequences of applying a gross receipts definition of proceeds are so perverse that i can not believe they were contemplated by congress.id.at.
the district court granted thorn motion to vacate.it ruled that the motion was timely because it was filed within one year of the santos decision,which was retroactively applicable to thorn case,see f thorn adequately preserved his proceeds challenge on direct appeal and,even if he did not,the default was properly excused and santos compelled vacatur of thorn money laundering conviction because the jury instruction had allowed conviction based on thorn use of the receipts not the profits of fraudulent asbestos abatements to promote his larger scheme.
on november,the district court recalculated thorn guidelines sentencing range with respect to the remaining nine clean air act counts and determined his guidelines prison range to be to months.the district court elected to impose a total sentence of months incarceration as follows concurrent month prison terms on counts through a consecutive month prison term on count and a consecutive month prison term on count.
ii.discussion 
our consideration of the parties begins and ends with the government argument that thorn challenge to his money laundering conspiracy conviction is procedurally barred from collateral review.
in general,a defendant is barred from collaterally challenging a conviction under on a ground that he failed to raise on direct appeal.see yick man mui united states,cir zhang united states,cir.an exception applies,however,if the defendant establishes cause for the procedural default and ensuing prejudice or actual innocence.see bousley united states,d accord zhang united states,at.to the extent the district court concluded both that thorn adequately preserved his challenge to the government proof of the proceeds element of money laundering and,in any event,that he qualified for an exception to any procedural bar,these are determ
