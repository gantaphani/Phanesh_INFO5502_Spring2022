petitioner gary cohen was convicted of various sexual abuse charges after a trial in new york state court.cohen subsequently petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus,alleging that his federal constitutional right to be present at trial had been violated when some portions of the voir dire were conducted without his participation.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,denis hurley,judge,denied the petition,finding that although cohen had a constitutional right to be present when jurors were questioned about their exposure to publicity,he had waived this right.we agree with the district court and accordingly affirm.
background 
in december,cohen,a pediatrician,was arrested in suffolk county,new york,on felony charges of sexual abuse of a patient.in response to the publicity generated by his arrest,seven other patients came forward with similar accounts of abuse.cohen was later charged by the state with counts of felony sexual offenses.cohen case attracted a substantial amount of publicity in the county media.
jury selection for cohen trial in suffolk county court began in september.at the outset,judge tisch announced in open court that he would initially question the prospective jurors individually in his chambers on,inter alia,their prior knowledge about this case which has been reported in the media.although cohen counsel participated in this questioning,cohen himself was not present.of the prospective jurors who were in this manner,two who stated that they had prior knowledge of the case due to pretrial publicity were ultimately seated on the jury that convicted cohen.later in the jury selection process,judge tisch conducted sidebar questioning of three prospective jurors on bias connected to pretrial publicity and the nature of the charges.one of these jurors,who conceded possible bias,was empaneled as an alternate juror.
judge tisch also invited counsel on four occasions to exercise challenges for cause and peremptory challenges in his chambers.cohen was not present for any of these exercises,but he did have an opportunity to consult with his attorney each time before counsel went into chambers.he was also present in court when the court announced which jurors were excused and which were selected.
on october,the jury convicted cohen of counts of sexual abuse.he received a to sentence,which he continues to serve.
cohen first attack on his conviction was a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to.proc.law.he argued that his right to be present at trial under the new york and federal constitutions had been violated when prospective jurors were for their prior knowledge of the case,sidebar voir dire was conducted,and juror challenges were exercised,all in his absence.cohen further argued that he had not knowingly waived his right to be present.judge tisch denied the motion on procedural grounds,finding that all facts material to cohen claim were undisputed and in the record,and that therefore the claim could be raised on direct appeal.people cohen,misc d.
cohen proceeded to file a direct appeal in which he reiterated his claims of state and federal constitutional violations.the appellate division,second department,affirmed his conviction on state constitutional grounds,but did not directly address cohen federal claim that his right to be present at all material stages of his trial had been violated.see people cohen.cohen applications for further state appeals were denied.people cohen,people cohen.
in april,cohen filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,arguing that his constitutional rights had been violated by his absence from the of jurors,from sidebar voir dire,and from the exercise of cause and peremptory challenges.cohen also contended that he did not know he had a constitutional right to be present at these proceedings,and therefore waiver of the right was not possible.the state responded that because cohen was aware of the proceedings and had failed to object to them,he had impliedly waived the right to be present.
the district court denied cohen petition on may,holding that cohen did have a federal constitutional right to be present at the of the prospective jurors,but that he had waived that right.the court also found that cohen did not have a federal constitutional right to be present at the sidebar conferences or at the exercise of juror challenges in chambers.in so holding,the court applied a de novo standard of review to cohen claims.
leave to appeal was granted by this court on april.the certificate of appealability directed the parties to address the following issues 
whether there has been a state court adjudication of appellant federal claims,triggering the application of the standard of review set forth in d and whether,under the applicable standard of review,appellant is entitled to habeas relief on his claim that his right to be present at the material stages of his trial was violated because he was not present when the trial court prescreened prospective jurors,held sidebar discussions with jurors during voir dire,and conducted the exercise of juror challenges.
cohen appeals on essentially these grounds,with the distinction that he has chosen not to pursue his sidebar conferences claim before this court.
discussion 
addressing first the standard of review issue certified in this appeal,we recognize that whether the more deferential standard set forth in aedpa should apply raises a difficult question,which would involve extensive analysis of the state court decisions in cohen case.see washington schriver,cir.however,we need not resolve this question because,as in washington,even reviewing the state court resolution of cohen federal constitutional claim de novo,we hold that the district court properly denied the petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus.id.at.in other words,we do not need to decide what level of deference to accord the state court rulings because nothing turns on it here.see also leka portuondo,cir.we therefore decline to rule on the applicability of aedpa standard of review to the state court rulings in this case,and instead apply a de novo standard for the purposes of argument.
we review de novo the district court denial of habeas relief.leka,at washington,at.
turning to the merits of cohen claims,we are confronted with a inquiry.to determine whether cohen constitutional right to be present at all material stages of his trial was violated,we must examine first whether the court of jurors and the exercise of juror challenges were material stages that triggered the right to be present and then,if so,whether cohen waived that right.we will address each question in turn.
i.the right to be present 
it is a principle of constitutional law that a criminal defendant has the right to be present at all stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings.faretta california,d accord kentucky stincer,d.it is also clear that the impaneling of the jury is one such stage.tankleff senkowski,cir accord gomez united states,d see also.a stating that the defendant shall be present at every stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury.as the supreme court has recognized,however,the right to be present is not absolute it is triggered only when the defendant presence has a relation,reasonably substantial,to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.snyder massachusetts.thus,there is no constitutional right to be present when presence would be useless,or the benefit but a shadow.id.at.see also united states gagnon,d per curiam.
the district court held that cohen had a right to be present at the of jurors,basing its holding on our decisions in tankleff,at,and united states gallego,cir.in tankleff,the court and counsel questioned prospective jurors in chambers about their ability to be impartial in light of the media coverage the case had received.at.tankleff was not present for the questioning,and argued on appeal that his right to be present was violated by this procedure.id.although we did not explicitly state in our decision that tankleff had such a right,we assumed it when we analyzed whether tankleff had waived the
