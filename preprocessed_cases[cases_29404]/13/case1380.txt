we consider here the claims of a petitioner who all but concedes that he has no legal right to remain in the united states,but who argues that his removal proceedings were invalid because the charges brought against him did not reflect his proper status,which he claims was merely that of an illegal visa overstay.in particular,we consider whether petitioner,who remained in the united states after the expiration of his visa and subsequently left and returned to the country pursuant to the government grant of advance parole while his application was pending,was improperly charged with removal as an arriving alien and an applicant for admission once his application was denied.petitioner argues that because he traveled abroad with the government express authorization,he should have retained his prior status as a visa overstay and been subject to a charge of deportability rather than inadmissability he therefore contends that the ij erred in denying his motion to terminate his removal proceedings and in failing to afford him the enhanced protections that apply to visa overstays,as opposed to arriving aliens.
we hold that the government did not err in treating petitioner as an arriving alien and an applicant for admission,or in denying his motion to terminate his removal proceedings.we further hold,pursuant to kambolli gonzales,cir,that we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioner additional claim that the board of immigration appeals bia erred by having his appeal decided by a panel rather than referring it to a panel for decision.finally,assuming without deciding that we have jurisdiction to review the propriety of the panel issuance of a summary affirmance instead of a written opinion,we conclude that it was not error to do so here under the governing bia regulations.
background 
petitioner david ibragimov,a native of uzbekiztan and citizen of israel,entered the united states on a valid visa on september.petitioner his,he remained in the united states after the expiration of the visa that permitted him to enter the united states in the first place that visa expired on march.on november,while still residing in the united states,he married a united states citizen.petitioner wife subsequently filed a petition for alien relative form on his behalf.in conjunction with the petition for alien relative,petitioner filed an application for adjustment of status form.
while these applications were pending before the immigration and naturalization service ins,petitioner applied for advance parole,permission to leave and return to the united states with the government prior authorization pending resolution of his immigration status.the ins granted advance parole on july,by issuing a form.the form contained a warning which stated warning pursuant to a if your application for adjustment of status is denied,you will be subject to exclusion proceedings.pursuant to this advance parole authorization,and while his adjustment of status application was pending,petitioner left the united states and was paroled back into the country several times.
petitioner most recent return to the united states pursuant to the government grant of advance parole occurred on or about july.thereafter,on october,the ins denied petitioner visa petition and his application for adjustment of status.on july,the ins revoked petitioner parole on the ground that its purpose ha d been accomplished,and there was no emergent,humanitarian,or public interest reasons which warrant ed his continued presence in the united states.
on october,the ins issued a notice to appear nta for removal proceedings before an immigration judge.the nta charged that petitioner was inadmissible pursuant to section a a i i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i i in particular,the nta alleged that petitioner was a who applied for admission to enter the united states on or about july,the date he last returned to the united states applied for admission as an intending immigrant and was not in possession of a valid,unexpired immigrant visa,reentry permit,border crossing card,or other valid entry document required by the immigration and nationality act.
removal proceedings were held before immigration judge ij patricia rohan between february and february.on or about may,petitioner filed a motion to terminate his removal proceedings.in his brief in support of his motion to terminate,petitioner argued,inter alia,that he was not an arriving alien,an applicant for admission as alleged in the nta because he had left and been paroled back into the country with the government advance authorization.the ins opposed the motion,arguing that under applicable ins regulations petitioner was an arriving alien.
on february,the ij denied petitioner motion to terminate the removal proceedings.the ij stated that petitioner had not established as a matter of law that the definition of an arriving alien does not apply to him.the ij concluded that the definition of an arriving alien clearly does apply to the petitioner who most recently returned to the united states and was paroled into the united states for the purpose of completing his application for adjustment of his status.pursuant to this determination,the ij ordered petitioner removed from the united states on the grounds that he had not shown he was eligible for admission to the country.
petitioner timely appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals.on august,the bia affirmed without opinion the ij removal order.see in re david ibragimov,no a bia,aff g no a immig.city.petitioner timely seeks review of the bia decision.
on appeal,petitioner raises substantially the same argument that he raised in support of his motion to terminate before the,that he was not an arriving alien subject to a determination as to admissibility,but was,rather,a visa overstay subject to a determination as to deportability.he therefore urges this court to hold that the ij denial of his motion to terminate was error.
petitioner also argues on appeal that the bia violated his constitutional rights to due process of law and to equal protection of the laws when it affirmed the ij decision by the action of one member of the bia and without the issuance of a published opinion.
ii.governing law 
burden of proof in removal proceedings 
following congress passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat,iirira,there is a single category of immigration proceedings for adjudicating whether an alien is legally present in the united,removal proceedings.the burden of proof in removal proceedings differs,however,depending on an alien immigration status at the time his proceedings are commenced.in particular,an individual who is an applicant for admission to the united states at the time of his removal proceeding is deemed to be legally at the border and bears the burden of establishing that he is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible or by clear and convincing evidence,that he is lawfully present in the united states pursuant to a prior admission.c.
by contrast,in a removal proceeding commenced after an alien has been formally admitted to the country,the service,the government has the burden of establishing by clear,convincing evidence that the alien is deportable,c a.
accordingly,whether an alien presence in the united states is pursuant to a prior admission is the decisive factor in determining whether the alien or the government bears the burden of proof in removal proceedings.
charges in removal proceedings 
an alien prior admission vel non is also dispositive in determining which particular charge of removability is appropriate to his removal proceedings.an alien who is in and admitted to the united states,is considered potentially deportable and is therefore subject to a charge of deportability.a id.a.by contrast,an alien who is not in the united states pursuant to a prior admission is considered potentially inadmissible and is therefore subject to a charge of inadmissibility,see e explaining distinction between aliens removable on the basis of inadmissibility and aliens removable on a basis of deportability.
admission,entry,and arriving aliens 
the ina defines the admission of an alien as follows the terms admission and admitted mean,with respect to an alien,the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.ina a a,a a emphasis added.accordingly,an alien will not be considered admitted under the immigration laws and therefore will bear the burden of proving his admissibility unless his presence in the country is pursuant to an entry that was both lawful and authorized by an immigration officer.id.
aliens who appear at a seeking to enter the united states but who have not been formally admitted are considered arriving aliens and applicants for admission.see q a rriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come to the united states at a.
parole is an administrative practice whereby the government allows an arriving alien who has come to a without a valid entry document to be temporarily released from detention and to remain in the united states pending review of the his immigration status.the statute governing parole states 
the attorney general may in his discretion parole into the united states temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admission to the united states 
d a.such parole does not constitute an admission,however.see id.
advance parole is a practice whereby the government decides in advance of an alien arrival that the alien will be paroled into the united states when he arrives at a.see,succar ashcroft,st cir.advance parole is not explicitly contemplated by the statute governing parole,but is permitted by f,which provides advance authorization.when parole is authorized for an alien who will travel to the united states without a visa,the alien shall be issued form.f.advance parole is often granted to aliens residing in the united states who have a need to travel abroad,but whose immigration status would not afford them a right to legal admission upon their return.see,succar,at,explaining the common use of advance parole to allow the return to the country of a resident alien who has an unexpected need to travel abroad and whose conditions of stay do not otherwise allow for readmission see also,may,one use of advance parole has been to provide a means for applicants for adjustment of status to be able to leave the country briefly and return without abandoning their applicants for adjustment.after the purpose of the parole has been served,the alien status reverts to that which he had at the time he was inspected and paroled into the country,and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the united states.d a see eligibility of arriving aliens in removal proceedings to apply for adjustment of status,e 
iii.standard of review 
where,as here,the bia affirms the decision of the ij without opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.see twum ins,cir.we review the ij legal conclusions de novo.zhang jian xie ins,cir.
iv.discussion 
whether the ij erred in denying petitioner motion to terminate removal proceedings based on the conclusion that petitioner was an arriving alien 
we conclude here that under valid and unambiguous ins regulations governing the grant of advance parole,petitioner was properly treated as an arriving alien and an applicant for admission in removal proceedings once his application was denied.as explained below,ins regulations manifest the agency clear intent to treat parolees,including advance parolees,as arriving aliens subject to a determination of inadmissibility.once he departed from the united states,petitioner would have had no right to return to the united states absent the government grant of advance parole.therefore,when petitioner returned and was paroled into the united states in july,he was entitled only to the rights of an advance parolee namely,the right to physically enter the country and complete his application as an arriving alien and was not entitled to the enhanced protections that would have been available to a visa overstay who never left the country.
the gravamen of petitioner challenge to the ij denial of his motion to terminate his removal proceedings is that he was not an arriving alien at the time his removal proceedings were commenced because he had already arrived when the government issued its notice to appear.in particular,petitioner argues that his most recent return to the united states pursuant to the government grant of advance parole was an entry or to the country,the government advance parole authorization form was a valid entry document,and the subsequent denial of his application did not revoke,nunc pro tunc,the government admission of petitioner pursuant to its grant of advance parole.petitioner therefore urges this court to hold that he retained the status of a visa overstay that he held before leaving the united states.
although petitioner argument has some intuitive appeal,it is legally without merit for several reasons.
first,petitioner argument that the ij and the agency erred in treating him as an applicant for admission,rather than an admitted alien,directly contravenes the plain language of a b that regulation deals specifically with aliens who,like petitioner,apply for adjustment of status and subsequently travel outside the united states pursuant to the government grant of advance parole.it provides,in relevant part 
the travel outside the united states by an applicant for adjustment of status who is not under exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings shall not be deemed an abandonment of the application if he or she was previously granted advance parole for such absences,and was inspected and paroled upon returning to the united states.if the adjustment of status of such individual is subsequently denied,he or she will be treated as an applicant for admission,and subject to the provisions of section and of the immigration and naturalization act.
a b emphasis added.petitioner does not dispute that before his most recent trip abroad,he was an applicant for adjustment of status who was not under exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings.id.nor does he dispute that he traveled outside the united states having been previously granted advance parole,was inspected and paroled upon returning to the country,and was subsequently denied his adjustment of status application.it therefore directly follows from the plain language of the regulation that petitioner should be treated as an applicant for admission to the united states.id.
second,petitioner argument that he was not an applicant for admission because his parole back into the united states constituted an entry or admission,and because the government parole authorization form was a valid entry document,is undermined by the statute governing the grant of parole by immigration officials.section d a of the ina provides the attorney general with discretion to parole into the united states certain aliens who apply for admission.d a.the statute specifically states that parole of an alien shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien and that when the purposes of such parole shall have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the united states.id.emphasis added see also a a an alien who is paroled under section d shall not be considered to have been admitted.
the terms of this statute reflect the principle that congress did not intend for parole of an alien to constitute an alien legal entry or admission to the united states.see leng may ma barber,d united states ex rel.kordic esperdy,cir a parolee,even though physically in the country,is not regarded as having entered the country if he is required to leave the united states,he is being excluded,not expelled.instead,parole is a means by which the government allows aliens who have arrived at a to temporarily remain in the united states pending the review and adjudication of their immigration status.although paroled aliens physically enter the united states for a temporary period,they nevertheless remain constructively detained at the border,legally unadmitted,while their status is being resolved by immigration officials.see leng may ma,at.the parole of aliens seeking admission is simply a device through which needless confinement is avoided while administrative proceedings are conducted.it was never intended to affect an alien status,and to hold that petitioner parole placed her legally within the united states is inconsistent with the congressional mandate,the administrative concept of parole,and the decisions of this court.smith,th cir paroled aliens are considered detained at the border see also wong hing fun esperdy,cir marshall,same.
petitioner argues that his case is distinguishable from those cases cited above because he was not seeking admission for the first time but was,rather,a visa overstay returning to the united states with the government express permission.petitioner br.at.he thus argues that the bia exceeded its authority and contravened the purpose of the statute in treating him as an applicant for admission.id.this argument is unavailing.neither the governing statute nor the ins regulations provide any basis for the conclusion that a grant of advance parole warrants an exception to the principle that parole does not effect a legal entry or admission to the united states.petitioner was paroled pursuant to d a and presents no argument that he was entitled to enter the united states on any other basis.we therefore find no reason why the statute provision stating that parole of an alien shall not be regarded as an admission,should not be read to apply here.
moreover,to interpret the statute otherwise and deem petitioner an admitted visa overstay would ignore the fact that the government grant of advance parole merely constituted an agreement to allow for petitioner temporary return to the united states and to prevent the abandonment of his application.it did not constitute a promise to overlook all of the legal consequences of his departure.in particular,the government did not agree that petitioner would remain a visa overstay once he voluntarily departed the country.because visa overstays sacrifice their status as overstays when they leave the country and are not admissible on the basis of their expired visas should they subsequently appear at a,see a a i requiring a valid unexpired visa or other entry document for admission emphasis added,we reject petitioner argument that he was entitled to treatment either as an admitted alien or as a visa overstay when he returned to the country pursuant to his advance parole.
accordingly,the government parole of petitioner back into the united states in july did not constitute a,much less an admission,that reversed the legal effects of his previous departure,nor did his parole document afford him entry to the united states.petitioner left the united states with the government assurance merely that he would be granted a temporary,physical presence in the country upon his return for the sole purpose of completing his adjustment of status application.having been paroled into the country and denied an adjustment of status,petitioner can not now bootstrap his latest parole into a formal,legal.see zheng zheng gonzales,cir holding that because the petitioner with no legal status greater than that of a parolee,he is simply a paroled arriving alien.
although petitioner additionally relies on q to suggest that the definition of an arriving alien does not apply to him,this reliance is misplaced.q defines an arriving alien as follows 
the term arriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the united states at a,or an alien seeking transit through the united states at a an arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to section d of the act,except that an alien who was paroled before april,or an alien who was granted advance parole which the alien applied for and obtained in the united states prior to the alien departure from and return to the united states shall not be considered an arriving alien for purposes of ina section b a i.
q.petitioner does not appear to dispute that at the time he returned to the united states in july,and before he was paroled back into the country,he was an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the united states at a,and that the definition of an arriving alien therefore applied to him see matter of oseiwusu,i n,bia holding that aliens returning pursuant to a grant of advance parole are arriving aliens.instead,petitioner argues that a t the time the notice to appear issued,he had been paroled back into the country and was therefore no longer seeking inspection to the united states but,rather,had already arrived within the meaning of the regulation.petitioner br.at emphasis added.he thus contends that the termination of his advance parole status can not undue sic the grant of advance parole nunc pro tunc and make him an arriving alien.id.at.this argument is unavailing for two reasons.
first,petitioner argument that he was no longer an arriving alien when the notice to appear issued ignores the regulation command that an arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to ina section d.q emphasis added.the regulation carves out only two limited exceptions to this general principle,neither of which applies here.the first exception,for aliens paroled before april,does not apply because petitioner was most recently paroled in july of than a full year after the latest date covered by the exception.the second exception,for aliens who are granted advance parole,is rendered inapplicable to this particular petitioner by the exception narrow specification that such aliens shall not be regarded as arriving aliens for purposes of section b a i.id.section b a i of the ina is a statute that deals specifically with expedited removal proceedings.b a i.as the government correctly asserts,the regulation thus exempts an arriving alien who has been given advance parole from being put in expedited removal proceedings.respondent br.at.petitioner in the instant case was not put in expedited removal proceedings he was afforded a regular,hearing by immigration officials.therefore,neither the expedited removal statute,nor the exception set forth in q,applies to him.
second,petitioner argument that he was not an arriving alien at the time his notice to appear issued is further undermined by the terms of e i,which provides that upon termination of an alien parole,the alien shall be restored to the status that he or she had at the time of parole.e i emphasis added.contrary to petitioner assertion in his brief,petitioner br.at,the time of parole of an alien is not the time when the government provides advance authorization for the alien to be paroled upon his return to the united states.rather,the time of parole occurs when the alien is actually paroled into the country by immigration officials at a.see barney rogers,cir although petitioner received advance promise of parole upon her she was an illegal overstay,she was not paroled until she returned to the united states from abroad.accordingly,even if we accepted arguendo petitioner argument that he had arrived in the united states on the date he returned from his most recent sojourn abroad upon denial of his adjustment of status application,his status reverted to that which he held at the time he was paroled into the united states in july,that of an arriving alien seeking admission at our borders.see id.holding that a t the time of parole,as distinguished from the time of advance parole,a petitioner was an excludable alien like all aliens who seek admission to the united states at designated ports of entry.
thus,the statutory and regulatory framework governing administrative parole supports the ij and the bia conclusion that petitioner was an arriving alien properly subjected to a charge of inadmissibility.ins regulations manifest the agency intent to treat visa overstays who return to t
