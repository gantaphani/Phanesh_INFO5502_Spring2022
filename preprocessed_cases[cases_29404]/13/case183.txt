federal rule of criminal procedure governs guilty pleas.rule c instructs that t he court must not participate in plea discussions,and rule h states that a variance from the requirements of th e rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.rule a,which covers trial court errors generally,similarly prescribes any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.
respondent davila,while under indictment on multiple tax fraud charges,wrote to the district court,expressing dissatisfaction with his attorney.complaining that his attorney offered no defensive strategy,but simply advised him to plead guilty,davila requested new counsel.a magistrate judge held an in camera hearing at which davila and his attorney,but no representative of the united states,appeared.at the hearing,the magistrate judge told davila that he would not get another attorney and that his best course,given the strength of the government case,was to plead guilty.more than three months later,davila pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of other charges.he stated under oath before a district judge that he had not been forced or pressured to enter the plea,and he did not mention the in camera hearing before the magistrate judge.prior to sentencing,however,davila moved to vacate his plea and dismiss the indictment,asserting that he had entered the plea for a strategic reason,to force the government to acknowledge errors in the indictment.finding that davila plea had been knowing and voluntary,the district judge denied the motion.again,davila said nothing of the in camera hearing conducted by the magistrate judge.on appeal,the eleventh circuit,following circuit precedent,held that the magistrate judge violation of rule c required automatic vacatur of davila guilty plea,obviating any need to inquire whether the error was prejudicial.
held under rule h,vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to davila decision to plead guilty.
a rule c prohibition of judicial involvement in plea discussions was included in the amendment to the rule out of concern that a defendant might be induced to plead guilty rather than risk antagonizing the judge who would preside at trial.rule h was added in the amendment to make clear that rule errors are not excepted from rule a inquiry.rule also states,in subsection b,that a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the trial court attention.when rule a governs,the prosecution has the burden of showing harmlessness,but when rule b controls,the defendant must show that the error affects substantial rights.see united states vonn.
as clarified in vonn and united states dominguez benitez,rule error may be of the rule a type or the rule b kind,depending on when the error was raised.in vonn,the judge who conducted the plea hearing failed to inform the defendant,as required by rule c,that he would have the right to the assistance of counsel if he proceeded to trial.the defendant first objected to the omission on appeal.this court held that a silent defendant has the burden to satisfy rule b rule.at.in dominguez benitez,the error first raised on appeal was failure to warn the defendant,as rule c b instructs,that a plea could not be withdrawn even if the sentence imposed was higher than the sentence recommendation.the court again held that rule b controlled,and prescribed the standard a defendant silent until appeal must meet to show plain error,namely,a reasonable probability that,but for the rule error,he would not have entered the plea.at.
b here,the magistrate judge plainly violated rule c by exhorting davila to plead guilty.davila contends that automatic vacatur,while inappropriate for most rule violations,should attend conduct banned by rule c.he distinguishes omissions,errors of the kind involved in vonn and dominguez benitez,from exhortations to admit guilt.the former come into play after a defendant has decided to plead guilty,the latter,before a defendant has decided to plead guilty or to stand trial.nothing in rule text,however,indicates that the ban on judicial involvement in plea discussions,if dishonored,demands automatic vacatur without regard to circumstances.nor does the advisory committee commentary single out any rule instruction as more basic than others.and rule h,specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs,calls for application of the prescription or,absent prompt objection,the rule.
rule c was adopted as a prophylactic measure,not one impelled by the due process clause or any other constitutional requirement.thus,violation of the rule does not belong in the highly exceptional category of structural errors,denial of counsel of choice or denial of a public trial that trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of the entire criminal proceeding.united states marcus.instead,in assessing rule errors,a reviewing court must take account of all that transpired in the trial court.had davila guilty plea followed soon after the magistrate judge comments,the rule would have remained erroneous.the court of appeals mistake in that regard,however,might have been inconsequential,for the magistrate judge exhortations,if they immediately elicited a plea,would likely have qualified as prejudicial.here,however,three months distanced the in camera meeting conducted by the magistrate judge from davila appearance before the district judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea after an exemplary rule colloquy,at which davila had the opportunity to raise any questions he might have about matters relating to his plea.the court of appeals,therefore,should not have assessed the magistrate judge comments in isolation.instead,it should have considered,in light of the full record,whether it was reasonably probable that,but for the magistrate judge comments,davila would have exercised his right to go to trial.
c the court of appeals,having concluded that the magistrate judge comments violated rule c,cut off further consideration.it did not engage in a assessment of the particular facts of davila case or the arguments raised by the parties,including the government assertion that davila was not prejudiced by the magistrate judge comments,and davila contention that the extraordinary circumstances his case presents should allow his claim to be judged under rule a standard rather than rule b standard.the court decides only that the rule is incompatible with rule h and leaves all remaining issues to be addressed on remand.

united states,petitioner anthony davila 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which governs guilty pleas.two provisions of that rule are key here.the first,rule c,instructs that t he court must not participate in plea discussions.the second,rule h,states a variance from the requirements of th e rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.rule a,which covers trial court errors generally,similarly prescribes any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.
anthony davila,respondent here,entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to defraud the united states by filing false income tax returns.he maintains that he did so because a magistrate judge,at a in camera hearing and in flagrant violation of rule c,told him his best course,given the strength of the government case,was to plead guilty.three months later,davila entered a plea on advice of counsel.the hearing on davila plea,conducted by a district judge,complied in all respects with rule.
the question presented is whether,as the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held,the violation of rule c by the magistrate judge warranted automatic vacatur of davila guilty plea.we hold that rule h controls.under the inquiry that rule instructs,vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to davila decision to plead guilty.
in may,a federal grand jury in the southern district of georgia returned a indictment against respondent anthony davila.the indictment charged that davila filed over falsified tax returns,receiving over from the united states treasury as a result of his fraudulent scheme.
in january,davila sent a letter to the district court expressing dissatisfaction with his attorney and requesting new counsel.his attorney,davila complained,offered no defensive strategy,never mentioned a defense at all,but simply advised that he plead guilty in response to davila letter,a magistrate judge held an in camera hearing at which davila and his attorney,but no representative of the united states,appeared.at the start of the hearing,the magistrate judge told davila that he was free to represent himself,but would not get another attorney.see app.
addressing davila complaint that his attorney had advised him to plead guilty,the magistrate judge told davila that oftentimes that is the best advice a lawyer can give his client.at.in view of whatever the government evidence in a case might be,the judge continued,
it might be a good idea for the defendant to accept responsibility for his criminal conduct,to plead guilty,and go to sentencing with the best arguments still available without wasting the court time,and causing the government to have to spend a bunch of money empanelling a jury to try an open and shut case.ibid.
as to davila objection that his attorney had given him no options other than pleading guilty,the magistrate judge commented t here may not be a viable defense to these charges.at.the judge then urged davila to cooperate in order to gain a downward departure from the sentence indicated by the federal sentencing guidelines.t ry to understand,he counseled,
the government,they have all of the marbles in this situation and they can file that motion for a downward departure from the guidelines if they want to,you know,and the rules are constructed so that nobody can force them to file that motion for you.the only thing at your disposal that is entirely up to you is the two or three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.that means you got to go to the cross.you got to tell the probation officer everything you did in this case regardless of how bad it makes you appear to be because that is the way you get that reduction for acceptance,and believe me,davila,someone with your criminal history needs a reduction for acceptance.at.
davila sentencing guidelines range,the magistrate judge said,would probably be pretty bad because his criminal history score would be so high.at.to reduce his sentencing exposure,the magistrate judge suggested,davila could cooperate with the government in this or in other cases.ibid.as the hearing concluded,the judge again cautioned that to get the sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility,davila had to come to the cross 
t hat two or reduction for acceptance is something that you have the key to and you can ensure that you get that reduction in sentence simply by virtue of being forthcoming and not trying to make yourself look like you really did know what was going on.you got to go to the cross and you got to tell it all,brother,and convince that probation officer that you are being as open and honest with him as you can possibly be because then he will go to the d istrict j udge and he will say,you know,that davila guy,he got a long criminal history but when we were in there talking about this case he gave it all up so give him the,give him the reduction.at.
nearly a month after the in camera hearing,davila filed a motion demanding a speedy trial.the district court set a trial date for april,which was continued at the government request.
in may,more than three months after the hearing before the magistrate judge,davila agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for dismissal of the other counts charged in the indictment.davila entered his guilty plea before a district judge six days later.under oath,davila stated that he had not been forced or pressured to plead guilty,at.davila did not mention the in camera hearing before the magistrate judge,and the record does not indicate whether the district judge was aware that the hearing had taken place.see,at.
before he was sentenced,davila moved to vacate his plea and to dismiss the indictment.the reason for his plea,davila asserted,was strategic.at.aware that the prosecutor had a duty to disclose all information relevant to the court determination whether to accept the plea bargain,he stated that his purpose in entering the plea was to force the government to acknowledge timeframe errors made in the indictment,at.by pleading guilty,davila said,he would make the court aware that the prosecution was vindictive.at.
the district judge denied davila motion.in so ruling,the court observed that,at the plea hearing,davila had affirmed that he was under no pressure,threats,or promises,other than promises made by the government in the plea agreement.at.furthermore,he had been fully advised of his rights and the consequences of his plea,at.it was therefore clear to the district judge,who had himself presided at the plea hearing,that davila guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.at.in view of davila extensive criminal history,the court sentenced him to a prison term of months,at.again,neither davila nor the court mentioned the in camera hearing conducted by the magistrate judge,at.
on appeal,davila attorney sought leave to withdraw from the case,asserting,in a brief filed pursuant to anders california,that there were no issues of arguable merit to be raised on davila behalf.the eleventh circuit denied counsel motion without prejudice to renewal.app.to pet.for cert.it did so based on a discovery the appeals court made upon independent review of the record.that review revealed an irregularity in the statements of a magistrate judge,made during a hearing prior to davila plea,which appeared to urge him to cooperate and be candid about his criminal conduct to obtain favorable sentencing consequences.at.the court requested counsel to address whether the irregularity constituted reversible error under federal rule of criminal procedure c,at.
following the court instruction,counsel filed a brief arguing that davila plea should be set aside due to the magistrate judge comments.in response,the government conceded that those comments violated rule c.even so,the government urged,given the gap between the comments and the plea,and the fact that a different judge presided over davila plea and sentencing hearings,no adverse effect on davila substantial rights could be demonstrated.pursuant to circuit precedent,the appeals court held that the rule c violation required automatic vacatur of davila guilty plea.under the circuit bright line rule,the court explained,there was no need to inquire whether the error was,in fact,prejudicial,per curiam.
we granted certiorari to resolve a circuit conflict concerning the consequences of a rule c violation.
rule c prohibition of judicial involvement in plea discussions was introduced as part of the amendment to the rule.see advisory committee note on subd.e of fed.rule crim.proc,ed.hereinafter advisory committee note as the advisory committee note explains,commentators had observed,prior to the amendment,that judicial participation in plea negotiations was common practice.at citing newman,conviction the determination of guilt or innocence without trial,note,guilty plea bargaining compromises by prosecutors to secure guilty pleas.nonetheless,the prohibition was included out of concern that a defendant might be induced to plead guilty rather than
