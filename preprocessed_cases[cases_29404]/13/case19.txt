petitioner is a child with a severe form of cerebral palsy a trained service dog named wonder assists her with various daily life activities.when parents,petitioners stacy and brent fry,sought permission for wonder to join in kindergarten,officials at ezra eby elementary school refused.the officials reasoned that the human aide provided as part of individualized education program rendered the dog superfluous.in response,the frys removed from ezra eby and began homeschooling her.they also filed a complaint with the department of education office for civil rights ocr,claiming that the exclusion of service animal violated her rights under title ii and.ocr agreed,and school officials invited to return to ezra eby with wonder.but the frys,concerned about resentment from school officials,instead enrolled in a different school that welcomed the service dog.the frys then filed this suit in federal court against ezra eby local and regional school districts and principal collectively,the school districts,alleging that they violated title ii and and seeking declaratory and monetary relief.the district court granted the school districts motion to dismiss the suit,holding that l required the frys to first exhaust the idea administrative procedures.the sixth circuit affirmed,reasoning that l applies whenever a plaintiff alleged harms are educational in nature.
exhaustion of the idea administrative procedures is unnecessary where the gravamen of the plaintiff suit is something other than the denial of the idea core guarantee of a fape.
a the language of l compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks relief that is available under the idea.establishing the scope of l,then,requires identifying the circumstances in which the idea enables a person to obtain redress or access a benefit.that inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a fape in the statutory scheme.the idea stated purpose and specific commands center on ensuring a fape for children with disabilities.and the idea administrative procedures test whether a school has met this obligation any decision by a hearing officer on a request for substantive relief shall be based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.f e i.accordingly,l exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a fape.if a lawsuit charges such a denial,the plaintiff can not escape l merely by bringing the suit under a statute other than the idea.but if the remedy sought in a suit brought under a different statute is not for the denial of a fape,then exhaustion of the idea procedures is not required.
b in determining whether a plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a fape,what matters is the gravamen of the plaintiff complaint,setting aside any attempts at artful pleading.that inquiry makes central the plaintiff own claims,as l explicitly requires in asking whether a lawsuit in fact seeks relief available under the idea.but examination of a plaintiff complaint should consider substance,not surface l requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school failure to provide a fape,even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way.in addressing whether a complaint fits that description,a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities.the idea guarantees individually tailored educational services for children with disabilities,while title ii and promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions for people with disabilities of all ages.that is not to deny some overlap in coverage the same conduct might violate all three statutes.but still,these statutory differences mean that a complaint brought under title ii and might instead seek relief for simple discrimination,irrespective of the idea fape obligation.one clue to the gravamen of a complaint can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions.first,could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school second,could an adult at the school have pressed essentially the same grievance when the answer to those questions is yes,a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a fape is also unlikely to be truly about that subject.but when the answer is no,then the complaint probably does concern a fape.a further sign of the gravamen of a suit can emerge from the history of the proceedings.prior pursuit of the idea administrative remedies may provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff claim concerns the denial of a fape,even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.
this case is remanded to the court of appeals for a proper analysis of whether the gravamen of complaint charges,and seeks relief for,the denial of a fape.the frys complaint alleges only discrimination,without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services school provided.instead,the frys have maintained that the school districts infringed right to equal access even if their actions complied in full with the idea requirements.but the possibility remains that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different.the parties have not addressed whether the frys initially pursued the idea administrative remedies,and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts.on remand,the court below should establish whether or to what extent the frys invoked the idea dispute resolution process before filing suit.and if the frys started down that road,the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a fape,thus necessitating further exhaustion.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the individuals with disabilities education act idea or act,stat,as amended,et,ensures that children with disabilities receive needed special education services.one of its provisions,l,addresses the act relationship with other laws protecting those children.section l makes clear that nothing in the idea restrict s or limit s the rights or remedies that other federal laws,including antidiscrimination statutes,confer on children with disabilities.at the same time,the section states that if a suit brought under such a law seek s relief that is also available under the idea,the plaintiff must first exhaust the idea administrative procedures.in this case,we consider the scope of that exhaustion requirement.we hold that exhaustion is not necessary when the gravamen of the plaintiff suit is something other than the denial of the idea core guarantee what the act calls a free appropriate public education.a a.
the idea offers federal funds to states in exchange for a commitment to furnish a free appropriate public education more concisely known as a fape to all children with certain physical or intellectual disabilities.see a i listing covered disabilities.as defined in the act,a fape comprises special education and related services both instruction tailored to meet a child unique needs and sufficient supportive services to permit the child to benefit from that instruction,see board of ed.of hendrick hudson central school,westchester cty.rowley.an eligible child,as this court has explained,acquires a substantive right to such an education once a state accepts the idea financial assistance.smith robinson.
under the idea,an individualized education program,called an iep for short,serves as the primary vehicle for providing each child with the promised fape.honig doe,see d.welcome to and apologies for the acronymic world of federal legislation.crafted by a child iep team a group of school officials,teachers,and parents the iep spells out a personalized plan to meet all of the child educational needs.d a i ii bb,d b.most notably,the iep documents the child current levels of academic achievement,specifies measurable annual goals for how she can make progress in the general education curriculum,and lists the special education and related services to be provided so that she can advance appropriately toward those goals.d a i i,ii,iv aa.
because parents and school representatives sometimes can not agree on such issues,the idea establishes formal procedures for resolving disputes.to begin,a dissatisfied parent may file a complaint as to any matter concerning the provision of a fape with the local or state educational agency as state law provides.see b.that pleading generally triggers a p reliminary meeting involving the contending parties,f b i at their option,the parties may instead or also pursue a mediation process,see e.assuming their impasse continues,the matter proceeds to a due process hearing before an impartial hearing officer.f a see f a i.any decision of the officer granting substantive relief must be based on a determination of whether the child received a fape.f e i.if the hearing is initially conducted at the local level,the ruling is appealable to the state agency.see g.finally,a parent unhappy with the outcome of the administrative process may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in state or federal court.see i a.
important as the idea is for children with disabilities,it is not the only federal statute protecting their interests.of particular relevance to this case are two antidiscrimination laws title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and of the rehabilitation act,which cover both adults and children with disabilities,in both public schools and other settings.title ii forbids any public entity from discriminating based on disability section applies the same prohibition to any federally funded program or activity.a.a regulation implementing title ii requires a public entity to make reasonable modifications to its policies,practices,or procedures when necessary to avoid such discrimination.cfr b see,alboniga school bd.of broward,supp,sd requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under title ii.in similar vein,courts have interpreted as demanding certain reasonable modifications to existing practices in order to accommodate persons with disabilities.alexander choate,see,sullivan vallejo city unified school,supp,ed cal.requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under.and both statutes authorize individuals to seek redress for violations of their substantive guarantees by bringing suits for injunctive relief or money damages.see a.
this court first considered the interaction between such laws and the idea in smith robinson,the plaintiffs there sought to secure a free appropriate public education for their handicapped child.at.but instead of bringing suit under the idea alone,they appended virtually identical claims again alleging the denial of a free appropriate public education under of the rehabilitation act and the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause,at see,at.the court held that the idea altogether foreclosed those additional claims with its comprehensive and carefully tailored provisions,the act was the exclusive avenue through which a child with a disability or his parents could challenge the adequacy of his education,at see,at.
congress was quick to respond.in the handicapped children protection act of,stat,it overturned smith preclusion of claims while also adding a carefully defined exhaustion requirement.now codified at l,the relevant provision of that statute reads 
nothing in the idea shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,the ada,title v of the rehabilitation act including,or other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under the idea,the idea administrative procedures shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under the idea.
the first half of l up until except that reaffirm s the viability of federal statutes like the ada or rehabilitation act as separate vehicles,no less integral than the idea,for ensuring the rights of handicapped children.see,at.according to that opening phrase,the idea does not prevent a plaintiff from asserting claims under such laws even if,as in smith itself,those claims allege the denial of an appropriate public education much as an idea claim would.but the second half of l from except that onward imposes a limit on that anything goes regime,in the form of an exhaustion provision.according to that closing phrase,a plaintiff bringing suit under the ada,the rehabilitation act,or similar laws must in certain circumstances that is,when seeking relief that is also available under the idea first exhaust the idea administrative procedures.the reach of that requirement is the issue in this case.
petitioner is a child with a severe form of cerebral palsy,which significantly limits her motor skills and mobility.app.to brief in opposition,complaint when was five years old,her parents petitioners stacy and brent fry obtained a trained service dog for her,as recommended by her pediatrician.the dog,a goldendoodle named wonder,help s to live as independently as possible by assisting her with various life activities,at.in particular,wonder aids by retrieving dropped items,helping her balance when she uses her walker,opening and closing doors,turning on and off lights,helping her take off her coat,and helping her transfer to and from the toilet.at.
but when the frys sought permission for wonder to join in kindergarten,officials at ezra eby elementary school refused the request.under existing iep,a human aide provided with support throughout the day that assistance,the school officials thought,rendered wonder superfluous.in the words of one administrator,wonder should be barred from ezra eby because all of physical and academic needs were being met through the accommodations that the school had already agreed to,at.later that year,the school officials briefly allowed wonder to accompany to school on a trial basis but even then,the dog was required to remain in the back of the room during classes,and was forbidden from assisting with many tasks he had been specifically trained to do.and when the trial period concluded,the administrators again informed the frys that wonder was not welcome.as a result,the frys removed from ezra eby and began homeschooling her.
in addition,the frys filed a complaint with the department of education office for civil rights ocr,charging that ezra eby exclusion of service animal violated her rights under title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act.following an investigation,ocr agreed.the office explained in its decision letter that a school obligations under those statutes go beyond providing educational services a school could offer a fape to a child with a disability but still run afoul of the laws ban on discrimination.see app.and here,ocr found,ezra eby had indeed violated that ban,even if its use of a human aide satisfied the fape standard.see,at.ocr analogized the school conduct to requir ing a student who uses a wheelchair to be carried by an aide or requir ing a blind student to be led around by a teacher instead of permitting him to use a guide dog or cane,at.regardless whether those or ezra eby policies denied a fape,they violated title ii and by discriminating against children with disabilities.see,at.
in response to ocr decision,school officials at last agreed that could come to school with wonder.but after meeting with ezra eby principal,the frys became concerned that the school administration would resent and make her return to school difficult.app.to brief in opposition.accordingly,the frys found a different public school,in a different district,where administrators and teachers enthusiastically received both and wonder.
the frys then filed this suit in federal court against the local and regional school districts in which ezra eby is located,along with the school principal collectively,the school districts.the complaint alleged that the school districts violated title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act by denying equal access to ezra eby and its programs,refus ing to reasonably accommodate use of a service animal,and otherwise discriminat ing against as a person with disabilities.at.according to the complaint,suffered harm as a result of that discrimination,including emotional distress and pain,embarrassment,and mental anguish.at.in their prayer for relief,the frys sought a declaration that the school districts had violated title ii and,along with money damages to compensate for injuries.
the district court granted the school districts motion to dismiss the suit,holding that l required the frys to first exhaust the idea administrative procedures.see app.to pet.for cert.a divided panel of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed on the same ground.in that court view,l applies if the injuries alleged in a suit relate to the specific substantive protections of the idea.and that means,the court continued,that exhaustion is necessary whenever the genesis and the manifestations of the harms were educational in nature,at quoting charlie board of ed.of skokie school dist.on that understanding of l,the sixth circuit held,the frys suit could not proceed because the harms to were generally educational most notably,the court reasoned,because wonder absence hurt her sense of independence and social confidence at school the frys had to exhaust the idea procedures,at.judge daughtrey dissented,emphasizing that in bringing their title ii and claims,the frys did not allege the denial of a fape or seek to modify iep in any way.at.
we granted certiorari to address confusion in the courts of appeals as to the scope of l exhaustion requirement.we now vacate the sixth circuit decision.
section l requires that a plaintiff exhaust the idea procedures before filing an action under the ada,the rehabilitation act,or similar laws when but only when her suit seek s relief that is also available under the idea.we first hold that to meet that statutory standard,a suit must seek relief for the denial of a fape,because that is the only relief the idea makes available.we next conclude that in determining whether a suit indeed seeks relief for such a denial,a court should look to the substance,or gravamen,of the plaintiff complaint 
in this court,the parties have reached substantial agreement about what relief the idea makes available for children with disabilities and about how the sixth circuit went wrong in addressing that question.the frys maintain that such a child can obtain remedies under the idea for decisions that deprive her of a fape,but none for those that do not.so in the frys view,l exhaustion requirement can come into play only when a suit concerns the denial of a fape and not,as the sixth circuit held,when it merely has some articulable connection to the education of a child with a disability.see reply brief.the school districts,for their part,also believe that the sixth circuit exhaustion standard goes too far because it could mandate exhaustion when a plaintiff is seeking relief that is not in substance available under the idea.brief for respondents.and in particular,the school districts acknowledge that the idea makes remedies available only in suits that directly implicate a fape so that only in those suits can l apply.tr.of oral arg.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the parties shared view the only relief that an idea officer can give hence the thing a plaintiff must seek in order to trigger l exhaustion rule is relief for the denial of a fape.
we begin,as always,with the statutory language at issue,which at risk of repetition compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks relief that is available under the idea.the ordinary meaning of relief in the context of a lawsuit is the redress or benefit that attends a favorable judgment.black law dictionary ed.and such relief is available,as we recently explained,when it is accessible or may be obtained.ross blake,slip,at quoting webster third new international dictionary.so to establish the scope of l,we must identify the circumstances in which the idea enables a person to obtain redress or,similarly,to access a benefit.
that inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a fape in the statutory scheme.in its first section,the idea declares as its first purpose to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.d a.that principal purpose then becomes the act principal command a state receiving federal funding under the idea must make such an education available to all children with disabilities.a a.the guarantee of a fape to those children gives rise to the bulk of the statute more specific provisions.for example,the iep the centerpiece of the statute education delivery system serves as the vehicle or means of providing a fape.honig,at rowley,at see supra,at.and finally,as all the above suggests,the fape requirement provides the yardstick for measuring the adequacy of the education that a school offers to a child with a disability under that standard,this court has held,a child is entitled to meaningful access to education based on her individual needs.rowley,at 
the idea administrative procedures test whether a school has met that obligation and so center on the act fape requirement.as noted earlier,any decision by a hearing officer on a request for substantive relief shall be based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.f e i see supra,at or said in latin in the idea administrative process,a fape denial is the sine qua non.suppose that a parent complaint protests a school failure to provide some accommodation for a child with a disability.if that accommodation is needed to fulfill the idea fape requirement,the hearing officer must order relief.but if it is not,he can not even though the dispute is between a child with a disability and the school she attends.there might be good reasons,unrelated to a fape,for the school to make the requested accommodation.indeed,another federal law like the ada or rehabilitation act might require the accommodation on one of those alternative grounds.see infra,at.but still,the hearing officer can not provide the requested relief.his role,under the idea,is to enforce the child substantive right to a fape.smith,at.and that is all 
for that reason,l exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a free appropriate public education.if a lawsuit charges such a denial,the plaintiff can not escape l merely by bringing her suit under a statute other than the idea as when,for example,the plaintiffs in smith claimed that a school failure to provide a fape also violated the rehabilitation act rather,that plaintiff must first submit her case to an idea hearing officer,experienced in addressing exactly the issues she raises.but if,in a suit brought under a different statute,the remedy sought is not for the denial of a fape,then exhaustion of the idea procedures is not required.after all,the plaintiff could not get any relief from those procedures a hearing officer,as just explained,would have to send her away.and that is true even when the suit arises directly from a school treatment of a child with a disability and so could be said to relate in some way to her education.a school conduct toward such a child say,some refusal to make an accommodation might injure her in ways unrelated to a fape,which are addressed in statutes other than the idea.a complaint seeking redress for those other harms,independent of any fape denial,is not subject to l exhaustion rule because,once again,the only relief the idea makes available is relief for the denial of a fape.
still,an important question remains how is a court to tell when a plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a fape and when she does not here,too,the parties have found some common ground by looking,they both say,to the substance of,rather than the labels used in,the plaintiff complaint.brief for respondents reply brief.and here,too,we agree with that view what matters is the crux or,in,the gravamen of the plaintiff complaint,setting aside any attempts at artful pleading.
that inquiry makes central the plaintiff own claims,as l explicitly requires.the statutory language asks whether a lawsuit in fact seeks relief available under the idea not,as a stricter exhaustion statute might,whether the suit could have sought relief available under the idea or,what is much the same,whether any remedies are available under that law.see brief for united states as amicus curiae contrasting l with the exhaustion provision in the prison litigation reform act,a.in effect,l treats the plaintiff as the master of the claim she identifies its remedial basis and is subject to exhaustion or not based on that choice.caterpillar williams,and.a court deciding whether l applies must therefore examine whether a plaintiff complaint the principal instrument by which she describes her case seeks relief for the denial of an appropriate education.
but that examination should consider substance,not surface.the use or of particular labels and terms is not what matters.the inquiry,for example,does not ride on whether a complaint includes or,alternatively,omits the precise words fape or iep.after all,l premise is that the plaintiff is suing under a statute other than the idea,like the rehabilitation act in such a suit,the plaintiff might see no need to use the idea distinctive language even if she is in essence contesting the adequacy of a special education program.and still more critically,a magic words approach would make l exhaustion rule too easy to bypass.just last term,a similar worry led us to hold that a court jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act turns on the gravamen,or essentials,of the plaintiff suit.obb personenverkehr ag sachs,slip,at.a ny other approach,we explained,would allow plaintiffs to evade the act restrictions through artful pleading.at slip,at.so too here.section l is not merely a pleading hurdle.it requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school failure to provide a fape,even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way.
in addressing whether a complaint fits that description,a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities the idea on the one hand,the ada and rehabilitation act most notably on the other.the idea,of course,protects only children well,really,adolescents too and concerns only their schooling.a a.and as earlier noted,the statute goal is to provide each child with meaningful access to education by offering individualized instruction and related services appropriate to her unique needs.see rowley,at,supra,at.by contrast,title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act cover people with disabilities of all ages,and do so both inside and outside schools.and those statutes aim to root out discrimination,enabling each covered person sometimes by means of reasonable accommodations to participate equally to all others in public facilities and federally funded programs.see supra,at.in short,the idea guarantees individually tailored educational services,while title ii and promise access to public institutions.that is not to deny some overlap in coverage the same conduct might violate all three statutes which is why,as in smith,a plaintiff might seek relief for the denial of a fape under title ii and as well as the idea.but still,the statutory differences just discussed mean that a complaint brought under title ii and might instead seek relief for simple discrimination,irrespective of the idea fape obligation.
one clue to whether the gravamen of a complaint against a school concerns the denial of a fape,or instead addresses discrimination,can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions.first,could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school say,a public theater or library and second,could an adult at the school say,an employee or visitor have pressed essentially the same grievance when the answer to those questions is yes,a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a fape is also unlikely to be truly about that subject after all,in those other situations there is no fape obligation and yet the same basic suit could go forward.but when the answer is no,then the complaint probably does concern a fape,even if it does not explicitly say so for the fape requirement is all that explains why only a child in the school setting not an adult in that setting or a child in some other has a viable claim.
take two contrasting examples.suppose first that a child sues his school for discrimination under title ii again,without mentioning the denial of a fape because the building lacks access ramps.in some sense,that architectural feature has educational consequences,and a different lawsuit might have alleged that it violates the idea after all,if the child can not get inside the school,he can not receive instruction there and if he must be carried inside,he may not achieve the sense of independence conducive to academic or later to success.but is the denial of a fape really the gravamen of the plaintiff title ii complaint consider that the child could file the same basic complaint if a municipal library or theater had no ramps.and similarly,an employee or visitor could bring a mostly identical complaint against the school.that the claim can stay the same in those alternative scenarios suggests that its essence is equality of access to public facilities,not adequacy of special education.see supra,at describing ocr use of a similar example.and so l does not require exhaustion 
but suppose next that a student with a learning disability sues his school under title ii for failing to provide remedial tutoring in mathematics.that suit,too,might be cast as one for discrimination,grounded on the school refusal to make a reasonable accommodation the complaint might make no reference at all to a fape or an iep.but can anyone imagine the student making the same claim against a public theater or library or,similarly,imagine an adult visitor or employee suing the school to obtain a math tutorial the difficulty of transplanting the complaint to those other contexts suggests that its essence even though not its wording is the provision of a fape,thus bringing l into play 
a further sign that the gravamen of a suit is the denial of a fape can emerge from the history of the proceedings.in particular,a court may consider that a plaintiff has previously invoked the idea formal procedures to handle the dispute thus starting to exhaust the act remedies before s
