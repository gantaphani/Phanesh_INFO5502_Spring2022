we conclude that petitioners contact with immigration officials at the airport was not a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment because no force,threat of force,or other assertion of authority was used by the officials.because petitioners were not seized,the statements obtained from petitioners by the immigration officials were properly admitted.
background 
petitioners,brothers who are natives and citizens of guatemala,arrived at john kennedy airport in new york on a flight from los angeles on february.as they disembarked from the plane,immigration agents in plainclothes approached them and asked them,in spanish,about their immigration status.when petitioners admitted that they were in the united states illegally,the officers detained them and conducted additional questioning.as part of the questioning,both petitioners signed sworn statements conceding that they entered the united states unlawfully and were in the united states in violation of immigration law.
shortly after the events at the airport,the ins commenced removal proceedings against petitioners.petitioners did not file applications for relief from removal or contest their status but,instead,moved to suppress the evidence obtained during their questioning at the airport on the basis that they had been stopped at the airport solely on the basis of their race and nationality.respondents contended that petitioners were apprehended pursuant to a larger interdiction project conducted by the former immigration and naturalization service ins.in support of their position,respondents submitted a declaration from the agent who signed off on the form documenting petitioners apprehension.although the agent was not present when petitioners were interviewed and detained,he was the supervisor of the operation under which petitioners were selected for questioning.
the declaration explained that the ins,after observ ing various trends in the routes taken by aliens illegally smuggled into the country,had developed a protocol for identifying and questioning suspected smugglers and their clients.plainclothes agents would approach individuals as they were disembarking from a plane,ask whether they would be willing to speak to the agents,and permit them to walk away if they did not.if an individual agreed to speak to the agents,he would be taken to a separate area,where the agents would reveal their identities and ask him questions about his immigration status.according to the protocol,t he questioning at this point would also be voluntary.if the person did not want to answer the questions he would be free to leave.individuals who provided sufficient information to establish alienage and removability would be taken into custody and transported to an ins office for processing.the agent described the criteria used in the protocol as follows 
in determining who would be identified for questioning,the protocol dictated that agents look for passengers typically of mestizo physical appearance a person of mixed spanish and american blood sic who would be inappropriately dressed in light of the season,they would not be wearing or carrying cold weather coats in the winter.the targeted people would also generally not have any baggage and bypass the baggage claim.they often would also carry airline issued food with them off the plane.
petitioners arrived in new york on one of the flights identified by the ins as likely to contain illegal aliens.
the ij,after reviewing the parties submissions on the appropriateness of suppression,held a hearing to take testimony from petitioners regarding the circumstances under which they were approached and questioned.petitioners testified that they did not meet any of the criteria in the protocol other than and racial characteristics they were wearing jackets,had checked luggage,and did not take airline food with them.they further testified that,as they left the plane,they were approached by a man dressed in casual clothing who asked if they had papers and inquired whether they had permission to stay in this country.both answered these questions in the negative.ismar stated that he answered the questions rather than walking away because the individual asking the questions was standing in front of him and could have pulled him back.efraulio stated that he agreed to speak with the agent because other passengers from the of whom were described by the as spanish were being questioned at the same time.both petitioners testified that the immigration officials did not identify themselves as such until after petitioners admitted that they were in the country illegally.petitioners were then transported to another location where they were questioned by the same agents and signed the statements conceding their unlawful entry.
based on petitioners testimony,the ij concluded that the petitioners contact with immigration officials at the airport was not a stop or seizure because they spoke to the agents voluntarily.
petitioners did not testify to any actions by the agent s that would be intimidating.there was no testimony that voices were raised or that threats were made.no one told petitioners that they had to answer the question s or that certain consequences would flow from not answering the questions.
the ij also observed that the circumstances,as described by petitioners,were such that a reasonable person would have believed himself free to leave the officers were in plainclothes,did not identify themselves as immigration officials and had no other physical example,them as law enforcement officials.as the ij noted for all petitioners knew the person who asked them about their status was a civilian the ij further concluded that even if petitioners had been seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment,their detention and questioning was not so egregious as to justify suppression.
the bia summarily dismissed petitioners appeal,and petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of that decision.after determining that there was no stop or seizure at the airport and that there was nothing unreasonable or egregious about the officer s encounter with the petitioners,the bia denied petitioners motion for reconsideration.

our immigration laws permit an immigration official to interrogate without a warrant any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the united states.a.the applicable regulations governing interrogation and detention not amounting to arrest,b,state that 
interrogation is questioning designed to elicit specific information.an immigration officer,like any other person,has the right to ask questions of anyone as long as the immigration officer does not restrain the freedom of an individual,not under arrest,to walk away.
