the ice storm referred to in the letter occurred in january of and caused extensive damage throughout northwestern vermont,including the city of south burlington.on january,president clinton declared vermont a federal disaster area eligible for public assistance funds under the disaster relief act,et.the federal emergency management agency,popularly known as fema,was the federal agency responsible for administering the federal disaster funds made available to the city.in addition to claims for other services performed,the city sought and received reimbursement for meals provided to firefighters during ice storm operations.according to the letter,no such meals were provided,the invoices for the meals were false,and fire chief was responsible for the claim.those referred to in the letter as and interior qualified firefighters were the city unpaid volunteer firefighters,whose numbers were said to have been diminished due to dissatisfaction with the fire chief.the letter purported to be written by an unnamed firefighter.
the letter generated a number of inquiries and reports.in a letter dated january,scott merchant of the south burlington firefighter association,responding to an inquiry by chief,reported that t he actual receipts were lost in the confusion of various people picking up the meals.invoices based upon estimates therefore were sent to fema as receipts to support the meal expenses claimed.the letter concluded it is very disheartening when someone attacks the credibility of an organization such as the and south burlington fire dept,who has sic done countless things to support and contribute to the community they serve.
by memorandum to city manager hafter,dated january,chief reported that he had reviewed the documentation submitted for the reimbursement and had discussed the documentation requirements with fema representatives.reported that he had turned over to fema the copies of the receipts received from scott merchant.by memorandum to john mcgough of fema region,dated february,fema inspector frederick costello reported that he had investigated the meal reimbursment claim described in the letter and found all records to be in order and kept in accordance with fema region guidelines.he concluded his report as follows fire chief michael says the anonymous l etter is currently under investigation.
the investigation referred to was undertaken by the city police department and,apparently,was instigated by city manager hafter,to whom a copy of the letter had been sent.detective gary small was assigned to the case.he interviewed chief,who reported his suspicion that a paid firefighter,leon brown,had written the letter.the chief said that brown was upset and unhappy about a number of problems in his low score on a promotion exam injuries sustained in a car accident an extended sick leave resulting from the accident and extensive damage to his house as the result of a fire next door.
detective small also interviewed captain ken dattilio,who was brown supervisor in the fire department.dattilio related that he,too,suspected that brown was the letter author.dattilio opined that brown had been depressed lately,referring to some of the same problems cited by chief.dattilio was of the opinion that brown felt hated by chief and may have had something to do with the false claims involving chief.dattilio also noted that brown had been on some medication because of his health issues.detective small investigation included a comparison of envelopes and labels sent from the brown residence with the envelope and label used for the letter.
on february,detective small and captain dattilio interviewed leon brown.early in the interview,brown said i feel relieved that the l etter has come to sic and admitting it,yes,i did type it up and i am the only one that acted on it and i am very sorry for ever doing it.in the interview,brown went on to describe his perceived problems with chief the damage to his house as a cause of financial difficulties a serious automobile accident and consequent extended sick leave and a poor showing on his promotion examination.when asked whether the chief had any involvement illegally with any of the funds from fema,brown responded that he did not know but that no meals had been provided and that sonny audette,the emergency management coordinator at the fire department,had contest ed signing the slips for the meal reimbursement.
by confidential memorandum to city manager hafter,dated february,chief provided an update on the investigation into the letter.the chief noted that the letter had accused him of certain improprieties and that the accusations ha d proven to be false.the chief,reporting that brown had admitted to writing the letter,noted that various members of the department felt that,because brown wrote the letter,they would be unable to trust him or to work with him.brown attempt to cast responsibility for the letter on the call staff by referring in the letter to us firefighter sic was also cited as detrimental to fire department morale.reporting that the members of the fire department considered brown untrustworthy and that he had brought shame and disgrace on the department by writing the letter,chief recommended that brown employment be terminated.
by letter dated february,brown was advised by city manager hafter that he had received the recommendation and that he would be conducting his own inquiries.thereafter,hafter apparently gave brown the option of resignation or termination.by letter dated march,brown resigned from the fire department and executed a general release the release of all claims against the city in consideration of the payment of.in a letter dated the same day,hafter accepted brown resignation and set forth an hourly breakdown of items for which brown was paid.these items included accrued vacation time,compensatory time,two weeks severance pay,two weeks sick leave,and an item designated personal leave.other than the two weeks severance pay,it appears that all the items were due any employee of the city upon termination of employment.
after his resignation,brown continued to press fema for further investigation of the claim for meal reimbursement.a further investigation was conducted,and fema determined that the claim was indeed fraudulent.sometime thereafter,it became apparent that and hafter were involved in the scheme.hafter,knowing that the meals had not been provided,had authorized the false claim to proceed,likening it to a grant application.had acquired the proceeds of the claim through the had used the money to purchase exercise equipment in canada for the fire department.consequently,a complaint in an action against the city was filed by the united states attorney for the district of vermont on behalf of the government under the false claims act,seeking treble damages and a civil penalty.according to the complaint,the city claim for disaster relief included a reimbursement of for meals that never were provided.the city stipulated to the entry of judgment in the action in the sum of on october.
by memorandum to city manager hafter dated january,brown sought to be reimbursed for additional earned sick time that he claimed to have accumulated through march of.in the memorandum,he reviewed the events that led to his dismissal and noted that his allegations of fraudulent meal claims had been proved correct by the later fema investigation.having received no response,on october,brown filed a complaint the complaint in the united states court for the district of vermont,thus commencing the action giving rise to this appeal.
defendants moved for summary judgment in the action,and the motion was referred to magistrate judge jerome niedermeier for a report and recommendation.the magistrate judge undertook a thorough examination of all of the issues presented in the motion for summary judgment and,on april,filed a detailed,report and recommendation the first report.
as to defendants contention that brown was barred by the release from asserting any of his claims,the magistrate judge found a triable issue as to brown assertion that he was induced to sign the release by defendants fraudulent misrepresentations made in connection with the meal reimbursement.the magistrate judge therefore recommended that the court deny summary judgment on the issue of the validity of the release.addressing the false claims act,vermont wrongful termination,and first amendment claims,the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment in favor of hafter and in their individual capacities.the magistrate judge reported i that the claim of retaliatory discharge under the false claims act had to be dismissed as against the individual defendants because individual supervisors are not employers under the act ii that the vermont state law claim for wrongful termination should have been brought against the municipality rather than the individuals,pursuant to a vermont statutory provision and iii that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on brown first amendment claim because they had acted in good faith in discharging brown on the basis of a reasonable fear of disruption and on an objectively reasonable belief that they could lawfully terminate brown employment because of the potentially disruptive effect of the letter.
with respect to the merits of the first amendment claim,the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment in favor of defendants.the magistrate judge reported that an anonymous letter publicizing internal grievances would be cause for discharge absent the protected speech and that defendants could reasonably believe that an anonymous letter asserting the dissatisfaction of firefighters could lead to strife within the fire department.the first report further indicated that defendants had performed an adequate investigation regarding the potentially disruptive nature of the speech.
the magistrate judge recommended denial of defendants summary judgment motion,however,insofar as it pertained to the false claims act retaliation claim and the vermont state law claim.the magistrate judge reported that there was a triable issue as to whether brown discharge was a retaliation for the protected activity of protesting a false claim.the first report noted that there was no authority allowing a defendant to avoid the retaliatory discharge claim under the false claims act upon a mere showing that a letter describing a false claim would be disruptive.the magistrate judge was of the opinion that vermont would recognize an exception to the employment rule of that state in a case for retaliation against a whistleblower and that a factual question was sufficiently presented for the vermont state law claim to survive the summary judgment motion.
on may,in a,unpublished opinion ruling on the parties objections to the first report,the district court addressed only the issue of the release.the court agreed that brown had raised genuine issues of fact as to whether the release was procured by fraud.the court noted,however,that in their motion for reconsideration of the first report treated by the court as a timely objection to same,defendants argued that brown had failed to tender the consideration he received for the release and that this failure constituted ratification of the release.since this argument had not been raised before magistrate judge niedermeier,the district court,by order dated may,recommitted the matter to the magistrate judge to determine whether the argument had been properly raised,its merits,and its effect,if any,upon brown remaining claims.
on august,in a report and recommendation the second report responding to the recommittal order,the magistrate judge,having found that the defense of ratification was properly raised and established,recommended summary judgment in favor of defendants on the basis of the release.the magistrate judge determined that,although not specifically raised as a defense,ratification could be considered to be included in the defense of release.moreover,the magistrate judge recommended that if the ratification defense could not be inferred as interposed in this way,then defendants motion to amend their answer to include the defense should be granted.
the second report noted that proper consideration had been given for the release,including payment for two items to which terminated employees ordinarily were not entitled two weeks severance pay,to which brown admitted he was not entitled,and unused sick leave.the magistrate judge reported that any economic duress rendering the release ineffective would have been removed by october,by which time brown was reemployed and had received a substantial settlement on the claim arising from the automobile accident in which he had been injured.the magistrate judge also reported that brown knew of the purported misrepresentations by january,when he wrote a letter to defendants demanding additional money.the second report stated that because brown did not offer to tender back the consideration until may,long after he knew of the alleged misrepresentations in regard to the release,and after removal of any economic duress,the tender back offer was untimely,and the ratification defense should therefore be sustained.
on september,in a,unpublished opinion,the district court ruled on brown objections to the second report.the court rejected the objection to the timeliness of the ratification defense,agreeing with the second report that there was no undue delay or prejudice in allowing defendants to amend their answer to raise that defense.the second objection,that the release was void as against public policy,was rejected because releases of private claims under the false claims act are permitted.as to the third objection,the district court found that there was ample support in the record for the magistrate judge conclusion that any economic duress ceased when brown obtained other employment and settled his personal injury lawsuit.the fourth objection,that there was no consideration for the release,was rejected for the reasons given in the second report.
as for the final objection,that the defense of ratification is inapplicable because ordinary contract principles do not apply to releases under the false claims act,the district court rule
