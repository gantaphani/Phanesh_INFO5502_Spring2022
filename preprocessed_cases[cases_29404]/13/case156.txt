respondents,various benefit funds funds,sued petitioner ray haluch gravel haluch in federal district court to collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law.the funds also sought attorney fees and costs,which were obligations under both a federal statute and the parties collective bargaining agreement cba.the district court issued an order on june,on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on july on the funds motion for fees and costs.the funds appealed both decisions on august.haluch argued that the june order was a final decision pursuant to,and thus,the funds notice of appeal was untimely since it was not filed within the federal rules of appellate procedure deadline.the funds disagreed,arguing that there was no final decision until july.the first circuit acknowledged that an unresolved attorney fees issue generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final,but held that no final decision was rendered until july since the entitlement to fees and costs provided for in the cba was an element of damages and thus part of the merits.accordingly,the first circuit addressed the appeal with respect to both the unpaid contributions and the fees and costs.
held the appeal of the june decision was untimely.
a this case has instructive similarities to budinich becton dickinson.there,this court held a district court judgment to be a final decision for purposes despite an unresolved motion for attorney fees,noting that fee awards do not remedy the injury giving rise to the action,are often available to the defending party,and were,at common law,an element of costs awarded to a prevailing party,not a part of the merits judgment,at.even if laws authorizing fees might sometimes treat them as part of the merits,considerations of operational consistency and predictability in the overall application of favored a uniform rule.at.
b the funds attempts to distinguish budinich fail.
their claim that contractual attorney fees provisions are always a measure of damages is unpersuasive,for such provisions often provide attorney fees to prevailing defendants.more basic,budinich uniform rule did not depend on whether the law authorizing a particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits,at,and there is no reason to depart from that sound reasoning here.the operational consistency stressed in budinich is not promoted by providing for different jurisdictional effect based solely on whether an asserted right to fees is based on contract or statute.nor is predictability promoted since it is not always clear whether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory.the funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation,but the budinich court was aware of such concerns when it adopted a uniform rule,and it suffices to say that those concerns are counterbalanced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed,especially given the complexity and amount of time it may take to resolve attorney fees claims.furthermore,the federal rules of civil procedure provide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in many cases.see,rules d,e.complex variations in statutory and contractual provisions also counsel against treating attorney fees claims authorized by contract and statute differently for finality purposes.the budinich rule looks solely to the character of the issue that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits.the funds suggest that it is unclear whether budinich applies where,as here,nonattorney professional fees are included in a motion for attorney fees and costs.they are mistaken to the extent that they suggest that such fees will be claimed only where a contractual fee claim is involved.many statutes authorize courts to award related litigation expenses like expert fees,see west virginia.hospitals,casey,and there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell that budinich remains applicable where such fees are claimed and awarded incidental to attorney fees.
the funds claim that fees accrued prior to the commencement of litigation fall outside the scope of budinich is also unpersuasive.budinich referred to fees for the litigation in question,at,or attributable to the case,at,but this court has observed that some of the services performed before a lawsuit is formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are performed on the litigation,webb dyer county bd.of.here,the fees for investigation,preliminary legal research,drafting of demand letters,and working on the initial complaint fit the description of standard preliminary steps toward litigation.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from final decisions of united states district courts.in budinich becton dickinson,this court held that a decision on the merits is a final decision under even if the award or amount of attorney fees for the litigation remains to be determined.the issue in this case is whether a different result obtains if the unresolved claim for attorney fees is based on a contract rather than,or in addition to,a statute.the answer here,for purposes of and the federal rules of civil procedure,is that the result is not different.whether the claim for attorney fees is based on a statute,a contract,or both,the pendency of a ruling on an award for fees and costs does not prevent,as a general rule,the merits judgment from becoming final for purposes of appeal.
petitioner ray haluch gravel haluch is a landscape supply company.under a agreement cba with the international union of operating engineers,local,haluch was required to pay contributions to benefit funds.various of those funds are respondents here.
in,respondents funds commissioned an audit to determine whether haluch was meeting its obligations under the cba.based on the audit,the funds demanded additional contributions.haluch refused to pay,and the funds filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.
the funds alleged that haluch failure to make the required contributions was a violation of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the labor management relations act.the funds also sought attorney and auditor fees and costs,under g d of erisa,stat,g d providing for reasonable attorney fees and costs of the action,to be paid by the defendant and the cba itself,app.to pet.for cert.providing that a ny costs,including legal fees,of collecting payments due these funds shall be borne by the defaulting employer 
at the conclusion of a bench trial,the district court asked the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to allow the court to consider both the possibility of enforcing a settlement and a decision on the merits at the same time.tr.these submissions were due on march.the district court went on to observe that u nder our rules if there is a judgment for the plaintiffs,typically a motion for attorney fees can be filed shortly thereafter,at.it also noted that,o n the other hand,attorney fees is part of the damages potentially here.ibid.it gave the plaintiffs the option to offer a submission with regard to fees along with their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,or to wait to see if i find in your favor and submit the fee petition later on.ibid.
the funds initially chose to submit their fee petition at the same time as their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,but they later changed course.they requested an extension of time to file their request for reimbursement of attorneys fees and costs in the above matter.motion to extend time to submit request for attorneys fees in d.the district court agreed and on april,the funds moved for an o rder awarding the total attorneys fees and costs incurred in attempting to collect this delinquency,in obtaining the audit,in protecting plaintiffs interests,and in protecting the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.app.the motion alleged that t hose fees and costs amount to,and stated that d efendants are liable for these monies pursuant to erisa,and for the reasons detailed in the accompanying affidavit.ibid.the accompanying affidavit in support of the application for attorneys fees and costs,in turn,cited the parties agreements including the cba,as well as related trust agreements and g d of erisa,at.
as to the merits of the claim that haluch had underpaid,on june,the district court issued a memorandum and order ruling that the funds were entitled to certain unpaid contributions,though less than had been requested.international union of operating engineers,local health and welfare,pension and annuity funds ray haluch gravel,supp.a judgment in favor of the funds in the amount of was issued the same day.app.to pet.for cert.the district court did not rule on the funds motion for attorney fees and costs until july.on that date it awarded in attorney fees,plus costs of,for a total award of.supp.on august,the funds appealed from both decisions.haluch filed a a week later.

the court of appeals agreed with the funds.it acknowledged this court holding that an unresolved issue of attorney fees generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.but it held that this rule does not mechanically apply to all claims for attorneys fees,whatever their genesis,and that,instead,w here,as here,an entitlement to attorneys fees derives from a contract the critical question is whether the claim for attorneys fees is part of the merits.at.interpreting the cba in this case as provid ing for the payment of attorneys fees as an element of damages in the event of a breach,the court of appeals held that the june decision was not final.ibid.concluding that the appeal was timely as to all issues,the court of appeals addressed the merits of the dispute with respect to the amount of unpaid remittances as well as the issue of fees and costs,remanding both aspects of the case to the district court,at.

title provides that t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states t he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.bowles russell.rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure provides,as a general matter and subject to specific qualifications set out in later parts of the rule,that in a civil case the notice of appeal must be filed within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.rule a a.the parties in this case agree that notice of appeal was not given within days of the june decision but that it was given within days of the july decision.the question is whether the june order was a final decision for purposes of.
in the ordinary course a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.in budinich,this court addressed the question whether an unresolved issue of attorney fees for the litigation prevents a judgment from being final,at.there,a district court in a diversity case had entered a judgment that left unresolved a motion for attorney fees based on a colorado statute providing attorney fees to prevailing parties in certain cases,at.the court held that the judgment was final for purposes of despite the unresolved issue of attorney fees,at.
the court in budinich began by observing that a s a general matter,at least,a claim for attorney fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain.at.the court noted that awards of attorney fees do not remedy the injury giving rise to the action,are often available to the party defending the action,and were regarded at common law as an element of costs awarded to a prevailing party,which are generally not treated as part of the merits judgment.ibid.though the court acknowledged that the statutory or decisional law authorizing the fees might sometimes treat the fees as part of the merits,it held that considerations of operational consistency and predictability in the overall application of favored a uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attorney fees for the litigation in question does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.at.
the facts of this case have instructive similarities to budinich.in both cases,a plaintiff sought to recover payments.in both cases,the district court entered a judgment resolving the claim for unpaid amounts but left outstanding a request for attorney fees incurred in the course of litigating the case.despite these similarities,the funds offer two arguments to distinguish budinich.first,they contend that unresolved claims for attorney fees authorized by contract,unlike those authorized by statute,are not collateral for finality purposes.second,they argue that the claim left unresolved as of june included fees incurred prior to the commencement of formal litigation and that those fees,at least,fall beyond the scope of the rule announced in budinich.for the reasons given below,the court rejects these arguments.
the funds principal argument for the nonfinality of the june decision is that a district court decision that does not resolve a fee claim authorized by contract is not final for purposes of,because it leaves open a claim for contract damages.they argue that contractual provisions for attorney fees or costs of collection,in contrast to statutory attorney fees provisions,are provisions intended to remedy the injury giving rise to the action.
the premise that contractual attorney fees provisions are always a measure of damages is unpersuasive,for contractual fee provisions often provide attorney fees to prevailing defendants.see rossi,attorneys fees,ed.gleason,supra,at.the funds argument fails,however,for a more basic reason,which is that the court in budinich rejected the very distinction the funds now attempt to draw.
the decision in budinich made it clear that the uniform rule there announced did not depend on whether the statutory or decisional law authorizing a particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits,at.the court acknowledged that not all statutory or decisional law authorizing attorney fees treats those fees as part of costs or otherwise not part of the merits and the court even accepted for purposes of argument that the colorado statute in that case ma de plain
