defendant robert vargo,a sergeant in the vermont state state police,appeals from an order of the united states district court for the district of vermont,garvan murtha,judge,denying his motion to alter or amend an order that denied his motion pursuant to.for summary judgment dismissing,on the basis of qualified immunity,the claim of plaintiff kenneth plaintiff,brought under as administrator of the estate of richard,for use of excessive force in the shooting death of.the district court denied vargo motion for summary judgment on that claim,ruling that there were genuine issues of material fact to be tried as to the circumstances confronting vargo after he entered trailer home and it denied vargo motion to alter that denial,ruling that on plaintiff version of the facts it was not objectively reasonable to subject to deadly force.on appeal,vargo argues that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the basis of the undisputed facts and any disputed facts construed favorably to plaintiff.plaintiff from the summary dismissal,on the ground of qualified immunity,of so much of the complaint as asserted claims under against vargo and defendant john fagerholm,iii,likewise a state police sergeant,for unlawful entry into home.the court entered a partial final judgment pursuant to.b as to the unlawful entry claims,stating this court would thereby have the entire case before it since vargo could take an immediate appeal with respect to the excessive force claim.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the order of the district court that is the subject of the appeal by vargo we dismiss the because the partial final judgment did not comply with the requirements of rule b and was improvidently entered.
background 
this action has its origin in a complaint received by the state police at approximately on april,that a beating a woman in the parking lot of a trailer park.the officers who responded collectively the officers were vargo,fagerholm,and state troopers ruth gemperlein and schmidt.fagerholm was the first officer on the scene,and he soon determined that had been physically abusive toward cynthia miller,who lived with and described herself as his wife.
fagerholm interviewed miller outside the trailer,with remaining inside except for a few minutes when he stepped a very restrained,controlled,and nonthreatening manner,according to speak with miller and fagerholm.fagerholm,as a result of his conversation with miller,decided that should be arrested on a charge of domestic assault,and he so informed the other officers when they arrived.
most of the details as to the events that led the officers to enter the trailer,while pertinent to the claims of unlawful entry,are not material to the claim against vargo for use of deadly force.we recount here only what is pertinent to vargo appeal.further,we describe the events as plaintiff contends they occurred,given vargo assertion that he is entitled to take the present appeal from an interlocutory order on the premise that he accepts plaintiff version of the facts.
a.the shooting of version 
when the officers decided to arrest,gemperlein urged him to come out of the trailer.refused and when the officers threatened to enter the trailer to arrest him,yelled,i will blow your fucking heads off.miller,who had been asked whether had any weapons in the trailer,had told the officers that he had only a rifle or hunting guns.
the officers debated whether to call for a swat or tactical support team.while they were debating,gemperlein,looking through a window of the trailer,saw standing in the middle of the living room with nothing in his hands but a cigarette.gemperlein informed vargo and fagerholm that she could see and that he did not have a weapon in his hands.the officers decided to enter the trailer immediately,without summoning other forces,because was unarmed they would not have entered had they believed he was armed.
gemperlein continuously watched through the window from the time she first observed him without a weapon until just before fagerholm kicked in the front door and the officers entered the trailer.the trailer was brightly lit,and gemperlein observation was that remained unarmed standing in the center of the room.at the moment the officers entered the trailer they observed without a gun in his hands,and they never lost sight of him.after the officers entered,was never out of vargo sight at all or if he was ever out of sight after gemperlein first observed that he was unarmed,the interval was not long enough for him to access a weapon.
after the officers entered and followed down the hallway of the trailer,stood with his left side nearest to the officers.the officers repeatedly ordered to show them his right hand.although they could not see right hand,his right side was not entirely out of sight.by reason of the earlier conversations with miller,the officers knew or had reason to know that only had a rifle or long gun for hunting,not a handgun that would have been concealed as he stood there.accordingly,fagerholm walked to within a few feet of and holstered his gun.he planned to tackle and subdue him.fagerholm made a sudden movement forward in an attempt to grab,and turned in response to fagerholm lunge.when turned,vargo shot him through the chest.died minutes later.he was unarmed.
b.the denial of summary version of the events 
plaintiff,brother and the administrator of his estate,commenced the present action under against vargo and fagerholm defendants,as well as others who are no longer parties in the case.the complaint asserted claims against vargo and fagerholm for unlawful entry and a claim against vargo for use of excessive force.following a period of discovery,which included depositions of all four officers,defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the claims against them on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court granted defendants motion with respect to the claims for unlawful entry for reasons adverted to in part iii below.vargo motion for summary judgment with respect to the excessive force claim was denied for the reasons that follow.
in support of his motion for summary judgment on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity for his use of deadly force,vargo presented the following version of the events.when gemperlein reported to vargo and fagerholm that did not have a weapon in his hands,the officers decided to enter the trailer immediately.after they kicked the door in and entered,disappeared from view.the trailer was dimly lit,and was out of fagerholm sight for approximately seconds and was out of vargo sight for about one minute.the officers feared that would grab a gun that he had hidden in a handy spot and shoot at them.
when reappeared after being out of the officers sight for some seconds,his left side was facing the officers and his right hand and right side were entirely hidden behind his body.the officers repeatedly ordered to show them his right hand,which he refused to do.even though gemperlein had seen that did not have a weapon in his hand immediately before the officers entered,the officers could not be sure whether or not he was armed because he had been out of their sight for up to a minute,and upon his reappearance he was intentionally concealing his right hand.this led the officers to believe that was concealing a weapon he had had ample time to access a gun between the time he disappeared down the hallway after the officers entered the trailer and the time when he reappeared.
as the officers made their way down the hallway toward,fagerholm holstered his weapon in the hopes that he could apprehend by lunging at him.he took a little step forward to get within several feet of but fagerholm did not try to grab and made no sudden movement.shortly after fagerholm holstered his gun,spun around very quickly with his right hand in a cocked angle,as though he was going to shoot the officers vargo statement of undisputed facts,coming around so fast that sergeant vargo could not see right hand id.quoting his own deposition testimony.fearful for his life and the lives of the other officers at that point,vargo shot,aiming for his center of mass.id.
in an opinion and order dated april,summary judgment opinion,the district court denied vargo motion for summary judgment,finding that there were genuine issues of fact to be tried as to the objective reasonableness of vargo use of deadly force.for example,the court stated that,with respect to the period after the officers entered the trailer,there was a dispute as to whether was out of vargo sight at all,and if so,for how long 
w ithout discrediting sergeant vargo testimony or resolving the issue in plaintiff favor,the court finds the testimony of fagerholm and schmidt to create a genuine dispute as to how long,if at all,remained out of vargo sight after they entered the trailer.
summary judgment opinion at emphasis added.further,viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff as the party opposing summary judgment,the court noted that,although prior to their entry had not been continuously visible from the outside and could have hidden a weapon in the trailer,id.at,at the moment the officers entered the trailer they observed without a gun in his hands,id.at.the court also noted that there were disputes as to whether the trailer was and as to whether made a quick movement before fagerholm lunged at him.the court found these disputes material because they affect the assessment as to whether vargo was reasonable in the moment he fired his posed an immediate threat to the officers.id.at.
c.the refusal to amend the denial of summary judgment 
following the denial of summary judgment on the excessive force claim,vargo moved pursuant to.e for an order altering that decision,arguing that he was entitled to summary judgment even on plaintiff version of the facts.in a ruling on defendant vargo motion to alter or amend judgment,dated june,rule e order,the district court denied the motion because,on plaintiff version of the facts,a reasonable officer in vargo position would not have perceived as an immediate threat so as to necessitate the use of deadly force.rule e order at.the court stated that 
b ecause vargo understood as he entered the trailer that was not holding a hunting rifle or other weapon in his hands,and because vargo saw from the time he entered the trailer,it is reasonable to infer that could not have picked up or otherwise handled a weapon without vargo seeing him do so.as such,and in light of other factors,vargo lacked a reasonable basis for believing was carrying a firearm or other weapon,even though and perhaps surprised by four armed police officers in his own trailer to show his right hand upon the officers request.absent a reasonable basis for believing his life or safety or the lives or safety of the other officers was threatened,vargo had no reason to employ deadly force against.
id.at footnote omitted emphasis added.the court noted as well that the fact that sergeant fagerholm holstered his weapon and inched within a few feet of before attempting to physically tackle him is also suggestive that was not armed.such factors sufficiently undercut vargo contention that he was reasonable in believing the circumstances warranted using deadly force against.id.at.
vargo has appealed the denial of his rule e motion.
ii.vargo appeal 
on appeal,vargo contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law on the ground that,even on plaintiff version of the events,which vargo states he adopts for these purposes,it was objectively reasonable for him to use deadly force against in the belief that posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury to vargo the other officers.we disagree,for as the district court concluded,under plaintiff version of the events,with all permissible inferences drawn in plaintiff favor,vargo use of deadly force was not objectively reasonable.
excessive force and qualified immunity 
a government official sued in his individual capacity is entitled to qualified immunity if the conduct attributed to him is not prohibited by federal law,see,county of sacramento lewis,d siegert gilley,d or where that conduct is so prohibited,if the plaintiff right not to be subjected to such conduct by the defendant was not clearly established at the time of the conduct,see,harlow fitzgerald,d or if the defendant action was objective ly legal ly reasonable in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.anderson creighton,d internal quotation marks omitted see harlow fitzgerald,at.in a case involving the use of deadly force,only the objective reasonableness branch of this test presents any possibility for a qualified immunity defense.see,salim proulx,cir.
under the fourth amendment,which governs the use of force in connection with an arrest,law enforcement officers may use only such force as is objectively reasonable under the circumstances.see,graham connor,d.the calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.id.at.it is not objectively reasonable for an officer to use deadly force to apprehend a suspect unless the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.see,tennessee garner,d see also illinois gates,d existence of probable cause is to be determined on the basis of the totality of the circumstances.
where officers attempting to make an arrest used deadly force,the objective reasonableness inquiry,for purposes of either fourth amendment liability or qualified immunity,depends only upon the officer knowledge of circumstances immediately prior to and at the moment that he made the decision to employ deadly force,salim proulx,at qualified immunity see graham connor,at.with respect to a claim of excessive force during arrest,in violation of the fourth amendment,the standard is the reasonableness of the particular force used at the moment.see also scott henrich,cir i n fourth amendment unreasonable force cases,unlike in other cases,the qualified immunity inquiry is the same as the inquiry made on the merits internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.the objective reasonableness test will not be met if,on an objective basis,it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded,malley briggs,d,in that moment that his use of deadly force was necessary.
summary judgment and appealability 
in ruling on a motion for summary judgment and assessing whether there is a genuine issue to be tried as to any material fact,the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.see,anderson liberty lobby,d united states diebold,d per curiam inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts revealed in materials such as affidavits,exhibits,and depositions,must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.summary judgment should not be granted on the basis of a qualified immunity defense premised on an assertion of objective reasonableness unless the defendant show s that no reasonable jury,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,could conclude that the defendant actions were objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.ford moore,cir see also thomas roach,cir lennon miller,cir.
further,given the difficult problem posed by a suit for the use of deadly force,in which the witness most likely to contradict the police officer person shot unable to testify,the court may not simply accept what may be a account by the police officer.scott henrich,at.rather,the court must also consider circumstantial evidence that,if believed,would tend to discredit the police officer story,and consider whether this evidence could convince a rational factfinder that the officer acted unreasonably.see,maravilla united states,cir where the witness most likely to contradict the officers testimony is dead,the court should examine all the evidence to determine whether the officers story is consistent with other known facts plakas drinski,cir.in deadly force cases,where the officer defendant is the only witness left alive to testify,a court must undertake a fairly critical assessment of,inter alia,the officer original reports or statements to decide whether the officer testimony could reasonably be rejected at a trial,cert.denied,d.
ordinarily,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable because such a decision is not a final judgment.see.under the collateral order doctrine,however,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is immediately appealable to the extent that the district court has denied the motion as a matter of law,although not to the extent that the defense turns solely on the resolution of questions of fact.see,behrens pelletier,d johnson jones,d mitchell forsyth,d in re state police litigation,cir.we have held that where the district court has denied a motion for summary judgment on the ground that there are triable issues as to which party version of the facts is to be accepted,a defendant may pursue an immediate appeal if he adopts the plaintiff version of the facts,contending that the facts asserted by the plaintiff entitle the defendant to the defense of qualified immunity as a matter of law.salim proulx,at.
c.the merits of vargo appeal,accepting plaintiff version 
in light of the above principles and the record in this case,we affirm the district court denial of vargo rule e motion for several reasons.preliminarily,we note that although vargo purports to accept plaintiff version of the facts see,vargo brief on appeal at a ccepting for purposes of this appeal that no time elapsed when o bert was out of the officers sight id.at accepting plaintiff version of events id.at viewing the permissible inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,his brief on appeal is replete with his own versions of the events.for example,detailing his own deposition testimony and that of fagerholm,vargo brief states that after the officers entered the trailer,disappeared down the hallway id.at that according to fagerholm,was out of our view for ten or fifteen seconds id.at that according to vargo,was out of his view for about one minute after he entered the trailer id.that after the officers entered,had ample opportunity to access a gun without being observed by the officers id.at that after reappearing following his alleged disappearance,gave the impression that he was armed id.that vargo shot when swung around so fast that the officers could not see whether he had a gun in his right hand id.at see id.at so fast that the officers could not see whether or not he was armed and that spun around quickly with his hand cocked in a degree angle as though he was holding a gun id.at.
these assertions by vargo are disputed by plaintiff,who contends,inter alia,that was never out of the officers sight long enough to access a weapon see,plaintiff response to vargo statement of undisputed facts,that the level of alcohol found in blood suggests that was too intoxicated to move with the blinding speed attributed to him id.and that,contrary to any suggestion that vargo was influenced by the angle of right hand,vargo could not then see right hand id.citing deposition of vargo vargo dep.at vargo could not see his right hand at any time before vargo shot him.
to the extent that vargo version of the events is disputed by plaintiff,vargo version forms no proper basis for this appeal,for the district court interlocutory ruling is not immediately appealable except to the extent that vargo contends that plaintiff own version of the facts entitles vargo to judgment as a matter of law.we therefore disregard so much of vargo version as is contrary to plaintiff version.
plaintiff version of the facts,with all permissible inferences drawn in his favor,is that the officers decided to enter the trailer knowing,based on gemperlein observations through the trailer window,that was unarmed.gemperlein continuously watched through the window from the time she first observed him without a weapon until just seconds before fagerholm kicked the front door in and the officers entered,and she saw that he remained unarmed.given those observations,it could permissibly be inferred that at the moment the officers entered the trailer they observed without a gun in his hands,summary judgment opinion at,that the officers knew that he remained unarmed.after the officers entered the trailer,which was brightly lit,was never out of vargo sight.although eventually stood with his right hand beyond the officers view,there was no way,after the officers entered and saw that he was unarmed,that he could have seized a gun without vargo seeing him do so.accordingly,vargo knew that was unarmed.
further,the actions of fagerholm provide strong circumstantial evidence that the officers knew that remained unarmed whether or not fagerholm lunged at,it is undisputed that fagerholm walked to within a few feet of and put away his own gun.that conduct would have been foolhardy if the officers had any reason to believe had a gun in his hand,because fagerholm could easily have been shot or grabbed as a hostage.a rational factfinder could easily infer that fagerholm holstering his gun after placing himself within reach belies vargo claim that the officers believed that could be armed.
moreover,a reasonable factfinder could find that in fact fagerholm did proceed to lunge at and that merely moved in response to that lunge.vargo told a police investigator,in an interview conducted just hours after the shooting,that had not swung around until after fagerholm nicknamed skip attempted to grab skip at one point went to grab him and then all of a sudden he just twisted real quick.interview of robert vargo by joel davidson,april,at approximately vargo interview,at emphasis added.despite vargo present position to the contrary reflected in his deposition testimony a year and a half after the event,see vargo dep.at remembering it,going over and over it again,twisted first and it my testimony that he twisted first,a rational factfinder could easily choose to credit vargo original statement to the police investigator that had moved only after fagerholm lunged.
vargo urges us to view it as immaterial whether or fagerholm moved first.we decline that invitation in light of vargo deposition testimony that,as a police officer,he had been aware that if sergeant fagerholm did try to grab,he might,might move in response to that vargo dep.at.thus,if,as vargo informed the police investigator,did not move until fagerholm attempted to grab him,vargo shot,whom he knew to be unarmed,in response to a movement that vargo expected.
finally,although vargo relentlessly emphasizes the fact that had threatened to blow the officers heads off just minutes before the officers decided to enter the trailer vargo brief on appeal at see also id.at,that argument focuses on the wrong period of time.as discussed in part.above,the objective reasonableness inquiry must focus on vargo knowledge of the circumstances immediately prior to and at the moment of his decision to use deadly force,his decision to tap one shot right in center mass vargo interview at.the threat made by prior to the officers entry into the trailer can not enter into the reasonableness calculus because,after that threat was made,gemperlein observed that was unarmed the officers entered the trailer precisely because they knew was not armed and because they never lost sight of him thereafter,they knew that he remained unarmed.the earlier threat did not give vargo license to shoot to kill a man he knew,immediately before and at the moment of the shooting,was unarmed.
in sum,although vargo appeal is purportedly premised on his acceptance of plaintiff version of the facts and all permissible inferences that could be drawn in plaintiff favor,that version and those inferences plainly do not entitle vargo to judgment as a matter of law.on plaintiff version of the facts,in which vargo shot to kill while knowing that was unarmed,it is obvious that no reasonable officer would have believed that the use of deadly force was necessary.
iii.plaintiff 
in his,plaintiff seeks reversal of the district court dismissal
