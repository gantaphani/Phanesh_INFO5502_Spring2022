the principal issue in this appeal is the constitutionality of the civil forfeiture procedures in effect prior to enactment of the civil asset forfeiture reform act cafra the law prior to cafra allowed the government to seize property on a mere showing of probable cause and then placed the burden of proof on the claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property was not subject to forfeiture.following this procedure,the government seized three properties owned by appellant francisco aguilar and commenced civil forfeiture proceedings in the united states district court for the district of connecticut burns.a jury subsequently found the properties forfeitable and the district court entered judgment for the government.for reasons stated below,we affirm the district court.
background 
beginning in june,francisco aguilar was the subject of an investigation by the united states drug enforcement administration dea that eventually led to his arrest in october on various drug charges.after a trial,a jury found aguilar guilty of all criminal charges and the judge sentenced him to a sentence,which he is now serving.in affirming aguilar conviction we noted that the evidence at trial showed that he was the leader of a narcotics organization that he aptly described as a operation.united states tracy,cir.
parallel with aguilar criminal proceedings,the government brought civil forfeiture actions against three properties aguilar owned in connecticut,which the government argued had been used to facilitate his drug activity.the first property,located at drumlin road in westport,was a single family residence the other two properties,both located on main street in bridgeport,were commercial properties consisting primarily of stores and offices with residential rental apartments above.
in october,the government obtained search warrants for the two main street properties based on a affidavit by dea special agent terrence sprankle describing aguilar drug operation and its connection to the properties.the sprankle affidavit reported information from various confidential informants who had either seen or participated in drug activity on the premises.the affidavit also described two kidnappings during which the victim was held on the properties,and stated that there was probable cause to believe that drugs,materials and drug records would be found on the premises.when the agents executed the search warrants the following day,no such items were found however,the searches did uncover a cache of firearms,in cash,firearm files,handcuffs,a radio transceiver,a list of police codes,a beeper and a cell phone.
on the day after the searches,the government filed civil forfeiture complaints against the three properties.in support of the complaints,the government submitted the sprankle affidavit,but did not inform the court of the results of the prior day searches.based on that affidavit,the district court issued warrants of arrest in rem and the properties were seized by the government.in accordance with law,aguilar was not afforded a hearing prior to the seizure to contest the government evidence.in august,the court ordered interlocutory sale of the properties based on findings that two of the properties were abandoned,liable to deteriorate,and subject to vandalism,and that the mortgage obligations on the third property greatly exceeded the rental income.
in june,the district court ruled on the parties for summary judgment in the civil forfeiture proceeding and rejected most of the claims aguilar now pursues before this court.first aguilar objected to the shifting burden of proof in civil forfeiture actions as an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process.the district court held that while the burden of allocation may very well be unfair,it is not unconstitutional.the court noted that congress may alter the traditional burdens of proof in civil cases and relied on the supreme court decision in united states ursery,d,for the proposition that a forfeiture suit is a civil proceeding.the court thus concluded that congress allocation of the burdens of proof in a civil forfeiture proceeding is not unconstitutional.
second,in response to aguilar argument that the forfeiture complaints must be dismissed because his properties were seized without notice or a hearing,the district court stated that the analysis is not so simple.it recognized that the lack of a hearing violated due process in light of the supreme court decision in united states james daniel good real property,d.however,the court went on to hold that the proper remedy for such a violation was not dismissal but suppression of any evidence gained through the illegal seizure and the return of any rents or profits received prior to the time when aguilar was afforded a hearing 
third,the district court rejected aguilar argument that the government was barred from using hearsay evidence to establish probable cause.citing this court opinion in united states daccarett,cir,the court held that it is in the second circuit that a court may rely upon hearsay statements,such as those contained in the sprankle affidavit,in assessing whether the government has probable cause for a forfeiture.the court considered these statements and concluded that they were reliable and that aguilar would have a chance to question many of the confidential informants if the case went to trial.
finally,the court addressed aguilar argument that the forfeiture complaints should be dismissed on the ground that the government had committed fraud on the court by relying on a stale,inaccurate affidavit to obtain the seizure warrants without disclosing the results of the searches performed on the properties.the district court,while criticizing the government actions,declined to dismiss the case 
the court is unimpressed with the government conduct during the initial stages of these forfeitures.the government repeatedly relied upon a stale and misleading affidavit,while neglecting to apprise the court of relevant information concerning the properties relationship to aguilar drug trafficking activities.nevertheless,there is no evidence that the government intentionally committed any fraud upon the court.the government presentation of the evidence was negligent.this certainly not not warrant dismissal of the forfeitures.
in,the court conducted an evidentiary hearing and determined that the government had established probable cause to forfeit the main street properties and reserved decision on the residential property until after trial.the three forfeiture cases were tried before a jury from march through march.in accordance with law,the judge instructed the jury that the burden was on aguilar to establish that the properties were not subject to forfeiture.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the government as to all three properties.after trial,the court reaffirmed its finding of probable cause on the main street properties and also found probable cause on the other property based on supplemental evidence and testimony presented at trial.the court then entered judgment in favor of the government.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
burdens of proof 
we first address aguilar argument that the allocation of burdens of proof in forfeiture proceedings violates due process.civil forfeiture proceedings commenced prior to the effective date of cafra are governed by and.section provides for the forfeiture of all real property used to facilitate drug activity,a,and authorizes seizure of such property on a showing of probable cause.id.at b.when a claimant comes forward seeking recovery of the seized property,the proceedings are governed by,which provides 
in all suits or actions brought for forfeiture where the property is claimed by any person,the burden of proof shall lie upon such claimant and in all suits or actions brought for the recovery of the value the burden of proof shall be upon the defendant provided,that probable cause shall be first shown for the institution of such suit or action,to be judged of by the court 
id.emphasis in original thus,once the government has established probable cause,the claimant has the burden of persuasion to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is not subject to forfeiture 
in,this court rejected a constitutional challenge to these shifting burdens of proof.see united states in united states currency,cir,cert.denied sub,aponte united states,d.in,the claimant of seized currency argued that this allocation of the burden of proof violates due process because forfeiture under a constitutes criminal punishment.at.we examined that claim following a analysis derived from the supreme court decision in kennedy,d.we first looked to whether congress had intended the proceedings in question to be civil or criminal and concluded that congress expressly indicated a preference for the civil label.we then questioned whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.at quoting united states ward,d.we found that the forfeiture laws served many apparent remedial,purposes and that t he statute makes no attempt to tailor the amount of the loss suffered by forfeiture to the degree of culpability,a strong indication that any punitive effect is incidental.id.at.thus,we concluded that claimants in forfeiture proceedings were not entitled to the protections afforded in criminal proceedings and the burdens of proof did not violate the constitution.see also,united states acres of land and dwelling located on whites hill road,cir we find nothing unconstitutional in congress allocation of the burdens of proof in forfeiture cases.
aguilar asks us to reconsider our holding in in light of two subsequent supreme court decisions.the first is austin united states,d,in which the supreme court held that the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment restrained the government ability to seek forfeiture of property.the court framed the issues surrounding forfeiture by stating,the question is not,as the united states would have it,whether forfeiture is civil or criminal,but rather whether it is punishment.id.at.the court looked at the history of forfeiture in england and the united states and at the legislative history of the forfeiture statute in question and concluded that forfeiture was historically perceived as a form of punishment.as such,the eighth amendment limits on the government ability to punish applied even to a proceeding that was nominally termed civil.
the second decision aguilar relies on in this context is good,at,in which the supreme court held that the fourth amendment was not the sole source of constitutional protections afforded property owners in forfeiture proceedings.rather,those proceedings must also satisfy the general standards of due process required by the fifth amendment.more specifically,the court held that when the government seizes property not for the purpose of preserving evidence but to assert ownership over the property itself,due process requires the government to provide notice and a hearing.id.at.
in,this court questioned the continuing validity of after the supreme court decisions in austin and good.see united states v.one parcel of property located at quaker farms road,cir.we stated 
good and austin reopen the question of whether the quantum of evidence the government needs to show in order to obtain a warrant in rem allowing to meet the requirements of due process in currency,which held that the beyond a reasonable doubt standard of in re winship,d does not apply to civil forfeitures under the drug forfeiture statute,has been opened for reexamination by austin.independent of this question,we also note that it is an open issue whether the due process clause requires the government to sustain a burden falling between the extremes of probable cause and proof beyond a reasonable doubt before a seizure is made and a claimant is put to proof of the innocent owner defense.
id.at quoting peter petrou,note due process implications of shifting the burden of proof in forfeiture proceedings arising out of illegal drug transactions,duke.we noted that none of the second circuit cases applying the forfeiture framework after good and austin dealt squarely with either of those supreme court cases.id.at.we more fully analyzed austin effect on,explaining 
austin holding that drug forfeiture is punitive in intent,its historical analysis,and its rejection of the government proffered reasons why the drug forfeiture statute is remedial all directly contradict some of the holdings made by this court when it made its analysis of the forfeiture statutes in.thus,austin sufficiently vitiated the rationale of that we regard its continued viability an open question.
id.at.we did not decide the issue,however,because the claimant in quaker farms had waived his right to a probable cause hearing,thereby waiving his constitutional challenge to the burdens of proof.
aguilar relies heavily on our dicta in quaker farms and argues that because the forfeiture laws are highly penal in nature,the government must bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the subject properties were used to facilitate a violation of the narcotics laws.however,aguilar fails to give adequate consideration to the supreme court most recent pronouncement on the forfeiture laws in ursery,which was decided three weeks after quaker farms.the issue in ursery was whether the government could prosecute a person criminally and institute separate forfeiture proceedings for the same underlying conduct without violating the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.at.the court held that in rem civil forfeitures are neither punishment nor criminal for purposes of the double jeopardy clause.id.at.to reach this conclusion,the court followed an analysis that parallels the analysis we applied in,
first,we ask whether congress intended proceedings under to be criminal or civil.second,we turn to consider whether the proceedings are so punitive in fact as to persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding s may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature.
id.at.quoting united states v.one assortment of firearms,d.further,the supreme court reached the same conclusions we reached in,namely that congress clearly intended forfeiture to be a civil sanction and that the forfeiture laws are not so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal.id.at.the ursery court also limited austin holding that civil forfeitures are punishment to the context of the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.id.at.
after ursery it seems quite clear to us that congress may constitutionally impose a standard of proof in forfeiture cases less stringent than would be required in criminal proceedings.while austin may have called that conclusion into question for a time,the court most recent affirmation of forfeiture as a distinctly civil proceeding is controlling in this case.that the supreme court followed the same analysis as we did in in reaching our conclusions further strengthens our holding in that case.thus,remains good law and the constitution does not require the government to prove forfeitability beyond a reasonable doubt.
of course,as we noted in quaker farms,an additional question remains whether the due process clause requires the government to sustain a burden falling between the extremes of probable cause and proof beyond a reasonable doubt before a seizure is made and a claimant is put to proof of the innocent owner defense.at.on this question,we agree with the ninth circuit that close inspection of the burdens of proof reveals that the actual burden imposed on the government in most cases is greater than probable cause.see united states currency,cir.it is true that the government may seize property on a showing of probable cause.however,even under procedures a claimant may recover his property by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the property was not used to facilitate drug activity.thus,when a claimant presents evidence that the property was not connected to drug activity,the government must provide evidence of its own to the contrary that is at least as persuasive and credible.
as the ninth circuit has stated,s een in this light,the actual burden of proof is a preponderance of the evidence stand
