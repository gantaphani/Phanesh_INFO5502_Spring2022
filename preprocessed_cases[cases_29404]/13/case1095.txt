this appeal presents an unsettled question of law whether the tolling rule set forth by the supreme court in american pipe construction utah,d american pipe that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action,id.at applies to the statute of repose in section of the securities act of securities act,in addition,we are called upon to decide whether members of a putative class can avoid the effect of a statute of repose using the relation back doctrine of federal rule of civil procedure c to amend the class complaint and intervene in the action as named parties 
this appeal comes to us from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lewis kaplan,judge denying,in relevant part,proposed motions to intervene see in re indymac mortgage backed sec,d indymac ii.the lead plaintiff and other putative class members alleged that defendants had made fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in the offering and sale of certain financial instruments which they purchased.following the district court dismissal of certain claims,as well as the expiration of the statute of repose under section,several putative class members sought to intervene in the action to revive the dismissed claims on either of two theories that the american pipe tolling rule operated to preserve their right to sue,or that rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure allowed them to relate back their otherwise untimely claims to the surviving claims in the class complaint.the district court rejected these two theories and denied the motions to intervene as barred under section statute of repose.this appeal by proposed followed.
we hold that american pipe tolling rule does not apply to the statute of repose in section and absent circumstances that would render the newly asserted claims independently timely,neither federal rule of civil procedure nor the rule c relation back doctrine permits members of a putative class,who are not named parties,to intervene in the class action as named parties in order to revive claims that were dismissed from the class complaint for want of jurisdiction.in practical terms,the proposed intervenors may not circumvent section statute of repose by invoking american pipe or rule c.accordingly,we affirm the june,order of the district court,insofar as it partially denied motions to intervene by the proposed intervenors.
background 
this appeal arises from two securities class actions,consolidated by the district court,asserting claims for violations of sections,a and of the securities against indymac mbs,indymac mbs,an issuer of securities,and certain of its officers,directors,and underwriters jointly,defendants.as relevant here,indymac mbs issued securities known as mortgage certificates certificates in different offerings pursuant to three registration statements and the related prospectuses and prospectus supplements.indymac,d,indymac i.the police and fire retirement system of the city of detroit detroit pfrs and the wyoming state treasurer and the wyoming retirement system jointly,wyoming or wyoming entities commenced two separate putative class actions against the indymac defendants on behalf of asserted class members who had purchased certificates in some of the offerings.the district court then consolidated the detroit pfrs and wyoming actions,and appointed wyoming lead plaintiff of the consolidated action,pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act pslra,although wyoming was the only plaintiff named in the consolidated action,the amended consolidated complaint amended complaint raised claims on behalf of other asserted class members,who were purchasers of the indymac certificates.
on june,the district court dismissed for lack of standing all claims in the amended complaint arising from the offerings of securities not purchased by the wyoming entities,who are the lead and sole named plaintiffs.indymac i,d at.the district court explained that,as in any lawsuit,the named plaintiffs must demonstrate constitutional standing,and that the wyoming entities had failed to make the necessary showing of injury as to the offerings of securities that they did not purchase.id.relying on an earlier district court opinion in separate securities litigation.
the dismissed claims included those involving securities purchased by detroit pfrs and by other members of the asserted class,none of whom were named plaintiffs.in addition to detroit pfrs,five members of the asserted class the city of philadelphia board of pensions and retirement philadelphia the los angeles county employees retirement association lacera the public employees retirement system of mississippi pers the iowa public employees retirement system iowa and the general retirement system of the city of detroit detroit retirement subsequently moved to intervene in the action,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure to assert claims with respect to the certificates that those entities had purchased,but which the named wyoming plaintiffs had not purchased although the period of repose in section had run on their claims,these putative plaintiffs invoked the tolling rule set forth in american pipe,where,as noted above,the supreme court held that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action,at emphasis supplied.the putative plaintiffs argued that the american pipe tolling rule,which has long been accepted in the context of statutes of limitations,applied equally to the statute of repose in section.the putative plaintiffs further argued that,in the event that american pipe tolling did not apply,it could nonetheless relate back its proposed amended complaint to the amended complaint by operation of federal rule of civil procedure rule c,see note,ante,despite the expiration of the period for bringing these claims.
the district court denied the motions to intervene in a thorough and careful memorandum opinion of june,reasoning that the section repose period had expired and could not be tolled under american pipe or extended by operation of rule c.see indymac ii,d.three of the five putative plaintiffs detroit retirement,lacera,and pers filed a notice of appeal as proposed intervenors to this court on july,

legal framework 
american pipe tolling 
the principal issue before us is whether the tolling rule set forth by the supreme court in american pipe and its progeny applies to the statute of repose in section of the securities act.the plaintiffs in american pipe originally instituted a timely putative antitrust suit,which was dismissed by the district court in that case for failing to satisfy the prerequisite of numerosity,as required for certification of a class under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure at.soon after,the district court denied the motions to intervene filed pursuant to rule,see note,ante,by proposed members of the asserted class on the ground that the applicable statute of limitations,section of the clayton act had run during the pendency of the litigation.see american pipe,at.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district court denial of the motions to intervene,concluding that the denial of class certification could not strand asserted members of the class for whom the statute of limitations had run while the case was pending.id.at.the supreme court then affirmed the ninth circuit decision,holding that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the american pipe court relied heavily on rule,reasoning that a contrary holding would frustrate the principal function of a class action and create a multiplicity of activity which rule was designed to avoid.id.at see also id.at suggesting that tolling derived from court interpretation of the rule.the american pipe court,however,also seemed to rely on the equitable power of the courts to toll statutes of limitations.for instance,it observed that i n recognizing judicial power to toll statutes of limitation in federal courts we are not breaking new ground.id.at emphasis supplied see also id.at concluding that judicial tolling of the statute of limitations does not abridge or modify a substantive right.ultimately,the american pipe court stated that the tolling rule we establish here is consistent both with the procedures of rule and with the proper function of the limitations statute.id.at.
in crown,cork seal parker,d,the supreme court clarified that the american pipe tolling rule applies not only to putative class members who seek to intervene in an action,but also to class members who later file their own independent actions.id.at see also joseph wiles,cir.in so doing,the crown court explained the rationale for the american pipe tolling doctrine 
the american pipe court recognized that unless the statute of limitations was tolled by the filing of the class action,class members would not be able to rely on the existence of the suit to protect their rights.only by intervening or taking other action prior to the running of the statute of limitations would they be able to ensure that their rights would not be lost in the event that class certification was denied in the absence of tolling,a putative class member who fears that class certification may be denied would have every incentive to file a separate action prior to the expiration of his own period of limitations.the result would be a needless multiplicity of actions precisely the situation that federal rule of civil procedure and the tolling rule of american pipe were designed to avoid.
proposed intervenors in this appeal now seek to apply the tolling rule of american pipe to the statute of repose provision in section.
ii.section as a statute of repose 
although s tatutes of repose and statutes of limitations are often confused,they are nonetheless distinct and serve distinct purposes.ma merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir see also city of pontiac emps.ret.mbia,cir noting a difference in the basic purpose of a statute of limitations as contrasted to a statute of repose.as we recently explained 
statutes of limitations limit the availability of remedies and,accordingly,may be subject to equitable considerations,such as tolling,or a discovery rule.in contrast,statutes of repose affect the underlying right,not just the remedy,and thus they run without interruption once the necessary triggering event has occurred,even if equitable considerations would warrant tolling or even if the plaintiff has not yet,or could not yet have,discovered that she has a cause of action.
fed.hous.fin.agency ubs americas,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in other words,while statutes of limitations are often subject to tolling principles,a statute of repose extinguishes a plaintiff cause of action after the passage of a fixed period of time,usually measured from one of the defendant acts.ma,at.
thus,in contrast to statutes of limitations,statutes of repose create a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a period of time.amoco prod.newton sheep,cir emphasis supplied quotation marks omitted see also stolz family.daum,cir stolz unlike a statute of limitations,a statute of repose is not a limitation of a plaintiff remedy,but rather defines the right involved in terms of the time allowed to bring suit.this conceptual distinction carries significant practical consequences.for instance,a statute of repose may bar a claim even before the plaintiff suffers injury,leaving her without any remedy.fed.hous.fin.agency,at emphasis supplied relying on stolz,at,and stuart,at see also mccann hy vee,cir.and,as most important here,a statute of repose is subject only to legislatively created exceptions,stolz,at quotation marks omitted,and not to equitable tolling,fed.hous.fin.agency,at internal alterations omitted.
section of the securities act contains two limitations periods see note,ante.the first a statute of limitations states,in relevant part,that n o action shall be maintained to enforce any liability unless brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,or within one year after the violation upon which it is based.as relevant here,the second limitations period of section a statute of repose states that i n no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability more than three years after the underlying security was bona fide offered to the public,or more than three years after its sale.id.
courts have repeatedly recognized that the limitations period in section is a statute of repose.see,lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d lampf referring to section as a year period of repose fed.hous.fin.agency,at stolz,at.in so doing,they have also emphasized that,as a statute of repose,the period in section is said to be absolute and not subject to equitable tolling.for instance,the supreme court in lampf noted that section limitation is a period of repose inconsistent with tolling,and reiterated that the purpose of the year limitation is clearly to serve as a cutoff,to which tolling principles do not apply.lampf,at emphasis supplied.we have similarly recognized that a statute of repose begins to run without interruption once the necessary triggering event has occurred,even if equitable considerations would warrant tolling or even if the plaintiff has not yet,or could not yet have,discovered that she has a cause of action.stolz.at see also jackson.life ins.merril lynch,cir the period is an absolute limitation which applies whether or not the investor could have discovered the violation.emphasis supplied see generally hazen,law of securities regulation ed.section is not only a statute of limitations but also operates as a statute of repose.there is an absolute maximum of three years in order to prevent stale claims.the repose period is absolute in that it can not be extended by applying equitable tolling principles.
application of american pipe to section statute of repose 
the supreme court opinion in american pipe does not explicitly state whether the court was recognizing judicial tolling,grounded in principles of equity,or statutory tolling or,legal tolling,based on rule see credit suisse sec.usa llc simmonds,d noting that a lthough american pipe did not employ the term legal tolling,some federal courts have used that term to describe our holding on the ground that the rule is derived from a statutory source,whereas equitable tolling is judicially created.judicial power to toll statutes of limitations arises from an exercise of a court equity powers,traditionally used to relieve hardships which,from time to time,arise from a hard and fast adherence to more absolute legal rules.holland florida,d internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,statutory tolling,as the name suggests,derives from a statutory,or legal,source.see credit suisse.at see also albano shea homes,cir.the parties make much of this distinction because,as explained above,if american pipe tolling rule is equitable in nature,it does not apply to statutes of repose,whereas if it is statutory or legal in nature,it may.
as discussed in part,ante,the american pipe decision contains conflicting indications of the source of authority for its tolling rule
