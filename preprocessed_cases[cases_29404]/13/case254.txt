petitioners reichle and doyle were members of a secret service detail protecting vice president richard cheney while he greeted members of the public at a shopping mall.agent doyle overheard respondent howards,who was speaking into his cell phone,state that he was going to ask the vice president how many kids he killed today.doyle and other agents observed howards enter the line to meet the vice president,tell the vice president that his policies in iraq are disgusting,and touch the vice president shoulder as the vice president was leaving.after being briefed by doyle,agent reichle interviewed and then arrested howards,who was charged with harassment.after that charge was dismissed,howards brought an action against petitioners and others under and bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents.howards claimed that he was arrested and searched without probable cause,in violation of the fourth amendment,and that the arrest violated the first amendment because it was made in retaliation for howards criticism of the vice president.petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity,but the federal district court denied the motion.on appeal,the tenth circuit reversed the immunity ruling with respect to the fourth amendment claim because petitioners had probable cause to arrest howards,but the court affirmed with regard to the first amendment claim.in doing so,the court rejected petitioners argument that,under hartman moore,probable cause to arrest defeats a first amendment retaliatory arrest claim.it concluded instead that hartman applied only to retaliatory prosecution claims and thus did not upset prior tenth circuit precedent holding that a retaliatory arrest violates the first amendment even if supported by probable cause.

c at that time,hartman impact on the tenth circuit precedent was far from clear.although hartman facts involved only a retaliatory prosecution,reasonable law enforcement officers could have questioned whether its rule also applied to arrests.first,hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest claims and retaliatory prosecution claims similarly.it resolved a circuit split concerning the impact of probable cause on retaliatory prosecution claims,but some of the conflicting cases involved both retaliatory prosecution and retaliatory arrest claims and made no distinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable cause.second,a reasonable official could have interpreted hartman rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests.like in retaliatory prosecution cases,evidence of the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest will be available in virtually all retaliatory arrest cases,and the causal link between the defendant alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff injury may be tenuous.finally,decisions from other circuits in the wake of hartman support the conclusion that,for qualified immunity purposes,it was at least arguable at the time of howards arrest that hartman extended to retaliatory arrests.

virgil gus reichle,et,petitioners steven howards 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
this case requires us to decide whether two federal law enforcement agents are immune from suit for allegedly arresting a suspect in retaliation for his political speech,when the agents had probable cause to arrest the suspect for committing a federal crime.
on june,vice president richard cheney visited a shopping mall in beaver creek,colorado.a secret service protective detail accompanied the vice president.petitioners gus reichle and dan doyle were members of that detail.
respondent steven howards was also at the mall.he was engaged in a cell phone conversation when he noticed the vice president greeting members of the public.agent doyle overheard howards say,during this conversation,i going to ask the vice president how many kids he killed today.brief for petitioners.agent doyle told two other agents what he had heard,and the three of them began monitoring howards more closely.
agent doyle watched howards enter the line to meet the vice president.when howards approached the vice president,he told him that his policies in iraq are disgusting.ibid.the vice president simply thanked howards and moved along,but howards touched the vice president shoulder as the vice president departed howards then walked away.
several agents observed howards encounter with the vice president.the agents determined that agent reichle,who coordinated the protective intelligence team responsible for interviewing individuals suspected of violating the law,should question howards.agent reichle had not personally heard howards comments or seen his contact with the vice president,but agent doyle briefed agent reichle on what had happened.
agent reichle approached howards,presented his badge and identified himself,and asked to speak with him.howards refused and attempted to walk away.at that point,agent reichle stepped in front of howards and asked if he had assaulted the vice president.pointing his finger at agent reichle,howards denied assaulting the vice president and told agent reichle,if you do want other people sharing their opinions,you should have him the vice president avoid public places.howards mclaughlin,internal quotation marks omitted.during this exchange,agent reichle also asked howards whether he had touched the vice president.howards falsely denied doing so.after confirming that agent doyle had indeed seen howards touch the vice president,reichle arrested howards.
the secret service transferred howards to the custody of the local sheriff department.howards was charged by local officials with harassment in violation of state law.the charge was eventually dismissed.
howards brought this action in the united states district court for the district of colorado under stat,and bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,howards alleged that he was arrested and searched without probable cause,in violation of the fourth amendment.howards also alleged that he was arrested in retaliation for criticizing the vice president,in violation of the first amendment.
petitioners reichle and doyle moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion.see app.to pet.for cert.on interlocutory appeal,a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.
the court of appeals held that petitioners enjoyed qualified immunity with respect to howards fourth amendment claim.the court concluded that petitioners had probable cause to arrest howards for making a materially false statement to a federal official in violation of because he falsely denied touching the vice president,at.thus,the court concluded that neither howards arrest nor search incident to the arrest violated the fourth amendment,at.
however,the court of appeals denied petitioners qualified immunity from howards first amendment claim.the court first determined that howards had established a material factual dispute regarding whether petitioners were substantially motivated by howards speech when they arrested him,at.the court then rejected petitioners argument that,under this court decision in hartman moore,probable cause to arrest defeats a first amendment claim of retaliatory arrest.the court concluded that hartman established such a rule only for retaliatory prosecution claims and,therefore,did not upset prior tenth circuit precedent clearly establishing that a retaliatory arrest violates the first amendment even if supported by probable cause,at.
judge paul kelly dissented from the court denial of qualified immunity.he would have held that when howards was arrested,it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the first amendment.in judge kelly view,hartman called into serious question the tenth circuit prior precedent on retaliatory arrests,at.he noted that other circuits had applied hartman to retaliatory arrests and that there was a strong argument in favor of doing so,at.
we granted certiorari on two questions whether a first amendment retaliatory arrest claim may lie despite the presence of probable cause to support the arrest,and whether clearly established law at the time of howards arrest so held.see.if the answer to either question is no,then the agents are entitled to qualified immunity.we elect to address only the second question.we conclude that,at the time of howards arrest,it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the first amendment.we,therefore,reverse the judgment of the court of appeals denying petitioners qualified immunity 
qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damages liability unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.see ashcroft,slip,at.in pearson callahan,we held that courts may grant qualified immunity on the ground that a purported right was not clearly established by prior case law,without resolving the often more difficult question whether the purported right exists at all,at.this approach comports with our usual reluctance to decide constitutional questions unnecessarily,at see also camreta greene,slip,at,at slip,at.
to be clearly established,a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.at slip,at quoting anderson creighton.in other words,existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.at slip,at.this clearly established standard protects the balance between vindication of constitutional rights and government officials effective performance of their duties by ensuring that officials can reasonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages.anderson,supra,at quoting davis scherer.
the clearly established standard is not satisfied here.this court has never recognized a first amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause nor was such a right otherwise clearly established at the time of howards arrest.
howards contends that our cases have settled the rule that,as a general matter,the first amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for his speech.see brief for respondent quoting hartman,supra,at.but we have previously explained that the right allegedly violated must be established,not as a broad general proposition,brosseau haugen,per curiam,but in a particularized sense so that the contours of the right are clear to a reasonable official,anderson,supra,at.here,the right in question is not the general right to be free from retaliation for one speech,but the more specific right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is otherwise supported by probable cause.this court has never held that there is such a right 
we next consider tenth circuit precedent.assuming arguendo that controlling court of appeals authority could be a dispositive source of clearly established law in the circumstances of this case,the tenth circuit cases do not satisfy the clearly established standard here.
relying on deloach bevers,and poole county of otero,the court of appeals concluded that,at the time of howards arrest,its precedent had clearly established the unlawfulness of an arrest in retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights,irrespective of probable cause.in deloach,a case involving both a retaliatory arrest and a retaliatory prosecution,the court held that a n act taken in retaliation for the exercise of a constitutionally protected right is actionable under even if the act,when taken for a different reason,would have been proper.at internal quotation marks omitted.in poole,a subsequent retaliatory prosecution case,the court relied on deloach for the proposition that a plaintiff illegal conduct is not relevant to his first amendment claim.at.
the court of appeals acknowledged that poole was abrogated by this court subsequent decision in hartman moore,which held that a plaintiff can not state a claim of retaliatory prosecution in violation of the first amendment if the charges were supported by probable cause.but the court of appeals determined that hartman requirement did not extend to claims of retaliatory arrest and therefore did not disturb its prior precedent in deloach.accordingly,the court concluded,when howards was arrested it was clearly established that an arrest made in retaliation of an individual first amendment rights is unlawful,even if the arrest is supported by probable cause.at.
we disagree.at the time of howards arrest,hartman impact on the tenth circuit precedent governing retaliatory arrests was far from clear.although the facts of hartman involved only a retaliatory prosecution,reasonable officers could have questioned whether the rule of hartman also applied to arrests.
hartman was decided against a legal backdrop that treated retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims similarly.hartman resolved a split among the courts of appeals about the relevance of probable cause in retaliatory prosecution suits,but some of the conflicting court of appeals cases involved both an arrest and a prosecution that were alleged to be retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights.see,at,citing mozzochi borden,singer fulton cty.sheriff,keenan tejeda,wood kesler.those cases made no distinction between claims of retaliatory arrest and claims of retaliatory prosecution when considering the relevance of probable cause.see mozzochi,supra,at singer,supra,at keenan,supra,at wood,supra,at.indeed,the close relationship between retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims is well demonstrated by the tenth circuit own decision in deloach.deloach,too,involved allegations of both retaliatory arrest and retaliatory prosecution,and the tenth circuit analyzed the two claims as one,at.
a reasonable official also could have interpreted hartman rationale to apply to retaliatory arrests.hartman first observed that,in retaliatory prosecution cases,evidence showing whether there was probable cause for the charges would always be available and apt to prove or disprove retaliatory causation.at.in this court view,the presence of probable cause,while not a guarantee that retaliatory motive did not cause the prosecution,still precluded any prima facie inference that retaliatory motive was the cause of the plaintiff injury,at.this was especially true because,as hartman next emphasized,retaliatory prosecution claims involve particularly attenuated causation between the defendant alleged retaliatory animus and the plaintiff injury,at.in a retaliatory prosecution case,the key defendant is typically no
