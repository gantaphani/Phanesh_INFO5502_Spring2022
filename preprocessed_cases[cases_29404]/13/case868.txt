this appeal involves,in part,the unusual claim that the defendant michael newton retrial was barred by the double jeopardy clause,const.amend.v,because the trial judge intentionally provoked his request for a mistrial.
background 
newton was indicted with wyman hogan,ernest membrino and edward hall on october,by a federal grand jury sitting in the district of new hampshire,and charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine and cocaine base in violation of a,b a iii,and.the facts of the conspiracy pertain to an extensive operation of buying powder cocaine,manufacturing crack cocaine,and selling both powder and crack cocaine from a number of residences in and around the keene,new hampshire area.newton was primarily charged in connection with the sale of cocaine in keene,but outside of the residences allegedly controlled by the conspiracy crack cocaine distribution operation.
on january,prior to jury selection,edward hall notified the district court that he would present a defense that would portray the in an unfavorable light,and moved to sever his case from the other defendants.the district court denied this motion.the other three then moved for severance.the district court likewise denied their motion and proceeded to trial.after the jury was sworn,defendant hall counsel delivered an opening statement that corroborated much of the government version of events.the other renewed their request for severance and moved for a mistrial,which the district court granted.the retrial commenced on january,and resulted in newton conviction for conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine.on may,newton was sentenced to two hundred and months imprisonment,to be followed by five years of supervised release 
newton appeals both the conviction and the sentence,arguing that his retrial after an initial mistrial was prohibited by the double jeopardy clause,const.amend.v,that the prosecutor violated newton fifth amendment right to remain silent by impermissibly commenting during closing argument on newton failure to testify,and that the district court committed an error of law during sentencing by failing to exercise independent judgment on evidence presented pertinent to sentencing.for the reasons stated below,we affirm newton conviction and decline to set aside his sentence.
ii.double jeopardy 
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment protects a defendant in a criminal proceeding against repeated prosecutions for the same offense.united states dinitz,d.however,the double jeopardy clause is not an absolute bar to successive trials.justices of boston municipal court lydon,d.the protection embodied in the double jeopardy clause is a personal defense that may be waived or foreclosed by a defendant voluntary actions,including a request for,or effectual consent to,a mistrial.united states dipietro,cir.thus,in this case of retrial following the declaration of a mistrial,the key question for double jeopardy purposes is whether the mistrial was declared with the defendant consent.
if a mistrial is declared with the defendant consent,she is deemed to have waived any double jeopardy claim she might otherwise have.if,on the other hand,the defendant wishes to proceed to a verdict by the jury empaneled to try her,and the court declares a mistrial over her objection,the double jeopardy clause will bar the defendant retrial unless manifest necessity required the court to so act.
united states,cir citing dinitz,at.the only circumstance in which the defendant consent to a mistrial does not operate as a waiver of her right to claim double jeopardy is where the prosecutor or the judge intentionally provokes the defendant to request the mistrial the circumstances under which a defendant may invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.oregon kennedy,d emphasis added.here,newton insists that the trial judge intentionally provoked his mistrial request.
sequence of events 
to evaluate newton claim we must examine closely the sequence of events that prompted the judge to declare a mistrial,and what transpired between the judge and newton trial counsel.defendant hall counsel first raised the issue of severance immediately prior to jury selection.based on the vague assertion of a defense strategy that would be antagonistic to the other defendants,hall counsel requested that hall be severed from the other three defendants.after requesting but failing to obtain details elucidating the proposed defense,the trial judge denied the motion.the three other defendants then made a joint motion to sever based on hall request.the judge similarly denied this motion and proceeded to empanel the jury and begin the trial.
during his opening statement,hall counsel characterized hall as a victim not a criminal and claimed that hall was used by his codefendants.there were no immediate objections by the other defendants to the defense outlined in hall opening statement.the following morning,however,counsel for one of the other defendants noted hall antagonistic defense and raised the possibility of renewing the motion to sever hall from the trial.newton counsel joined in the renewed motion.the judge reserved ruling on the motion until the afternoon.
that afternoon,during an extensive colloquy on the motion to sever,the judge explained to defense counsel his position on the motion 
i will not grant any motion to sever unless i do an individual inquiry with each defendant and ascertain from each defendant that they understand what this means that their case is being severed that a mistrial is being granted that they are waiving any claim that they may have that they fully understand that if they want to go ahead with trial with the current jury,they can.
i f i were to grant a mistrial based on the defendants request for a mistrial because of the failure to grant severance and the trial evidence jointly being prejudicial to the defendants in their eyes,i could grant that request and not make a finding of manifest necessity,and notwithstanding the absence of a finding of manifest necessity,the defendants could be reprosecuted,notwithstanding the clause.
in other words,the judge was telling the defendants that if they requested a mistrial and he granted this request despite the absence of manifest necessity for declaring such a mistrial,the double jeopardy clause would not bar their reprosecution.counsel for one of the other defendants immediately interjected we do agree with that if the case law supports the position that this trial has gone so far that jeopardy has attached and that they unable to be retried again and that it should be with prejudice,of course,we not waiving that.realizing that the defendants did not seem to understand the relationship between their request for a mistrial and their waiver of the double jeopardy bar,the court offered further explanation 
supreme court precedent makes very clear that where a defendant requests a mistrial,he waives any right he has to assert that a reprosecution gives rise to a violation i can grant a mistrial over a defendant objection without presenting a question,only where there is a manifest necessity i do think i could make a manifest necessity finding here unless i could conclude that there was an overwhelming probability that the jury could disregard my instructions to disregard any comments in hall opening statement i could make that finding.i could find manifest necessity.
based on this determination that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial,the judge thoroughly explained to the defendants their options regarding severance and mistrial 
if hall wants a mistrial and severance and all three other defendants want a mistrial and severance i could do either of two things.i could either grant the severance motion and mistrial as to hall and proceed to trial with the three defendants,giving a limiting instruction to the jury to disregard hall opening statement,or i could grant a severance and mistrial as to the three defendants,continue on with hall and give an instruction to the jury to disregard any evidence that we determine is admissible against the three but not against hall.
i at this time am not persuaded by any argument that the defendants may have that mistrial is absolutely required because there manifest necessity for a mistrial,but nevertheless,if they want a mistrial and there a potential for reprosecution and issues are plainly addressed,i willing to consider granting everyone mistrials and just starting again with separate trials for the two groups.
the judge then addressed each attorney individually to ascertain how the defendants wished to proceed.
the court let me hear from the defendants.let me go through one at a time.counsel for membrino,what does your client wish to do 
counsel membrino has informed me that he wishes to sever the trial and he will waive his right to a 
the court so he wants to sever and ask for a mistrial.
counsel sever and a mistrial,yes,your honor.
the court all right.what does your client want to do,counsel for hogan 
counsel judge,i conferred with him.based upon the readings from the court as to what the status of the law is on that,we willing we want to see done is the case be severed,mistrial and severance.he will waive will not assert his rights to double jeopardy.
the court all right.and counsel for newton,what do you want to do 
counsel we like to sever hall and proceed.
the court and proceed 
counsel or to have a mistrial with prejudice.he does not want to waive his right to any claims.
thus,at this point,two of the remaining defendants requested severance of hall and a mistrial,whereas newton requested severance of hall and continuation of the trial before the empaneled jury.the judge understood newton alternate request for mistrial with prejudice to mean that if the judge granted a mistrial and forced newton to go to trial later with a new jury,it would be over newton objection and that therefore,since the judge had already determined that there was no manifest necessity for a mistrial,double jeopardy might bar newton retrial.
with only newton wishing to proceed with the empaneled jury,the judge made clear that he accepted the need for two for hall and another for the other three that he was not going to go through two separate trials for that group of three.the three remaining defendants would be tried together,either now with the empaneled jury or later with a new jury.he would not permit three trials one for newton before the empaneled jury,a separate trial for hall before another jury,and a third trial for the other two defendants before yet another jury.because of this requirement that the three remaining defendants be tried together,and because he would not grant newton a mistrial over his objection,the judge confronted newton with a choice he could persist in his desire to be tried before the empaneled jury and thereby override the requests of the other two defendants for a mistrial and a trial before a different jury or he could join them in their requests for a mistrial and hence waive any claim that double jeopardy bars retrial.after a brief conference with the other defense attorneys,newton attorney indicated that newton would waive his double jeopardy rights and ask for a mistrial.
before accepting this choice,the district court was commendably careful to ensure that the defendant understood the consequences of his decision to request a mistrial.in an extended colloquy,the judge ascertained that newton understood that he has a constitutional right not to be tried twice on the same charge and that by choosing to move for a mistrial,newton would be giving up this right 
the court but if you do want a trial now,you have to understand that you will be retried again and you will give up your right to claim double double jeopardy prevents your retrial.do you understand that 
newton yes,i do.
the court are you willing to give up that right 
newton yes.
after this clarification of the consequences of requesting a mistrial,there was no further talk by newton of a mistrial with prejudice.
legal analysis 
on appeal,accepting that he reluctantly agreed to waive his double jeopardy rights,newton now argues that the trial judge induced him to do so by exerting pressure on him to request a mistrial to avoid the consequences of the judge error in the denial of the motion to sever despite numerous warnings from counsel for hall regarding hall anticipated defense strategy.he elaborates on this renewed demand for a mistrial with prejudice as follows 
in the wake of that error and consequent prejudice introduced in the opening statement of hall counsel,the trial court should have known that any conviction arising out of the first trial likely would be reversed.as such,the trial court presented newton with an with an irreparably prejudiced trial,at which newton had already been implicated by a,or consent to a mistrial.newton was essentially forced to forego his right not to be tried more than once in order to minimize the significance of the trial court otherwise obvious error.
newton sees in this scenario a judge who intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial,and thus argues that his case falls within the narrow exception carved out by oregon kennedy to the rule that where circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching,a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution,even if the defendant motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.dinitz,at.
newton intentional provocation scenario is a creative rewriting of what transpired at trial.the trial judge confronted newton with a choice,not an ultimatum he could be tried before the empaneled jury with the other two defendants,or he could join them in requesting a mistrial,waive his double jeopardy rights,and be tried with them before a new jury at a later date.however,the mere fact that newton was offered a choice of two imperfect options does not imply compulsion.the criminal process,like the rest of the legal system,is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which course to follow.although a defendant may have a right,even of constitutional dimensions,to follow whichever course he chooses,the constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.mckune lile,d quoting mcgautha california,d internal quotation marks omitted.
if there was any pressure on newton as he considered the choice posed by the court,it came from the who preferred a mistrial.however,the opportunity for newton to proceed with the empaneled jury remained,and there is no indication that,of the two options available to newton,the judge preferred a mistrial for which he saw no manifest necessity.indeed,when newton first indicated that he wanted to proceed with a limiting instruction before the empaneled jury,the judge immediately determined that 
the thing to do is to consider a potential severance and mistrial as to hall and try the other three together.and they asking me for a mistrial,and i would deny it on the grounds that there is manifest necessity,and i will instruct the jury to disregard.
the essence of the double jeopardy protection is the right to be tried by the jury initially empaneled unless manifest necessity requires otherwise.united states jorn,d w here the judge,acting without the defendant consent,aborts the proceeding,the defendant has been deprived of his valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal quoting wade hunter.to this end,the judge took note of the principle articulated in scott,that the important consideration for purposes of the double jeopardy clause is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of error.united states scott,d.hence,the judge made clear his willingness to issue a limiting instruction and proceed with the jury already empaneled,thereby preserving newton right to be tried by the original jury and belying newton claim that he was provoked into requesting a mistrial.although he sp
