on its face,this appeal involves a somewhat technical issue of federal appellate procedure namely,whether we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to consider the merits of this interlocutory appeal.but a similarly difficult inquiry,which also bears on our analysis of the jurisdictional question,is whether the district court properly applied governing principles under the rules of decision act,see as interpreted in erie railroad tompkins,erie,and its progeny 
the tricky questions raised in this appeal have arisen because this case has progressed through three different venues.the suit,which alleges malicious prosecution with respect to prior litigation in federal court in new york between the same parties,was originally filed in california state court,later removed to federal court in california,and then voluntarily transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york pursuant to a while the suit was pending in federal court in california,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss under california litigation against public participation rule,see arguing that the plaintiff malicious prosecution claim was meritless and intended to inhibit the defendants constitutionally protected conduct in bringing the suit.after the case was transferred,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sandra feuerstein,judge denied the defendants pending motion to dismiss,which was based on the purported immunity provided by california rule.the court concluded that because new york law,not california law,governs the substance of the plaintiff cause of action,and because the suit was transferred to a federal court in new york,california rule did not apply.
the questions presented in this appeal are whether the district court decision regarding the inapplicability of california rule is a collateral order reviewable on an interlocutory appeal under and whether the district court erred by concluding that california rule is inapplicable in light of its determination that new york law,instead of california law,governs the plaintiff malicious prosecution claim.
with respect to the first question,we hold that the district court denial of the defendants motion to dismiss under california rule constitutes an immediately appealable collateral order because it conclusively determined the disputed issue resolved an important question that is completely separate from the merits of the action and would be effectively unreviewable in a later appeal.see will hallock.
with respect to the second question,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that california rule can not apply to a claim transferred from a california federal court to a new york federal court and governed,under the erie doctrine,by new york law.in particular,the district court conflated the relevant state question with the separate federal inquiry under erie.state rules that are considered procedural under state law may still apply in federal diversity suits if those rules are considered substantive under federal law pursuant to erie.because the plaintiff initially brought this suit in california and then voluntarily transferred it to the eastern district of new york,and because a california state court would have applied california rule as a procedural matter,the aspects of california rule considered substantive by federal law continue to apply in this case,notwithstanding that the case is now being heard in new york,and notwithstanding that the cause of action is otherwise governed by substantive new york law.see ferens john deere.
for these reasons,the district court order denying the defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to california rule is vacated,and the cause is remanded to the district court for further consideration of the motion to dismiss,and for such further proceedings as may be appropriate in the circumstances.
background 
the in this case,liberty synergistics liberty,was the defendant in an earlier,round of litigation between the same parties in the eastern district of new york.thereafter,liberty filed this malicious prosecution suit in california state court against microflo ltd,edward malkin,and ecotech jointly,microflo.liberty filed its complaint in california state court on september,alleging that microflo,in pursuing the previous litigation against liberty,undertook no reasonable investigation to verify any of the facts asserted in the complaint,and maintain ed the action against liberty out of motives grounded in spite,malice,and with a vexatious and malicious intent,in complete and utter disregard for the rights of liberty and others complaint.microflo removed the case to the central district of california on november.
microflo then moved on january,to dismiss the suit under california rule,see note,ante,arguing that liberty claim is meritless and is intended to inhibit microflo constitutionally protected conduct in petitioning for relief in the prior litigation.microflo also moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.before the california federal court decided these motions,however,it transferred the case on january,to the district court for the eastern district of new york the district court,pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,under a,see note,ante.
later that year,microflo reasserted its motion to strike under california rule.judge feuerstein referred the matter to magistrate judge thomas boyle,who heard oral argument on october,and issued an amended report and recommendation r r on october,in his r r,magistrate judge boyle concluded,inter alia,that california law does not govern microflo motion to dismiss under california rule because,under california principles,new york law governs liberty malicious prosecution claim.in other words,magistrate judge boyle determined that california rule does not apply to a claim governed by new york substantive law and being heard in new york,even though the case was originally brought in california.as magistrate judge boyle explained 
defendants have succeeded in their argument that new york substantive law applies to this case.as it applies to this motion to strike,however,their argument is unavailing.
california code of civil procedure the statute under which this motion to strike is brought is california substantive law.see batzel smith,cir because california law recognizes the protection of the statute as a substantive immunity from suit,this court,sitting in diversity,will do so as well.the ninth circuit has held that antislapp motions may be maintained in diversity cases where california provides the law of decision.see see also ex rel.newsham lockheed missiles space,cir applying certain subsections of california statute to state law counterclaims.however,those decisions are not relevant here because new york,not california,provides the law of decision.
defendants assert that california law applies to the motion.reply at.their only support for this proclamation is that the action was brought in california state court and the motion was timely filed in federal district court in california.reply at.but,the case has since been transferred to new york and this new york court has determined that california principles mandate the application of new york law.defendants have not explained why the mere fact that an motion was filed prior to the court evaluation of the question should mandate the application of california law to part of this action and new york law to the rest of it.if the argument is that the motion somehow conceptually precedes to the decision that is,that the motion should be decided as if the question had not been answered,the court is equally flummoxed as to the precedential or doctrinal authority that supports this view.
liberty synergistics microflo,no.cv sjf etb,wl,at.judge feuerstein adopted this aspect of the magistrate judge r r in an order dated december.see liberty synergistics microflo,no.cv sjf etb,wl,at.
in this appeal,microflo contests that part of the district court order,arguing that the district court should have conducted a separate analysis with respect to the antislapp issue rather than viewing that question as derivative of the court conclusion that new york substantive law governs liberty malicious prosecution claim.liberty disputes this argument on the merits and claims,as a jurisdictional matter,that the denial of a motion to dismiss pursuant to california rule is not an immediately appealable order under the collateral order doctrine 
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that appellate jurisdiction exists to consider this appeal.we also conclude that the district court erred by denying defendants motion to dismiss under california rule because of the transfer of the case to new york.we intimate no views regarding the proper disposition of any other aspect of microflo motion,nor do we intimate any views regarding liberty underlying malicious prosecution claim,or the substantive law that governs that cause of action.
discussion 
it is common ground that jurisdiction is a threshold matter that must exist before a court may decide the merits of an appeal.see steel citizens for a better env t.as relevant here,our appellate jurisdiction is limited to review of final decisions of district courts.it is undisputed that the district court has not issued a final judgment or certified any issue for interlocutory appeal under b as a general matter,orders not falling within these categories are not appealable because of the powerful interest in avoid ing the waste of time and the delay in reaching trial finality which ensue when piecemeal appeals are permitted.nelson unum life ins.of,cir quotation marks omitted.microflo,however,asserts that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal by virtue of the collateral order doctrine,which provides for appellate jurisdiction over a small class of collateral rulings that do not terminate the litigation in the court below but are nonetheless sufficiently final and distinct from the merits to be appealable without waiting for a final judgment to be entered.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.
the requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions that an order conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will,at brackets in original,internal quotation marks omitted.these conditions are stringent,id.internal quotation marks omitted,and t he justification for immediate appeal must therefore be sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of deferring appeal until litigation concludes,mohawk,carpenter.moreover,the issue of appealability under is to be determined for the entire category to which a claim belongs,without regard to the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a particular injustice averted,by a prompt appellate court decision.digital equip.desktop direct,u,alteration,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.whether a particular order falls within the collateral order doctrine is an issue of federal law,even when the order itself relates to a issue.budinich bechton dickinson.
we begin by considering whether the district court ruling that california rule was inapplicable as a matter of law,following the forum transfer,conclusively determine d the disputed question.wil,at quotation marks omitted.
the requirement that the district court order conclusively determine the question means that appellate review is likely needed to avoid th e harm of delay.johnson jones.in this case,the critical part of this inquiry is assessing whether the essence of the claimed right is either a right not to stand trial,van cauwenberghe biard,u,quoting mitchell forsyth,or a right not to face the other burdens of litigation,mitchell,at.if either such right is at issue,a denial of that right conclusively determines the disputed issue by ensuring that the defendant must bear the burdens of discovery.ashcroft iqbal,alteration and quotation marks omitted.
whether the essence of a right is to protect against the burdens of litigation should not,and can not,depend on a party agility in so characterizing the right asserted.digital,at.indeed,in some sense,all litigants who have a meritorious pretrial claim for dismissal can reasonably claim a right not to stand trial.van cauwenberghe,at.accordingly,we must examine the nature of the right asserted with special care,id.at,and a certain skepticism,if not a jaundiced eye,digital,at,to determine whether an essential aspect of the claim is the right to avoid the burdens of litigation,van cauwenberghe,at.whether a right satisfies this standard is a question of federal law,see budinich,at,but where a state rule is at issue,we look to the state law to determine whether the nature of the right is to protect certain defendants against the burdens of litigation.
the nature of the rule is clear.according to the supreme court of california,t he point of the statute is that you have a right not to be dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights.varian med,delfino,cal th,quotation marks omitted.accordingly,t he protections afforded by the statute against the harassment and burdens of litigation are in large measure lost if the petitioner is forced to litigate a case to its conclusion before obtaining a definitive judgment through the appellate process.id.quoting fabre walton.in line with these observations,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has held that the expedited dismissal provisions of the rule share the nature of immunity they protect the defendant from the burdens of trial,not merely from ultimate judgments of liability.batzel smith,cir see also id.noting that california rule is designed to protect the defendant from having to litigate meritless cases aimed at chilling first amendment expression factors etc,pro arts,cir deferring to interpretations of state law by the federal court of appeals covering that state.
we agree.california rule reflects a substantive policy favoring the special protection of certain defendants from the burdens of litigation because they engaged in constitutionally protected activity.the denial of this protection through the rejection of a motion to dismiss is sufficiently final to meet the first prong of the collateral order doctrine.
the district court ruling also satisfies the requirement that the appealed order must resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action.wil,at quotation marks omitted.the requirement that the issue be important is a pragmatic one,ensuring that the considerations that favor immediate appeals seem comparatively strong and those that disfavor such appeals seem comparatively weak.johnson,at see also mohawk,at.immediate appeals are generally more appropriate where purely legal matters are at issue.johnson,at.whether the question presented is separate from the merits depends on whether it turns on matters significantly different from the legal issues that likely underlie the plaintiff claim on the merits.id.at.
several factors favor immediate appeal in this case.first,the questions presented are neat abstract issues of law that appellate courts are better suited to consider.id.at quotation marks omitted.those questions,moreover,need only be answered once,since we are asked to consider whether any plaintiff may invoke california rule following a consensual forum transfer not whether this particular plaintiff actually warrants protection given the facts of this case.see note,post moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,an order that amounts to a refusal to adjudicate the merits plainly presents an important issue separate from the merits.in other words,the question presented in this case is whether the defendants get one proverbial bite at the apple through consideration of the motion in the lower court not whether the defendants get a second bite through appellate review.see,weight watchers of,weight watchers int l,cir another important factor bearing on the application of the cohen doctrine is whether a decision will settle a point once and for all,as it did in the cohen case,or will open the way for a flood of appeals concerning the propriety of a district court ruling on the facts of a particular suit.citation omitted and the importance of considering that threshold inquiry is particularly notable in this case,where the policy interest at stake is one of substantial importance that can not be effectively vindicated after final judgment.see part,post.
the district court order also was completely separate from the merits of the plaintiff cause of action.the court denied microflo motion as a matter of law,ruling that the motion was predicated on a source of law that did not apply to the suit.the district court therefore did not consider the underlying facts in the complaint,much less the merits of the malicious prosecution claim.additionally,as we will see in part b,post,the question whether california rule applies in this diversity case does not depend on whether california substantive law governs the merits of liberty malicious prosecution claim.accordingly,we are able to review the district court order with respect to the issue without addressing the district court decision that new york law governs the malicious prosecution claim,thereby avoiding the general rule that one may not bring an interlocutory appeal of a district court choice of law determination.gramercy mils,wolens,cir.for these reasons,the question raised in this appeal presents an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action.wil,at quotation marks omitted.
finally,we conclude that the denial of a motion to dismiss pursuant to california antislapp rule would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will,at quotation marks omitted.as explained in part,ante,the rule is designed to protect the defendant from the burdens of trial.batzel,at.consequently,even if the defendants could obtain relief in a later appeal regarding some aspects of california antislapp rule under the provisions,for instance,the denial of protections would be unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment of a district court.
by itself,however,the inability to review after final judgment the denial of protections does not settle whether the third prong of the collateral order test is satisfied.as the supreme court explained in will 
since only some orders denying an asserted right to avoid the burdens of trial qualify as orders that can not be reviewed effectively after a conventional final judgment,the cases have to be combed for some further characteristic that merits appealability under cohen and that something further boils down to a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.
wil,at quoting digital,at.immediate review must further some particular value of a high order in support of the interest in avoiding trial.id.at.that is,it is not mere avoidance of a trial,but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest,that counts when asking whether an order is effectively unreviewable if review is to be left until later.id.at quoting coopers lybrand livesay.
california enacted the rule to advance the substantial public interest in safeguarding constitutionally protected activities see part,ante.the state demonstrated the significance of this interest by providing for immediate appeals from the denial of motions in california courts.see i in light of these compelling public interests,we agree with the ninth circuit that i f the defendant were required to wait until final judgment to appeal the denial of a meritorious motion,an appellate reversal of a judgment would not remedy the fact that the defendant had been compelled to defend against a meritless claim brought to chill rights of free expression.batzel,at digital,at when a policy is embodied in a constitutional or statutory provision entitling a party to immunity from suit a rare form of protection,there is little room for the judiciary to gainsay its importance.
to be sure,we recognize that the particular legal question presented in this appeal namely,whether the forum transfer made the rule inapplicable could be reviewed following final judgment if microflo moved for attorneys fees.but the supreme court has clarified that,when the essence of a right is to shield certain defendants from the burdens of litigation,collateral review is not defeated by the opportunity for review of the same legal question that arose when considering the earlier order.see,behrens pelletier,t he defense is meant to give a right,not merely to avoid standing trial,but also to avoid the burdens of such pretrial matters as discovery whether or not a later summary judgment motion is granted,denial of a motion to dismiss is conclusive as to this right.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,even though we could review the pertinent questions in a appeal,that review would not be effective in vindicating the compelling public interest protected by the aspects of california rule.
for these reasons,we conclude that the denial of the protections offered by the rule would be effectively unreviewable in a later appeal,and that interlocutory appeal is available under the collateral order doctrine.
having concluded that an interlocutory appeal is available,we now turn to the relevant principles in federal diversity cases.as interpreted by the supreme court,the rules of decision act,see note,ante,provides that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction over a claim must consider two conceptually distinct issues.first,a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the rules of the state in which that court sits to determine the rules of decision that would apply if the suit were brought in state court.see klaxon stentor electric.though constrained in some respects by the united states constitution,this inquiry is an issue of state law.see sun oil wortman.second,after using state principles to ascertain the rules of decision that would apply in the state courts of the federal forum,federal courts apply those state rules of decision that are substantive under erie,and are consistent with federal law see id.at see also gasperini ctr.for humanities,under the erie doctrine,federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.
whether a particular state rule of decision is substantive under erie is a question of federal law,see sun oil,at hanna plumer,and is decided by examining 
whether application of the state rule would make so important a difference to the character or result of the litigation that failure to enforce it would unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum state,or whether application of the rule would have so important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federal court.
gasperini,at quotation marks omitted.this test looks not to the labels but to the content of state rules of decision in other words,once a federal court decides that a state rule of decision would apply in an identical action in state court,it is immaterial whether that state rule of decision is labelled by state law as procedural,substantive,both,or neither.guaranty trust york.
classification of a law as substantive or procedural for erie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor,gasperini,at,but perhaps even more confounding is the fact that a state procedural rules under its own principles can be substantive for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction.for instance,a state court considering whether to apply its own statutes of limitations to claims governed by the laws of other states,may apply its statutes of limitations as a procedural matter.see,sun oil,at.a federal court,however,may apply the same statute of limitations because it is substantive within the meaning of erie.see guaranty trust,at.as the supreme court has explained 
guaranty trust itself rejects the notion that there is an equivalence between what is substantive under the erie doctrine and what is substantive for purposes of conflict of laws.at.except at the extremes,the terms substance and procedure precisely describe very little except a dichotomy,and what they mean in a particular context is largely determined by the purposes for which the dichotomy is drawn.in the context of our erie jurisprudence,that purpose is to establish within the limits of applicable federal law,including the prescribed rules of federal procedure substantial uniformity of predictable outcome between cases tried in a federal court and cases tried in the courts of the state in which the federal court sits.the purpose of the dichotomy in the context of the full faith and credit clause,by contrast,is not to establish uniformity but to delimit spheres of state legislative competence.
sun oil,at.
in sum,if state principles call for a rule of decision that would apply to the suit if it were brought in state court,that is substantive within the meaning if erie,and that is not displaced by a valid federal law or rule governing the same issue,then the rules of decision act,see note,ante,requires the federal court sitting in diversity to apply the state rule,irrespective of whether that rule is understood to be procedural or substantive as a matter of state law.we address below the first of these issues,which is the only one contested by the parties.see generally greenlaw united states,in our adversary system,in both civil and criminal cases,in the first instance and on appeal,we follow the principle of party presentation.that is,we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.
as noted,a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction generally must apply the rules of the state in which the court sits.klaxon,at.in this case,however,liberty originally filed suit in california,after which time the parties agreed to transfer the case to the eastern district of new york pursuant to a,see note,ante.the supreme court has held that,in such circumstances,the governing law does not change following a transfer of venue under a,regardless of which party initiates the transfer.ferens,at.here,that means that the federal court in new york must pretend,for the purpose of determining the applicable state rules of decision,that it is sitting in california accordingly,the district court was required to determine the rules of decision that a california state court would apply see,phelps mcclellan,cir because the federal court in ohio would as a procedural matter,under ohio choice of law rules,apply the ohio statute of limitations,so must the federal court in new york if the case was transferred there under section a.muldoon tropitone furniture,cir because an illinois state court would as a procedural matter have applied the illinois statute of limitations,a federal district court in illinois would have been bound to do likewise.as transferee court,the district court in california,in turn,should have applied the statute that the illinois district court,the transferor court,would have been required to apply.internal citations omitted.
we have no reason to doubt that a california state court would apply california antislapp rule as a matter of its own procedural rules,even if it applied new york substantive law to the merits of the malicious prosecution action.the rule,which appears in california code of civil procedure,and which california courts have described as a procedural remedy,rusheen cohen,cal th,and a mere rule of procedure,ludwig superior court,states that it is intended to avoid the abuse of the judicial process in the form of lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,a.to this end,the rule provides for expeditious dismissal and an award of attorney fees and costs for any meritless cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue id.b see also id.c the text of the rule is not limited to causes of action that arise under california law,and we perceive no reason to construe it that way.
indeed,california courts have repeatedly held,as a matter of state law,that california antislapp rule is procedural in nature and therefore applies in california courts regardless of which source of law governs a plaintiff claim.see,bradbury superior court,where the action is founded on a federal statute and brought in state court,state procedure controls unless the federal statute provides otherwise.the legislature,in enacting section,recognized that all kinds of claims could achieve the objective of a slapp suit.internal citations and quotation marks omitted vergos mcneal,federal civil rights claims brought in california state courts are subject to section motions.moreover,even if california state law required a substantive analysis using california governmental interest analysis approach,sullivan oracle,cal th,the rule would still apply.as one california appellate court recently explained in a case where virginia law governed the cause of action and the plaintiff,on that basis,argued that the rule was inapplicable 
o ne of the purposes of the california statute is to ensure that california courts,and the state judicial processes as a whole,are not used as a means of interfering with the valid exercise of the right of free speech or the right of petition.because alison filed her complaint in a california court,this state has an interest in applying the procedures described in section to ensure that her claims have sufficient merit to justify the potential restraints it places on respondents right to exercise their right to speak freely to police 
in effect,alison argues that virginia has an interest in having its citizens,who are the defendants in this case,receive fewer procedural protections than they would receive in virginia courts.alison fails to explain how virginia interests are impaired by such an outcome and we find no merit in her argument.moreover,we can conceive of no possible interest that virginia might have in whether california applies a procedural mechanism that is intended to ensure that its own courts are not used to restrain the exercise of the right of petition or the right of free speech.
mcdaniel mcdaniel,no,wl,at,unpublished.it is unclear to us that this type of conflicts analysis was even necessary under california law,given the procedural nature of the rule,county of los angeles superior court,although federal law controls the substantive aspects of plaintiffs federal civil rights claim,state rules of evidence and procedure apply unless the application of those rules would affect plaintiffs substantive federal rights,but we have no doubt that other california courts would reach the same conclusion were they to apply california substantive principles.
to be sure,the due process clause and the full faith and credit clause,among other constitutional provisions,provide some limitations to the application of state rules in ways that would frustrate causes of action defined by other states laws,but this case does not approach those constitutional boundaries indeed,n o one disputes the general and unassailable proposition that states may establish the rules of procedure governing litigation in their own courts,felder casey,and it is common for procedural rules to have substantive implications,see,shady grove.at plurality opinion id.at stevens,concurring see also sun oil,at since the procedural rules of its courts are surely matters on which a state is competent to legislate,it follows that a state may apply its own procedural rules to actions litigated in its courts.
in sum,california rule would apply to this suit if the claim were proceeding in a california state court.because the district court erred with respect to this issue,we vacate the district court order and remand for its further consideration of the motion.
conclusion 
to summarize,we hold that 
jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal exists under the collateral order doctrine,because the district court rejected microflo motion to dismiss under california antislapp rule by conclusively determining a disputed issue on an important question
