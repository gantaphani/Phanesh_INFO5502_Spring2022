thomas wilner,et,attorneys representing individuals detained by the united states government at guantánamo bay,cuba,appeal from a july,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,judge entered after a june,opinion and order granting the motion for summary judgment of the national security agency nsa and the department of justice doj in plaintiffs freedom of information act foia case.plaintiffs submitted foia requests to the nsa and doj seeking records showing whether the government has intercepted plaintiffs communications relating to the representation of their detainee clients.the nsa and doj served and filed glomar confirming nor denying the existence of such to foia exemptions and the fbi also filed a similar response pursuant to foia exemption whether,as a general matter,agencies may invoke the glomar doctrine and whether,in particular,the nsa may invoke the glomar doctrine in response to a foia request for records obtained under the terrorist surveillance program tsp or program are both questions of first impression for our court.
we affirm the judgment of the district court upholding the nsa glomar response and hold that agencies may invoke the glomar doctrine when responding to foia requests,and thus may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested records to prevent cognizable harm under a foia exemption glomar responses are available,when appropriate,to agencies when responding to foia requests for information obtained under a publicly acknowledged intelligence program,such as the tsp,at least when the existence of such information has not already been publicly disclosed the nsa properly issued a glomar response to plaintiffs request for information pursuant to foia exemption specifically,pursuant to section of the national security agency act of the government affidavits sufficiently support its invocation of the glomar doctrine in this case and we therefore decline to review ourselves or require the district court to review ex parte and in camera any classified affidavits the nsa might proffer in further support of its glomar response and we find no evidence in this record that the nsa invoked glomar for the purpose of concealing illegal or unconstitutional activities.we agree with counsel for all parties that we need not determine the legality of the tsp because that question is beyond the scope of this foia action.
background 
are law professors and attorneys at prominent law firms and established organizations,who represent individuals detained by the united states government at guantánamo bay,cuba,for suspected terrorist activity.appellants br.plaintiffs note that they began representing detainees after undergoing security clearance.defendants are the nsa and the doj.the nsa is an agency within the department of defense that is charged with,among other tasks,collecting,processing,and disseminating signals intelligence sigint information for national foreign intelligence purposes.nsa sigint work includes intercepting communications necessary to national defense,national security,and the conduct of the foreign affairs of the united states.the doj is the cabinet department charged with law enforcement relevant to this case.
in the aftermath of the september,attacks on the united states by al qaeda,president george bush secretly authorized the tsp,which empowered the nsa to intercept the international communications of people with known links to al qaeda and related terrorist organizations.george bush,president radio address,excerpted in bush on the patriot act and eavesdropping,times,at full transcript available at last visited,president bush address.president bush described the tsp as a highly classified program that is crucial to our national security.its purpose is to detect and prevent terrorist attacks against the united states,our friends and allies.id.it is not disputed that tsp surveillance was conducted without warrants and without oversight by the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc.the fisc is a united states court that was established by the foreign intelligence surveillance act of fisa and has jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving electronic surveillance anywhere within the united states under the procedures set forth in the fisa,a,and to hear applications for and grant orders approving a physical search for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information anywhere within the united states under the procedures set forth in the fisa.c.
the tsp served as an early warning system intended to detect and prevent further terrorist attacks by intercepting communications between known and potential terrorists and their affiliates.to intercept a communication under the tsp,one of the parties to the communication had to be located outside of the united states,and there had to be a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication was a member of al qaeda,affiliated with al qaeda,or a member of an affiliated organization.the nsa conducted tsp surveillance in secret until,following news reports revealing the program,president bush publicly acknowledged the existence of the tsp in a radio address on december.on january,attorney general alberto gonzales announced that tsp electronic surveillance would henceforth be subject to the approval of the fisc and that the president original authorization of the tsp had lapsed.the tsp itself has ceased to exist and,as counsel for the government noted at oral argument,to the extent that any similar electronic surveillance is taking place,that activity shifted under the rubric of the fisa court.tr.
by separate letters to the nsa and the doj dated january,plaintiffs requested,pursuant to foia,seven categories of records only the first of plaintiffs foia requests request is at issue on this appeal request sought records obtained or relating to ongoing or completed warrantless electronic surveillance or physical searches regarding,referencing or concerning any of the plaintiffs.
in response to plaintiffs request,the nsa invoked the glomar that it refused to confirm or deny whether the agency possessed records responsive to the request.this lawsuit followed.plaintiffs complaint alleged that they have a statutory right to the records that they seek,and there is no legal basis for the defendants refusal to disclose them,and sought principally a declaration that defendants refusal to disclose the requested records was unlawful and an order compelling defendants to produce the records without further delay.second am.compl.for declaratory and injunctive relief.the nsa and doj filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the glomar issue.
in an opinion and order of june,the district court granted defendants motion for partial summary judgment,holding that the nsa was permitted to provide a glomar response to plaintiffs foia requests for information potentially acquired through electronic surveillance because the requested records,if they exist,are protected under foia exemption specifically,pursuant to section of the national security agency act of revealing whether or not the requested documents exist would not only violate particular statutes,but would also undermine national security the nsa did not provide a glomar response for the purpose of concealing illegality and any challenge to the legality of the underlying tsp was beyond the scope of plaintiff foia suit.
discussion 
the issues on appeal are whether,in a foia action,a court may uphold an agency invocation of the glomar doctrine where the executive branch has officially acknowledged the existence and contours of a program concerning which records are sought and where the agency claims the specific documents requested fall under,or would fall under,identified foia exemptions.accordingly,we consider first whether to adopt the glomar doctrine in our circuit and second,if it is in fact available,whether the glomar doctrine was properly invoked in this case.
i.the glomar doctrine 
as the district court noted in its opinion,t he second circuit has never opined on the glomar response.wilner,wl,at.we take this opportunity now to address the availability of the glomar doctrine to an agency when it responds to a foia request.
the glomar doctrine originated in a foia case concerning records pertaining to the hughes glomar explorer,an oceanic research vessel.see phillippi cia.in phillippi,the central intelligence agency cia claimed that the existence or nonexistence of the requested records was itself a classified fact exempt from disclosure under foia.id.at.the cia then responded to the plaintiff foia request by asserting that,in the interest of national security,involvement by the government in the activities which are the subject matter of plaintiff request can neither be confirmed nor denied.id.this an agency may,pursuant to foia statutory exemptions,refuse to confirm or deny the existence of certain records in response to a foia since become known as the glomar doctrine.see,hunt cia,cir.the government urges us to adopt the glomar doctrine as circuit law,and plaintiffs do not object to our doing so.mindful that mere stipulation by the parties,standing alone,can not serve as the basis for our conclusions of law,we turn to that question.
the glomar doctrine and government use of the glomar response is firmly established in other circuits.see,larson dep t of state,upholding the nsa use of the glomar response to plaintiffs foia requests regarding past violence in guatemala pursuant to foia exemptions and bassiouni cia,cir noting that the glomar doctrine is well established minier cia,cir permitting the cia to invoke the glomar doctrine in response to a foia request seeking employment records of an alleged cia operative carpenter dep t of justice,cir endorsing the glomar doctrine though evaluating the case as an ordinary foia suit after assuming the existence of documents that plaintiff requested under foia.the glomar doctrine is well settled as a proper response to a foia request because it is the only way in which an agency may assert that a particular foia statutory exemption covers the existence or nonexistence of the requested records in a case in which a plaintiff seeks such records.phillippi,at see also larson,at foia exemptions cover not only the content of the protected government records but also the fact of their existence or nonexistence,if that fact itself properly falls within the exemption.
we now join our sister circuits in holding that an agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records where to answer the foia inquiry would cause harm cognizable under a foia exception.gardels cia.to properly employ the glomar response to a foia request,an agency must tether its refusal to respond,wilner,wl,at,to one of the nine foia other words,a government agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of certain records if the foia exemption would itself preclude the acknowledgment of such documents.minier,at emphasis added.
an agency resisting disclosure of the requested records has the burden of proving the applicability of an exemption.id.the agency may meet its burden by submitting a detailed affidavit showing that the information logically falls within the claimed exemptions.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the phillippi court explained,a responsive affidavit should explain in as much detail as possible the basis for the agency claim that it can be required neither to confirm nor to deny the existence of the requested records.phillippi,at.
in evaluating an agency glomar response,a court must accord substantial weight to the agency affidavits,provided that the justifications for nondisclosure are not controverted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of bad faith.minier,at internal quotation marks omitted.the court should attempt to create as complete a public record as is possible the a gency arguments should then be subject to testing by plaintiff,who should be allowed to seek appropriate discovery when necessary only after the issues have been identified by this process should the district court,if necessary,consider arguments or information ex parte and in camera which the a gency is unable to make public.phillippi,at.
ii.the glomar doctrine in this case 
although plaintiffs do not take issue with the glomar doctrine as a general rule or as a permissible response to some foia requests,they contend that the nsa invocation of the glomar doctrine in this particular case was inappropriate because the tsp is no longer a secret national security program,any responsive records,if they exist,are not exempt under foia,and the nsa affidavits in support of its invocation of glomar,which are part of the public record,are insufficient to sustain the agency burden of proof.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment in foia litigation.see,tigue dep t of justice,cir.we also conduct de novo review when a member of the public challenges an agency assertion that a record being sought is exempt from disclosure.michael piano,ftc,cir.the agency asserting the exemption bears the burden of proof,and all doubts as to the applicability of the exemption must be resolved in favor of disclosure.see see also carney dep t of justice,cir t he defending agency has the burden of showing that any withheld documents fall within an exemption to the foia.affidavits or declarations giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption are sufficient to sustain the agency burden.carney,at.the a ffidavits submitted by an agency are accorded a presumption of good faith.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
glomar response to requests for information gathered pursuant to the tsp 
plaintiffs first argue that glomar may be invoked only to preserve the secrecy of a covert intelligence program or secret intelligence sources and methods,appellants br,and that the nsa inappropriately provided a glomar response in this case because the tsp is no longer a secret program in light of the government public acknowledgment of its existence and purpose following its controversial disclosure by the news media and ensuing public controversy.whether the glomar doctrine may be invoked in response to a foia request for records obtained under the tsp is also an issue of first impression for our court.
we now hold that,as a general rule,an agency may provide a glomar response to foia requests for information gathered under a program whose existence has been publicly revealed,and may do so specifically with respect to information gathered under the tsp,and that such a response will be reviewed in the same manner as any other glomar response to a foia request.the government decision to make public the existence of the tsp does not alter the rationale for allowing an agency to provide a glomar,to prevent the sort of harm that a foia exemption is designed to prevent.
the record is clear that,although the general existence of the tsp has been officially acknowledged,the specific methods used,targets of surveillance,and information obtained through the program have not been disclosed.president bush announced that he had authorized the nsa to intercept the international communications of people with known links to qaeda and related terrorist organizations.president bush address,supra.additionally,cia michael hayden noted that the general procedures the nsa implements in conducting electronic surveillance were also applicable to the tsp.he also indicated that,under the tsp,the nsa was targeting communications where one party is outside of the united states.general michael hayden,what american intelligence especially the nsa have been doing to defend the nation,address to the national press club,available at last visited.however,at no time have the president or other members of the national government in either the bush or obama administrations publicly confirmed or denied that particular persons were targeted or subject to surveillance.
the glomar doctrine is applicable in cases where to answer the foia inquiry would cause harm cognizable under a foia exception,gardels,at other words,in cases in which the existence or nonexistence of a record is a fact exempt from disclosure under a foia exception.an agency is therefore precluded from making a glomar response if the existence or nonexistence of the specific records sought by the foia request has been the subject of an official public acknowledgment.if the government has admitted that a specific record exists,a government agency may not later refuse to disclose whether that same record exists or not.see wolf cia,hudson river stoop clearwater,dep t of the navy,cir.
here,although the public is aware that the tsp exists,the government has found it necessary to keep undisclosed the details of the program operations and subject of plaintiffs foia request in this case.the fact that the public is aware of the program existence does not mean that the public is entitled to have information regarding the operation of the program,its targets,the information it has yielded,or other highly sensitive national security information that the government has continued to classify.indeed,the fact that the tsp existence has been made public reinforces the government continuing stance that it is necessary to keep confidential the details of the program operations and scope.
we therefore hold that,as a threshold matter,and as a general rule,an agency may invoke the glomar doctrine in response to a foia request regarding a publicly revealed matter.an agency only loses its ability to provide a glomar response when the existence or nonexistence of the particular records covered by the glomar response has been officially and publicly disclosed.we hold,in particular,that an agency may invoke the glomar doctrine with respect to the tsp,at least with respect to those aspects of the program that have not been the subject of such disclosures.accordingly,we now turn our attention to the question of whether the nsa in this particular case has met its burden to justify its glomar response.
b.the nsa invocation of glomar pursuant to foia exemptions in the instant case 
plaintiffs contend that even if the glomar doctrine may be invoked in the context of a foia request,the records plaintiffs seek here are not exempt from public disclosure under foia.accordingly,plaintiffs argue,confirming or denying the existence of these records is not exempt from public disclosure.we agree with the district court that,in order to invoke the glomar response to a foia request,an agency must tether its refusal,wilner,wl,at,to one of the nine foia exemptions.in other words,a government agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of certain records if the foia exemption would itself preclude the acknowledgment of such documents.minier,at.we adopt the district court careful and analysis,and affirm its judgment,including the holding that nsa glomar response was properly tethered to foia exemption,under section of the national security agency act of.
the nsa tied its glomar response to foia exemptions and.exemption permits the nondisclosure of records that are a specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and b are in fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order.b.in invoking exemption,the nsa specifically relies on executive order,as amended by executive order,which provides that an agency may classify records relating to,inter alia,intelligence activities including special activities,intelligence sources or methods,or cryptology,and vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems,installations,infrastructures,projects,plans,or protection services relating to the national security,which includes defense against transnational terrorism.at.under executive order,as amended,an agency may classify information when it determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security,which includes defense against transnational terrorism,and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.id.at.as the district court noted,the executive order specifically countenances the glomar response,permitting a classifying agency to refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of requested records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under this order or its predecessors.id.at.wilner,wl,at.
foia exemption applies to records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,provided that the statute requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue.b.in invoking exemption,the nsa relies on three statutes that preclude disclosure of the documents plaintiffs seek.first,the nsa argues that the documents are exempt under section of the national security agency act of nsaa,stat,codified at note,which provides that 
n othing in this act or any other law shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization or any function of the national security agency,of any information with respect to the activities thereof,or of the names,titles,salaries,or number of persons employed by such agency.
second,the nsa relies on section a i of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of,stat.codified at i,which requires the director of national intelligence to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.third,the nsa invokes section of title of the,which criminalizes disclosure of information concerning,inter alia,the communication intelligence activities of the united states.
because defendants need only proffer one legitimate basis for invoking the glomar response and foia exemptions and are separate and independent grounds in support of a glomar response,we consider only the applicability of foia exemption.see larson,at,a gencies may invoke the exemptions independently and courts may uphold agency action under one exemption without considering the applicability of the other.the district court held that the nsa affidavits provide the requisite detailed explanations for withholding the documents requested in foia request under foia exemption.specifically,defendants have demonstrated that acknowledging the existence or nonexistence of the information entailed in foia request would reveal the nsa organization,functions,and activities,in contravention of section of the nsaa.wilner,wl,at.we agree with the district court holding with respect to foia exemption,and we adopt its thorough analysis,which for convenience we set forth in full below 
in cia sims,d,the supreme court adopted a approach to evaluating an agency invocation of foia exemption first,the court must consider whether the statute identified by the agency is a statute of exemption as contemplated by exemption.second,the court must consider whether the withheld material satisfies the criteria of the exemption statute.id.at see fitzgibbon.as the circuit has observed,e xemption presents considerations distinct and apart from the other eight exemptions inscribed in foia.ass of retired workers retirement,
exemption differs from other foia exemptions in that its applicability depends less on the detailed factual contents of specific documents the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant statute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute coverage.
defendants argue,and plaintiffs do not dispute,that section of the nsaa qualifies as an exemption statute under exemption.the only circuit court to have considered this.see founding church of scientology,nsa,hoyden nsa.indeed,the language of section makes quite clear that it falls within the scope of exemption.section states that no law shall be construed to require the disclosure of any information with respect to the activities of the nsa,stat,codified at.section thus specifically exempt s certain information from disclosure.b.

sufficiency of the nsa affidavits 
the nsa affidavits in this case 
as we stated above,the agency resisting disclosure has the burden of proving the applicability of a foia exemption and may may meet its burden by submitting a detailed affidavit showing that the information logically falls within the claimed exemptions.minier,at internal quotation marks omitted.at oral argument before our court,plaintiffs argued that the nsa had not met its burden and that the government declarations were inadequate to support its invocation of glomar.we are not entirely convinced that plaintiffs preserved this argument but even if we were to reach the merits of whether the government affidavits are sufficient,we agree with the district court that the nsa has met its burden in this case.
an agency that has withheld responsive documents pursuant to a foia exemption can carry its burden to prove the applicability of the claimed exemption by affidavit,and we review the agency justifications therein de novo.ctr.for sec.studies dep t of justice,see also a b.summary judgment is warranted on the basis of agency affidavits when the affidavits describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption,and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.ultimately,an agency justification for invoking a foia exemption is sufficient if it appears logical or plausible.larson,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in evaluating an agency glomar response,a court must accord substantial weight to the agency affidavits.minier,at internal quotation marks omitted.in according such weight to the affidavits on which the district court relied,we conclude that they provide sufficient detail that the question of the existence or nonexistence of the requested records falls within exemption of foia.the nsa asserts that it can not provide any more information without doing cognizable harm,and we agree.the affidavits sufficiently establish that nondisclosure is reasons of national security and confidentiality.minor details of intelligence information may reveal more information than their apparent insignificance suggests because,much like a piece of jigsaw puzzle,each detail may aid in piecing together other bits of information even when the individual piece is not of obvious importance in itself.larson,at alterations in original.
in the interest of thoroughness,the district court provided a detailed explanation and analysis of the affidavits submitted by the nsa to support its claim that even confirming or denying the existence of the requested records would cause a harm that the exemptions to foia seek to avoid.we adopt that analysis as follows 
defendants contend that a cknowledging the existence or of the information requested by plaintiffs foia request would unquestionably reveal nsa organization,functions and activities by revealing the success or failure of nsa activities.in support of this contention,they have submitted affidavits from joseph brand,associate director,community integration,policy and records for the nsa michael mcconnell,director of national intelligence and david hardy,section chief of the dissemination section,records management division,federal bureau of investigation.
in his affidavit,brand avers that the tsp is a sigint program that is critical to the national security of the united states.operation of the tsp depends upon the collection of electronic communications,which can be easily compromised if targets are made aware of nsa capabilities and priorities.giving the glomar response to foia request was essential,brand attests,because 
a cknowledging the existence or non existence of those individuals or organizations subject to surveillance would provide our adversaries with critical information about the capabilities and limitations of the nsa,such as the types of communications that may be susceptible to nsa detection.confirmation by nsa that a person activities are not of foreign intelligence interest or that nsa is unsuccessful in collecting foreign intelligence information on their activities on a basis would allow our adversaries to accumulate information and draw conclusions about nsa technical capabilities,sources,and methods.
similarly,mcconnell states that t o confirm or deny whether someone is a target of surveillance would reveal to our adversaries that an individual may or may not be available as a secure means for communicating or,more broadly,the methods being used to conduct surveillance.the disclosure of such information would run afoul of section of the nsaa,brand contends,because it would reveal the sources of intelligence and would tend to reveal the methods by which such intelligence is collected further,confirmation or denial of this information would reveal the limitations of nsa sigint capabilities.even the disclosure of what appears to be the most innocuous information about the tsp poses a threat to national security,mcconnell avers,because it might permit our adversaries to piece together sensitive information about how the program operated,the capabilities,scope and effectiveness of the program and our current capability,which would be utilized by the enemy to allow them to plan their terrorist activities more securely.
these affidavits demonstrate that the documents sought in foia request relate to the organization or any function of the national security agency and seek information with respect to the activities thereof,stat,codified at,all of which are exempted from disclosure by section of the nsaa.the affidavits aver that the tsp is a sigint program,and signals intelligence is one of nsa primary functions the release of the sigint information would disclose information with respect to nsa activities,since any information about an intercepted communication concerns an nsa activity.hayden,at.moreover,the affidavits explain in detailed,nonconclusory fashion,wood fbi,cir,why the glomar response is appropriate.the affidavits thus giv e reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption,and are therefore sufficient to sustain the agency burden.carney,at.
wilner,wl,at.
nsa burden of proof under section of the nsaa generally 
an agency invoking glomar must show not only that the requested records would be exempt from disclosure,but also that the foia exemption would itself preclude the acknowledgment even confirming or denying the existence of such documents.minier,at.congress broad language in section of the nsaa eases that burden for the agency,as it exempts from disclosure any information with respect to the activities of that agency.confirming or denying the mere existence of specific records in a general surveillance program would logically be both confirming or denying that the nsa was targeting a specific individual and confirming or denying that the nsa is conducting a general surveillance program.either disclosure would be information with respect to the activities of the nsa and therefore exempt under foia.id.even if the nsa affidavits,standing alone,are insufficient,as plaintiffs argue,the very nature of their seeks records concerning whether their communications were monitored by the that any response would reveal information with respect to the activities of the nsa.because the nsa is exempt under the nsaa from revealing such information,foia exemption also applies and the nsa glomar response was therefore justified.
bad faith invocation of the glomar doctrine 
having concluded that the affidavits more than sufficiently support the nsa claim that foia exemption encompasses confirmation or denial of the existence of the requested records,we now consider plaintiffs claims that the nsa invoked the glomar doctrine for the purpose of concealing illegal or unconstitutional actions.we can not base our judgment on mere speculation that the nsa was attempting to conceal the purported illegality of the tsp by providing a glomar response to plaintiffs requests.a finding of bad faith must be grounded in evidence suggesting bad faith on the part of the agency.larson,at.ultimately,an agency justification for invoking a foia exemption is sufficient if it appears logical or plausible.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.after reviewing the record before us,we agree with the district court that the agency affidavits and justification are both logical and plausible.we d
