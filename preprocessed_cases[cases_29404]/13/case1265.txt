background 
on april,the government filed a criminal complaint against david hall alleging that he traveled in interstate commerce and knowingly failed to register and update his registration as a sex offender under a according to the complaint,hall pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in violation of penal law on may,and was sentenced to one year of incarceration.the sentencing judge designated hall a level sex offender,meaning that he was required to register as a sex offender with new york and keep that registration up to date.an affidavit that accompanied the april,criminal complaint states that,although hall initially registered as required,an annual registration verification form sent by new york to his registered address in june was returned by the united states post office.according to the affidavit,hall whereabouts remained unknown to new york until february or march,when hall applied for benefits and informed the cayuga county department of health and human services that he had been in charlottesville,virginia until moving back to auburn,new york with his girlfriend on february.the affidavit further states that virginia officials confirmed that hall did not register as a sex offender in virginia.a federal grand jury indicted hall under a on april.
hall moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that sorna does not apply in his case because neither new york nor virginia have implemented the terms of sorna as required by,and the united states attorney general did not make sorna retroactive violates the ex post facto and due process clauses as applied to him because it has not been implemented by new york or virginia exceeds congress power under the commerce clause encroaches on powers reserved to the states by the tenth amendment and violates the congressional doctrine.
on september,the united states district court for the northern district of new york dismissed the indictment.hall,d at.the district court rejected hall argument that of sorna by new york and virginia precludes prosecution because,contrary to the defendants assertions,the attorney general has specified that sorna applies to sex offenses predating its enactment regardless of whether sorna has been implemented by the relevant jurisdictions.id.at citing and.may.the district court also concluded that hall ex post facto challenge was misplaced because punishes knowing failure to register when moving between states and does not impermissibly increase the punishment for his underlying sex offense conviction.id.at.
the district court was equally unconvinced by hall argument that requiring him to register violated his due process rights because it was impossible for him to have registered under sorna when the relevant states have not yet implemented the statute registration requirements.the court reasoned that,regardless of state implementation,hall could have fulfilled his obligation to register as a sex offender under sorna by providing the existing virginia and new york sex offender registries with the required information upon changing his residence.id.at.
the district court rejected hall tenth amendment argument because hall could not show that either new york or virginia made any changes to their laws in order to comply with sorna.id.at.because the states did not take the actions required by sorna,the district court reasoned,their officials were not unconstitutionally commandeered into implementing federal law.id.at.the district court further concluded that congress had not impermissibly delegated its legislative authority to the attorney general by enacting sorna because the act provided the attorney general with an intelligible principle to follow by granting only the limited authority to determine the retroactive application of sorna registration requirements to individuals convicted of sex offenses prior to sorna enactment.id.at.
the district court nevertheless dismissed the indictment.it determined that congress overstepped its authority to regulate interstate commerce in enacting sorna.id.at.although the district court held that a which criminalizes travel in interstate commerce without updating one registration under not run afoul of the commerce clause under united states lopez,or united states morrison,see hall at at,it concluded that the underlying sorna registration requirement,is unconstitutional because it lacks a jurisdictional element restricting its application to individuals who travel in interstate commerce.hall,at.because requires registration when changing address,employment,or student status,without regard to state lines,the district court determined that the section was sustainable only if it regulated an activity substantially affecting interstate commerce.the court held it does not.id.at.the district court then rejected the government attempt to justify via congress spending power,reasoning that sorna registration requirements were not predicated upon any action being taken by a state.id.at.the district court dismissed the indictment because a conviction under would necessarily rely on the registration requirement that it had determined was unconstitutional.
on october,the government filed a superseding indictment in the northern district of new york alleging that f rom in or about may,through in or about april,defendant jose manuel guzman traveled in interstate commerce and knowingly failed to register or update his sorna registration in violation of a.according to a may,affidavit,following two convictions in new york,guzman was designated a level sex offender and required as a matter of new york law to register and to keep his registration up to date.the affidavit further states that a june annual verification form sent by new york to guzman address was returned by the united states post office,and in february the united states marshals in syracuse received information indicating that guzman was residing in lawrence,massachusetts.according to the affidavit,guzman did not register as a sex offender in massachusetts.he was arrested on april,and federally indicted.
guzman case was assigned to the same district judge who had previously dismissed hall indictment.guzman moved for dismissal,and on october,the district court issued a decision dismissing the indictment.as in its decision in hall,the district court rejected all of guzman arguments in support of dismissal,except for his argument that exceeds congress authority under the commerce clause.guzman,d at.the court rejected the government argument that regulates activity that substantially affects interstate commerce in the aggregate,see wickard filburn,and gonzales reich,because it regulates an activity that is not economic in nature.guzman,d at.similarly,the court rejected the government argument regarding the aggregate economic cost of crime as foreclosed by the supreme court in lopez.id.at see also lopez,at.the district court also held that the statute was not saved by the necessary and proper clause as an integral part of a broader regulatory scheme,because the necessary and proper c lause may not be used to sustain the regulation of intrastate activity having an insufficient effect upon interstate commerce if the more general statutory objective is outside the scope of the constitution.guzman,d at.
discussion 
the provisions of sorna relevant to this appeal are fairly straightforward.under a,a convicted sex offender must register and keep the registration current,in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,is employ ed,or is a student.with respect to initial registration,a sex offender must also register in the jurisdiction of conviction if it is not the offender jurisdiction of residence.id.for initial registration purposes,b provides that the individual must register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement or not later than business days after being sentenced for that offense,if the sex offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.section c requires the registrant to inform at least one of the relevant jurisdictions of all relevant updates to his or her registration information within three days of a change of name,residence,employment,or student status.the jurisdiction so informed must then share that information with other jurisdictions where the offender is required to register.see also id.b.section d gives the united states attorney general the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before sorna enactment on july,or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction,and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection b of this section.
under sorna criminal enforcement provision,a,if an individual who is required to register knowingly fails to register or keep the registration information current,the offender is subject to a fine,imprisonment,or both.however,in order for criminal liability to attach,the offender must travel in interstate or foreign commerce,or enter or leave,or reside in indian country,or the offender registration requirement must derive from a conviction under federal law including the uniform code of military justice,the law of the district of columbia,indian tribal law,or the law of any territory or possession of the united states.id.a.
other sorna provisions require jurisdictions to maintain sex offender registries in conformance with the act,and empower the united states attorney general to issue guidelines and regulations interpreting and implementing the act.a,b.sorna provides for a reduction in federal funding related to law enforcement for those jurisdictions failing to substantially implement sorna.
guzman and hall make virtually identical arguments urging us to affirm the district court holding that the national sex offender registration requirements in exceed congress constitutional authority to legislate pursuant to the commerce clause.they further contend that a similarly violates the commerce clause.we find neither of these contentions convincing,and are equally unpersuaded by the other constitutional arguments rejected by the district court.
commerce clause 
the constitution grants congress the power t o regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.the current framework for approaching questions of the scope of congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce derives from the supreme court opinion in united states lopez.lopez broke down the commerce clause inquiry into three categories of congressional regulatory authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities and to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.id.at.in united states morrison,the supreme court provided further guidance regarding the final category,articulating four factors to be weighed in determining whether an activity substantially affects interstate commerce whether the regulated activity is economic in nature whether the statute contains an express jurisdictional element linking its scope in some way to interstate commerce whether congress made express findings regarding the effects of the regulated activity on interstate commerce and attenuation of the link between the regulated activity and interstate commerce,internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,in morrison,the supreme court again firmly rejected the proposition that congress may regulate noneconomic,violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct aggregate effect on interstate commerce.id.at.
we have no difficulty concluding that a is a proper congressional exercise of the commerce power under lopez.section a only criminalizes a knowing failure to register when the offender is either required to register by reason of a federal law conviction or travels in interstate or foreign commerce,or enters or leaves,or resides in,indian country.these requirements stand in clear contrast to the lack of a jurisdictional predicate in the statutes at issue in lopez and morrison and are clearly intended to provide just such a jurisdictional nexus.according to the statute explicit terms,a sex offender whose underlying conviction was obtained pursuant to state law and who never crosses state lines,international borders,or the boundaries of indian country,can not be criminally liable for failure to comply with sorna.however,a convicted sex offender who travels interstate may incur criminal liability under the statute.interstate travel inherently involves use of the channels of interstate commerce and is properly subject to congressional regulation under the commerce clause.moreover,lopez explicitly acknowledges congress power to regulate persons traveling in interstate commerce.lopez,at see also united states dixon,cir,cert.granted on other grounds sub nom.carr united states.it comes as no surprise,then,that we join every other circuit that has examined the issue in concluding that a is a legitimate exercise of congressional commerce clause authority.see united states george,cir united states whaley,cir united states gould,cir united states ambert,cir dixon,at united states hinckley,cir united states may,cir.
the analysis of the constitutionality of sorna underlying registration requirement,is more difficult,but ultimately leads to the same result.appellees contend that can not be justified under the commerce clause because its scope is overly broad and may regulate purely intrastate activities by requiring sex offenders to register in the first place and to keep current in their registrations.however,does not exist in a vacuum.sections and were enacted as part of the adam walsh child protection and safety act of,and are clearly complementary without,lacks federal criminal enforcement,and without,has no substance.whaley,at internal citation omitted.
sorna was preceded by the jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration act of,which conditioned federal funding on states enactment of sex offender registration laws.see g.by the time that sorna was enacted in,every state and the district of columbia had enacted a sex offender registration law,gould,at,and sorna does not penalize failure to register so long as the registrant remains.thus,with sorna,congress goal was not simply to require sex offenders to register or to penalize the failure to do so,but rather to establish a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders.in other words,congress wanted to make sure sex offenders could not avoid all registration requirements just by moving to another state.
the necessary and proper clause to the constitution gives congress the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for its use of the commerce power,cl.where necessary to make a regulation of interstate commerce effective,congress may regulate even those intrastate activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate commerce.raich,scalia,concurring see
