background 
plaintiff anna gualandi is a new york public school teacher in the river central school district school district.plaintiff claudia travers was a public school teacher in the same district until she retired plaintiffs or appellants.both plaintiffs have been members of a labor union called the river teachers association swrta or union,and have participated in an employee benefit plan called the swrta reimbursement fund plan.
defendants are the union and its officers,as well as insurance broker newman,newman,its agents,and various affiliated corporations,all of which entities and individuals have been involved with administering the plan.plaintiffs contend defendants actions with regard to the plan violated various provisions of erisa.in particular,they allege defendants violated b,a c,and a b of erisa,b,a c,a b,by withholding information from the plan participants,breaching their fiduciary duties,and engaging in prohibited transactions with the plan funds.
a.the plan 
the plan,which is the subject of this litigation,is an reimbursement fund for the benefit of the public school teachers employed in the school district.it was designed to work as follows when a teacher is attended by a medical provider and the statement for the services rendered is not already covered by one of the numerous policies that insure the teachers,the teacher must pay herself for the medical services rendered.she may then seek reimbursement for her expense from the plan at issue in this litigation.the plan was created by using excess insurance payments from the school district that had been accumulating in a bank account since the.these excess payments were made under the terms of a series of collective bargaining agreements between the school district and the union.the agreements required the school district to provide medical,dental,optical,life and superimposed major medical insurance to its employees by paying a fixed yearly amount per teacher to insurance broker newman.in some years,the school district payments exceeded the total cost of the premiums due for the insurance coverage provided.newman set aside the excess money in a separate account,which by amounted to.
b.the agreement 
in a dispute arose because the school district refused to contribute a fixed amount sum to the extent that it exceeded the actual cost of the premiums.the school district and the union ultimately resolved the dispute through a settlement agreement.that agreement provided that the school district would now be required to pay only the actual amount of the insurance premiums,not the fixed yearly amount per teacher that it was paying before.the settlement agreement further stated 
the school district agrees to forward by december,to the swrta insurance fund account.
the school district relinquishes any and all claims to any funds previously accumulated in the swrta insurance fund account including the above payment.swrta relinquishes any and all claims to funds previously due to the swrta insurance fund in excess of the for the school year.the school district will provide any approvals necessary for swrta to set up a swrta benefit trust.
the union used the specified in the agreement and the money from excess payments already in the account to set up the reimbursement fund,the plan at issue in this case.
subsequently,plaintiffs instituted the instant suit based on the manner in which defendants had administered the plan.when the matter came before judge mishler he found the money used by defendants to set up and run the plan was government funds,which made the plan a governmental plan not covered by erisa.accordingly,the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.from the order of dismissal,plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
erisa is the sole basis plaintiffs assert for federal jurisdiction over their claims,and the district court dismissed because it determined such jurisdiction was lacking.it held the school district had funded the reimbursement fund,and it concluded this funding was enough to exclude the plan from erisa coverage as a governmental plan.on appeal,plaintiffs attack the district court factual finding and its legal conclusion.they also argue the district court erroneously failed to grant their request for additional discovery.
we go first to our standard of review.in reviewing a district court determination of whether it has subject matter jurisdiction,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.london polishook,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states gypsum.bronx household of faith bd.of,cir.we turn next to the merits.
i the school district funded the plan 
the district court found the school district funded the plan based on evidence that all of the money originally came from the school district and was specifically earmarked for an employee benefit plan.plaintiffs concede the school district was the original source of the money,but nonetheless insist that the union,not the school district,actually funded the plan.in plaintiffs view,the school district gave the money to the union with no strings attached,and the union then chose to use it for the plan.plaintiffs maintain it was clearly erroneous for the district court to find otherwise.
the trial court based its finding on three pieces of evidence the affidavit of one william cala,the school district superintendent at the time of the settlement agreement between the school district and the union the language of the settlement agreement and the language of the collective bargaining agreements.in the affidavit,cala states he negotiated the settlement agreement on behalf of the school district and it was his understanding that the money turned over to the union under the agreement could be used only to purchase additional insurance for school district employees.the court found this testimony supported by the language of the settlement agreement,which provided that the school district forward to the swrta union insurance fund account and for the school district to grant any approvals necessary for swrta the union to set up a union benefit trust.in addition,the collective bargaining agreements provided that the insurance money paid by the school district shall be spent for the insurance plans so designated.
plaintiffs contend the district court should not have considered the cala affidavit because it contains legal conclusions.yet,even assuming that to be the case,the district court did not rely on any legal conclusions in the affidavit.instead,it looked to cala statements as evidence of how he and the school district understood the terms of the settlement agreement.
appellants also assert the affidavit constituted parol evidence that should not have been considered because the settlement agreement was a fully integrated contract.the parol evidence rule generally prohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence of prior or contemporaneous o
