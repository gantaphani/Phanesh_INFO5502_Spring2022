respondent kebodeaux was convicted by a special of a federal sex offense.after serving his sentence and receiving a bad conduct discharge from the air force,he moved to texas where he registered with state authorities as a sex offender.congress subsequently enacted the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,which requires federal sex offenders to register in the states where they live,study,and work,a,and which applies to offenders who,when sorna became law,had already completed their sentences,cfr.when kebodeaux moved within texas and failed to update his registration,the federal government prosecuted him under sorna,and the district court convicted him.the fifth circuit reversed,noting that,at the time of sorna enactment,kebodeaux had served his sentence and was no longer in any special relationship with the federal government.believing that kebodeaux was not required to register under the jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration act,the court found that he had been unconditionally freed.that being so,the court held,the federal government lacked the power under article i necessary and proper clause to regulate his intrastate movements.
held sorna registration requirements as applied to kebodeaux fall within the scope of congress authority under the necessary and proper clause.
a contrary to the fifth circuit critical assumption that kebodeaux release was unconditional,a full reading of the relevant statutes and regulations makes clear that at the time of his offense and conviction he was subject to the wetterling act,which imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to sorna.see,i.the fact that these requirements in part involved compliance with requirements made them no less requirements of federal law.see generally united states sharpnack.
b congress promulgated the wetterling act under authority granted by the military regulation clause,art.i,cl,and the necessary and proper clause.the same power that authorized congress to promulgate the uniform code of military justice and punish kebodeaux crime also authorized congress to make the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of his conviction.and its decision to impose a civil registration requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like kebodeaux is eminently reasonable.see smith doe.it was also entirely reasonable for congress to have assigned a special role to the federal government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offender registration requirements.see carr united states.thus,congress did not apply sorna to an individual who had,prior to its enactment,been unconditionally released,but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements enacted pursuant to the military regulation and necessary and proper clauses.sorna somewhat modified the applicable registration requirements to which kebodeaux was already subject,in order to make more uniform what had remained a patchwork of federal and individual state registration requirements,reynolds united states.no one here claims that these changes are unreasonable or that congress could not reasonably have found them necessary and proper means for furthering its registration ends.

united states,petitioner anthony james kebodeaux 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in a special convicted anthony kebodeaux,a member of the united states air force,of a sex offense.it imposed a sentence of three months imprisonment and a bad conduct discharge.in,several years after kebodeaux had served his sentence and been discharged,congress enacted the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,stat,et,a federal statute that requires those convicted of federal sex offenses to register in the states where they live,study,and work.a a.and,by regulation,the federal government made clear that sorna registration requirements apply to federal sex offenders who,when sorna became law,had already completed their sentences.d attorney general authority to issue regulations cfr regulation specifying application to offenders.
we here must decide whether the constitution necessary and proper clause grants congress the power to enact sorna registration requirements and apply them to a federal offender who had completed his sentence prior to the time of sorna enactment.for purposes of answering this question,we assume that congress has complied with the constitution ex post facto and due process clauses.see smith doe,upholding a similar alaska statute against ex post facto challenge supp.brief for kebodeaux on rehearing en banc in not raising any due process challenge brief for respondent same.we conclude that the necessary and proper clause grants congress adequate power to enact sorna and to apply it here.
as we have just said,in a special convicted kebodeaux,then a member of the air force,of a federal sex offense.he served his sentence the air force released him with a bad conduct discharge.and then he moved to texas.in kebodeaux registered as a sex offender with texas state authorities.brief for respondent.in congress enacted sorna.in kebodeaux moved within texas from san antonio to el paso,updating his sex offender registration.app.to pet.for cert.but later that year he returned to san antonio without making the legally required registration changes,at.and the federal government,acting under sorna,prosecuted kebodeaux for this sorna registration failure.
a federal district court convicted kebodeaux of having violated sorna.see,en banc.on appeal a panel of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit initially upheld the conviction.per curiam.but the circuit then heard the appeal en banc and,by a vote of to,reversed,at.the court stated that,by the time congress enacted sorna,kebodeaux had fully served his sentence he was no longer in federal custody,in the military,under any sort of supervised release or parole,or in any other special relationship with the federal government.ibid.
the court recognized that,even before sorna,federal law required certain federal sex offenders to register,at.see jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration act,stat.but it believed that the federal registration requirements did not apply to kebodeaux,at.hence,in the circuit view,kebodeaux had been unconditionally let free.at.and,that being so,the federal government lacked the power under article i necessary and proper clause to regulate through registration kebodeaux intrastate movements,at.in particular,the court said that after the federal government has unconditionally let a person free the fact that he once committed a crime is not a jurisdictional basis for subsequent regulation and possible criminal prosecution.ibid.
the solicitor general sought certiorari.and,in light of the fact that a federal court of appeals has held a federal statute unconstitutional,we granted the petition.see,united states morrison,united states edge broadcasting.
we do not agree with the circuit conclusion.and,in explaining our reasons,we need not go much further than the circuit critical assumption that kebodeaux release was unconditional,that after kebodeaux release,he was not in any special relationship with the federal government.at.to the contrary,the solicitor general,tracing through a complex set of statutory,has pointed out that at the time of his offense and conviction kebodeaux was subject to the federal wetterling act,an act that imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to those that sorna later mandated.brief for united states.
congress enacted the wetterling act in and updated it several times prior to kebodeaux offense.like sorna,it used the federal spending power to encourage states to adopt sex offender registration laws.i ed.smith,supra,at.like sorna,it applied to those who committed federal sex crimes.b a.and like sorna,it imposed federal penalties upon federal sex offenders who failed to register in the states in which they lived,worked,and studied.i.
in particular,i imposed federal criminal penalties upon any person who is described in section c of title,and knowingly fails to register in any state in which the person resides.the c said that a person is described in this paragraph if the person was convicted of certain enumerated offenses or a ny other offense designated by the attorney general as a sexual offense for purposes of this subsection.c.in the attorney general delegated this authority to designate sex offenses to the director of the bureau of prisons.of justice,bureau of prisons,designation of offenses subject to sex offender release notification,fed.reg.and that same year the director of the bureau of prisons designate d the offense of which kebodeaux was convicted,namely the military offense of carnal knowledge as set forth in article b of the code of military justice,at see cfr b.a full reading of these documents makes clear that,contrary to kebodeaux contention,the relevant penalty applied to crimes committed by military personnel.
moreover,a different wetterling act section imposed federal criminal penalties upon any person who is sentenced by a court martial for conduct in a category specified by the secretary of defense under section a c of title i of public law,and knowingly fails to register in any state in which the person resides.i ed.the section,a c,said that the secretary of defense shall specify categories of conduct punishable under the uniform code of military justice which encompass a range of conduct comparable to that described in certain provisions of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of,and such other conduct as the secretary deems appropriate.appropriations act,a c i,stat.see note following ed.the secretary had delegated certain types of authority,such as this last mentioned deem ing authority,to an assistant secretary of defense.dod directive.and in december an assistant secretary,acting pursuant to this authority,published a list of military crimes that included the crime of which kebodeaux was convicted,namely article b of the uniform code of military justice.app.to pet.for cert.the provision added that c onvictions shall trigger requirements to notify state and local law enforcement agencies and to provide information to inmates concerning sex offender registration requirements.at.and,the provision says contrary to kebodeaux reading,brief for respondent,that it shall take effect immediately.it contains no expiration date.app.to pet.for cert.
we are not aware of any plausible counterargument to the obvious conclusion,namely that as of the time of kebodeaux offense,conviction and release from federal custody,these wetterling act provisions applied to kebodeaux and imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to those that sorna later imposed.contrary to what the court of appeals may have believed,the fact that the federal law requirements in part involved compliance with requirements made them no less requirements of federal law.see generally united states sharpnack,congress has the power to adopt as federal law the laws of a state and to apply them in federal enclaves gibbons ogden,wheat,although congress can not enable a state to legislate,congress may adopt the provisions of a state on any subject.the act adopts state systems for regulation of pilots and gives them the same validity as if its provisions had been specially made by congress 
both the court of appeals and kebodeaux come close to conceding that if,as of the time of kebodeaux offense,he was subject to a federal registration requirement,then the necessary and proper clause authorized congress to modify the requirement as in sorna and to apply the modified requirement to kebodeaux.see,at,and tr.of oral arg.and we believe they would be right to make this concession.
no one here claims that the wetterling act,as applied to military sex offenders like kebodeaux,falls outside the scope of the necessary and proper clause.and it is difficult to see how anyone could persuasively do so.the constitution explicitly grants congress the power to make rules for the regulation of the land and naval forces.art.i,cl.and,in the necessary and proper clause itself,it grants congress the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers that the constitution vests in the government of the united states,or in any department or officer thereof.cl.
the scope of the necessary and proper clause is broad.in words that have come to define that scope chief justice marshall long ago wrote 
let the end be legitimate,let it be within the scope of the constitution,and all means which are appropriate,which are plainly adapted to that end,which are not prohibited,but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,are constitutional.mcculloch maryland,wheat.
as we have come to understand these words and the provision they explain,they leav e to congress a large discretion as to the means that may be employed in executing a given power.lottery case.see morrison,at.the clause allows congress to adopt any means,appearing to it most eligible and appropriate,which are adapted to the end to be accomplished and consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution.james everard breweries day.
the constitution,for example,makes few explicit references to federal criminal law,but the necessary and proper clause nonetheless authorizes congress,in the implementation of other explicit powers,to create federal crimes,to confine offenders to prison,to hire guards and other prison personnel,to provide prisoners with medical care and educational training,to ensure the safety of those who may come into contact with prisoners,to ensure the public safety through systems of parole and supervised release,and,where a federal prisoner mental condition so requires,to confine that prisoner civilly after the expiration of his or her term of imprisonment.see united states comstock.
here,under the authority granted to it by the military regulation and necessary and proper clauses,congress could promulgate the uniform code of military justice.it could specify that the sex offense of which kebodeaux was convicted was a military crime under that code.it could punish that crime through imprisonment and by placing conditions upon kebodeaux release.and it could make the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of kebodeaux offense and conviction.this civil requirement,while not a specific condition of kebodeaux release,was in place at the time kebodeaux committed his offense,and was a consequence of his violation of federal law.
and congress decision to impose such a civil requirement that would apply upon the release of an offender like kebodeaux is eminently reasonable.congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.see smith,at sex offender registration has a legitimate nonpunitive purpose of public safety,which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community there is evidence that recidivism rates among sex offenders are higher than the average for other types of criminals.see of justice,bureau of justice statistics,langan,schmitt,durose,recidivism of sex offenders released in,reporting that compared to offenders,released sex offenders were four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime,and that within the first three years following release of released sex offenders were rearrested for a sex crime.there is also conflicting evidence on the point.tewsbury,jennings,zgoba,final report on sex offenders recidivism and collateral consequences concluding that sex offenders have relatively low rates of recidivism,and that registration requirements have limited observable benefits regarding recidivism.but the clause gives congress the power to weigh the evidence and to reach a rational conclusion,for example,that safety needs justify postrelease registration rules.see lambert yellowley,upholding congressional statute limiting the amount of spirituous liquor that may be prescribed by a physician,and noting that congress finding regarding the appropriate amount,in the presence of the diverging opinions of physicians,can not be regarded as arbitrary or without a reasonable basis see also gonzales raich,in assessing the scope of congress authority under the commerce clause,we stress that the task before us is a modest one.we need not determine whether respondents activities,taken in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce in fact,but only whether a rational basis exists for so concluding see also,pt,house report citing statistics compiled by the justice department as support for sorna sex offender registration regime.
at the same time,it is entirely reasonable for congress to have assigned the federal government a special role in ensuring compliance with sorna registration requirements by federal sex offenders persons who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.carr united states,slip,at.the federal government has long kept track of former federal prisoners through probation,parole,and supervised release in part to prevent further crimes thereby protecting the public against the risk of recidivism.see parole act,stat.probation act,ch,stat.sentencing reform act of,ch.ii,stat.see also cohen,the law of probation and parole,ed.principal purposes of postrelease conditions are to rehabilitate the convict,thus preventing him from recidivating,and to protect the public.neither,as of,was registration particularly novel,for by then states had implemented similar requirements for close to half a century.see logan,knowledge as power criminal registration and community notification laws in america.moreover,the wetterling act took state interests into account by,for the most part,requiring released federal offenders to register in accordance with state law.at the same time,the wetterling act requirements were reasonably narrow and precise,tying time limits to the type of sex offense,incorporating details,and relating penalties for violations to the sex crime initially at issue.see b ed.
the upshot is that here congress did not apply sorna to an individual who had,prior to sorna enactment,been unconditionally released,a person who was not in any special relationship with the federal government,but rather to an individual already subject to federal registration requirements that were themselves a valid exercise of federal power under the military regulation and necessary and proper clauses.but post,at scalia,dissenting.
sorna,enacted after kebodeaux release,somewhat modified the applicable registration requirements.in,sorna provided more detailed definitions of sex offenses,described in greater detail the nature of the information registrants must provide,and imposed somewhat different limits upon the length of time that registration must continue and the frequency with which offenders must update their registration,ed.and supp.v.but the statute,like the wetterling act,used spending clause grants to encourage states to adopt its uniform definitions and requirements.it did not insist that the states do so.see a,d ed.the provisions of this subchapter that are cast as directions to jurisdictions or their officials constitute,in relation to states,only conditions required to avoid the reduction of federal funding under this section 
as applied to an individual already subject to the wetterling act like kebodeaux,sorna makes few changes.in particular,sorna modified the time limitations for a sex offender who moves to update his registration to within three business days of the move from both seven days before and seven days after the move,as required by the texas law enforced under the wetterling act.compare c with app.to pet.for cert.sorna also increased the federal penalty for a federal offender registration violation to a maximum of years from a maximum of year for a first offense.compare a with i ed.kebodeaux was sentenced to one year and one day of imprisonment.for purposes of federal law,sorna re duced the duration of kebodeaux registration requirement to years from the lifetime requirement imposed by texas law,compare a ed.with app.to pet.for cert,and reduced the frequency with which kebodeaux must update his registration to every six months from every days as imposed by texas law,compare with app.to pet.for cert.and as far as we can tell,while sorna punishes violations of its requirements instead of violations of state law,the federal government has prosecuted a sex offender for violating sorna only when that offender also violated requirements.
sorna general changes were designed to make more uniform what had remained a patchwork of federal and individual state registration systems,reynolds united states,slip,at,with loopholes and deficiencies that had resulted in an estimated sex offenders becoming missing or lost,house report.see.see also jinks richland county,holding that a statute is authorized by the necessary and proper clause when it provides an alternative to otherwise unsatisfactory options that are obviously inefficient sorna more specific changes reflect congress determination that the statute,changed in respect to frequency,penalties,and other details,will keep track of more offenders and will encourage states themselves to adopt its uniform standards.no one here claims that these changes are unreasonable or that congress could not reasonably have found them necessary and proper means for furthering its registration ends.
we conclude that the sorna changes as applied to kebodeaux fall within the scope congress authority under the military regulation and necessary and proper clauses.the fifth circuit judgment to the contrary is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
roberts,concurring in judgment 
united states,petitioner anthony james kebodeaux 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
chief justice roberts,concurring in the judgment.
i agree with the court that congress had the power,under the military regulation and necessary and proper clauses of article i,to require anthony kebodeaux to register as a sex offender.the majority,having established that premise and thus resolved the case before us,nevertheless goes on to discuss the general public safety benefits of the registration requirement.ante,at.because that analysis is beside the point in this case,i concur in the judgment only.
while serving in the air force,kebodeaux violated the uniform code of military justice by having sexual relations with a minor.a special convicted him.as relevant here,that conviction had two consequences first,kebodeaux was sentenced to confinement for three months.and second,as the majority describes,he was required to register as a sex offender with the state in which he resided and keep that registration current failure to do so would subject him to federal criminal penalties.ante,at.
in the same way that congress undoubtedly had the authority to impose the first consequence for a violation of military rules,it also had the authority to impose the second.the constitution gives congress the power t o make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.art.i,cl.and,under the necessary and proper clause,congress can give those rules force by imposing consequences on members of the military who disobey them.see mcculloch maryland,wheat,all admit that the government may,legitimately,punish any violation of its laws and yet,this is not among the enumerated powers of congress.a servicemember will be less likely to violate a relevant military regulation if he knows that,having done so,he will be required to register as a sex offender years into the future.
it is this power,the power to regulate the conduct of members of the military by imposing consequences for their violations of military law,that supports application of the federal registration obligation to kebodeaux.as the court explains,the wetterling act was in force when kebodeaux committed the original offense,and applied to him as soon as the special rendered its verdict.see ante,at.congress later,in enacting the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,modified the registration regime in place under the wetterling act.but as applied to kebodeaux here the relevant inquiry in this challenge,those changes were insignificant their only effect was that kebodeaux received a day more than he could have received for the same conduct had the wetterling act remained in force.see ante,at describing sorna effect on kebodeaux registration obligations compare post,at,thomas,dissenting discussing changes that did not affect kebodeaux.whatever other constitutional concerns might attach to such a change,as a question of article i power it was permissible.just as the federal government may,under the necessary and proper clause,alter the conditions of a federal prisoner confinement or adjust the timing and location of drug tests required of a federal convict,so too could it make slight modifications to a previously imposed registration obligation.
the majority says,more or less,the same thing.ante,at.but sandwiched between its discussion of the basis for congress power and its discussion of the inconsequential nature of the changes is a discussion of benefits from the registration system.along with giving force to military regulations,the majority notes,congress could also have reasonably conclude d that registration requirements help protect the public from federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.ante,at.
maybe so,but those consequences of the registration requirement are irrelevant for our purposes.public safety benefits are neither necessary nor sufficient to a proper exercise of the power to regulate the military.what matters all that matters is that congress could have rationally determined that mak ing the civil registration requirement at issue here a consequence of kebodeaux offense would give force to the uniform code of military justice adopted pursuant to congress power to regulate the armed forces.ibid.
ordinarily such surplusage might not warrant a separate writing.here,however,i worry that incautious readers will think they have found in the majority opinion something they would not find in either the constitution or any prior decision of ours a federal police power.the danger of such confusion is heightened by the fact the solicitor general adopted something very close to the police power argument,contending that the federal government has greater ties to former federal sex offenders than it does to other members of the general public,and can therefore impose restrictions on them even years after their unconditional release simply to serve purposes.brief for united states.
i write separately to stress not only that a federal police power is immaterial to the result in this case,but also that such a power could not be material to the result in this case because it does not exist.see united states morrison,w e always have rejected readings of the scope of federal power that would permit congress to exercise a police power quoting united states lopez,thomas,concurring.
our resistance to congressional assertions of such a power has deep roots.from the first,we have recognized that the powers of the government are limited,and that its limits are not to be transcended.mcculloch,at.thus,while the necessary and proper clause authorizes congressional action incidental to an enumerated power,and conducive to its beneficial exercise,chief justice marshall was emphatic that no great substantive and independent power can be implied as incidental to other powers,or used as a means of executing them.at,see also gibbons ogden,wheat,the enumeration presupposes something not enumerated 
it is difficult to imagine a clearer example of such a great substantive and independent power than the power to help protect the public and alleviate public safety concerns,ante,at.i find it implausible to suppose and impossible to support that the framers intended to confer such authority by implication rather than expression.a power of that magnitude vested in the federal government is not consist ent with the letter and spirit of the constitution,mcculloch,supra,at,and thus not a proper means for carrying into execution the enumerated powers of the federal government,art.i,cl.see united states comstock,kennedy,concurring in judgment it is of fundamental importance to consider whether essential attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the assertion of federal power under the necessary and proper clause 
it makes no difference that the federal government would be policing people previously convicted of a federal crime even a federal sex crime.the fact of a prior federal conviction,by itself,does not give congress a freestanding,independent,and perpetual interest in protecting the public from the convict purely intrastate conduct.
but as i have said,i do not understand the majority opinion to be based on such a power.the connection to the military regulation clause on which the majority relies,ante,at,is less attenuated,and the power it produces less substantial,than would be true of a federal police power over prior federal offenders the power to threaten and impose particular obligations as a result of a violation of military law is not such a great substantive and independent power that the framers failure to enumerate it must imply its absence.
nevertheless,i fear that the majority discussion of the benefits of the registration requirement will be mistaken for an endorsement of the solicitor general basis for the law.i accordingly concur in the judgment only.
alito,concurring in judgment 
united states,petitioner anthony james kebodeaux 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice alito,concurring in the judgment.
i concur in the judgment solely on the ground that the registration requirement at issue is necessary and proper to execute congress power t o make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.art.i,cl.exercising this power,congress has enacted provisions of the uniform code of military justice ucmj that authorize members of the military to be tried before a military tribunal,rather than a state court,for ordinary criminal offenses,including sex crimes,that are committed both within and outside the boundaries of a military installation.see,ucmj persons subject to ucmj this chapter applies in all places rape by a person subject to ucmj solorio united states,servicemember may be for crime without service connection states usually have concurrent jurisdiction over such crimes when they are committed off base and sometimes possess jurisdiction over such offenses when committed on base these offenses,however,are rarely prosecuted in both a military and a state court,and therefore when a servicemember is for a sex offense over which the state had jurisdiction,this is usually because the state has deferred to the military where the offense in question is a sex crime,a consequence of this handling of the case is that the offender,if convicted,may fall through the cracks of a state registration system.for example,if the servicemember is convicted of a sex offense in a state court,the state court may be required by state law to provide that information to the state registry.see.stat.ann.a i.state law may also require the state corrections department to notify both state and local police of the offender release.see.provisions such as these are designed to prevent sex offenders from avoiding registration,as many have in the past.see,pt,despite registration efforts,t he most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program was that over sex offenders,or nearly in the nation are missing,meaning that they have not complied with sex offender registration requirements when a servicemember is convicted by a military tribunal,however,the state has no authority to require that tribunal to notify the state registry,nor does it have the authority to require the officials at a military prison to notify state or local police when the servicemember is released from custody.because the exercise of military jurisdiction may have this effect in other words,may create a gap in the laws intended to maximize the registration of sex offenders it is necessary and proper for congress to require the registration of members of the military who are convicted of a qualifying sex offense in a military court.when congress,in validly exercising a power expressly conferred by the constitution,creates or exacerbates a dangerous situation here,the possibility that a convicted sex offender may escape registration,congress has the power to try to eliminate or at least diminish that danger.see united states comstock,alito,concurring in judgment.i accordingly concur in the judgment only.

i join parts i,ii,and of justice thomas dissent.i do not join part because i do not agree that what is necessary and proper to enforce a statute validly enacted pursuant to an enumerated power is not itself necessary and proper to the execution of an enumerated power.it is my view that if congress has the authority to act,then it also possesses every power needed to make that action effective.gonzales raich,scalia,concurring in judgment quoting united states wrightwood dairy.if i thought that sorna registration requirement were reasonably adapted,raich,supra,at,to carrying into execution some other,valid enactment,i would sustain it.
but it is not.the lynchpin of the court reasoning is that kebodeaux was subject to a federal registration requirement the wetterling act at the time of his offense,and so the necessary and proper clause authorized congress to modify the requirement as in sorna and to apply the modified requirement to kebodeaux.ante,at.that does not establish,however,that the wetterling act registration requirement was itself a valid exercise of any federal power,or that sorna is designed to carry the wetterling act into execution.the former proposition is dubious,the latter obviously untrue.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice thomas,with whom justice scalia joins as to parts i,ii,and,dissenting.
anthony kebodeaux was convicted under the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,et,for failing to update his sex offender registration when he moved from one texas city to another.the court today holds that congress has power under the necessary and proper clause to enact sorna and criminalize kebodeaux failure to update his registration.i disagree.as applied to kebodeaux,sorna does not carr y into execution any of the federal powers enumerated in the constitution.art.i,cl.rather,it usurps the general police power vested in the states.because sorna registration requirements are unconstitutional as applied to kebodeaux,i respectfully dissent.
congress enacted sorna in.sorna requires that every sex offender shall register,and keep the registration current,in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,where the offender is an employee,and where the offender is a student.a these requirements apply to all sex offenders,including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of sorna.cfr.as relevant here,sorna makes it a federal crime when someone who is required to register as a sex offender knowingly fails to register or update a registration and that person is a sex offender as defined by sorna by reason of a conviction under federal law including the uniform code of military justice.a a.
in march,anthony kebodeaux had consensual sex with a girl when he was a airman in the air force.he was convicted by a of carnal knowledge of a female under the age of,in violation of article b of the uniform code of military justice ucmj.he was sentenced to three months imprisonment and received a discharge.he completed his sentence in september and was no longer in federal custody or the military when congress enacted sorna,which required him to register as a sex offender.in,kebodeaux failed to update his registration within three days of moving from el paso,texas,to san antonio,texas.he was convicted under a a in and sentenced to a year and a day in prison.the question before the court is whether congress has power to require kebodeaux to register as a sex offender and to criminalize his failure to do so.
the constitution creates a federal government with limited powers.congress has no powers except those specified in the constitution.see marbury madison,cranch,marshall,the powers of the legislature are defined,and limited and that those limits may not be mistaken,or forgotten,the constitution is written thus,e very law enacted by congress must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the constitution.united states morrison.
a different default rule applies to the states.as the tenth amendment makes clear,the states enjoy all powers that the constitution does not withhold from them.the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution,nor prohibited by it to the states,are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people while the powers of congress are few and defined,the powers that remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite.the federalist,wright ed.madison.
the constitution sets forth congress limited powers in article i.that article begins by vest ing in congress a ll legislative powers herein granted,and then enumerates those powers in.the final clause of,the necessary and proper clause,gives congress power t o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states,or in any department or officer thereof.art.i,cl.importantly,the necessary and proper clause is not a freestanding grant of congressional power,but rather an authorization to makes laws that are necessary to execute both the powers vested in congress by the preceding clauses of,and the powers vested in congress and the other branches by other provisions of the constitution.see,kinsella united states ex rel.singleton,the necessary and proper clause is not itself a grant of power,but a caveat that the congress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the specifically granted foregoing powers of and all other powers vested by this constitution 
in mcculloch maryland,wheat,chief justice marshall famously set forth the court interpretation of the necessary and proper clause 
let the end be legitimate,let it be within the scope of the constitution,and all means which are appropriate,which are plainly adapted to that end,which are not prohibited,but consist ent with the letter and spirit of the constitution,are constitutional.at.
under this formulation,a federal law is a valid exercise of congress power under the clause if it satisfies a test.first,the law must be directed toward a legitimate end,which mcculloch defines as one within the scope of the c onstitution.united states comstock,thomas,dissenting quoting,at.in other words,the law must be directed at carrying into execution one or more of the powers delegated to the federal government by the constitution.art.i,cl.second,there must be a necessary and proper fit between the means the federal law and the end the enumerated power or powers it is designed to serve.comstock,at thomas,dissenting.the means congress selects will be deemed necessary if they are appropriate and plainly adapted to the exercise of an enumerated power,and proper if they are not otherwise prohibited by the constitution and not in consistent with its letter and spirit.at quoting art.i,cl.and mcculloch,at.
both parts of this test are critical.n o matter how necessary or proper an act of congress may be to its objective,congress lacks authority to legislate if the objective is anything other than carrying into execution one or more of the federal government enumerated powers.comstock,supra,at thomas,dissenting.as applied to kebodeaux,sorna fails this test.
it is undisputed that no enumerated power in article i,gives congress the power to punish sex offenders who fail to register,nor does any other provision in the constitution vest congress or the other branches of the federal government with such a power.thus,sorna is a valid exercise of congressional authority only if it is necessary and proper for carrying into execution one or more of those federal powers enumerated in the constitution.
in the course of this litigation,the government has argued that kebodeaux conviction under a a executes congress enumerated powers to spend for the general welfare,art.i,cl.to regulate interstate commerce,cl.and to regulate the armed forces,cl.but none of these powers justifies applying a a to kebodeaux.the spending clause argument is a nonstarter.section a a does not execute congress spending power because it regulates individuals who have not necessarily received federal funds of any kind.the government contends that federal funding and logistical support offered to states for their programs can be effective only if persons required to register actually do so and that congress may impose penalties on such individuals as a means of achieving that goal.brief for united states.but we have never held that congress gains the power to regulate private individuals merely because it provides money to the states in which they reside.
nor does the commerce clause the enumerated power that the court has construed most broadly support a a.under this court precedents,congress may use its commerce clause power to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,and economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.united states lopez,see also morrison,at.section a a does not fall within the first two categories because it is not limited to regulating sex offenders who have traveled in interstate commerce.instead,it applies to all federal sex offenders who fail to register,even if they never cross state lines.nor does a a fall within the third category.congress may not regulate noneconomic activity,such as sex crimes,based on the effect it might have on interstate commerce.morrison,supra,at.we reject the argument that congress may regulate noneconomic,violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct aggregate effect on interstate commerce in short,a a regulates activity that is neither interstate nor commercial,and,thus,it can not be justified on the ground that it executes congress power to regulate interstate commerce.
finally,congress power t o make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces does not support kebodeaux conviction under a a.art.i,cl.kebodeaux had long since fully served his criminal sentence for violating article b of the ucmj and was no longer in the military when congress enacted sorna.congress does not retain a general police power over every person who has ever served in the military.see united states ex rel.toth quarles,it has never been intimated by this court that article i military jurisdiction could be extended to civilian who had severed all relationship with the military and its institutions g iven its natural meaning,the power granted congress to make rules to regulate the land and naval forces would seem to restrict jurisdiction to persons who are actually members or part of the armed forces accordingly,kebodeaux conviction under a a can not be sustained based on congress power over the military.
moreover,it is clear from the face of sorna and from the government arguments that it is not directed at carrying into execution any of the federal powers enumerated in the constitution,art.i,cl,but is instead aimed at protecting society from sex offenders and violent child predators.see in order to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children,and in response to the vicious attacks by violent predators against the victims listed below,congress in this chapter establishes a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders tr.of oral arg.convicted sex offenders pose a serious threat to public safety.when those convictions are entered under federal law,congress has the authority to impose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that conduct in order to protect the public brief for united states same.
protecting society from sex offenders and violent child predators is an important and laudable endeavor.see kennedy louisiana,alito,dissenting explaining that,for most americans,sexual abuse of children is the epitome of moral depravity but the constitution does not vest in congress the authority to protect society from every bad act that might befall it.comstock,at thomas,dissenting.the power to protect society from sex offenders is part of the general police power that the framers reserved to the states or the people.see amdt.morrison,supra,at w e can think of no better example of the police power,which the framers denied the national government and reposed in the states,than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims lopez,supra,at.t he states possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law quoting brecht abrahamson,
the government has failed to identify any enumerated power that a a carr ies into execution in this case.accordingly,i would hold that a a and the registration requirements that it enforces are unconstitutional as applied to kebodeaux.
in concluding otherwise,the court entirely skips mcculloch first step determining whether the end served by sorna is within the scope of the c onstitution.at.the court appears to believe that congress power to make rules for the regulation of the land and naval forces justifies imposing sorna registration requirements on kebodeaux.ante,at.but not one line of the opinion explains how sorna is directed at regulating the armed forces.instead,the court explains how sorna and the wetterling act serve various ends that are not enumerated in the constitution.ante,at explaining that sorna was designed to keep track of more offenders and encourage states to adopt its uniform standards ante,at explaining that the wetterling act was designed to protect the public from federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns the court failure to link sorna to any enumerated power results in analysis that is untethered from the constitution and disregards the admonition that t he powers of the legislature are defined,and limited.marbury,cranch,at.
the court analysis is flawed at every step.it begins by explaining that at the time of his offense kebodeaux was subject to the federal wetterling act,an act that imposed upon him registration requirements very similar to those that sorna later mandated.ante,at.but that is beside the point.kebodeaux was convicted of violating sorna registration requirements,not the wetterling act,and so the relevant question is what enumerated power sorna carr ies into execution.the necessary and proper clause does not provide congress with authority to enact any law simply because it furthers other laws congress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental authority the clause plainly requires a showing that every federal statute carr ies into execution one or more of the federal government enumerated powers.comstock,at thomas,dissenting.
nevertheless,apparently in an effort to bootstrap the wetterling act,the court proceeds to determine whether the wetterling act not sorna falls within congres
