orlando,omar,raymond,josé,and julio appeal their convictions and sentences for conspiracy to distribute quantities of cocaine in violation of a and.we affirm.
appellants were members of a organization that operated drug distribution points in and around la plena ward in juana díaz,puerto rico from to a grand jury indicted each of them with conspiring to distribute quantities of heroin,cocaine,cocaine base,and marijuana,in violation of a and,and with a forfeiture allegation of up to million pursuant to.appellant entered a straight plea of guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and conspiring to distribute at least kilograms but less than kilograms of cocaine.after a jury was empaneled,the remaining appellants each pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine as part of a package plea agreement.
appellants raise numerous claims of error on appeal.and challenge their convictions on the ground that their guilty pleas were not voluntary,and raise an assortment of challenges to their sentences.lastly,each appellant requests a remand for sentencing in accordance with united states booker,d.we address each claim in turn.
voluntary guilty plea 
and ask us to vacate their convictions and remand their cases for trial on the ground that their guilty pleas were not voluntary.while the entry of a guilty plea does not preclude an attack on the plea voluntariness,united states sahlin,cir,because neither appellant sought to withdraw his guilty plea before the district court,we review the district court acceptance of their pleas for plain error.united states,cir citing united states vonn,d,cert.denied,d.
to establish that the district court committed error in accepting their guilty pleas,appellants must point to a fundamental defect in the change of plea hearing itself.see united states bierd,cir see also sahlin,at error must affect substantial rights.appellants argue that the joint change of plea hearing was fundamentally defective because it failed to ensure that their guilty pleas,entered as part of a package plea agreement,were truly voluntary.as in many such package plea arrangements,the government offered the entire group of defendants charged in connection with the la plena drug point a favorable plea and sentencing recommendation on the condition that all the enter guilty pleas.
we have previously recognized that such package deals create a significant risk that one defendant will plead guilty against his will in order for his to obtain the offered benefit.united states abbott,cir united states,cir.thus,we have crafted two safeguards designed to minimize this risk of coercion,at citing,at.first,the prosecution should inform the district court that the defendant guilty plea is part of a package deal.id.second,the district court should carefully ascertain the voluntariness of the defendant plea during the rule colloquy,with an eye toward minimizing the risk of coercion inherent in the context.id.
the record of the rule proceeding below reflects that both safeguards were observed.first,there is little doubt that the district court was fully aware that all the defendants,save for,were entering their pleas as part of a package deal.at the joint change of plea hearing,in the presence of all defendants and their respective counsel,the government disclosed to the court that the individual pleas were part of a package deal.indeed,on several occasions throughout the change of plea hearing the district court specifically referred to the package nature of defendants pleas.
second,the district court rule inquiry was more than sufficient to guard against the risk of coercion.the court individually questioned the defendants,asking whether they were threatened or coerced by anyone or anybody into entering their individual guilty pleas.although this alone was likely sufficient,see,at anyone or anybody united states,cir anyone,the court inquired further.it specifically named each and asked whether any of them had threatened or coerced or into pleading guilty,thereby probing whether the increased likelihood of coercion in the context had affected either of their decisions to plead guilty.
in light of these additional safeguards,the district court was entitled to rely upon and representations,made under oath,that they were neither coerced nor threatened into making their pleas.see united states,cir.the only indication of the contrary comes from and general allegations of coercion on appeal,which are insufficient,absent record support,to invalidate their guilty pleas.see,at.finding no error,plain or otherwise,in the district court acceptance of their guilty pleas,we affirm and convictions.
ii.sentencing issues 
the entry of a guilty plea does not itself waive a defendant right to challenge the ensuing sentence.united states,cir,and advance such challenges.
argues that the district court erred by failing to impose his federal sentence concurrently with his undischarged term of state imprisonment as required under guideline b like his,was charged with distributing more than five kilograms of both cocaine and cocaine base,more than one kilogram of heroin,and more than fifty pounds of marijuana.however,also like all but one of his,entered into a plea agreement,pursuant to which he pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least kilograms of cocaine,in return for the government recommendation of months imprisonment.the parties further agreed that if presentence investigation revealed convictions for offenses that took place during the time period of the conspiracy,they would not be counted in determining his criminal history category.
ultimately,presentence report listed four prior convictions in the superior court of puerto rico on december,was arrested for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute for which he was sentenced to three years imprisonment on january,he was arrested and charged with the second and third offenses,possession of marijuana and heroin with the intent to distribute,for which he was sentenced to a total of six years imprisonment and on february,he was arrested and charged with possession with the intent to distribute cocaine,for which he was sentenced to two years imprisonment although he received a sentence of imprisonment on the four offenses,had served only months of that sentence before being transferred to federal custody to face the instant charges.
since his prior drug offenses occurred during the period of the charged cocaine trafficking conspiracy,the presentence report recommended that they be treated as overt acts,resulting in zero criminal history points.consistent with the recommendation of the presentence report and the agreement of the parties,the district court assessed zero criminal history points for his prior convictions,leaving him with a criminal history category of recognizing that had been incarcerated due to these prior convictions during a significant portion of the charged conspiracy,the district court found him to be less culpable than his,and accordingly,sentenced him to months imprisonment,rather than the sentence provided for in the plea agreement 
on appeal argues that the district court was required under guideline b to run his federal sentence concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state term of imprisonment.because,as concedes,he did not object to his sentence on this ground,we employ plain error review.united states cruz,cir citing united states olano,d.to decide whether the district court erred in imposing his sentence,we must determine whether his state offenses were fully taken into account in determining his offense level.see guideline b if they were,then guideline b required the court to impose the federal term concurrently with the undischarged state term,which would have reduced the federal sentence by approximately difference between the entire state term and the months had served on it before being transferred to federal custody.see united states caraballo,cir see also b,cmt.
argues that because his state court offenses were treated as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy,they were treated as relevant conduct under guideline,and therefore fully taken into account under guideline b.because guideline is directed at the prevention of duplicative sentencing for any particular conduct,we held in caraballo that only relevant conduct that has resulted that could have resulted change in the instant offense offense level is fully taken into account under b.id.emphasis in original.however,we also reasoned that mandatory concurrent sentencing would be inappropriate where the defendant undischarged prison term was for multiple offenses,but only some of those offenses were fully taken into account in determining the instant offenses offense level,since in such a situation the instant offense may involve conduct unrelated to the conduct underlying the undischarged term.id.at.accordingly,we held that w hen some of the conduct underlying an undischarged term impacted the offense level,but other aspects of that conduct did not,the district court is free,under c,to choose wholly concurrent,partially concurrent,or wholly consecutive sentencing.id.at.
in the instant case,we face precisely this kind of multiple offense situation.undischarged term of state imprisonment was the result of four separate offenses.even assuming that,in reaching its drug quantity determination and corresponding offense level,the district court took into account his two prior cocaine offenses it could not have taken into account offenses for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of heroin,since these convictions punished conduct unrelated to that punished by the instant cocaine trafficking conviction.thus,as in caraballo,undischarged state term was the result of multiple offenses,some of which may have been taken into account in setting his offense level for the federal conviction,while the rest clearly were not.at.in short,because not all of the conduct from which puerto rico term resulted influenced his ultimate offense level,not all of it was fully taken into account under b.the court below thus correctly chose to apply c instead.id.at.
thus proceeding under subsection c,the district court enjoyed the discretion to impose a wholly concurrent,partially concurrent,or wholly consecutive sentence,so long as the end result was reasonable.see united states,cir quoting caraballo,at.the court exercised this discretion by sentencing to a term of imprisonment months less than that stipulated to in the plea agreement,which had the effect of imposing part of his federal sentence concurrently with his undischarged state sentence,while imposing the remainder consecutively.the court specifically stated that it was imposing this sentence in recognition of the time was incarcerated on his prior drug offenses,thereby furthering the underlying policy of guideline in preventing duplicative sentencing for any particular conduct.caraballo,at.makes no argument that the district court abused its discretion in doing so,nor does he claim that his sentence is otherwise unreasonable.see,at see also caraballo,at affirming district court exercise of discretion under guideline c to run part of defendant federal sentence concurrent with undischarged state sentence.accordingly,we affirm his sentence 
drug quantity 
argues that the district court sentenced him based on a flawed calculation.because he objected to the calculation at sentencing,we review any legal error of the district court de novo,united states barbour,cir,cert.denied,d,while reviewing its factual findings for clear error.united states santos,cir.
stipulated to the scope of the conspiracy drug trafficking operations as well as to the amount of narcotics for which he was personally responsible based on this stipulated drug quantity,the parties agreed that the applicable sentencing range was from to months imprisonment,and the government agreed to recommend a sentence of months.at the change of plea hearing,acknowledged these stipulations and stated that he understood the terms of the plea agreement.
at sentencing,counsel for objected to the computation in the presentence investigation report.he requested that the district court lower the calculation because had participated in the conspiracy for a shorter period of time than other whose plea agreements provided for lesser drug quantities.the government responded that had specifically stipulated in his plea agreement to the amount of cocaine for which he personally was responsible and this amount was not tied to the length of his involvement in the conspiracy.
the court rejected request and sentenced him to months imprisonment,as provided in the plea agreement.the court explained that other had received reductions in return for their stipulation to leadership role enhancements,and not because their involvement in the conspiracy was any less than that originally contemplated in their plea agreements.this was necessary to ensure that the government sentencing recommendation would remain months as stipulated in the plea agreements.
argues that the district court erred in sentencing him based on the stipulated drug quantity instead of making an individualized finding as to the amount of drugs specifically attributable to him.in support,he relies upon united states,cir,which held that a district court could not automatically shift a stipulated amount to an individual conspirator in order to trigger a statutory mandatory minimum.
however,this reliance is misplaced,since the defendant in had stipulated only to the drug amount,and there remained an open question as to whether he personally was responsible for a lesser quantity.see id.at.here,stipulation as to the amount of drugs specifically attributable to him left no such open question.although the district court was not required to follow this stipulation,it was entitled to rely upon it in determining the appropriate sentence,united states teeter,cir,and such reliance is not clearly erroneous,see united states santos,cir 
second attack on the calculation focuses on the reductions granted to some of his.citing no legal authority in support,claims that,notwithstanding his plea agreement,he is entitled to a similar reduction because the district court stated reasons for the reductions were arbitrary and not related to facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
a review of the record convinces us that the district court determination as to was anything but arbitrary rather,it reflected,to the kilogram,the quantity admitted to in his plea agreement.once again,the court was not bound by this admission,and could have determined that he was responsible for less.its refusal to do so was not clearly erroneous.see teeter,at santos,at.
term of supervised release 
advances two arguments in favor of vacating the supervised release term of his sentence.first,he claims that the term in the written judgment violated his right to be present at sentencing because the district court had announced a contrary,term,at sentencing second,argues that the drug testing condition of his supervised release improperly delegates authority to the probation officer.
we review right to be present claim for harmless error.united states,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states padilla,cir en banc.a criminal defendant has the right to be present at his own sentencing.united states,cir.thus,if a district court oral sentence materially conflicts with its subsequent written expression,the tendency is to honor the oral.id.quoting united states cali,cir.however,no material conflict exists where the defendant is on notice that he is subject to the terms included in the written judgment,at citing united states tulloch,cir see also united states,cir finding no material conflict between oral sentence and written judgment imposing million forfeiture where defendant had notice that forfeiture of at least two million dollars would be component of sentence.
while there was surely a conflict between the district court oral pronouncement of a term of supervised release and the term included in the written judgment,there is overwhelming evidence that knew well before the written judgment was issued that he faced a term of supervised release and that the term was announced in error.first,and foremost,the statute criminalizing the drug offense to which pled guilty mandates a supervised release term of at least.see b a emphasis added.while the mere existence of this mandatory minimum may provide sufficient constructive notice that a term would apply,see tulloch,at,the term was also included in the plea agreement,explained to and accepted by him at the change of plea hearing,and reiterated in the presentence investigation report.
at no point did object to the length of the supervised release term.when the district court stated that it was imposing a term,in contravention of the statutory minimum,the plea agreement,and the presentence investigation report,it became incumbent upon to request further clarification,which he did not do.see tulloch,at.indeed,the need for clarification was especially acute in this case,since the district court oral pronouncement of a term at sentencing hearing was immediately preceded by its reference to a term in this context,the district court isolated reference to a term appears to have been an inadvertent mistake.although this reference was erroneous,the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence that had notice that a term would apply.see,at.
second challenge to the term of supervised release likewise fails.both at sentencing and in its written judgment,the district court stated that term of supervised release would be subject to the following condition 
the defendant shall submit to a drug test within fifteen days of release on supervised release,and thereafter when so requested by the probation officer.
argues that this condition improperly delegates authority to the probation officer to determine the frequency and quantity of drug testing.
in united states,cir,a panel of this court held that a district court commits plain error by delegating to a probation officer the authority to determine a defendant regimen while on supervised release.id.at citing d sitting en banc,our court overruled to the extent that it held that such an improper delegation would automatically rise to the level of plain error,although the defendant was free to argue that the plain error requirements were met in the individual case.united states padilla,cir en banc.for the reasons stated in padilla,we conclude that the improper delegation that occurred here does not rise to the level of plain error,since it neither affects substantial rights nor impugn s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the criminal proceeding as a whole.id.at see also,at united states,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we decline to correct it.
claims that,pursuant to guideline a,the district court should have awarded him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility instead of the reduction he received.it was burden to demonstrate that he was entitled to the additional point reduction,and we will reverse the withholding of such a reduction only if clearly erroneous.united states baltas,cir.initially,we recognize,as did the district court,that request for a reduction contradicts his stipulation to a reduction in his plea agreement.however,like the district court,we conclude that even in the absence of this stipulation,was not entitled to a reduction because his guilty plea was untimely.
a defendant qualifies for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under guideline a if he clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.a defendant may receive an additional level reduction by,inter alia,timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently,b.as we have previously recognized,t he reduction is for contrition,while the third level is for helping the authorities save resources.united states hines,cir see also,cmt.
argues that his acceptance of responsibility was sufficiently timely and beneficial to the government to warrant a reduction in light of the numerous witnesses and anticipated length of the trial the government and district court were able to avoid.to earn a reduction,a defendant must give notice of his intent to plead guilty at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the government may avoid preparing for trial,which will usually be particularly early in the case,cmt.and the bulk of his indicted entered into the package plea deal after a jury had already been selected the district court concluded that this was not early enough in the process to merit a reduction this determination was not clearly erroneous.see united states donovan,cir sustaining denial of reduction for defendant who pled guilty on the eve of trial.
unlike his,was not a party to the package plea agreement.instead,he entered a straight plea of guilty to conspiring to sell five kilograms or more of cocaine,as alleged in the indictment,an offense that carried a statutory minimum sentence of ten years.see b a.he also admitted to participating in the conspiracy from until his september arrest.
the government stated at the change of plea hearing that if the case had gone to trial,it would have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that conspired to distribute in excess of kilograms of cocaine and that he possessed a firearm in connection to the charged drug trafficking offense.requested and received an evidentiary hearing to contest these sentencing factors.at the hearing,the government presented the testimony of two witnesses.the first was victor,a task force agent with the ponce,puerto rico drug enforcement agency,who had investigated the la plena drug point.the second witness was josué,an unindicted testifying as a material witness for the government,who had participated in the la plena drug point from.presented three witnesses to rebut any evidence that he participated in a homicide.
following the evidentiary hearings,the district court imposed a enhancement under guideline b for possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a offense,determined that was responsible for in excess of kilograms of cocaine,and granted him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under guideline a.based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of iv,the applicable guideline imprisonment range was to months.see guideline.the district court sentenced to months imprisonment,the bottom of the guidelines range.
contends that the determination and firearm enhancement were unwarranted and that the district court criminal history calculation was in error.we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.united states caldwell,cir.
firearm enhancement 
challenges the enhancement he received for possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a drug trafficking offense on the ground that the government failed to establish that it was reasonably foreseeable to him that firearms would be possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy.see b.he argues that the government failed to prove that he was involved in any of the murders alleged to have been committed by members of the la plena drug trafficking organization and that the district court found at sentencing that there was insufficient evidence to link him to the murders.he claims that without such proof the district court could not impose the enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon.
argument would gain greater traction if the government had stuck to its initial position seeking a dangerous weapon enhancement based on proof that he was involved in a murder committed in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.however,it abandoned that theory and instead sought the enhancement under guideline b by proving that it was reasonably foreseeable that a would possess a gun in furtherance of the criminal activity.united states casas,cir see also united states may,cir.thus,the question was not,as now argues,whether the government was able to prove his involvement in a murder,but rather,whether it was reasonably foreseeable to him that weapons would be used in furtherance of the conspiracy.
the district court made a finding of reasonable foreseeability here,stating that it had plenty of evidence from which to conclude that weapons were used by members of the conspiracy and that this use of weapons was foreseeable to.agent testified that members of the la plena organization carried a variety of weapons and handguns,with sellers carrying weapons for keeping everything under control at the drug point,and that he had seen weapons seized by police from members of the organization.unindicted testified that he and were drug sellers,that sellers were always armed at the drug point,and that he personally saw carrying weapons on several occasions when the two went out hunting for members of rival drug gangs in order to kill them.from this testimony,the district court could have concluded that it was reasonably foreseeable to that a dangerous weapon would be possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy.
pointing to criminal record,his hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence in cases pending against him in state court,and his desire to deter federal authorities from filing charges against him for his admitted participation in a murder,argues that testimony should have been completely disregarded as unreliable or,at the very least,considered with caution.it is for the sentencing court to assess the credibility of the witness,and it is the for the appellate court to defer to that assessment unless it is clearly erroneous.see,united states nunez,cir citing united states brum,cir see also e stating that court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.indeed,in this case the district court specifically credited testimony due to his personal involvement in the illegal activities to which he testified,despite the court frank recognition of the negative credibility issues surrounding the testimony in light of the district court careful consideration of credibility,we can not conclude that it was clear error for the court to rely upon it in making its dangerous weapon finding.see,united states whalen,cir holding district court finding not clearly erroneous despite crediting of testimony district court characterized as problematic.
drug quantity 
contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court determination that he should be held responsible for kilograms of cocaine,and therefore,he should be held responsible only for the amount he admitted to at his change of plea hearing.as an admitted participant in a drug trafficking conspiracy,is responsible under guideline for drugs he himself sold,transported,or negotiated,as well as for drug quantities attributable to others that are reasonably foreseeable to him in furtherance of the conspiracy.see cmt.may,at united states,cir.the district court finding as to the amount of drugs reasonably foreseeable to need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence and need not be exact so long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate.united states santos,cir.we will set aside a calculation only if clearly erroneous if there are two reasonable views of the record,the district court choice between the two can not be considered clearly erroneous.id.
argues that the testimony at sentencing regarding the was too inconsistent,and hence,too unreliable,to support an individualized finding.specifically,he points to the wide variance between the amounts testified to by agent and.though the two witnesses provided differing quantities,both testified to amounts greater than the amount the district court attributed to.
based on drug seizures by other agents and information provided by,agent testified that approximately two kilos each of heroin,cocaine and crack were sold out of the la plena drug point each week.from this,agent estimated that from until,the period in which admitted to participating in the conspiracy,at least five hundred kilos of cocaine were distributed at la plena.however,testified that he,like and other sellers at la plena,sold one kilogram each of heroin,cocaine,and crack every eight days.the government concedes that an extrapolation of testimony yields a total of approximately kilograms of each narcotic per year,which multiplied by the four to five years admitted to being a member of the conspiracy,yields an amount between and kilograms of each narcotic,a significantly lower total than the at least kilograms testified to by agent.
the district court recognized that the drug quantity testified to by agent iglesias was more than double that testified to by at the evidentiary hearing.however,it specifically credited testimony and adopted estimate in finding that was responsible for at least kilograms of cocaine for an offense level of.see c.because testimony directly supports this finding,we can not conclude that the district court choice between two plausible views of the record was clearly erroneous see santos,at.indeed,the district court explicit recognition that it was taking a cautious,conservative approach in adopting the lower of the two estimates,sufficiently insulates this finding from clear error attack.see united states sklar,cir.
criminal history 
based on two prior offenses,the district court assigned him a criminal history category of iv.claims that this was error because both prior offenses were relevant conduct to the instant conspiracy,and therefore neither should have been counted in calculating his criminal history category.see.by his calculation,if the district court had properly excluded both prior offenses,his criminal history category would have been i,or if the district court had counted one offense,but not the other,his criminal history category would have been iii in any event,he argues that his criminal history category should have been lower than the one he received.
was convicted for possessing narcotics in and,and sentenced for both offenses in.in connection with the instant conspiracy prosecution,the government filed an informative motion designating the and offenses as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.at his plea hearing,admitted to being a member of the charged conspiracy from to.because did not admit to being a member of the conspiracy during the time he committed his prior offenses,the presentence report recommended a criminal history category of iv to take into account the two prior offenses,rather than treating them as relevant conduct to the charged conspiracy.
before presenting its evidence at sentencing,the government informed the district court that it would not dispute stipulation that his participation in the conspiracy began in.however,in so doing,it took the position that the and offenses could no longer be considered as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy,and should therefore be counted towards his criminal history category.disputed the government contention that the prior offenses were outside the scope of the conspiracy,citing the government informative motion in which it had specifically designated them as overt acts.in response,the government conceded that if the case had proceeded to trial it would indeed have sought to prove that was involved in the conspiracy as early as and would have presented the second offense as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.however,the government reminded the court that the case was not going to trial because of guilty plea,which included the stipulation that he joined the conspiracy in.
in attempting to sort out the parties arguments,the district court explained that the parties had to choose between treating the prior offenses as overt acts or for criminal history purposes.the district court chose the latter,adopting the recommendation of the presentence report and assessing six criminal history points for the two prior offenses,as well as an additional two points because he committed the instant offense within two years after his release from imprisonment on the prior offenses.see e.in light of stipulation that he was only a member of the conspiracy from onward,we conclude that district court correctly counted the prior offenses for criminal history purposes.there was no error in holding to the facts to which he stipulated.
iii.booker claims 
appellants,and each ask for their cases to be remanded to the district court for in accordance with united states booker,d,and concede that they failed to preserve their booker claims in the district court thus,we review their sentences for plain error.see united states antonakopoulos,cir argues that he preserved his booker claim by objecting to the sentencing court determination.a defendant preserves booker error by arguing to the district court that it erred under either apprendi or blakely or arguing that the guidelines were unconstitutional.united states mclean,cir quoting antonakopoulos,at,cert.denied,d.raised no such argument before the district court.therefore he,like his,must proceed under the plain error standard.
under that standard,a defendant must show four things that an error occurred,that the error was clear or obvious,that it affected substantial rights,and that the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.antonakopoulos,at citing united states olano,d.because the district court treated the guidelines as mandatory at sentencing,the first two requirements are satisfied.see,united states kornegay,cir at issue is whether appellants satisfy the third and the fourth.
the operative question with respect to the third requirement is whether defendant has shown a reasonable probability the sentencing judge would,in a guidelines system,have imposed a more lenient sentence.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.we are not overly demanding in our proof where the record or a plausible proffer reasonably indicates that an advisory guideline regime might have led the sentencing judge to a different result,we will remand for resentencing.united states lewis,cir quoting united states heldeman,cir.however,the mere assertion that the district court would have imposed a more favorable sentence is insufficient.mclean,at.instead,we require the appellant to present specific facts to justify a booker remand.kornegay,at.
pursuant to a plea agreement,stipulated to being responsible for between and kilograms of cocaine for a base offense level of.see c.he further stipulated to a enhancement for possession of a firearm in relation to the charged crime,a enhancement for his leadership role,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.b,a,a.with a criminal history category of i,the applicable guidelines range would have been between to months the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment in accordance with the plea agreement.
argues that consideration of the sentencing factors of a would have resulted in a more lenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.however,he fails to indicate how any of the listed factors would have created a reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence.see kornegay,at requiring specific facts to justify booker remand,not merely recitation of sentencing factors.moreover,the district court comments at sentencing suggest that would be far more likely to receive a harsher sentence,not a more lenient one,on remand see united states mercado,cir.finding no prejudice,we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
pursuant to a plea agreement with the government,stipulated that he was responsible for not less than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine and that such amount should be the proper drug quantity to be considered for sentencing purposes.he also stipulated to a enhancement for possession of a firearm and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.b,a.the parties agreed that the applicable sentencing range under the guidelines was from to months imprisonment the district court sentenced him to months as provided in the plea agreement.
like,argues that consideration of the a factors would have led to a more lenient sentence under an advisory guidelines regime.however,also like,puts forth no facts that he would offer on remand to justify a more lenient sentence,save for those arguments already considered and rejected by the district court at sentencing.although the district court was aware that it was not required to honor the sentencing recommendation stipulated to in the plea agreement,it did so nonetheless,even in the face of claim that he was less culpable than his due to his shorter participation in the conspiracy.there is nothing to suggest that the district court would weigh the duration of participation in the conspiracy any differently under an advisory guidelines regime.
pursuant to a plea agreement,stipulated that he was responsible for at least kilograms of cocaine.he also stipulated to a enhancement for possession of a firearm and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.b,a.the plea agreement provided that the applicable guidelines range was between and months imprisonment.however,presentence report recommended a leadership role enhancement that he had not admitted to in the plea agreement,which would have resulted in a guidelines sentencing range of to months,well above the sentence stipulated to in the plea agreement.
at sentencing,this discrepancy was brought to the attention of the district court.in order to accommodate the leadership role enhancement while still honoring the sentencing recommendation,the court recommended that the parties amend the plea agreement by reducing the drug quantity from kilograms to between and kilograms of cocaine the parties followed the district court recommendation and amended the plea agreement accordingly.accepting the amended plea,the district court sentenced to the months to which the parties had agreed.
points to nothing in the record suggesting a reasonable probability that he would fare any better under an advisory guidelines regime.indeed,he would be to make such a showing in light of the district court stated desire to honor the agreed to sentence,even in the face of a contrary,and significantly higher,recommendation in the presentence investigation report.the district court statements that it was going out of its way to honor the recommendation suggests a reasonable probability that would receive an identical sentence on remand.because shows nothing to the contrary,he fails to establish that he was prejudiced by the sentencing court enforcement of his bargain.
in his plea agreement,admitted responsibility for at least kilograms of cocaine for a base offense level of.c.he further stipulated to a enhancement for possession of a firearm and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.b,a.assuming a criminal history category of i,which the presentence report ultimately recommended,the applicable guidelines sentencing range was between and months imprisonment.the government agreed to a sentence of months imprisonment.recognizing that had been incarcerated during a significant portion of the conspiracy,the district court found him to be less culpable than his,and,notwithstanding the government objection,sentenced him to months months less than the term the parties had stipulated to in the plea agreement and three months above the bottom of the applicable guidelines range.
to establish a reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence on remand,relies solely on the fact that his sentence was fourteen months lower than the sentence the government agreed to in the plea agreement.although he argues that this is evidence the district court would go even lower under an advisory guidelines regime,it could just as easily indicate that the district court would exercise its discretion in an identical manner on remand.see sahlin,at finding no possible claim of prejudice where defendant receives sentence lower than that stipulated to in a plea agreement.points to no additional facts he would present to the district court to convince it that it should go lower than the plea agreement than it already did.see mclean,at.moreover,the fact that the sentence he received was near the bottom of the applicable guidelines range is insufficient,standing alone,to establish prejudice.kornegay,at.under these circumstances,fails to show he was prejudiced by the court mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines.
entered a straight plea of guilty to conspiring to sell five kilograms or more of cocaine,as alleged in the indictment,which carried a statutory minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum of life imprisonment.see b.at the change of plea hearing the government stated that if the case had gone to trial it would have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that conspired to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine and that he possessed a firearm in relation to the drug trafficking offense charged.
following an evidentiary hearing on the and sentencing factors,the district court imposed a enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a drug trafficking offense.b.the court further determined that was responsible for in excess of kilograms of cocaine for a base offense level of,b,and granted him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,a.based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of iv,the applicable guideline imprisonment range was to months.the district court sentenced to months imprisonment.
contends that the disparity between his sentence and the sentence received by one of his coconspirators,jorge lagase requires a remand so that he may be resentenced in accordance with his real conduct.as the district court recognized,lagase and were not similarly situated thus,there is no reason for their sentences to be similar.lagase entered into a plea agreement much earlier in the prosecution of the present conspiracy and,unlike,did not request an evidentiary hearing to contest all the facts underlying the applicable sentencing factors.stripped of its sentencing disparity patina,booker claim is nothing more than a challenge to the district court determination,a challenge which we have already rejected.because he fails to show prejudice as a result of the district court mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines,we reject his booker claim as well.
iv.conclusion 
the convictions and sentences imposed by the district court are affirmed.
because appellants convictions and sentences followed admissions of guilt,we glean the pertinent facts from the colloquies,the plea agreements,the presentence reports,and the transcripts of the sentencing and change of plea hearings.see united states,cir.
effective november,a little more than one month after september,sentencing,guideline b was amended.because neither party argues otherwise,we assume that the version in effect at the time of sentencing applies.united states harotunian,cir a defendant is to be punished according to the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.see also united states rouse,cir holding that amendment to guideline b does not apply retroactively,cert.denied,d.
the sentences for all four convictions were imposed on may,and ordered to run consecutively.
the sentencing court stated and the court,because this defendant spent a considerable amount of time in jail during the conspiracy,and his participation is less than the other gentlemen who have been also sentenced by this court,therefore,sentences him within the guideline but to a lower amount than recommended in the plea 
at the time of sentencing,guideline provided b if the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense s that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.c policy statement in any other case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment,the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently,partially concurrently,or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.
the record does not conclusively demonstrate that the district court took into account the unspecified quantities of cocaine involved in prior cocaine offenses in determining that he was responsible for at least kilograms of cocaine and assessing the corresponding offense level of.see.indeed,the district court stated at sentencing that it was specifically relying on admission in his plea that he was guilty of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute at least kilograms of cocaine and his specific stipulation to an offense level of in his plea agreement.however,because we conclude that even if his prior cocaine offenses were taken into account,nonetheless is not entitled to wholly concurrent sentencing,we need not resolve this question.
had been sentenced after the november,effective date of the amendments to b,which jettisoned the somewhat confusing fully taken into account language as well as any reference to undischarged terms of imprisonment,we would reach the same result.the amended subsection requires concurrent sentencing if a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under the provisions of subsections a,a,or a of relevant conduct and that was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense under chapter two offense conduct or chapter three adjustments b emphasis added.under this framework,would likewise not be entitled to concurrent sentencing because he fails to demonstrate that his prior offenses were the basis for an increase in the drug quantity determination underlying the offense level for the instant cocaine trafficking offense.
according to the stipulated facts in the plea agreement,each month for the duration of the conspiracy the organization sold at least five kilograms of cocaine,one kilogram of heroin,more than fifty grams of cocaine base,and approximately five pounds of marijuana.notwithstanding these amounts,the parties agreed that would be held responsible for not less than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine and that such amount should be the proper drug quantity to be considered for sentencing purposes.
nor does this court recent decision in united states,cir,call for a contrary result.unlike the possibly suspect stipulation in,there was nothing suspect about stipulation because he did not dispute it at the change of plea hearing or at sentencing.see id.at.
the discussion before the district court was,in pertinent part pérez counsel for we were referring to the fact that he will be kilograms.and his involvement was for a shorter time than the rest of the individuals involved.and we thought that he should be benefitting from that,from the reduced amount that some of them have been court but some of them have been granted reduced amounts because they going to accept the status or because of something else.was this what you agreed to in the very beginning w as this a reverse,sort or,agreement where you all agreed on the final number what the court is doing is adding two points to another because he is a leader,and on the other hand reducing the drugs a little bit so that you all end up in the same place which was what you had bargained for.
at sentencing the district judge stated,upon release from confinement the defendant shall be placed on supervised release for a term of at least three years under certain terms and conditions.emphasis added.however,the written judgment stated,upon release from imprisonment,the defendant shall be on supervised release for a term of five years.emphasis added.
the district court stated based on a total offense level of,and criminal history category one,the guideline imprisonment range in this particular case is from to months,with a fine range of thousand to four million,plus a supervised release term of not more than five court will follow the plea agreement as stipulated by the parties and sentence the defendant accordingly.emphasis added.
d provides in relevant part the court shall also order,as an explicit condition of supervised release,that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to a drug test within days of release on supervised release and at least periodic drug tests thereafter as determined by the court for use of a controlled substance.emphasis added.
as the district court explained if the court were to grant you three points that would mean that everyone would wait until the jury is selected.a
