hungry joe packed up his bags and wrote happy letters home.he had flown the missions required to complete a tour of duty.but things were not so simple on catch pianosa island.he soon discovered that colonel cathcart had just raised the number of missions to,forcing hungry joe to unpack his bags and rewrite his happy letters.at the time,yossarian had flown missions.
the colonel later increased the number to.when yossarian was just three away from that mark,the number was increased to,and then to.when yossarian had missions under his belt,the colonel made the number.and later.
when yossarian reached missions,he knew it was no cause to celebrate he raise them,yossarian understood.he appealed to squadron commander major major to be exempted from flying his four remaining missions.every time i get close he raises them,yossarian complained.major major responded,perhaps he wo this time.but of course yossarian was right.colonel cathcart raised the number to,then,then,then,with no end in sight.
plaintiff steven sherman must have felt a lot like yossarian in his decade of dealing with defendant town of chester.in,sherman applied for subdivision approval while he was in the process of buying a nearly acre piece of land for million.that application marked the beginning of his journey through the town labyrinth of red tape.in,the town enacted a new zoning ordinance,requiring sherman to redraft his proposed development plan.when he created a revised proposal in,the town again enacted new zoning regulations.when he created another revised plan in,the town changed its zoning laws once more.and again in.and again in.
on top of the shifting sands of zoning regulations,the town erected even more hurdles.among other tactics,the town announced a moratorium on development,replaced its officials,and required sherman to resubmit studies that he had already completed.when the town insisted that sherman pay in consultants fees before he could obtain a hearing,he might have thought,the colonel will just raise it again.and he would have been right.after paying the,he was told he owed an additional,and that he would also have to respond to a lengthy questionnaire.
by the time this lawsuit was filed,over ten years had passed.in that time,sherman became financially exhausted forced to spend million on top of the original million purchase.the district court edgardo ramos,judge ruled that sherman claim under the takings clause was not ripe under williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank of johnson city,because sherman had not received a final decision on his property and seeking a final decision would not be futile.the court reasoned that while sherman may have to jump through more hoops in the future,he had not established that his application would definitely be denied in the end.to sherman,this must have sounded a lot like perhaps he wo raise the number this time.
we conclude that under these circumstances,sherman was not required to obtain a final decision from the town.sherman takings claim was ripe and adequately alleged.accordingly,we reverse that part of the district court decision that dismissed the takings claim,and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the allegations recited below are taken from the complaint,and we assume they are true for the purposes of this appeal.
this case concerns the decade worth of red tape put in place by the town of chester,its town board,and its planning board.the town board is the governing body of the town,and the planning board appears to give at least preliminary approval to development proposals.
in march of,sherman applied to the planning board for subdivision approval so that he could use and develop marebrook.the proposed project would include units of housing as well as an equestrian facility,baseball field,tennis courts,clubhouse,restaurant and a golf course that wove through the property.when sherman completed his purchase of the property in,it was already zoned for residential use.but soon thereafter,sherman troubles began.
i.the moratorium 
in july,the town board announced that it was imposing a six month moratorium on major subdivision approvals retroactive to may.at least two members of the town board expressed the view that the moratorium was specifically aimed at plaintiff marebrook project.sherman was the only developer affected even though other projects were similarly situated.
when the six month period expired,the moratorium was extended,which singularly affected sherman.during the extension,sherman applied for a minor subdivision approval that was permitted under the moratorium.however,the town still refused to allow sherman to pursue the application.
sherman brought suit against the town in state court,and as a result of the lawsuit,the town ended the moratorium,but not until january.in other words,the six month moratorium lasted over a year and a half.
ii.draft environmental impact statement and the first zoning change 
in october,the planning board deemed complete sherman draft environmental impact statement deis.that determination established that sherman application to the town was satisfactory in form and content.
in,the town board approved the first in a series of changes to its zoning regulations.when sherman learned of the new requirements early the next year,he was assured by the town planner,garling associates,that he could meet all its requirements with only a modest amount of additional work and that he would soon obtain preliminary approval.
iii.more changes to the zoning regulations 
approximately five months later,sometime in late may to early june,sherman finished revising his plan.but the town had already amended its zoning regulations.garling associates,which helped write the new regulations,did not tell sherman about the changes even though it was advising sherman about complying with the regulations.these amendments created several new requirements,further delaying sherman.
it took him approximately eleven months to once again revise his application.in may five years after he first sought subdivision approval he finally met with some success.the planning board approved the marebrook proposal.but this success was not to last.the town board refused to entertain sherman application,despite holding meetings concerning another development.
one month later,the town amended its zoning law for a third time without informing sherman in advance.sherman revised his application again,and in february,the town for the fourth time changed its zoning law without warning sherman.sherman responded by submitting yet another revised plan,this one in march.that same month,the town changed its zoning for the fifth time,and it once again did not let sherman know these changes were coming.
fed up,sherman filed suit in federal court in may,a precursor to the case before us now.
iv.further obstruction 
in november and december of,sherman resubmitted his marebrook application and supplemental deis.by this point,over eight years had passed since sherman first applied for subdivision approval.
a.the town engineer 
in january,the town engineer gave sherman a list of corrections to the supplemental deis.as part of that list,the town engineer demanded final designs for water and sewer plants.but sherman could not submit the final water and sewer designs until other aspects of the plan like the number and location of the homes were finalized.that,in turn,required preliminary approval,which is the very thing he was trying to obtain from the town engineer.
a few months later,the town appointed a new town engineer.the new appointee needed time to get up to speed on marebrook.the town billed sherman for the expense of having the new town engineer review the entire marebrook project,even though sherman already paid for the first engineer to conduct that same review.the new town engineer had an entirely new set of questions,concerns,and items for sherman to address.despite that,for two years the new town engineer maintained his predecessor requirement regarding sewer and water plant designs.
b.the chairman 
in september,sherman submitted two different versions of his subdivision proposal.by now,the proposals had become much more conventional than his first application,and they did not include the recreational facilities initially envisioned.
soon after submitting the proposals,sherman discovered that the planning board chairman had been replaced.the new chairman,don serotta,was openly hostile towards the marebrook application and had written letters to the town in against the project.
for three months,the planning board refused without explanation to put sherman proposals on the agenda.then in december,serotta explained that sherman needed to pay in consultants fees.yet sherman did not receive an invoice for those fees as required by the town code for approximately two months.
serotta had other demands as well.he required an additional cluster plan,which would lead to another reworking of sherman deis.serotta also insisted that all roads must be feet wide instead of thirty feet.this required sherman to redraw his plans to relocate curbs,drainage,water and sewer mains,and grading.
later,serotta canceled sherman appearance at the planning board monthly meeting and demanded more in consultants fees.the planning board also insisted that sherman respond to a questionnaire,which required sherman to provide,among other things,an evaluation of a traffic intersection in the town of monroe located miles away and the details of a wetlands walking trail crossing that did not cross any wetlands.
sherman was also required to answer all inquiries by local residents.some answers to these questions needed to be repeated twenty to forty times because the planning board did not permit him to quote a previous answer.
c.the town planner 
in september,the planning board voted to accept sherman deis as complete,seven years after his original deis was deemed complete in october.a few months later,ted fink replaced garling associates as the town planner.fink requested an additional study regarding traffic on the other side of town,even though sherman had long before completed that study.fink also sent monthly lists of demands to sherman,which included a wetland study,a concerted species study,and a constraints study.the new studies concluded that there were no changes since those same studies were completed in.fink also required sherman to redo the deis that had just been deemed complete.
financial losses and subsequent death 
the town machinations to prevent the development of marebrook were not without their cost.between taxes,interest charges,carrying costs,and expenses,sherman spent approximately million on top of the original purchase price.as a result,sherman became financially exhausted to the point of facing foreclosure and possible personal bankruptcy.and while the case was pending on appeal,sherman died.nancy sherman,his widow,was substituted for him on appeal as his personal representative 
vi.procedural history 
as already mentioned,in sherman filed suit against the town and other defendants in federal court.he brought many of the same claims that he raises today.the town moved to dismiss,arguing among other things that sherman takings claim was not ripe because he had not sought compensation from the state.sherman voluntarily dismissed the case and then filed the case now before us in state court.the town removed to federal court,where it once again moved to dismiss in part on ripeness grounds.
the district court dismissed some of sherman federal claims on the merits,and most because they were unripe.while acknowledging it was a close case,the district court concluded that sherman had failed to show that seeking a final decision from the town would be futile.
sherman timely appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court order granting a motion to dismiss under rule b,accepting as true all allegations in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,the complaint must include enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.a claim will have facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.wilson dantas,wl,at cir,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
although sherman brought numerous federal and state claims,the main dispute on appeal concerns sherman takings claim,which was dismissed as unripe under the first prong of williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank of johnson city.the district court dismissed most of the other federal claims for the same reason,and some of them,in the alternative,for failure to state a claim.finally,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over sherman state law claims 
takings claim and williamson county ripeness 
we evaluate the ripeness of a takings claim under the two prong test established by the supreme court in williamson county.for the claim to be ripe,the plaintiff must show that the state regulatory entity has rendered a final decision on the matter,and the plaintiff has sought just compensation by means of an available state procedure.dougherty town of hempstead bd.of zoning appeals,cir.
because williamson county is a prudential rather than a jurisdictional rule,we may determine that in some instances,the rule should not apply and we still have the power to decide the case.sansotta town of nags head,cir see also horne dep t of,recognizing that williamson county is not,strictly speaking,jurisdictional suitum tahoe reg l planning agency,describing the williamson county prongs as two independent prudential hurdles.
a.the final decision prong 
sherman concedes that the town has not reached an official final decision.he argues instead that he does not need to meet this requirement because seeking a final decision would be futile.
t he finality requirement is not mechanically applied.a property owner,for example,will be excused from obtaining a final decision if pursuing an appeal to a zoning board of appeals or seeking a variance would be futile.that is,a property owner need not pursue such applications when a zoning agency lacks discretion to grant variances or has dug in its heels and made clear that all such applications will be denied.murphy new milford zoning comm n,cir.
additionally,g overnment authorities,of course,may not burden property by imposition of repetitive or unfair procedures in order to avoid a final decision.palazzolo rhode island,see also macdonald,sommer frates yolo,a property owner is of course not required to resort to piecemeal litigation or otherwise unfair procedures in order to obtain this determination.
while these two exceptions to the finality requirement futility and procedures are distinct concepts,in this case,the analyses for the two are the same.sherman argues that seeking a final decision would be futile because the town used and in all likelihood will continue to use repetitive and unfair procedures in order to avoid a final decision.
the final decision requirement follows from the principle that only a regulation that goes too far,results in a taking under the fifth amendment.suitum,at internal citations omitted.normally,a court can not determine whether a regulation has gone too far unless it knows how far the regulation goes.macdonald,at.however,in this case,sherman is not challenging any one regulation.rather,he argues that the repeated zoning changes and other roadblocks the procedure he had to endure constituted a taking.see appellant brief at.a final decision is not necessary to evaluate whether that obstruction itself constituted a taking.
in del monte dunes at monterey,city of monterey,the ninth circuit ruled that seeking a final decision would be futile under similar circumstances,cir.in that case,the property owners submitted a proposal to develop their property with residential units.id.at.the plan was denied by the planning commission,and the city planners stated that a proposal with units would be received favorably.id.when the owners submitted a new unit plan,it was denied,and the city planners this time stated that a proposal with units would be received favorably.id.when the owners submitted a new unit plan,it was denied as well.id.that decision was appealed to the city council,which referred the project back to the planning commission with a request that it consider a unit plan.id.the owners submitted a new unit plan,which was also denied.id.the owners once again appealed to the city council,which approved the plan so long as fifteen conditions were met.id.at.the owners submitted a new plan which substantially met those conditions.that too was denied by both the planning commission and the city council.id.at.yet none of this constituted a final decision.
the ninth circuit ruled that the property owners did not need to meet the final decision prong of williamson county.id.at.the court reasoned that r equiring the owners to persist with this protracted application process to meet the final decision requirement would implicate the concerns about disjointed,repetitive,and unfair procedures expressed in macdonald id.internal citations omitted.
requiring sherman to persist with a similar protracted application process would implicate these same concerns.for years,every time sherman submitted or was about to submit a proposal for marebrook,the town changed its zoning regulations,sending sherman back to the drawing board.it retroactively issued a six month moratorium on development that appears to have applied only to sherman property.that six month moratorium was extended for another year until after sherman sued the town.town officials also repeatedly asked sherman to resubmit studies and plans that had already been approved.
the district court adopted a narrower view of futility than the ninth circuit that while the ripeness doctrine does not require litigants to engage in futile gestures such as to jump through a series of hoops,the last of which is certain to be obstructed by a brick wall,the presence of that brick wall must be all but certain for the futility exception to apply.sherman town of chester,civ,wl,at,internal alteration omitted.applying that standard to our case,the court below concluded,here,all that is known is that plaintiff has jumped through many hoops more,perhaps,than sound policy should require and there are one or more hoops in the future.the inference that there is a brick wall at the end is hard to establish,and it is not established here,though it is a close case.id.
this analysis does not account for the nature of the town tactics.the town will likely never put up a brick wall in between sherman and the finish line.rather,the finish line will always be moved just one step away until sherman collapses.in essence,the town engaged in a war of attrition with sherman.over ten years,sherman was forced to spend over million on top of the original million purchase.as a result,he became financially exhausted to the point of facing foreclosure and possible personal bankruptcy.moreover,at no point could sherman force the town to simply give a final yay or nay to his proposal.when asked at argument,the town counsel could not name one way sherman could have appealed any aspect of the town decade of maneuvers in order to obtain a final decision.see oral arg.tr.at.
we are mindful that federal courts should not become zoning boards of appeal sullivan town of salem,cir.every delay in zoning approval does not ripen into a federal claim.unfortunately,it is no simple task to distinguish procedures that are merely frustrating from those that are unfair or would be futile to pursue.but when the government actions are so unreasonable,duplicative,or unjust as to make the conduct farcical,the high standard is met.
and it was met in this case.seeking a final decision would be futile because the town used and will in all likelihood continue to use repetitive and unfair procedures,thereby avoiding a final decision.sherman is therefore not required to satisfy the first prong of williamson county.this conclusion is consistent with the principles behind williamson county.the final decision requirement ensures that a court knows how far a regulation goes before it is asked to determine whether that regulation goes too far.in this case,we are not dealing with any one regulation but the town decade of obstruction.a final decision is not necessary to evaluate whether that obstruction was itself a taking.
state procedures prong 
under the second prong of williamson county,a plaintiff claim is ripe only if the plaintiff has sought just compensation by means of an available state procedure.dougherty,at.
while williamson county prevents a plaintiff from bringing his takings claim in federal court before first seeking compensation from the state,it does not preclude state courts from hearing simultaneously a plaintiff request for compensation under state law and the claim that,in the alternative,the denial of compensation would violate the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the federal constitution.san remo hotel,city and cnty.of.this is because r eading williamson county to preclude plaintiffs from raising such claims in the alternative would erroneously interpret the supreme court cases as requiring property owners to resort to piecemeal litigation or otherwise unfair procedures.id.quoting macdonald,at.
sherman first brought suit against the town in federal court in.the town argued that the takings claim was unripe in part because sherman had not alleged that he sought and was denied just compensation by an available state procedure.sherman voluntarily dismissed the case,and followed san remo by filing his federal takings claim and his state law claim for compensation in state court.the town then removed the case from state court to federal court,where it argued once again that the takings claim must be dismissed because it can be heard only in state court under williamson county.
in sansotta town of nags head,cir,the fourth circuit concluded that when the defendant removes a takings claim to federal court,the state procedures prong of williamson county does not apply.we agree with that court reasoning that refusing to apply the requirement in this instance ensures that a state or its political subdivision can not manipulate litigation to deny a plaintiff a forum for his claim.id.at.
the removal maneuver prevents sherman from litigating his federal takings claim until he finishes litigating his state law claim for compensation.in other words,it prevents sherman from pursuing both claims simultaneously,no matter what forum they are brought in.this runs against san remo,which allows plaintiffs to do just that.in other words,the removal tactic can deny a plaintiff any forum for having his claim heard,or at least force the plaintiff into the kind of piecemeal litigation that,under san remo,can not be required.see id.at.
we conclude that when a defendant removes a takings claim from state court to federal court,the second prong of williamson county is satisfied.sherman takings claim is ripe,and we may address the merits.
