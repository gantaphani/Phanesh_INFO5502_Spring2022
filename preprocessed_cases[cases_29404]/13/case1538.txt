defendants,the city of new york and its police commissioner appeal from a grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs,the church of the american knights of the ku klux klan,the reverend jeffrey berry,the reverend james sheeley,and jane doe and richard roe collectively,american knights entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,judge,dated november.the district court found new york statute,new york penal law,invalid under the first amendment.church of the american knights of the ku klux klan kerik,d.for the reasons stated below,we reverse.
background 
the american knights claims to be an unincorporated political membership association that advocates on behalf of the white race and the christian faith.id.at.the organization was founded in by plaintiff jeffrey berry,currently the group imperial wizard or national leader.while not formally associated with other organizations bearing the name ku klux klan,or a facsimile thereof,the american knights does identify in part with the ku klux klan which existed earlier in american history insofar as both groups believe in racial separation and in the importance of the ten commandments and the virtues of religious belief.the group opposes integration,affirmative action,racial intermarriage,immigration and abortion.as plaintiff berry stated in his deposition,members follow the old tradition of the hood and robe,the garb traditionally associated with the klan of the reconstruction era and its early purported successor.
on september,the american knights applied to the new york police department police department for a parade permit and a sound device permit for an event to be held on saturday,october,on the steps of the new york county courthouse at centre street.id.at.after reviewing the application,the police department notified the american knights on october,that its plan to wear masks would violate new york penal law,new york law.id.that statute provides,in pertinent part 
a person is guilty of loitering when he 
being masked or in any manner disguised by unusual or unnatural attire or facial alteration,loiters,remains or congregates in a public place with other persons so masked or disguised,or knowingly permits or aids persons so masked or disguised to congregate in a public place except that such conduct is not unlawful when it occurs in connection with a masquerade party or like entertainment 
penal law mckinney.the permit was therefore denied.church of am.knights,d at.
on october,the american knights sought a preliminary injunction to force the police department to allow its members to demonstrate while wearing masks.id.at.on october,a hearing was held before an anomalous panel of the district court,consisting of judge harold baer,and judge alvin hellerstein the latter had been assigned a related case dealing with the logistics of the planned event.id.at.judge baer issued a preliminary injunction that allowed the american knights to conduct the event with masks.id.at.the following day,a panel of this court kearse,miner and cabranes,jj.stayed that part of the district court order permitting the use of masks.safir church of the american kkk,cir,the american knights applied pursuant to to justice ginsburg,our circuit justice,to reinstate the preliminary injunction,and on october,she declined to do so.church of am.knights,d at see generally john kifner,unmasked klan is besieged at manhattan rally,times,at.our stay effectively negated the district court order permitting the american knights to demonstrate with masks.
the american knights conducted its demonstration on october,as planned.church of am.knights,d at.seventeen members participated and wore the american knights regalia,including robes and hoods,but did not wear masks.id.in proceedings before the district court after the demonstration,both parties moved for summary judgment on the american knights request for declaratory relief and a permanent injunction.id.
the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,and denied defendants motion for summary judgment,on four independent and alternative first amendment grounds.see id.at.
first,the district court held that the american knights mask wearing was protected by the right to anonymous speech.id.at.the court relied primarily on three supreme court decisions naacp alabama,d,which held that the state of alabama could not compel the national association for the advancement of colored people to reveal to the state attorney general lists of its members names and addresses buckley valeo,d,which upheld a federal statute requiring the disclosure of donors to political parties,but noted circumstances in which the statute might be unconstitutionally applied and mcintyre ohio elections commission,d,which invalidated an ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of anonymous campaign literature.the district court reasoned that,l ike the naacp members,the citizen distributing leaflets and the donors to political campaigns,the american knights have produced unrefuted evidence that it has a legitimate fear of reprisal if its members reveal their identities at public american knights events.d at.the court rejected defendants attempts to distinguish these precedents as involving compelled disclosure rather than prevented concealment,and held that since the statute restricts protected speech,the inquiry is whether the statute is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.id.
the district court concluded that the statute did not pass the exacting scrutiny prescribed in the anonymous speech cases.id.at.it agreed with defendants that the statute advanced security and law enforcement concerns the statute prevents groups of demonstrators from concealing their faces which understandably makes it more difficult for police officers to identify and apprehend wrongdoers.id.at.however,the district court held that the statute was not narrowly tailored to these concerns because it applied regardless of the demonstrators propensity for illegal behavior.id.the court determined that the government could have taken other,less restrictive means to address its goals f or example,the police department could ask permit applicants if participants will wear masks and if so,require lead time to insure proper security measures are in place and assign additional officers to curtail any increased risk of disruption by demonstrators or,as happened here.id.at.the court also questioned whether the defendants asserted interest in law enforcement was a compelling one,in light of the statute exception for entertainment events,where crime might just as easily occur.id.
second,the district court found that wearing masks was protected as expressive conduct or symbolic speech.id.at.the court determined,as an initial matter,that wearing the masks constituted expressive conduct,in that t he hooded masks are an integral part of the message that links the american knights to the kkk and its horrific ideology.id.the court thereby rejected defendants argument that the masks themselves,as distinct from the rest of the klan regalia,did not convey a particularized message,explaining that a narrow,succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection id.quoting hurley gay,lesbian bisexual group of boston,d.the court then determined that,since neither party argued that the statute was enacted with a motive to suppress or popularize any particular viewpoint,the applicable level of scrutiny was that set forth in united states,d.see church of am.knights,d at.under,a statute will be upheld if it is within the constitutional power of the government if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction on speech is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.see,at.the district court concluded,referring to its prior discussion of the right to anonymous speech,that the statute was not narrowly tailored to serve an important or substantial government interest.church of am.knights,d at.
third,the district court held that the statute was facially invalid,since it distinguishes on its face between types of allows masks for entertainment events but for no others.id.at.the court reasoned that the result is that a face mask worn to delight the public is lawful while one intended to sway its political beliefs is unlawful.id.the court concluded,a s this statute is clearly founded on the content of the speech,it can not be sustained as a time,place or manner restriction.id.at.
fourth and finally,the district court held that the city engaged in viewpoint discrimination by selectively applying the statute to the american knights while not to other similarly situated groups.id.the court seemed to undertake a viewpoint discrimination inquiry under the first amendment,but in places characterized its analysis in terms of selective enforcement,a phrase from equal protection jurisprudence.the court pointed to other,gatherings in which the police department did not arrest participants who covered their faces,and the court rejected defendants argument that there was no viewpoint discrimination because,in those cases,the participants did not provide advance warning to the police department of their intent to wear masks.id.
on appeal,defendants argue that the masks worn by the american knights do not possess sufficient communicative elements to implicate the first amendment even if mask wearing constituted expressive conduct,the statute is constitutionally valid as either a permissible restriction on symbolic expression or as a reasonable time,place or manner restriction the first amendment does not extend to protect masked expression in a public forum even if the first amendment did so extend,the statute is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest,and is therefore constitutionally valid and the american knights was not the victim of unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination or selective enforcement.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see,new york state ass of realtors,shaffer,cir.
new york law 
new york law,reenacted in its current form in,can be traced back in substance to legislation enacted in to thwart armed insurrections by hudson valley tenant farmers who used disguises to attack law enforcement officers.see church of am.knights,d at.the era in new york history,running from to,involved a conflict over lease terms between the landlords and tenants of vast manorial estates.see generally charles mccurdy,the era in new york law and politics,mccurdy reeve huston,land and freedom rural society,popular protest,and party politics in antebellum new york huston.the tenants held leases in fee,an arrangement in which they paid the landlord rent,and rendered annual services,for an indefinite term.quarter sale provisions in the leases commonly entitled landlords to of the sale price if the tenants sold their farms.mccurdy.depressions in the prices of wheat and loss of soil productivity left many tenants unable to fulfill their rental obligations,and ultimately indebted for back rent.huston mccurdy.after the death in of stephen van rensselaer iii,the good patroon of rensselaerwyck the largest estate in new york,his son stephen van rensselaer iv demanded repayment of outstanding debts,and sought to evict tenants who did not pay.huston mccurdy.their livelihood threatened,tenants organized associations to muster funds for litigation and to exert pressure on legislators.huston.some formed bands of indians,disguised in calico gowns and leather masks,who forcibly thwarted landlords efforts to serve farmers with process or to conduct distress sales.id.the operations of the masked indians commonly involved intimidation,and sometimes tarring and feathering,but also caused three deaths from,including the death of a sheriff.id.
in response to the civil unrest in upstate new york,the new york legislature passed on january,an act to prevent persons appearing disguised and armed.laws of the state on new york,at van benthuysen.it authorized the pursuit and arrest of any person who having his face painted,discolored,covered or concealed,or being otherwise disguised,in a manner calculated to prevent him from being identified,shall appear in any road or public highway,or in any field,lot,wood or enclosure.id.at.the act provided that such a person,upon being brought before a judge and not giving a good account of himself,shall be deemed a vagrant,and could be imprisoned in the county jail for up to six months.id.the act imposed more severe penalties for those who appeared masked in groups every assemblage in public houses,or other places,of three or more persons disguised as aforesaid,is hereby declared to be unlawful,punishable by up to a year imprisonment.id.at.governor silas wright,in a message to the legislature on january,urged the passage of an law for the prevention and punishment of crime.messages from the governors charles lincoln,lyon.governor wright explained 
t he disguises of organized bands,calling themselves indians,are assumed,worn for purposes unlawful and highly criminal after an offense,or other and higher crime has been perpetrated,the disguise is laid aside,and even eye witnesses upon the spot,may not be able to identify the guilty.
id.at.governor wright argued that an law would go far to aid in the prevention of the crimes which have been recently so daringly committed,under the protection of masks and other disguises.id.at.
new york law was therefore indisputably aimed at deterring violence and facilitating the apprehension of wrongdoers the parties agreed,and the district court properly held,that the statute was not enacted to suppress any particular viewpoint church of am.knights,d at.with the law history as a background,we now turn to the district court holding that the act violates the first amendment rights of the american knights.
ii.expressive conduct 
it is well established that t he first amendment affords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as well as to actual speech.virginia black,d.as the supreme court has cautioned,however,w e can not accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled speech whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea,at.see also zalewska county of sullivan,cir quoting from the preceding passage in.in determining whether particular conduct is sufficiently expressive to implicate the first amendment,therefore,the test is whether a n intent to convey a particularized message was present,and whether the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.texas johnson,d quoting spence washington,d.the party asserting that its conduct is expressive bears the burden of demonstrating that the first amendment applies,clark community for creative,d,and that party must advance more than a mere plausible contention that its conduct is expressive.id 
the district court determined that t he hooded masks are an integral part of the message that links the american knights to the kkk and its horrific ideology,and concluded that clearly the masks constitute expressive conduct.church of am.knights,d at.the message conveyed by the masks,according to the district court,was that the knights wish to identify with the historic klan.the american knights asserts that by wearing masks,its members intend to convey to the public that they follow the ideological tradition of the klan and share many of the views about racial separation and white pride with which the klan has been identified.
we agree with the district court that the regalia of the american knights,including the robe,mask,and hood,are expressive they are expressive in the way that wearing a uniform is expressive,identifying the wearer with other wearers of the same uniform,and with the ideology or purpose of the group.we do not doubt that a person who viewed a member of the american knights wearing such regalia would likely grasp that association.new york statute does not,however,bar members of the american knights from wearing a uniform expressive of their relationship to the klan.the statute only proscribes mask wearing.
the mask that the members of the american knights seek to wear in public demonstrations does not convey a message independently of the robe and hood.that is,since the robe and hood alone clearly serve to identify the american knights with the klan,we conclude that the mask does not communicate any message that the robe and the hood do not the expressive force of the mask is,therefore,redundant.
not only is the message conveyed by the mask duplicative of the robe and hood,we think the mask adds no expressive force to the message portrayed by the rest of the outfit.the mask asserted message is already being conveyed unequivocally inasmuch as the robe and hood draw an association between the american knights and the klan that is clear and unmistakable to any viewer,the addition of the mask can not make that association any clearer a witness to a rally where demonstrators were wearing the robes and hoods of the traditional klan would not somehow be more likely to understand that association if the demonstrators were also wearing masks.the american knights offers no evidence or argument to the contrary.
additionally,the expressive quality of the mask,as part of the american knights regalia,is diminished by the fact that mask wearing appears to be,to some extent,optional among american knights plaintiffs jeffrey berry and james sheeley,respectively the national imperial wizard and the grand dragon for the realm of new york and new jersey of the american knights,attend rallies without wearing masks.one member testified that some attendees at rallies,including members who are not part of the hierarchy,do not wear masks.these are people who are already public and who do not need to wear masks to protect their identities.plaintiff berry testified that o nly people who everybody knows who they are already are permitted to attend rallies without masks.to the extent that mask wearing is not even a uniform practice,the masks scarcely contribute to the expressiveness of the american knights uniform.
the approach we take today,analyzing the expressive value of the mask apart from the robe and hood,is supported by our decision in latino officers association,new york,city of new york,cir.in that case,we held that the new york police department parade policy likely ran afoul of the first amendment by preventing the plaintiffs,the latino officers association loa,from marching in parades while wearing their police uniforms to protest discrimination and misconduct within the police force.id.at.the city of new york argued that the plaintiffs interest in wearing police uniforms was not protected under the first amendment at all,because members of the public were unlikely to understand the plaintiffs message merely from the fact that they were wearing uniforms.id.at.in rejecting the city argument,we explained that members of the,the spectators at each of the more likely to discern and understand the loa message about discrimination and misconduct in the nypd if plaintiffs wear uniforms.id.at emphasis added.if the loa wearing of uniforms had added nothing whatsoever to their message,we would not have found the same first amendment concerns implicated.see see also hernandez superintendent,t he mask contributes nothing to the message already conveyed by the remainder of the costume,nor does it convey any independent message.thus,on the facts presented,petitioner did not constitute expressive conduct entitled to first amendment protection because it did not convey a particularized message.hernandez commonwealth,without the mask,the social and political message conveyed by the uniform of the ku klux klan is the same as it would be with the mask.
we are mindful that a federal court analysis of the expressive quality of conduct can be a difficult task.it is,however,a task that we must undertake.see,zalewska,at although appellant activity is expressive,it does not constitute the type of expressive conduct which would allow her to invoke the first amendment in challenging the county regulation because the ordinary viewer would glean no particularized message from appellant wearing of a skirt rather than pants as part of her uniform.we hold merely that where,as here,a statute banning conduct imposes a burden on the wearing of an element of an expressive uniform,which element has no independent or incremental expressive value,the first amendment is not implicated,and a balancing of interests under united states,d,is unnecessary.
iii.anonymous speech 
in numerous decisions,the supreme court has recognized a right to anonymous speech grounded in the first amendment freedoms of speech and association.in the seminal case,naacp alabama,d,the court held that the state of alabama could not compel the naacp to reveal to the state attorney general lists of its members names and addresses.the court found that compelled disclosure of the naacp alabama membership is likely to affect adversely the ability of the naacp and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate,in that it may induce members to withdraw from the association and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.id.at.because the disclosure order was a substantial restraint on the naacp members constitutionally protected right of association,the court subjected the order to exacting scrutiny and ultimately invalidated the order.id.at.
subsequent decisions of the supreme court have applied naacp alabama to prevent compelled disclosure of names in other contexts.see generally mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d invalidating an ohio statute that prohibited the distribution of anonymous campaign literature talley california,d invalidating a los angeles ordinance that prohibited the distribution of handbills without the names and addresses of persons who prepared,distributed,or sponsored the handbills bates city of little rock,d upholding the naacp refusal to provide the names of its members to municipal tax officials see also buckley valeo,d w e have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure,in itself,can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the first amendment.most recently,the supreme court addressed the issue of anonymous speech in buckley american constitutional law foundation,d,where it held that the first amendment was violated by a colorado statute that required persons who circulated petitions for an initiative to wear identification badges revealing their names.id.at.
these supreme court decisions establish that the first amendment is implicated by government efforts to compel disclosure of names in numerous settings,whether the names of an organization members,the names of campaign contributors,the names of producers of political leaflets,or the names of persons who circulate petitions.in contrast,the supreme court has never held that freedom of association or the right to engage in anonymous speech entails a right to conceal one appearance in a public demonstration.nor has any circuit found such a right.we decline the american knights request to extend the holdings of naacp alabama and its progeny and to hold that the concealment of one face while demonstrating is constitutionally protected.
the district court stated that,in determining whether the first amendment applies,the question is whether disclosing the identity of the american knights members restricts protected speech church of am.knights,d at.assuming for the discussion that new york law makes some members of the american knights less willing to participate in rallies,we nonetheless reject the view that the first amendment is implicated every time a law makes a member of a politically unpopular willing to exercise his or her free speech rights.while the first amendment protects the rights of citizens to express their viewpoints,however unpopular,it does not guarantee ideal conditions for doing so,since the individual right to speech must always be balanced against the state interest in safety,and its right to regulate conduct that it legitimate
