the mashantucket pequot tribe the tribe challenges the town of ledyard the town imposition of the state of connecticut the state personal property tax on the lessors of slot machines used by the tribe at foxwoods resort casino and mgm grand at foxwoods collectively foxwoods,located in ledyard,connecticut.see.et the tax.the tribe filed complaints in august and september on behalf of two vendors who lease slot machines to the tribe for use at foxwoods.the town and the state appeal from a ruling of the united states district court for the district of connecticut warren eginton,judge denying their motions for summary judgment,granting summary judgment to the tribe,and affording the tribe injunctive and declaratory relief.
as a threshold matter,the town and state assert that the tribe lacks standing the tax injunction act,strips federal courts of jurisdiction over this action and principles of comity bar federal courts from deciding this action.on the merits,the tribe defends the district court order to invalidate the state personal property tax as applied to the vendors,asserting that the tax is preempted by the indian trader statutes,by the indian gaming regulatory act igra,et and pursuant to the balancing test enunciated in white mountain apache tribe bracker.
we hold that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction,and the tribe has standing to pursue this claim neither igra nor the indian trader statutes expressly bar the tax and,under the bracker test,federal law does not implicitly bar the tax because state and town interests in the integrity and uniform application of their tax system outweigh the federal and tribal interests reflected in igra.the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the tribe and in denying summary judgment for the town and state.
background 
connecticut imposes a personal property tax for the purpose of revenue collection for the municipalities that assess and collect the tax.state law requires nonresident owners of personal property,which includes slot machines,to file declarations spelling out the value of their property with the towns where their property is located.the towns apply a formula to the value of that property and bill the owners accordingly.to collect the tax,the town relies heavily on the willingness of taxpayers to comply with state law and file personal property declarations.hopkins decl.this tax does not apply to tribal property located.
connecticut towns use these tax proceeds to fund the operation of municipal government.id.the services provided by the town include,inter alia,police and functions,road maintenance,education,and trash collection.the town maintains roads to and throughout the indian reservation,provides emergency services to the tribe,buses children living to schools,and pays for the education of tribal children.the annual cost to the town of educating tribal children is at least 
ii.the gaming procedures 
the mashantucket pequot gaming enterprise the enterprise operates foxwoods,the largest casino and resort in the united states.the enterprise employs people,of whom approximately are tribal members.although the tribe has other sources of income,including at least four types of taxes it imposes on activities,the majority of the tribe revenue comes from the enterprise.slot machines are among the most popular enterprise games.
igra defines slot machines as class iii games.see.the final mashantucket pequot gaming procedures,promulgated by the secretary of the interior,governs the tribe use of class iii games.see dist.doc.gaming procedures.under the gaming procedures,the state licenses gaming employees,requires enterprises to register before providing gaming,and collects compensation from the tribe.gaming procedures at.the enterprise pays percent of all proceeds from video facsimile to the state.these payments exceeded billion from to.the enterprise also reimburse s the state for law enforcement and regulatory services related to gaming this payment was,in total,approximately million from.
iii.the lease agreements and modifications 
the enterprise obtains slot machines from different vendors,including atlantic city coin slot company ac coin and wms gaming incorporated wms collectively the vendors.ac coin is incorporated and based in new jersey wms is a delaware corporation with headquarters in illinois.ac coin and wms sell some of their slot machines,but they offer some of their most popular proprietary games by lease only 
ac coin began leasing slot machines to the tribe in.these leases provided that t axes and any license fees applicable to the use and operation of the machines shall be paid by the c asino.ac coin lease.the agreements further provided that the tribe 
agrees to defend,indemnify,and hold harmless coin,its agents,employees,officers,and directors from and against any and all liabilities,obligations,losses,damages,injuries,claims,demands,penalties,costs and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature arising out of the use,operation and possession of the machines,provided such liabilities are not the direct result of the negligent or intentional conduct of coin or its agents,officers,and directors.
id.ac coin has used,and continues to use,this standard form tax and indemnification language in leases for both its tribal and lessees.mccormick aff.ac coin has paid connecticut personal property tax on slot machines leased to the tribes that operate both foxwoods and mohegan sun,another,casino.despite the permissive language in its leases,ac coin has not sought or received reimbursement for the taxes that it has paid on gaming equipment leased to other casinos and had not sought reimbursement from the tribe prior to this lawsuit.
wms also leased slot machines to the tribe pursuant to standard form leases,beginning in.a lease with the tribe contained standard language requiring that 
t axes,licenses and permit fees applicable to the installation or operation of the machines shall be paid by the tribe.the tribe shall indemnify and defend wms from and against any penalty,liability and expense arising from the tribe failure to remit such taxes or from any delinquency with respect to such remittance.
wms lease agreement.like ac coin,wms has not sought reimbursement nor has it ever been reimbursed for personal property taxes it has paid on gaming equipment leased to casinos by any casino or indian tribe,including the enterprise and the mohegan sun casino.town rule a statement.similarly,wms does not change the pricing,or lease rate,of leased slot machines because of personal property tax the tax is not a factor in lease pricing.id.
in the late,the tribe decided that its vendors should not be subject to the tax.despite the vendors initial reluctance,the tribe persuaded the vendors to modify the lease agreements to reflect this decision.the modified ac coin lease indicated 
foxwoods represents that it is not subject to any state or local taxes for any services or sales or leases occurring at foxwoods premises and ac coin agrees not to file with the local towns or any other applicable jurisdiction,including specifically the town of ledyard,a list of property or equipment provided under the agreement or to pay such tax with respect to such equipment except in the event that ac coin is legally obligated to do so.in the event that ac coin becomes legally obligated to file pay taxes,ac coin agrees to immediately notify foxwoods of such obligation and to reasonably cooperate with foxwoods in contesting such tax filing payment if so requested by foxwoods foxwoods agrees to hold harmless reimburse ac coin within thirty days for any taxes or any related cost or expense paid in accordance with this provision.
town rule a statement.
the modified language in the wms lease agreement was substantially identical.see id.despite the modifications,wms and ac coin continued to pay personal property taxes until the tribe pressured them to stop.
iv.court actions among the parties 
in,ac coin pursued and lost an administrative appeal of the tax to the town board of assessment appeals.in august,the tribe and ac coin filed the complaint in this action in the united states district court for the district of connecticut.
in july,the town filed suit in connecticut superior court to collect unpaid property taxes from wms.in september,the tribe sued in federal court to enjoin the enforcement of the tax against wms.the district court consolidated the two federal actions.the superior court has stayed connecticut action against wms pending resolution of this case.town of ledyard wms gaming,knl.the state intervened as a defendant in both federal cases.as relevant here,the parties filed for summary judgment,which the district court resolved in favor of the tribe.
discussion 
the town and state offer three independent reasons to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction standing,the tax injunction act t ia,and comity.the tribe argues that jurisdiction was proper and that we should affirm the district court opinion that the tax is preempted by the indian trader statutes,igra,and the bracker balancing test.we find that the district court properly reached the merits of the case,and the district court erred in holding that the tax was preempted.
i.the district court properly exercised jurisdiction 
the district court concluded that none of the appellants challenges to its jurisdiction were persuasive.see mashantucket pequot tribe town of ledyard,cv wwe,wl,pequot i denying motion to dismiss based on the tia and comity mashantucket pequot tribe town of ledyard,cv wwe,wl,pequot ii denying motion to dismiss based on the tia and lack of standing.we affirm that conclusion.
a.the tribe has standing to pursue its claim 
the town alleges that the tribe lacks standing to bring this claim.to establish article iii standing,an injury must be concrete,particularized,and actual or imminent fairly traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling.clapper amnesty intern.usa,quoting monsanto geertson seed farms.only the existence of a concrete,particularized injury is at issue in this case.
the tribe argues,inter alia,that it has suffered an because the tax infringes upon tribal sovereignty.we agree that the tribe allegations are sufficient to confer standing.
although article iii standing requirement is not satisfied by mere assertions of trespass to tribal sovereignty,actual infringements on a tribe sovereignty constitute a concrete injury sufficient to confer standing.this injury,distinct from the monetary injury asserted by the taxed parties,implicates the substantive interest which congress has sought to protect in tribal.moe confederated salish and kootenai tribes of flathead reservation,addressing state taxes imposed on indians directly implicating the tribe relationship with its members.this rule exists because tribes,like states,are afforded special solicitude in our standing analysis.massachusetts epa.
the supreme court has consistently recognized that a tribe has an interest in protecting tribal from the assertion by a state that it has regulatory or taxing authority over indians and conducting business on tribal reservations.miccosukee tribe of indians of.state athletic comm n,cir citing white mountain apache tribe bracker,and ramah navajo sch.bd.bureau of revenue of.in miccosukee,the eleventh circuit held that a tax imposed on revenues gained by a boxing promoter from an match constituted an affront to sovereignty sufficient to confer standing.id.at collecting cases in which the supreme court reached the merits of similar actions.
the town relies on reich mashantucket sand gravel,cir,in which this court held without discussing standing that some statutory interference with tribal sovereignty was permissible,to argue that the alleged infringement of sovereignty at issue here does not confer standing.however,we must avoid conflat ing the requirement for an with the validity of the tribe claim.dean blumenthal,cir per curiam.the standing inquiry only requires that the tribe establish an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,internal quotations and citations omitted.
here,the imposition of state taxes on slot machines operated only by the tribe casino and stored solely impinges upon the tribe ability to regulate its affairs and to be the sole governmental organ influencing activities,including possession of property,on its reservation.the injury in this case is neither speculative nor generalized there is a real tax with measurable interference in the tribe sovereignty on its reservation.miccosukee,at.the tribe has standing to vindicate these interests.
b.the tia does not bar this action 
the state alleges that the tribe suit is barred by the tia,which provides that district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.the tribe counters that a tribal exception recognized in moe,at,undercuts the tia seemingly sweeping language.we agree with the tribe.
federal courts have original jurisdiction of all federal claims brought by any indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the secretary of the interior.in moe,the supreme court permitted a tribe to challenge,inter alia,the imposition of a state personal property tax imposed.at.the moe court held that tribes are entitled to treatment similar to that of the united states had it sued on their behalf.id.at.the court further noted that the united states could sue to vindicate indian interests that it had sought to protect through federal legislation and federal programs.id.at citing heckman united states,and united states rickert.the tribe was therefore permitted to sue to dispute imposition of state personal property taxes and sales taxes as applied to indians.id.at.
if the tribe were suing to enjoin enforcement of a state tax imposed directly on the tribe,the action would not be barred by the tia.moe,at see also sac and fox nation of missouri pierce,cir.however,otherwise exempt parties are subject to the tia when they sue on behalf of institutions.fdic new york,cir.insofar as the tribe is suing on behalf of the vendors who are the taxed parties,its suit like theirs is barred by the tia.
here,the tribe is suing to defend against the town and state alleged encroachment upon aspects of tribal sovereignty protected by the indian trader statutes and igra.courts embrace the recognition of the interest of the united states in securing immunity to the indians from taxation conflicting with the measures it had adopted for their protection.moe,at quoting heckman,at.since we are required to decide whether the state tax at issue conflicts with the federal measures enacted for the tribe protection,we have undoubted jurisdiction notwithstanding the perform that task.recognizing this requirement,congress bestowed on the federal courts original jurisdiction over all federal claims brought by tribes.the tia does not preclude jurisdiction over a tribe suit to enjoin purportedly preempted state taxation of on the reservation.see,baron band of mission indians yee,cir 
comity does not preclude federal jurisdiction 
the state alleges that the district court abused its discretion in failing to dismiss this case under principles of comity.the tribe asserts that the state forfeited this claim.we reject both arguments the state adequately preserved its comity objection,but the district court was within its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss.see joseph hyman,cir where,as here,a district court dismisses the action based on comity,we review the decision for abuse of discretion.
the tribe points to cases in which courts have held that arguments raised in the complaint were waived unless reiterated in opposition to motions for summary judgment.tribe br.citing,inter alia,rocafort ibm,cir.these cases are unpersuasive in the context of comity and federalism,which bear on the relations between court systems,because those relations will be affected whether or not the litigants have raised the issue themselves.washington james,cir.moreover,the district court considered and rejected the comity challenge prior to the motion for summary judgment.after the final order,the district court earlier denial of the motion to remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction also is reviewable.capitol hill grp.pillsbury,winthrop,shaw,pittman,llc,citing charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure.ed.to require the state to its objections would be an overly formalistic application of waiver.dexia credit local rogan,cir.
more embracive than the tia,the comity doctrine applicable in state taxation cases restrains federal courts from entertaining claims for relief that risk disrupting state tax administration.levin commerce energy.the practical reasons for the stringent application of comity in the context of state tax law were explained by justice brennan 
the special reasons justifying the policy of federal with state tax collection are obvious if federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assessments,state tax administration might be thrown into disarray,and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law.during the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed,with consequent damage to the state budget,and perhaps a shift to the state of the risk of taxpayer insolvency.moreover,federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law,which,like issues of state regulatory law,are more properly heard in the state courts.
perez ledesma,concurring in part and dissenting in part.recognizing the competence of the state courts to adjudicate federal issues is essential to our federalism,particularly in the area of state taxation.fair assessment in real estate ass mcnary.
there is little precedent for applying the comity doctrine in cases brought by indian tribes.kiowa tribe of oklahoma lewis,cir affirming the dismissal,on res judicata grounds,of an issue that had already been litigated and appealed through the entire kansas state court system.the sixth circuit has upheld the dismissal on comity grounds of a lawsuit brought by a private indian enterprise.chippewa trading cox,cir.however,in so holding,the court explicitly relied on the fact that the plaintiff wa s not an indian tribe or band,as the statutory exception to the tia requires.id.at.winnebago tribe of kline,d.
two factors counsel against dismissing due to comity in this case,brought by an actual indian tribe and not yet litigated in state court first,there are strong federal interests in determining the contours of the indian trader statutes and igra,two federal regulatory regimes that entirely occupy and preclude state legislation in fields of indeterminate size.where congress has determined that there are strong policies favoring a federal forum to vindicate deprivations of federal rights,as in the context of litigation brought by indian tribes,federal courts should exercise their lawful jurisdiction.mcnary,at brennan,concurring.second,federal courts have regularly entertained indian tribes challenges to state taxes.see,washington confederated tribes of colville indian reservation,oneida nation of cuomo,cir.seeing no reason to depart from this precedent,we affirm the denial of the motion to dismiss on comity grounds 
ii.the state tax has not been preempted 
on reaching the merits,the district court held that the tax was preempted by the indian trader statutes,by igra,and pursuant to the bracker balancing test.pequot ii,wl,at.we conclude that neither the indian trader statute nor igra preempts the tax expressly or by plain implication,cotton petroleum new mexico,and that the town and state interests in the tax,as applied to the vendors,outweigh the tribe and federal interests.the tax is not preempted.
in determining whether federal law preempts a state authority to regulate activities on tribal lands,courts must apply standards different from those applied in other areas of federal preemption.confederated tribes of siletz indians of or.oregon,cir quoting cabazon band of mission indians wilson,cir.although a state will certainly be without jurisdiction if its authority is preempted under familiar principles of preemption,we d o not limit preemption of state laws affecting indian tribes to only those circumstances.new mexico mescalero apache tribe.
when examining whether a state tax is permissible,the initial and frequently dispositive question in indian tax cases is who bears the legal incidence of the tax,as the states are categorically barred from placing the legal incidence of an excise tax on a tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside indian country without congressional authorization.wagnon prairie band potawatomi nation,internal quotation,alterations,and emphasis omitted.but here,the parties stipulate that the legal incidence of the tax falls on the vendors.the supreme court in white mountain apache tribe bracker laid out a mode of analysis for courts to use where,as here,a state asserts authority over the conduct of engaging in activity on the reservation,see also wagnon,at.under bracker,a state tax may be invalid because it is by federal law,or because it unlawfully infringe s on the right of reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in our view,neither the indian trader statutes nor igra indicates congressional intent to bar the tax,and subjecting the tax scheme over,activities to a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake leads us to conclude that the tax is a valid exercise of state authority.oneida nation,at quoting bracker,at.
a.the indian trader statutes do not bar this tax 
the tribe argues that the indian trader statutes,et,bar any state regulation in the field of transactions with indians occurring on reservations.central machinery.state tax comm n.adopting a broad view of the indian trader statutes,the district court held that the state tax that is imposed upon the entities for the leased equipment is preempted by the indian trader statutes.pequot ii,wl,at.we disagree 
throughout this nation history,congress has authorized sweeping and comprehensive federal regulation over persons who wish to trade with indians and indian tribes.dep t of taxation and fin.of milhelm attea,quoting warren trading post.state tax comm n.this regulation includes the indian trader statutes,passed in to protect indians from becoming victims of fraud in dealings with persons selling goods.central machinery,at.these regulations grant the federal government sole power and authority to make such rules and regulations as it may deem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the indians.they also prohibit unrecognized traders such as ac coin and wms from trading with indians and require t hat no white person shall be employed as a clerk by any indian trader unless first licensed so to do by the commissioner of indian affairs.
the supreme court initially interpreted these statutes very broadly.see milhelm attea,at warren trading post.the district court relied on this interpretation,holding that wherever a product is bought,sold,or leased by a tribe,state taxes may not be applied.pequot ii,wl,at.however,in milhelm attea,the supreme court backed away from this interpretation a lthough language in warren trading post suggests that no state regulation of indian traders can be valid,our subsequent decisions have undermined that proposition.at internal alteration and quotation marks omitted see also cotton petroleum,at.indian traders are not wholly immune from state regulation that is reasonably necessary to the assessment or collection of lawful state taxes.milhelm attea,at.
instead of depend ing on rigid rules or on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty,preemption under the indian trader statutes involves a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake to determine whether,in the specific context,the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.milhelm attea,at quoting bracker,at,alteration omitted.thus where they are implicated,the indian trader statutes require the bracker balancing analysis.
the ability of a state to apply taxes to performing functions on an indian reservation is well established.oneida nation,at milhelm attea,at cotton petroleum,at.neither the tribe interests in economic development and fair dealing nor the federal interests in protecting the tribe by monitoring and regulating its commercial partners are implicated by connecticut personal property tax.see colville,at.that is particularly true here,where the incidence of the generally applicable tax falls on the ownership of property,rather than on the transaction between the tribe and the.central machinery,at indian trader law the field of transactions with indians emphasis added.as a result,the indian trader statutes do not preempt the personal property tax expressly or by plain implication.cotton petroleum,at.
igra does not bar the tax 
the district court also determined that igra preempts the tax.pequot ii,wl,at.the tribe is of the view that igra completely preempts all state legislation affecting the field of gaming.while the tribe is correct that igra preempts certain state regulations affecting the governance of gaming,the tax at issue here does not affect the tribe governance of gaming on its reservation,see,barona band,at.therefore,we conclude that igra does not preempt the tax.
the plain text of igra does not bar the tax 
the plain text of igra does not bar the tax.igra insists that nothing in this section shall be interpreted as conferring upon a state or any of its political subdivisions authority to impose any tax,fee,charge,or other assessment upon an indian tribe or upon any other person or entity authorized by an indian tribe to engage in a class iii activity.d.igra does confer the authority,however,for states and tribes to include provisions in the gaming procedures,relating to assessment s by the state of amounts necessary to defray the costs of regulating class iii activity.d c iii.
in this case,the gaming procedures are silent as to the legality of connecticut personal property tax.neither the state nor the tribe sought to include language relating to the personal property tax in the gaming procedures.as a result,neither the gaming procedures nor,by extension,igra explicitly forbids or permits the state to apply its personal property tax to the vendors.
igra does not bar the tax by plain implication 
igra does not explicitly bar the tax,but the tribe asserts that the provisions of igra demonstrate congressional intent to exempt lessors of gaming equipment from a state property tax levied on property located within a reservation even though that tax does not produce acute economic effects that interfere with the relevant gaming practices.igra,passed in in response to the supreme court decision in california cabazon band of mission indians,was intended to expressly preempt the field in the governance of gaming activities on indian lands.consequently,federal courts should not balance competing federal,state,and tribal interests to determine the extent to which various gaming activities are allowed.gaming of am.dorsey whitney,cir quoting,sess.however,n ot every contract that is merely peripherally associated with tribal gaming is subject to igra constraints.casino res.harrah entm t,cir.
in determining whether a state tax imposed on a third party is preempted by igra occupation of the governance of gaming field,courts have been quick to dismiss challenges to laws with de minimis effects on a tribe ability to regulate its gambling operations.for example,courts have held that igra preemptive scope is not implicated in cases involving gaming management and service contracts with a tribe,id.at contracts to acquire materials to build a casino,barona band,at and release of detailed investigative reports on the management of gaming,siletz,f d at.similarly,we conclude that any preemption of the field of gaming regulations is not at issue here,where the state tax on property is not targeted at gaming.instead,we apply the bracker framework to determine whether the particular application of this tax conflicts with federal law.see barona band,at if we were to accept the tribe argument that igra itself preempts the state taxation of contractors working on tribal territory,we would effectively ignore bracker and its progeny.
the tribe contends that,in order to assure the legality of a tax of general application,the state was required to include language in the gaming procedures reserving the right to apply the property tax to slot machine vendors.u nder igra,the only method by which a state can apply its general civil laws to gaming is through a compact.gaming,at.but under igra,mere ownership of slot machines by the vendors does not qualify as gaming,and taxing such ownership therefore does not interfere with the governance of gaming.
although the gaming procedures outline the tribe use of gaming services,nothing in the gaming procedures indicates that it delineates all of the rights and responsibilities of vendors engaged in gaming services.gaming services in the gaming procedures is defined as the providing of any goods or services to the tribe directly in connection with the operation of class iii gaming in a gaming facility,including manufacture,distribution,maintenance or repair of gaming equipment.gaming procedures m while the gaming procedures prohibit state taxation of any tribal gaming operation other than those explicitly permitted,gaming procedures f,they are silent as to taxes imposed on a third party ownership of slot machines on the tribe land,which,as explained above,is not gaming.
absent the gaming procedures,igra would not preempt the tax.with the gaming procedures,which are silent on the question of state taxation of the vendors property,the analysis is unchanged.
igra does not directly preempt,by its text or by plain implication,the imposition of connecticut personal property tax.it also does not explicitly authorize the tax the bracker balancing test is therefore in play.
c.the tax is not barred under bracker 
even when a state law is not barred by the text or plain implication of a federal statute,it may unlawfully infringe on the right of reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.bracker,at quoting williams lee,see also wilson,at.it may also unlawfully impinge upon the objectives of federal legislation.see bracker,at.such a tax is impermissible if the imposition of the tax fails to satisfy the bracker interestbalancing test.wagnon,at.
the bracker test is a flexible analysis sensitive to the particular facts and legislation involved.cotton petroleum,at.we examine federal statutes and treaties in light of the broad policies that underlie them and the notions of sovereignty that have developed from historical traditions of tribal independence.ramah,at quoting bracker,at.we then weigh the independent but related barriers of possible under federal statutes,and interfere nce with a tribe ability to exercise its sovereign functions.id.at quoting bracker,at.finally,t he state interest in exercising its regulatory authority over the activity in question must be examined and given appropriate weight.id.at.in balancing interests,ambiguities in federal law should be construed generously,and federal is not limited to those situations where congress has explicitly announced an intention to state activity.id.
the town and state contend that the balancing test does not apply and,in the alternative,that the town and state interests at issue are more significant than the tribal and federal interests at play.we find,first,that the bracker test applies,and second,that it balances in favor of the town and state.
the bracker test applies 
the town makes two arguments in support of its claim that the bracker test does not apply the taxed transaction takes place off of the reservation,and any needed balancing has already been conducted by the supreme court in thomas gay.neither argument is persuasive.
first,t he bracker test has never been applied where the state asserts its taxing authority over off the reservation.wagnon,at.in wagnon,the supreme court held that a fuel tax imposed on distributors who received fuel offreservation and delivered it to the prairie band potawatomi nation was imposed on transactions not subject to bracker.id.at.the tax at issue in wagnon applied regardless of the disposition of the fuel because it was triggered by the receipt of fuel.here,no relevant transaction occurs offreservation.instead,the tax is levied upon slot machines because they are located in the state of,on the tribe reservation.
second,the town points to several late cases non indian lessee cases in which the supreme court upheld taxes on property of who resided on indian reservations.in thomas the court upheld a tax put upon the cattle of the lessees as too remote and indirect to be deemed a tax upon the lands or privileges of the indians.at.expressly setting aside the argument that the value of the lands for such purposes would fluctuate or be destroyed altogether by the tax,the court declined to engage in a structured analysis or to weigh the tribal against the state interests.
thomas and the non indian lessee cases are similar to this case insofar as the court addressed state taxation with the incidence of the tax falling within indian land despite the absence of a direct tax on the indians.colville,at rehnquist,concurring.however,the law has changed since the the supreme court has clarified the ways in which courts should evaluate assertions of preemption of state taxes.bracker,at.each case requires a particularized examination of the relevant state,federal,and tribal interests.cotton petroleum,at quoting ramah,at.moreover,congress has established the importance of the specific federal interests at issue by enacting protective legislation such as igra.thomas,at conceding t he unlimited power of c ongress to deal with the indians but noting that the tax at issue would not be an interference with congressional power.although thomas informs our inquiry,we can not forgo bracker analysis because the supreme court decided a related question years ago.
the state and town interests outweigh the federal and tribal interests 
i.the federal interest 
for the purposes of the bracker test,determining relevant federal interests is primarily an exercise in examining congressional intent,and the history of tribal sovereignty serves as a necessary backdrop to that process.cotton petroleum,at.igra described at times as congress strongest and most explicit statement in favor of tribal economic development,matthew fletcher,the supreme court and federal indian policy,is intended to promote tribal economic development,prevent criminal activity related to gambling,and ensure that gaming activities are conducted fairly.rincon band of luiseno mission indians of the rincon reservation schwarzenegger,cir,and also to ensure that the indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation.nothing within igra reveals congressional intent to exempt suppliers of gaming equipment from generally applicable state taxes that would apply in the absence of the legislation.igra addresses state taxation,d without prohibiting taxes like this personal property tax.see,container of am.franchise tax,holding that if federal legislation speaks to a particular tax without prohibiting it,this undermines a claim that the tax is preempted.
the tax,imposed on vendors,is likely to have a minimal effect on the tribe economic development.while igra seeks to limit criminal activity at the casinos,nothing in connecticut tax makes it likely that michael corleone will arrive to take over the tribe operations.moreover,igra presented an opportunity for congress to preempt taxes exactly like this one congress chose to limit the scope of igra preemptive effect to the governance of gaming.gaming,at.as imposed on the owners of vending machines leased by the tribe,the tax entitles the state to a tangential benefit from the tribe gaming operation,but it does not prevent the indian tribe from being the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation.emphasis added.the tax therefore has only a minimal effect on federal interests.
ii.the tribal interest 
the tax implicates two tribal interests economic development and sovereignty over the the parties dispute the magnitude of the tax impact on each.
the economic effect of the tax on the tribe is minimal from to,ac coin had paid in personal property tax.after several years,at the tribe urging,ac coin permitted the tribe to reimburse it for this tax while this lawsuit was pending.assuming comparable taxes on wms this leads to an approximate total tax of per annum although this is a substantial sum,it constitutes less than two tenths of one percent of the ac coin and wms in revenue per annum that the vendors anticipate from their dealings with the tribe.
as of september,the tribe had invested over billion in its gaming operations at foxwoods.many of the vendors most popular games are available by lease only,and the tribe has elected to pursue leases of a significant duration however,the challenged tax does not significantly compromise the profitability of these leases.the tribe payments to the state of percent of its gross operating revenues from video facsimile games have exceeded billion since.even if the tribe were forced to reimburse the vendors,per year would not pose a substantial threat to the revenue the tribe derives from the vendors games,and it does not make the state the primary beneficiary of even this part of the tribe gaming operation.the tax economic effect on the tribe is less than minimal.
the tax has a moderate effect on tribal sovereignty.a tribe power to exclude nonmembers entirely or to condition their presence on the reservation is well established.mescalero apache,at.however,w e long ago departed from the conceptual clarity of chief justice marshall view in worcester georgia,that indian tribes were wholly distinct nations within whose boundaries the laws of a state can have no force.id.at quoting worcester,at alterations omitted.the state personal property tax,as imposed on the slot machines located entirely onreservation,overlaps with the tribe ability to set the restrictions to property rights in its sovereign territory.u nder some circumstances a state may exercise concurrent jurisdiction over acting on tribal reservations.id.at citations omitted.still,this encroachment into an area of tribal sovereignty,however modest,is a recognized injury that must be considered in a bracker balancing.
iii.the state and town interests 
in evaluating a state economic interests for the purpose of bracker balancing,we look for a nexus between the taxed activity and the government function provided barona band,at see also ute mountain ute tribe rodriguez,cir.in mescalero,the challenged state regulation targeted hunting in particular the supreme court considered state interests to be weaker because the state did not contribute to hunting or wildlife on the reservation.at.similarly,in ute tribe,the tenth circuit noted that the state taxes relating to extraction of oil and gas would be more defensible if the state used the tax proceeds to provide related services to the tribe.at.
there is nothing unique in the nature of a tax that requires a different analysis.ramah,at.however,for a tax,a court may credit the services provided by the state to the tribe more generally as related to the tax.in cotton petroleum,at,the supreme court permitted application of a generalized tax on oil and gas production to production,despite evidence that tax payments by reservation lessees far exceed ed the value of services provided by the state to the lessees,or more generally,to the reservation as a whole.id.at.the court reasoned that the state could point to t he intangible value of citizenship in an organized society that is not easily measured in dollars and cents.id.it also pointed out the nightmarish administrative burdens that would arise from requiring parity between state taxes and state services.id.at.
in this case,the town has a cognizable economic interest in imposing the tax.the supreme court has recognized the dependency of state budgets on the receipt of local tax revenues and appreciate s the difficulties enc
