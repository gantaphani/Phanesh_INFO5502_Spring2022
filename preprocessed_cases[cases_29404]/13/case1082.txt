entergy nuclear vermont yankee,llc,and entergy nuclear operations,collectively,entergy own and operate the vermont yankee nuclear power station vermont yankee,a nuclear power plant in vernon,vermont.entergy brought suit in the united states district court for the district of vermont against the governor and attorney general of the state of vermont and the members of the vermont public service board in their official capacities collectively,vermont,and asserted three claims.count one alleged that three recently enacted vermont statutes governing vermont yankee acts,and concerned issues of radiological safety and thus were preempted by the federal atomic energy act.count two alleged that vermont had attempted to condition its grant of permission to operate vermont yankee on the execution of a power purchase agreement that favored vermont retail consumers,and that this attempt was preempted by the federal power act.count three asserted that these same actions with respect to the power purchase agreement also violated the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution.following a bench trial,the district court murtha,found in favor of entergy as to count one with respect to acts and and found the challenge to act to be moot the district court also found in favor of entergy as to count three.lastly,the district court found count two to be premature.we affirm the district court as to counts one and two,and reverse the district court as to count three.
background 
we summarize here those findings of fact relevant to this appeal that were made by the district court following the bench trial.
i.the history of vermont yankee 
in,vermont yankee opened and began operating under the ownership and management of the vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vynpc,a joint venture of eight new england retail electric utilities.among the eight members of the joint venture were two vermont electric companies central vermont public service and green mountain power,which owned a collective percent share of vermont yankee.vermont yankee had been granted a facility operating license by the atomic energy commission,the federal agency that preceded the nuclear regulatory commission nrc.the license was to expire on march.
in,vynpc sought to sell vermont yankee.after an initial bid by one firm was rejected by the vermont public service board the board entergy submitted a bid for vermont yankee in the summer of and sought a certificate of public good cpg,a license from the board to continue to operate vermont yankee under vermont state law as it was negotiating with the board,entergy entered into a memorandum of understanding mou the mou with the vermont department of public service the department the mou incorporated a power purchase agreement ppa entergy executed in the ppa that promised vermont retail electric utilities favorable pricing terms for the purchase of power from vermont yankee until entergy maintains it agreed to the ppa because it feared that the department would not otherwise recommend a cpg for vermont yankee.entergy also agreed in the mou to waive any claim that federal law preempts the jurisdiction of the board.
on june,the board approved the sale of vermont yankee to entergy and issued a new cpg.in its decision and final order,the board stated that the sale of vermont yankee to entergy would promote the general good in part because,under most reasonably foreseeable scenarios,the transactions are highly likely to produce an economic benefit for vermont ratepayers.in re.yankee nuclear power,docket,wl,at.pub.serv.bd.june.the order specifically endorsed the ppa because it allowed vermont retail utilities to purchase power from vermont yankee at prices that are substantially below the currently committed operating costs of vermont yankee over the remaining term of its license.id.the order noted that the ppa also imposed a cap on the charges for vermont yankee power.id.
in,entergy obtained from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc authorization to sell power into the interstate market under a tariff,which remains in effect.the authorization permits entergy to sell power wholesale through iso new england iso ne,a nonprofit independent system operator under ferc regulation that administers new england energy markets.iso ne stated responsibilities are to maintain reliable power system operations,ensure efficient and competitive markets,and to administer the regional transmission tariff,including comprehensive regional system planning.
ii.the recent vermont legislation concerning vermont yankee 
act the vermont legislation concerning increased nuclear waste storage by vermont yankee 
in,entergy petitioned the board to obtain a uprate,which would allow an increase in vermont yankee power output and also result in a concomitant increase in nuclear waste.see entergy nuclear.yankee,llc united states,aff in part,rev in part sub.yankee nuclear power entergy nuclear.yankee,llc.under a statute enacted in five years after vermont yankee first began operating the construction of new nuclear waste storage facilities in vermont was prohibited unless the vermont legislature passed a bill or joint resolution finding that the facilities promoted the general good of the state.stat.ann.tit,a.however,two years later,in,the vermont legislature enacted an exemption provision stating that the requirements imposed by do not apply to any temporary storage by vermont yankee nuclear power corporation of spent nuclear fuel elements or other radioactive waste at its present site.id.
at the same time that entergy sought the uprate,it also entered into a new mou the mou with the department under which entergy would pay million into new state benefits funds,namely the environmental benefit fund,the low income benefit fund,and the entergy fund for economic benefit.see entergy nuclear.at in re entergy nuclear.yankee,llc.the board then issued a cpg approving the uprate on march.entergy nuclear.at.however,entergy also needed to obtain approval to construct the new dry cask spent nuclear fuel storage facility,even though it had recently received approval for it from the nrc entergy then petitioned the board,requesting permission to expand its spent fuel storage facility.entergy maintained that the exemption provision of section applied to the vermont yankee site in general,as opposed to a particular owner of the plant.the board sought guidance from the vermont senate,which,in turn,obtained a letter from the office of the vermont attorney general opining that section was.see letter from michael mcshane,att y,to peter welch,pro tempore of the.senate,wl,at.since vermont yankee had changed ownership from vynpc to entergy,the letter provided that entergy would need the approval of the vermont legislature to add spent fuel storage capacity.id.at.
in response,entergy presented proposed legislation clarifying that section was,rather than.this proposal failed to obtain support from the vermont legislature,however.the vermont legislature then began hearings on the bill that would eventually become act.
act,which was enacted on june,had two principal effects.first,entergy would only need to seek a cpg from the board before constructing storage facilities for new spent nuclear fuel,rather than the vermont legislature as had been required by section a.however,this cpg would remain in effect only until march.the second effect of act was that after march,the storage of any new spent nuclear fuel in vermont would require an affirmative vote by the vermont legislature.if no such affirmative vote occurred,storage of nuclear waste generated from operations after march,would not be permitted.thus,vermont yankee would have to shut down.
the,shift of responsibility for approving the storage of spent nuclear fuel generated by vermont yankee from the board to the vermont legislature had important ramifications.decisions of the board may be appealed to the vermont supreme court.stat.ann.tit.no such review mechanism would exist for the vermont legislature decision not to approve additional spent nuclear fuel storage space.
act added three new sections to title of the vermont statutes sections,and.section outlines the vermont legislature findings,including recognition of the need to develop renewable and environmentally sustainable energy sources in vermont.stat.ann.tit.to support this objective,section references the state creation of an energy efficiency fund to support investments in energy efficiency resources,and a statewide energy purchasing pool with a related program to accelerate investments in new renewable and and power projects.id.
section restates the requirement that the owners of vermont yankee can not construct new spent fuel storage facilities for the period up to march,unless they obtain a cpg from the board.id.a.section also mandates that the board find that the owners of vermont yankee have adequate resources to manage spent fuel and decommission the plant,if necessary,and a plan to remove all spent fuel from vermont to a federally certified storage facility in a timely manner,and that the owners comply with any existing mous with the state.id.b.lastly,section states that any cpg issued by the board pursuant to act will apply to spent nuclear fuel generated by vermont yankee only until march,which is the end of the current operating license.id.c.this provision states that the owners have no expectation or entitlement to continued operation of vermont yankee following the expiration of its current operating license on march.id.c.section c provides that vermont yankee can not store spent nuclear fuel generated after march,on site,unless the vermont legislature enacts legislation granting such permission.in the absence of any other storage options,this would effectively shut down vermont yankee.
section established a clean energy development fund the fund,which entergy agreed to when it received permission for its uprate.see.stat.ann.tit,a under section a,the money entergy had promised to pay into the state benefits funds under the mou would instead be paid into the fund.the fund purpose is to promote the development and deployment of and environmentally sustainable electric power and thermal energy or geothermal resources for the benefit of vermont consumers.id.c.section d outlines various types of renewable energy investments that the fund can undertake,such as energy projects on farms,biofuel production,and thermal energy facility development.id.d.entergy estimated that its total obligation under section to the fund would be million per year,or about million over the period from to 
act also explicitly incorporates the mous,including the and mous,as well as a new mou executed on june,the mou.stat.ann.tit,b the mou mandated,inter alia,that entergy locate the spent nuclear fuel storage pad at least one hundred feet from a floodplain,space the storage casks to permit access to individual casks to the greatest extent possible,configure the pool so that heat assemblies are surrounded by heat assemblies,perform temperature monitoring and monthly manual radiation surveillance of the storage casks and report the results to the department,not store waste generated outside vermont on site,remove high level spent nuclear fuel from vermont as quickly as possible,and conduct a study addressing the stability of the proposed new spent nuclear fuel storage facility based upon a stated concern that an adjacent river bank might erode and collapse.see mou at see also entergy nuclear.yankee.at in re entergy nuclear.yankee,llc,p,wl,at,this flood analysis was more extensive than that required by the nrc licensing process for the same spent nuclear fuel storage facility and,although entergy believed that the board concerns regarding the probability of a collapse were not credible,entergy agreed to undertake the study.in re entergy nuclear.yankee,llc,wl,at.as with the earlier mo us,entergy agreed to waive any federal preemption claim concerning the mou mou at.
on june,the day after act went into effect,entergy filed a petition with the board seeking to construct a dry fuel storage facility at vermont yankee,which,as mentioned,the nrc had already.in re entergy nuclear.yankee,llc,wl,at.in the subsequent eight months,the board held a series of public meetings and conducted technical hearings to evaluate the petition.id.at.the board also received public comments,of which the vast majority highlighted public concerns about the public uprate that the board has previously approved,and the desire for an independent safety assessment,general nuclear safety concerns,and vermont yankee as a terrorist target.id.at.in addition,most of those who attended the board public meetings opposed the proposed dry fuel storage facility for reasons relating to the facility vulnerability to natural or manmade disasters,the adequacy of dry fuel storage technology,and the potential for environmental harm.id.at.on april,the board issued an order granting the petition until,and issuing a new cpg for the construction of the storage facility.id.at.the board stated that the most significant factor in its decision was the economic benefit of the facility.id.at.noting that vermont yankee now provides approximately of the power consumed by the state of vermont,an early shutdown of the plant due to the absence of spent nuclear fuel storage facilities would impose substantial costs on vermont ratepayers.id.without the power from vermont yankee,vermont utilities would need to purchase replacement power from sources that are presently expected to be more expensive over this period.approval of the dry fuel storage facility provides a direct economic benefit to the state by preserving the power.id.the board estimated the likely savings to vermont ratepayers arising from the ppa,under which vermont yankee power has been sold to vermont utilities at prices consistently below the price of energy in new england,at approximately million over the period from to.id.at.
act the vermont legislation requiring state legislative approval to operate vermont yankee after 
on january,entergy applied to the nrc for a renewal license to operate vermont yankee through march.one week later,on february,the vermont legislature began considering the bill that would eventually become act.act was passed on may,and provides that a nuclear energy generating plant may be operated in vermont only with the explicit approval of the general assembly.act,a 
act provides that,in deciding whether to approve operation of a nuclear power plant,the vermont legislature should consider the state need for power,the economics and environmental impacts of storage of nuclear waste,and choice of power sources among various alternatives.id.the preamble states that act general purpose is to provide the vermont legislature with the authority to determine whether to issue a new cpg for vermont yankee after march.id.c.act would also help foster a larger societal discussion of broader economic and environmental issues relating to the operation of a nuclear facility in the state,including an assessment of the potential need for the operation of the facility and its economic benefits,risks,and costs,and of alternative methods of power generation as well.id.d.act also includes a stated purpose of ensuring that the evaluation of new cpgs be conducted under new assumptions and analyses,rather than those that supported the previous cpg.id.e.
act adds three new sections to title of the vermont statutes sections e,m,and.section e requires that the vermont legislature approve an extension of the vermont yankee operating lease before the board issues a new cpg.see.stat.ann.tit,e.legislative approval for continued operation of vermont yankee is no longer limited to issues concerning spent fuel storage,as under section c of act rather,act requires that the vermont legislature approve all aspects of the continued operation of vermont yankee.section m requires that the board evaluate the application for a new cpg under current assumptions and analyses and not apply an extension of the cost benefit assumptions and analyses forming the basis of the previous certificate of public good for the operation of the facility.id.m.lastly,section requires that the owners of vermont yankee apply for a new cpg at least four years prior to the expiration of the current cpg,and that the board inform the vermont legislature of the receipt of any new cpg application.id.a.when any new cpg application is submitted,the department is directed to engage in with three stated objectives in mind 
a to facilitate public discussion of economic and environmental issues relating to the operation of any nuclear facility in the state 
b to identify and assess the potential need for the operation of the facility and its economic and environmental benefits,risks,and costs and 
c to assess all practical alternatives to those set forth in the applicant petition that may be more or that otherwise may better promote the general welfare.
section also requires that the department collect information relating to entergy funding plans for guardianship of nuclear waste after licensure but before removal of nuclear waste from the site,plant closure procedures,and funding for emergency management systems.one subsection of section requires the department to identify,collect information on,and provide analysis of environmental,economic,and public health issues,including issues relating to dry cask storage of nuclear waste and decommissioning options.id.b b.the department is further directed to report its findings to the board and to the vermont legislature.id.a.the board,in turn,is directed to consider the findings of the department in assessing an application for a new cpg.id.c.
act the vermont legislation requiring state inspections of vermont yankee 
on june,governor jim douglas signed into law act,entitled an act relating to a comprehensive vertical audit and reliability assessment of the vermont yankee nuclear facility.the purpose of act was to assist the vermont legislature in making its determination as to whether vermont yankee should be permitted to operate past,and to reconfirm the obligation and authority of the general assembly to examine the reliability of the nuclear power station of entergy nuclear vermont yankee.act,a act further provides that,because entergy was applying to extend the life of vermont yankee beyond its original design,the vermont legislature needed to assess any reliability issues associated with operating entergy for an additional years after its scheduled closure in.id.b.act text also addresses concerns relating to the operating reliability of vermont yankee and issues relating to its performance that might arise from expanding the plant.id.
act calls for department inspections of vermont yankee operations,such as its electrical,emergency,and mechanical systems.id.a,a.the act also sets out documentation requirements and inquiries that must be undertaken by the department relating to the installation,maintenance,and inspection of safety systems in vermont yankee.id.to maximize the public visibility of these inspections of vermont yankee,act creates an oversight panel consisting of experts in nuclear power appointed by the governor and the vermont legislature.id.the panel findings and evaluation of vermont yankee were to be reported to the vermont legislature,which would use this information to determine whether to extend the operating license for the plant beyond march.id.d.
the vermont senate bill that would have permitted the continued operation of vermont yankee beyond,as required by act 
on january,entergy disclosed a leak of tritium,a decay product of nuclear energy,emanating from vermont yankee.entergy stopped the leak and remediated its impact on the surrounding soil,and after a subsequent investigation,the nrc concluded that the public health and safety and the environment were not adversely affected.a report by an independent consulting group retained by the state of vermont concluded,on april,that the leak did not affect the reliability of vermont yankee.
at the time of the leak,the vermont senate was considering,which was originally titled,an act relating to approval for continued operation of the vermont yankee nuclear power station,if passed,would have authorized the operation of vermont yankee for an additional twenty years past march,as required by act.although the nrc granted a renewal for the operation of vermont yankee on march,failed to pass in the vermont senate.as a result,vermont yankee has not been granted permission by the vermont legislature to operate past march.
collectively,under acts and,and due to the failure to pass,the operation of vermont yankee after march,depends upon the vermont legislature approving the power plant continued operation.as the vermont legislature has failed to act,vermont yankee cpg expired on march,and the plant would have been forced to shut down absent the district court decision below.
in making its determination whether to permit further operation,the vermont legislature is required by acts and to consider the impact of the local storage of spent nuclear fuel on the local economy and environment,and on the diversity of power sources available to vermont retail utilities.under the two acts,the vermont legislature must also consider the following in determining whether to allow vermont yankee to continue operating the public health implications related to dry cask storage of nuclear waste and decommissioning of the plant entergy resources for emergency management systems,management of spent nuclear fuel storage,and decommissioning of the plant entergy planning for the removal of nuclear waste and entergy plan for the closure of vermont yankee.
in addition,acts and require that entergy comply with the,and mous.those mous impose,inter alia,the following additional requirements on entergy,apart from making payments into a fund used to promote alternative energy sources analysis of the operational safety of vermont yankee in the event of flooding in excess of federal licensing requirements compliance with specific requirements for the construction and monitoring of spent nuclear fuel casks monitoring of the temperature and radiation of the storage casks and regular reporting to the department no storage of any nuclear waste generated outside of vermont removal of the nuclear waste generated by vermont yankee from the state as quickly as possible and waiver of any federal preemption challenge to the board authority to regulate the plant.lastly,the mous require that entergy comply with the ppa under which vermont retail utilities must receive favorable pricing terms for the power produced by vermont yankee relative to retail utilities in other states.
iii.proceedings before the district court 
on april,entergy brought suit in the united states district court for the district of vermont against the governor and attorney general of the state of vermont and the members of the vermont public service board.the complaint sets forth three claims 
count one entergy sought a permanent injunction and declaration that act,act,and act are invalid under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution because they are preempted by the atomic energy act.entergy nuclear.yankee,llc shumlin,d.
count two entergy sought a permanent injunction and declaration that the federal power act preempts the state of vermont from conditioning vermont yankee continued operation on the existence of a power purchase agreement between vermont yankee and vermont retail utilities,because ferc has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of power transmission and sale.id.at.
count three entergy sought a permanent injunction and declaration that vermont may not condition continued operation of vermont yankee on the existence of a power purchase agreement,because doing so places substantial burdens on interstate commerce,in violation of the dormant commerce clause.id.
on january,the district court issued its opinion following a bench trial.the court first concluded that the atomic energy act facially preempts act,which,through the operation of section e,effectively allows the vermont legislature to deny a pending renewal petition by taking no action on the petition,for any reason,procedural or substantive,stated or unstated,permissible or impermissible under federal law.entergy nuclear,d at.the court also pointed to section b b,which calls upon the department to support the vermont legislature by conducting studies on,inter alia,environmental,economic,and public health issues,including issues relating to dry cask storage of nuclear waste and decommissioning options.id.at.in light of the statute required consideration of public health issues,which are not defined elsewhere in the statute,the court then examined the actual legislative purpose leading to the passage of act.id.finding the stated legislative policy and purposes offered by vermont for act to be unpersuasive,the court conducted an extensive review of the act legislative history,including statements made by legislators and state regulators during both committee hearings and on the floor.see id.at.on the basis of this review,the court held that there was overwhelming evidence in the legislative record that act was grounded in radiological safety concerns and the concomitant desire to empower the legislature to act on those concerns in deciding the question of vermont yankee continued operation.id.at.the court concluded that act was thus preempted on its face by the atomic energy act under the standards articulated by the supreme court in pacific gas electric state energy resources conservation development commission,d pacific gas.
the district court performed the same analysis of act.the court reasoned that by not permitting entergy to store spent nuclear fuel generated after march,in vermont,absent affirmative action by the general assembly,section c effectively permits the general assembly to fail to act on a pending petition to store spent fuel for radiological safety reasons,in a manner that evades review.entergy nuclear,d at.the court conducted another extensive analysis of the legislative history behind act,and determined that act was enacted with radiological safety purposes in mind,and that by giving the general assembly the unreviewable power to prohibit storage of fuel,and therefore to prohibit continued operation for preempted radiological safety reasons,act was facially preempted under the atomic energy act.id.at.
as to entergy preemption challenge to the ppa under the federal power act,the district court considered the scope of ferc authority under the act and the doctrine,which holds that state courts and regulatory agencies are preempted by federal law from requiring the payment of rates other than the federal filed rate.id.at.the district court noted that vermont yankee has been operating under a tariff filed with ferc,which only requires that the seller of power enter into freely negotiated contracts with purchasers,as opposed to setting a prescribed rate.id.at quoting morgan stanley capital,pub.util.dist.of snohomish,d emphasis in entergy nuclear internal quotation marks omitted.the court then held that even if entergy were to be forced to enter into a new ppa in violation of the tariff,its recourse would be to have the agreement reviewed by ferc.id.at.however,the court concluded that it is not clear what preemptive effect the federal power act has to prevent vermont from refusing to consider continued operation without such an agreement,as there would be no such agreement to review.id.the court thus declined to enjoin the defendants on the basis of entergy federal power act claim.
lastly,the district court found merit in entergy claim that vermont had conditioned approval of a cpg for continued operation on the existence of a power purchase agreement at market rates in violation of the dormant commerce clause.id.at.the court concluded that an injunction was an appropriate remedy in this case,even though no new ppa past march,had yet been issued,because there was evidence of intent to condition continued operation on the demonstration of some marked economic benefit,in the form of power purchase agreements for vermont utilities.id.at.the court made this finding by examining the materials submitted and testimony of the representatives of the department in proceedings before the board,as well as the statements of state legislators,to find impermissible intent on the part of the defendants.id.at.on this basis,the court issued an injunction enjoin ing defendants from conditioning vermont yankee continued operation on the existence of a ppa with vermont utilities.id.at.
in sum,the district court permanently enjoined vermont from taking any action to shut down vermont yankee after march,pursuant to act or pursuant to section c of title,as enacted in act.id.at.it also permanently enjoined vermont from conditioning the issuance of a cpg on the execution of a favorable power purchase agreement.id.after the district court rendered its decision,vermont suggested in a statement dated february,that it still had authority over vermont yankee storage of spent nuclear fuel pursuant to section c of title of the vermont statutes.ecf.on march,the district court entered an injunction enjoining vermont from seeking to shut down vermont yankee on the basis of this statute as well.ecf.
vermont appeals the district court determinations with respect to entergy challenges to acts and under the atomic energy act and entergy claim under the dormant commerce clause.entergy the district court determination that its preemption challenge under the federal power act is premature.neither party appeals the district court determination that the challenge to act is moot because the safety assessments mandated by act had been completed by the time of trial.

ii.analysis 
atomic energy act preemption claima.preemption principles 
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.in determining whether preemption exists,we must start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.wyeth levine,d internal quotation marks omitted.this assumption provides assurance that the balance will not be disturbed unintentionally by congress or unnecessarily by the courts.jones rath packing,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.o ur task is to ascertain congress intent in enacting the federal statute at issue.shaw delta air lines,d.the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone.allis chalmers lueck,d internal quotation marks omitted.
there are several forms of preemption.the most obvious is where congress expressly states that it is preempting state authority.cnty.of suffolk long island lighting,cir citing jones,at.preemption may also occur where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.lime avocado growers,paul,d,or where state law impedes the execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hines davidowitz.in the absence of such explicit or functionally overt preemption,congress intent to supersede state law may be found from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.cnty.of sufolk,at quoting rice santa fe elevator.in this latter context,federal law occupies an entire field of regulation.wachovia bank,burke,cir.
a.the atomic energy act and pacific gas 
the domestic nuclear power industry had its genesis in the atomic energy act of,in which congress contemplated that the development of nuclear power would be a government monopoly.duke power carolina envtl.study,d.this view changed with the passage of the atomic energy act of,which stemmed from congress belief that the national interest would be served if the government encouraged the private sector to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes under a program of federal regulation and licensing.english electric,d.the act implemented this policy decision by providing for licensing of private construction,ownership,and operation of commercial nuclear power reactors.pacific gas,at.the atomic energy commission,the predecessor to the nrc,was given exclusive jurisdiction to license the transfer,delivery,receipt,acquisition,possession and use of nuclear materials.upon these subjects,no role was left for the states.id.internal citations omitted.congress decision to prohibit the states from regulating the safety aspects of nuclear development was premised on its belief that the atomic energy commission was more qualified to determine what type of safety standards should be enacted in this complex area.silkwood kerr mcgee,d.indeed,the congressional findings supporting the atomic energy act affirm that the processing and utilization of source,byproduct,and special nuclear material must be regulated in the national interest,and that the regulation of such materials by the united states is necessary in the national interest to assure the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public.c e.radiological safety therefore represents an arena of field preemption that congress,acting within its proper authority,has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance,thus precluding any regulation by the states.arizona united states,d see also skull valley band of goshute indians nielson,cir s tate laws within the entire field of nuclear safety concerns are preempted,even if they do not directly conflict with federal law.quoting pacific gas,at.
nonetheless,t here is little doubt that under the atomic energy act of,state public utility commissions or similar bodies are empowered to make the initial decision regarding the need for power.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.the atomic energy act also contains two savings clauses reserving certain regulatory powers not related to nuclear safety to the states.the first clause states that the atomic energy act does not limit state authority regarding regulation of the generation,sale,or transmission of electric power produced through the use of nuclear facilities licensed by the commission.the second clause provides that the atomic energy act shall not be construed to affect the authority of any state or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.id.k.
it was against this background that the supreme court issued its decision in pacific gas,which concerned whether the atomic energy act preempted a california state statute,the warren alquist state energy resources conservation and development act the warren alquist act.at.under the warren alquist act,a utility seeking to build a new nuclear power plant in california was first required to obtain permission from the california state energy resources and conservation commission the state energy commission.id.section of the warren alquist act imposed a moratorium on the construction of new power plants until the state energy commission determined that a viable spent nuclear fuel disposal method had been developed.id.at.the state energy commission was also required to report this determination to the california legislature,which could override it.id.at.the supreme court noted that laws similar to the warren alquist act had been enacted in response to two emerging societal concerns about nuclear waste management 
f irst,if not properly stored,nuclear wastes might leak and endanger both the environment and human health second,the lack of a disposal option increases the risk that the insufficiency of interim storage space for spent fuel will lead to,rendering nuclear energy an unpredictable and uneconomical adventure.
the court then considered whether the warren alquist act was preempted because it regulates construction of nuclear plants and because it is allegedly predicated on safety concerns.id.at.the court reviewed the legislative history of the atomic energy act and concluded that while the federal government maintains complete control of the safety and nuclear aspects of energy generation,the states exercise their traditional authority over the need for additional generating capacity,the type of generating facilities to be licensed,land use,ratemaking,and the like.id.at.examples of sole federal authority include the construction and operation of any production or utilization facility,and the disposal of byproduct,source or special nuclear material because of the hazards or potential hazards thereof.id.at quoting c.however,states retain authority over the economic question of whether a particular plant should be built indeed,utility financial qualifications are only of concern to the nrc if related to public health and safety.id.at.examples of exclusive state authority therefore include ratemaking and questions.id.at.
the court then examined the purposes underlying section,emphasizing that a state statute that seeks to regulate the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant even if enacted out of concerns,would nevertheless directly conflict with the nrc exclusive authority over plant construction and operation.id.at.the court focused on the state legislative committee report that accompanied section,which articulated a purely economic rationale for the bill.the committee report noted that in the absence of a federally approved method of waste disposal,a clog in the nuclear fuel cycle would emerge because s torage space was limited while more nuclear wastes were continuously produced.id.at.this scenario could lead to unpredictably high costs to contain the problem or,worse,shutdowns in reactors.id.at.because section was concerned not with the adequacy of the method of spent nuclear fuel storage,but rather its existence,the court concluded that it was not preempted by the atomic energy act.id.at quoting pac.legal found.state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,cir.
a.the evolution of the wholesale energy market after pacific gas 
critical to appreciating the supreme court concern in pacific gas about the prospect of state responsibility for rising nuclear energy costs is an understanding of the structure of the retail energy market in the and.in that era,electric utilities were typically vertically integrated entities that sold the power they generated directly to retail consumers.state regulatory agencies would focus on the retail rates charged directly to the public.pub.util.dist.of snohomish cnty.ferc,cir pud,vacated on other grounds,cir.these state agencies would determine the rates at which power could be sold by the electric utility to ensure that such rates were reasonable.see,consol.edison of,pataki,cir.federal agencies,on the other hand,would regulate the wholesale rates charged among businesses involved in providing power.pud,at internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,prior to the,the dominance of retail utilities ensured that transactions on wholesale markets were relatively few.david spence robert prentice,the transformation of american energy markets and the problem of market power.

the national marketplace for power began to evolve in the late.first,congress passed the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa,et,which sought to promote the development of new generating facilities and to conserve the use of fossil fuels.new york,at.to do so,purpa directed ferc to promulgate rules requiring utilities to purchase electricity from qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.id.quoting ferc mississippi,d.even more significant,congress enacted the energy policy act of,which authorized ferc to order individual utilities to provide transmission services to unaffiliated wholesale generators,to wheel power on a basis.id.citing.ferc exercised this authority in by promulgating orders and,which require all public utilities owning controlling transmission facilities to offer open access transmission service.transmission access policy study grp.ferc,per curiam,aff sub,new york,d 
by the late,the structure of the power industry had changed dramatically.many integrated utilities had divested their generating assets,and new participants entered the market in the form of both independent and affiliated power marketers and generators as well as independent power exchanges.regional transmission organizations,order,at.many formerly retail utilities became independent merchant generators,selling the power they generated wholesale across state lines.the emergence of merchant generators placed a significant strain on existing power grids.in response,ferc sought to organize owners of transmission lines into independent system operators isos and regional transmission organizations rtos to help manage the grid,ensure system reliability,and guard against discrimination and the exercise of market power in the provision of transmission services.spence prentice,supra,at.these isos and rtos gave rise to several large regional electricity trading hubs,including the california iso,the pennsylvania new jersey maryland pjm iso,the new york iso,the electric reliability council of texas ercot iso,and iso new england 
the development of merchant generators had two effects on the marketplace for power that are relevant here.first,consumers gained access to new sources of power,which meant that they were no longer captive to a single provider.see transmission access,at.correspondingly,l ocal energy utilities,could,rather than producing their own power to sell to the public,choose between various competing producers and then transfer the expected savings from this competition to the public.pud,at.the development of large regional power grids gave consumers access to power generated by merchant generators.as the supreme court has noted,it is now possible for a customer in vermont to purchase electricity from an environmentally friendly power producer in california or a cogeneration facility in oklahoma.new york,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,vermont yankee presently supplies only of the power consumed by vermont residents the rest is purchased by vermont electrical companies from other sources.see in re entergy nuclear.yankee,llc,wl,at.second,because states may obtain power from energy plants located in other states,there is less public support for continued operation of nuclear power plants and greater opposition to such local plants on safety as well as grounds 
with the advent of merchant generators,the challenge of identifying a spent nuclear fuel storage solution has grown even more pressing.after a useful life of years,spent nuclear fuel rods are thermally hot when removed from reactors and emit substantial amounts of radiation.new york nrc,citing blue ribbon commission on america nuclear future,report to the secretary of energy.the rods are transferred to deep,pools for cooling they may then be transferred to large concrete and steel casks for storage,even though they will continue to emit dangerous radiation for time spans seemingly beyond human comprehension.id.quoting nuclear energy,epa,per curiam.nonetheless,despite the continued production of nuclear waste,and despite years of blue ribbon commissions,congressional hearings,agency reports,and site investigations,the united states has not yet developed a permanent solution.id.most recently,plans to develop a storage site at yucca mountain in nevada were abandoned when the department of energy withdrew its license application for the facility.see ass of regulatory util.comm rs dep t of energy.at this time,there is not even a prospective site for a repository,let alone progress toward the actual construction of one.new york nrc,at.
with this general background in mind,we begin our preemption analysis of act,the most recent of vermont legislative enactments at issue the proper place to begin the analysis of a statute is its text.see,united states am.trucking ass ns.there is,of course,no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.as described previously,act adds three new sections to the vermont statutes sections e,m,and of title.section e requires the vermont legislature to determine whether an extension of the vermont yankee operating lease should be granted that is,to determine whether the lease advances the general welfare before the board can issue a new cpg.stat.ann.tit,e.section m requires that the evaluation of a new cpg be conducted using current assumptions,rather than those that informed the issuance of the previous cpg.id.m.section requires that an application to operate vermont yankee past march,be submitted at least four years in advance,and that the department engage in extensive to support the legislative determination that the lease advances the general welfare.id.a.the statute requires that the department identify,collect information on,and provide analysis of environmental,economic,and public health issues,including issues relating to dry cask storage of nuclear waste and decommissioning options.id.b b emphasis added.these are factors that the board shall consider in acting on a petition subject to the statute,id.b c,and the board conclusions are reported to the vermont legislature to inform its own determination regarding the status of vermont yankee,id.a.
as an initial matter,we must consider whether it is appropriate to consider a facial challenge to act.in this regard,we find it important that act,through the operation of section e,transfers the process for determining whether to approve a new operating license for vermont yankee from the board to the vermont legislature.before the passage of act,the board decision regarding whether to approve the continued operation of vermont yankee would have been subject to review by the vermont supreme court.stat.ann.tit.such a review likely would have encompassed legal questions regarding whether act was preempted by federal law.see,petition of.cogeneration.after the passage of act,if the vermont legislature chose not to act,the operating license for vermont yankee would lapse on march,and that decision would not be subject to judicial review.see bd.of educ.of kiryas joel vill.sch.dist.grumet,d u nlike an administrative agency denial of an exemption from a generally applicable law,which would be entitled to a judicial audience,a legislature failure to enact a special law is itself unreviewable.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
because a state moratorium on the operation of vermont yankee grounded in safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field,pacific gas,at,a law enacted for that purpose would facially lack any plainly legitimate sweep.state grange.state republican party,d internal quotation marks omitted.we also note several other reasons why it is appropriate to consider entergy facial challenge to the validity of act.first,because of the extensive legislative record accompanying act and the detailed inquiry conducted by the district court below,it is not the case that the court today is premature in interpreting act on the basis of a factually barebones record.citizens united fec,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.second,because act shifts the decision regarding whether to approve the operation of vermont yankee into the unreviewable province of the vermont legislature failure to enact a special law,grumet,at,we will not otherwise have any occasion to construe the law in the context of actual disputes.state grange,at.lastly,we believe that the issues before the court are concrete and sharply presented so as to permit meaningful review.dickerson napolitano,cir quoting thibodeau portuondo,cir.it is therefore necessary to determine whether there is a rationale for act by considering whether the decision to effectively shut down vermont yankee serves the policy interests articulated in the statute.pacific gas,at.
the legislative policy and purpose section of act sets forth several rationales for the statute.section a states that a nuclear energy generating plant may be operated in vermont only with the explicit approval of the general assembly expressed in law,and that legislative approval requires a public deliberation of such factors as the state need for power,the economics and environmental impacts of storage of nuclear waste,and choice of power sources among various alternatives.act a.the statute later states that the issue of spent fuel storage should be framed as 
a part of the larger societal discussion of broader economic and environmental issues relating to the operation of a nuclear facility in the state,including an assessment of the potential need for the operation of the facility and its economic benefits,risks,and costs and in order to allow opportunity to assess alternatives that may be more or that otherwise may better promote the general welfare.
id.d.drawing on the language in sections a and d,vermont argues that act advances two policy interests increased use of a diverse array of renewable power sources and promotion of energy sources that are more.
although vermont asserted policy interests would not necessarily interfere with the preempted concern of radiological safety,our inquiry does not end at the text of the statute.
we do not blindly accept the articulated purpose of a state statute for preemption purposes.if that were the rule,legislatures could nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation by simply publishing a legislative committee report articulating some state interest or policy other than frustration of the federal objective that would be tangentially furthered by the proposed state law.

as to the goal of diversifying the state means of producing power,vermont argues that the presence of vermont yankee hamper s efforts at diversification and has a dampening effect on the development of alternatives.citing the testimony of the state former director of regulated utility planning,vermont argues that closing vermont yankee would free up space in the electrical generation market and make it easier to promote diversity and sustainable resources.vermont also quotes a former maine state power regulator and nrc commissioner,who testified before the district court that the state has a legitimate interest in energy planning and promoting renewables and argued that any sensible energy planner would be anticipating a time when vermont would be without vermont yankee.
however,this argument presupposes that vermont retail utilities lack choices with respect to the sources of the energy they purchase.s tates have broad powers under state law to direct the planning and resource decisions of utilities under their jurisdiction.states may,for example,order utilities to build renewable generators themselves,or order utilities to purchase renewable generation.cal.edison.san diego gas,ferc,at june.vermont yankee provides only one third of the power consumed in the state,so it is clear that the vermont legislature can direct retail utilities to purchase electricity from an environmentally friendly power producer in california or a cogeneration facility in oklahoma,if it so chooses.new york,at internal quotation marks omitted.vermont can also direct or encourage its utilities to purchase power from nuclear power plants located.indeed,vermont recently pursued this exact approach by approving a petition to allow its retail utilities to purchase power from the seabrook station nuclear power plant in new hampshire,a merchant generator like vermont yankee.in re green mountain power,docket,wl,at.closing vermont yankee would thus have little effect on the actual array of energy sources from which vermont utilities can purchase power 
as to the second goal of containing costs,vermont argues that the economic rationale relied on by the pacific gas court applies with equal force here.vermont suggests that shutting down vermont yankee might assist the state in identifying alternatives that may be more.however,this argument is also not persuasive in light of vermont yankee status as a merchant generator.increases in the prices vermont yankee charges for its power would not be borne directly by a captive audience of retail consumers,as was the case for california residents in pacific gas.instead,vermont yankee is a merchant generator,which means that it sells power on the open wholesale market.envtl.law policy ctr.nrc,cir.for that reason,local energy utilities could simply choose between various competing producers and purchase power from the more provider.see pud,at.closing vermont yankee would not affect the availability of other sources of power from which local retail utilities could purchase power that might be more indeed,they are free to do so now 
vermont second economic argument regarding the state potential future liability for decommissioning costs is also of little weight.vermont contends that the recent collapse of the plan to construct a spent nuclear fuel storage facility in yucca mountain means that i f plant operators such as entergy become insolvent or abandon their obligations,the financial burdens will fall on host states.however,i n,the nuclear regulatory commission adopted a final rule requiring operators of nuclear facilities to file decommissioning plans,and to decommissioning by placing money aside in an external sinking fund.pub.power dist.midamerican energy,cir citing nuclear regulatory commission final rule,general requirements for decommissioning nuclear facilities.june,codified at.by regulation,decommissioning funds may not be used for related expenses,such as spent nuclear fuel storage.bos.edison united states,rev on other grounds.nuclear power plants must provide periodic reports to the nrc concerning the status of such funds for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance that funds will be available for the decommissioning process.a 
we must also look to the statute legislative history to determine if it was passed with an impermissible motive.vermont argues that pacific gas forecloses the use of legislative history to analyze a state statute for atomic energy act preemption,noting the court dictum describing inquiry into legislative motive as often an unsatisfactory venture.at.in analyzing the purpose of the warren alquist act,however,the court looked to a report issued by the state legislative committee that presented the bill.id.at.moreover,in a subsequent decision,the court interpreted pacific gas to hold that a state moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field.english,at quoting pacific gas,at.in other words,the court defined the preempted field,in part,by reference to the motivation behind the state law.id.emphasis added see also gade,at we can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration of the federal regulatory scheme.quoting perez campbell,d emphasis added.indeed,several other courts applying pacific gas have endorsed the use of legislative history to determine whether the atomic energy act preempts a particular state statute or local ordinance.see,skull valley,at long island lighting cnty.of suffolk,see also loyal tire auto,town of woodbury,cir sotomayor,holding,in the context of interstate commerce act preemption,that a court must consider any specific expressions of legislative intent in the statute itself as well as the legislative history greater,at examining legislative history to determine whether a new york city local law was preempted by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act.we therefore believe that legislative history is an important source for determining whether a particular statute was motivated by an impermissible motive in the preemption context 
vermont argues that the task of determining the legislative intent behind act is particularly difficult in this case because the vermont legislature,as a citizen body,does not produce formal committee reports like those congress prepares,and it has no requirement to preserve complete records of its proceedings.in addition,c ommittee hearings are generally recorded,but are not contemporaneously transcribed,and often do not identify the speaker.floor debates are usually recorded in the senate,but not in the house of representatives.for this reason,vermont argues that much of the legislative history behind act is missing or incomplete.
acknowledging these conditions does not change the fact that a court primary purpose in statutory interpretation is to discern legislative intent.morgan gay,cir although the lack of systemized may make our task more challenging,the informality of the proceedings of the vermont legislature and the state decision to not document its legislative history do not immunize act from judicial inquiry into legislative motivation.blanton city of murfreesboro,cir while we recognize today that the use of legislative history,much of which is not recorded until after the final congressional action,in trying to understand the intent of congress,is not as meaningful as it once was,we find ourselves with no other means of determining the intent of congress in enacting this legislation.
we agree with the district court careful analysis of the legislative intent motivating vermont enactment of act insofar as the district court identified radiological safety as the vermont legislature primary purpose in enacting the statute the district court concluded that the legislative record contained references,almost too numerous to count,that reveal legislators radiological safety motivations and reflect their wish to empower the legislature to address their constituents fear of radiological risk,and the legislators beliefs that the plant was too unsafe to operate,in deciding a petition for continued operation.entergy nuclear,d at.we need not repeat the entirety of the district court examination,which included considering many hours of audiotapes of floor debates and committee meetings for which written transcriptions are not typically maintained,except to note the remarkable consistency with which both state legislators and regulators expressed concern about radiological safety and expressed a desire to evade federal preemption.see disabled in action of metro.hammons,cir noting that the manager statement and floor and hearing colloquy are among the most authoritative and reliable materials of legislative history.
the vermont senate finance committee conducted its first hearings on the bill that would ultimately become act only days after entergy filed its application with the nrc for an extension of its operating license for vermont yankee past.during those first hearings,the committee chair and the chairman of the board engaged in an extended colloquy regarding the permissible legislative purposes for the bill,with particular emphasis on pacific gas and its roadmap for appropriate state legislative regulation of nuclear facilities.after being informed that regulation based on radiological safety was preempted and impermissible,the committee chair responded,okay,let find another word for safety,an approach also adopted by the board chairman.a state legislator participating in the hearing responded to testimony from a law professor regarding the permissible scope of the bill by stating,i understand that only the feds are allowed to think of safety issues,and we carefully do use that word here.another member of the finance committee expressed concern that all of our work will get overturned by the feds because it based on safety that all it going to be based on.a third member of the committee asserted that the federal government likely would not be able to transport vermont yankee spent nuclear fuel out of the state,and then asked rhetorically,d o we want another years worth of radioactive materials sitting somewhere in this state i think the people are getting a little concerned and obviously the closer you live to that radioactivity,the more concerned you are.that same senator also referenced the incidents at three mile island and chernobyl,and stated that the potential for a similar disaster was sufficiently serious that the legislature felt that the bill presented a public policy decision that they needed to make.the committee also considered testimony from the vermont legislature chief legislative counsel and a department representative concerning ways of writing the bill so as to avoid overt references to radiological safety.
the record also indicates that during hearings on the bill that would become act,members of the department,regulators,and vermont legislators repeatedly demonstrated awareness of the potential for a preemption problem and disguised their comments accordingly.for example,during a hearing of the senate finance committee on the bill that would become act,a member of the vermont state nuclear advisory panel told the committee chair that the board is not allowed to think about safety,as you know,but then proceeded to opine on various safety risks.the committee chair then admonished the panel member to speak purely about economic risks,which led that individual to suggest that a safety problem has economic implications,too.the committee also heard testimony from a professor at a local law school and former chairman of the board,who warned the committee that because the state is preempted in its concerns about radiological safety,the state has to make its decision on other grounds,which would include anything from aesthetics to the obvious ones about financial implication to such things as reliability of the electric grid.during a subsequent exchange,the current chairman of the board instructed the committee on whether and in what circumstances it could talk about public health.a member of the department then recommended that some alternative language be placed into the bill so as to avoid the issues referenced by the chairman of the board.these are not merely isolated comments by a few legislators,but rather a part of a consistent effort by those responsible for drafting and passing act to obfuscate the record through the use of misleading statements that they thought would pass muster under pacific gas.we conclude that the district court carefully,fairly,and properly analyzed the legislative intent undergirding act and found that it demonstrated an impermissible primary purpose on the part of the vermont legislature 
in concluding that the vermont legislature was improperly motivated by concerns relating to radiological safety in enacting act,we recognize that many legislators were likely acting with some concerns in mind as well.what motivates one legislator to vote for a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.pacific gas,at.we also acknowledge that the mere transfer of authority from a state administrative board to the legislature does not require a finding of preemption.we further recognize that the extent to which a state legislature permissible concerns outweigh its impermissible motive in passing a statute is not an issue that the pacific gas court elucidated with great clarity.compare id.at a state prohibition on nuclear construction for safety reasons would also be in the teeth of the atomic energy act objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use and would be preempted for that reason.emphasis added,with id.i t is necessary to determine whether there is a rationale for the warren alquist act.emphasis added.nonetheless,our task is not t o look for the sole purpose of the vermont legislature that exercise would require us probably to look for something that does not exist.edwards aguillard,d scalia,dissenting.our task is to determine whether the vermont legislature decision to pass act was grounded in radiological safety concerns.pacific gas,at.a record as consistent and replete with references to radiological safety as that here meets any conceivable standard for the allowable threshold level of impermissible concerns under pacific gas.as such,we affirm the district court determination that act is preempted on its face by the atomic energy act.
we likewise affirm the district court grant of a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing act.a plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate 
that it has suffered an irreparable injury that remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury that,considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant,a remedy in equity is warranted and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.
monsanto geertson seed farms,d quoting ebay,mercexchange,d.each of these four factors is clearly satisfied here.first,entergy would suffer an irreparable injury if the defendants were able to enforce act and shut down vermont yankee.see tom doherty,saban entm t,cir finding irreparable harm in part because the right to continue a business is not measurable entirely in monetary terms quoting semmes motors,ford motor,cir.second,entergy would be unable to recover monetary damages from vermont because of the eleventh amendment.see united states state of,cir per curiam.third,the balance of hardships favors entergy because it would suffer irreparable losses from vermont yankee being shut down while act would not meaningfully advance the rationales offered by vermont.lastly,the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction,because vermont would be able to continue purchasing the power generated by vermont yankee while still diversifying its energy base and purchasing power from more sources if it so chooses.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in granting the permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing act.
as with act,our analysis of act begins with the text of the statute.act adds three sections to title of the vermont statutes sections,and.as discussed above,section summarizes the stated legislative findings.stat.ann.tit.section requires that the board make certain findings before issuing a cpg allowing an expansion of the spent nuclear fuel storage facility beyond the capacity previously authorized,and for any such expansion after the expiration of the cpg on march,the affirmative approval of the vermont legislature is required.id.c,c.section establishes a clean energy development fund into which,pursuant to the mou entered into between entergy and the department,entergy would make payments for the purpose of promoting and environmentally sustainable power for the benefit of vermont electric consumers.id.current version at.stat.ann.tit.
act also incorporates the mou,which imposes on entergy a variety of requirements related to radiological safety.these requirements include rules regarding the placement and configuration of facilities that exceed the licensing standards required by the nrc the spacing of casks temperature and radiation monitoring with concomitant reporting requirements to the department and the density of pools.mou at.the mou also prohibits the storage of waste generated outside vermont on site,and requires entergy to use its best efforts to move the spent nuclear fuel generated by vermont yankee to a permanent location outside the state as soon as possible.id.at.
lastly,much like act,section allows the vermont legislature to terminate the operation of vermont yankee after march,by refusing to act affirmatively.this effectively codifies the vermont attorney general opinion that section,which had previously exempted vermont yankee from the provision requiring legislative approval of new dry cask storage facilities codified at section a,did not apply to entergy.as a result,the decision regarding whether to permit entergy to build additional spent nuclear fuel storage facilities was vested in the vermont legislature.unlike a decision of the board,which would be subject to review by the vermont supreme court,the vermont legislature decision not to authorize the construction of new storage facilities even those already approved by the nrc,as in this case would be unreviewable.
the reasons for the statute articulated in act legislative findings section mirror many of those offered in the preamble to act.for instance,section expresses the state goal of making its future power supply diverse,reliable,economically sound,and environmentally sustainable.stat.ann.tit.the statute also emphasizes the state need to make a smooth transition to the future,which requires accelerating vermont investment in electricity resources that are economically and environmentally sound and that can be acquired in modest increments.id.to make this transition,the statute states,there is a great value in investing in renewable energy sources,efficient,combined heat and power facilities,and energy efficiency.id.
these statements of legislative purpose reflect the two policy interests vermont argues are advanced by act increased use of a diverse array of renewable power sources and promotion of energy sources that are more.for the reasons discussed above,we believe that neither of these interests is plausibly served by act conferring unreviewable power over the continued operation of vermont yankee past march,on the vermont legislature.in addition,the regulations relating to radiological safety incorporated into act from the mou demonstrate that the vermont legislature primary motivation in enacting act relates to neither diversifying the state power supply nor reducing costs.we therefore turn to the legislative history behind act to determine the actual intent motivating its passage.
as with act,we find that the district court comprehensive review of the legislative history demonstrates convincingly that act was motivated by impermissible concerns about the radiological safety of spent nuclear fuel storage.we note again the frequency with which concerns about radiological safety appear in the legislative record in senate committee meetings and floor debates from legislators and regulators,notwithstanding obvious and frequent attempts to avoid specific mention of safety concerns and of deference to pacific gas.in hearings of the house natural resources committee considering the bill that would become act,for example,representatives asked numerous questions about the relative safety of spent nuclear fuel storage methods entergy was considering and heard testimony questioning the competence of the nrc to evaluate safety.one witness described the legislative problem that we dealing with here is that a lot of the concerns that citizens have are concerns that you ca address directly the way they want them to be addressed.several representatives asked questions about the dangers posed by an accidental release of radioactive waste.one member of the committee admonished another for referring to radiological safety,stating,but we ca say that,anything about safety.it can only be about economics and aesthetics.a member of the department expressed the same sentiment and advised a representative to frame his questions about the value of maintaining vermont yankee as an aesthetic issue,rather than one concerned with safety.in a concluding committee meeting on the bill,one representative praised the committee work to ensure that the findings have been emasculated and sanitized,noting that the bill no longer makes any mention of nuclear waste or the fact that nuclear waste lasts,it dangerous for years.during the subsequent floor debate on act,one senator stated candidly,none of us wants to have nuclear waste stored on the soil of vermont the reality is that vermont yankee will require some temporary storage in order to e nsure safety for our environment.other speeches adverted to the problem of storing radioactive nuclear waste in vermont while the federal government worked on developing a storage facility,and to the need to ensure that the method of waste storage employed by vermont yankee was safe.as with our analysis of act,the deficiencies in the of vermont legislative history,as well as the obvious coaching of vermont legislators to avoid explicit statements about nuclear safety,make our task in determining the principal purpose of act more difficult.nonetheless,this does not make our task less important,and the volume,frequency,and content of the legislators comments show clearly that their actions were motivated by preempted safety concerns.
the record also contains several statements by state legislators about the value of assigning their concerns regarding radiological safety to the mou,which required entergy to take several actions specifically addressing radiological safety.in re entergy nuclear.yankee,llc,wl,at during a meeting of the senate natural resources committee,for example,the state legislative council remarked that an earlier draft of act contained a laundry list of issues that are now covered by the mou.a member of the department testified that the federal government takes jurisdiction over any radiological safety and health.and so anything that touched on that,it better to have in an agreed upon mou than to have in the bill itself.other legislators echoed this sentiment at several other junctures.on the senate floor,one senator stated explicitly that a favorable aspect of act was that it left regulations relating to radiological safety to the mou entered into by entergy and the department,which,the senator believed,could save act from a preemption challenge indeed,the mou endorsed by act includes a provision under which entergy waived any right to bring a preemption challenge to the board authority to regulate vermont yankee,which clearly demonstrates the concern of the vermont legislature and the board as to whether their actions would withstand scrutiny under the atomic energy act and pacific gas 
these statements demonstrate the vermont legislature impermissible motive in passing act namely,to shut down vermont yankee based on concerns of radiological safety while attempting to avoid a preemption challenge under pacific gas.vermont legislators and regulators attempted to achieve this objective by shifting provisions regarding radiological safety into the mou and by creating an unreviewable mechanism by which the construction of new spent nuclear fuel storage facilities based on safety concerns would not be authorized.this is a legislative approach that pacific gas does not permit.we therefore also affirm the district court judgment that sections c and c of title of the vermont statutes,as enacted by act,are preempted on their face by the atomic energy act.for the reasons discussed above regarding act,we also affirm the district court grant of a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing sections c or c of the vermont statutes.
in conducting this analysis of acts and and their adoption,we are mindful of the traditional presumption against preemption with respect to areas where states have historically exercised their police powers.smsa,at.vermont would have us conclude that acts and are merely process statutes that simply reallocate the responsibility for approving the continued operation of vermont yankee from an administrative agency to the state legislature.indeed,justice brandeis once observed that the franchise to operate a public utility is a special privilege which may be granted or withheld at the pleasure of the state.frost.comm n.brandeis,dissenting.vermont further contends that it enacted acts and on several bases,such as diversifying the state power supply and controlling economic costs,that,if true,would surely be permissible reasons to deny the construction of a nuclear power plant.see pacific gas,at.however,the supreme court has instructed us that the regulation of nuclear power is different from the areas where states have historically exercised their police powers.smsa,at.the federal government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns,except the limited powers expressly ceded to the states.silkwood,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.we have conducted a review that reflects the supreme court specific directive that a state judgment that nuclear power is not safe enough to be further developed would conflict directly with the countervailing judgment of the nrc and would be preempted for that reason.pacific gas,at.we conclude that vermont legislators and regulators have undertaken a sustained effort to shut down vermont yankee based on this impermissible reason.
we have considered the legislative history behind acts and undertaken in large part through the district court exhaustive examination of audiotape recordings and found that it contains innumerable expressions of concern for radiological safety from vermont legislators and regulators we have taken note of the fact that the vermont legislature began considering the bill that would become act requiring entergy to seek legislative approval to operate vermont yankee past only one week after entergy applied to the nrc for an extension of its operating license.we have observed that witnesses at committee meetings,legislators,executive officials,and regulators were obviously coached to avoid making references to radiological safety to navigate the shoals of pacific gas.we have sought to reconcile the rationales proffered by the vermont legislature for acts and with those acts operative effects and found them to be untethered from vermont yankee status as a merchant generator and from the oversight already provided by the nrc.we have noted vermont efforts to evade court review by shunting requirements that concern radiological safety to mous,which in turn contain provisions requiring entergy to waive its right to bring a preemption challenge in court.we have concluded that vermont shifted responsibility for approving the continued operation of vermont yankee from the board,whose decisions were subject to review by the vermont supreme court,to the vermont legislature,where no judicial review of its action or inaction would be available.providing an inadequate and misleading legislative record,failing to provide plausible legislative rationales,and imposing impermissible obligations through memoranda of understanding,do not and can not shield acts and from this court review.
we do not question the legitimacy or sincerity of those vermont residents and officials who have concerns about vermont yankee,but vermont has other avenues available to air its concerns.for example,the atomic energy act mandates that the nrc hold hearings if requested by any person whose interest may be affected when taking certain actions relating to the licensing of a nuclear power plant.see brodsky nuclear regulatory comm n,cir quoting a a.the nrc has also promulgated regulations requiring a public period before amending any aspect of a nuclear power plant operating license.see.lastly,the federal courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate appeals from all final orders of the nrc made reviewable by section of title.riverkeeper,collins,cir quoting.such reviewable final orders include all final orders in licensing proceedings whether or not a hearing before the nrc occurred or could have occurred.id.quoting.power light lorion,d.vermont and its residents are free to pursue any of these routes to express their concerns regarding the potential public safety hazards posed by vermont yankee.the legislation passed here,however,was not the way to resolve those concerns.
as the supreme court has held,the one avenue vermont may not pursue is to pass a state moratorium on nuclear energy grounded in safety concerns.pacific gas,at.for this reason,we hold that sections c and c of title of the vermont statutes and act in its entirety are preempted on their face by the atomic energy act we affirm the district court grant of a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing act or section c of title of the vermont statutes,as enacted by act.entergy nuclear,d at.we also affirm the district court subsequent order of march,enjoining the defendants from enforcing section c of title of the vermont statutes.
dormant commerce clause claim 
entergy argues that vermont efforts to condition the approval of a new cpg for vermont yankee on the execution of a new ppa to replace the ppa represents a demand that entergy provide more favorable rates to than retail utilities in contravention of the dormant commerce clause.the district court agreed,after examining materials submitted by the department to the board,statements by state legislators and regulators during committee meetings,and floor debates in the vermont legislature advocating for a new favorable ppa.entergy nuclear,d at.the district court found evidence of intent to condition continued operation of vermont yankee on the demonstration of some marked economic benefit,or incremental value,beyond that reflected in market rates for contracts,in the form of power purchase agreements for vermont utilities.id.at.the district court held that this conduct violated the dormant commerce clause.vermont argues,however,that the district court erred in issuing an injunction on the basis of its finding mere intent on the part of the defendants to seek a favorable ppa,and that the issue was therefore not ripe for judicial review.we agree.
the basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.ripeness encompasses two overlapping doctrines concerning the exercise of federal court jurisdiction.see reno catholic soc,d.the first of these is drawn from article iii limitations on judicial power,and hence goes,in a fundamental way,to the existence of jurisdiction.simmonds ins,cir.the second is a more flexible doctrine of judicial prudence,and constitutes an important exception to the usual rule that where jurisdiction exists a federal court must exercise it.id.in either case,the question of ripeness may be considered on a court own motion.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d.
constitutional ripeness is a doctrine that,like standing,is a limitation on the power of the judiciary.it prevents courts from declaring the meaning of the law in a vacuum and from constructing generalized legal rules unless the resolution of an actual dispute requires it.civil liberties union grandeau,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court held that vermont efforts to secure favorable pricing for its retail utilities violated the prohibition discussed in new england power new hampshire,d,against providing residents an economic benefit not available to customers in other states.entergy nuclear,d at.however,we believe that the district court erred in applying this generalized legal rule in the absence of a ppa.
the dormant commerce clause,a doctrine inferred from the commerce clause of the united states constitution,see const.art.i,cl,is a restriction on permissible state regulation.hughes oklahoma,d.the dormant commerce clause stands for the principle that one state in its dealings with another may not place itself in a position of economic isolation.hood sons,dumond.internal quotation marks omitted.a state law may burden interstate commerce when it has the practical effect of requiring commerce to be conducted at the regulating state direction.am.booksellers found.dean,cir internal quotation marks omitted.when a statute directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a state,it is invalid under the dormant commerce clause because it exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting state authority.healy beer,d.the transmission of electric current from one state to another is interstate commerce subject to the commerce clause.pub.utils.comm of attleboro steam,abrogated on other grounds by quill north dakota ex rel.heitkamp,d.
the district court largely based its conclusion on the supreme court decision in new england power,which considered an order of a new hampshire regulatory commission prohibiting an power plant from exporting some of its output to retail utilities in an effort to reduce prices for consumers.at.the supreme court stated that the commerce clause precludes a state from mandating that its residents be given a preferred right of access,over consumers,to natural resources located within its borders or to the products derived therefrom.id.at.on this basis,the court held that new hampshire exportation ban constituted precisely the sort of protectionist regulation that the commerce clause declares to the states,because it was designed to gain an economic advantage for new hampshire citizens at the expense of the power plant customers in neighboring states.id.at.
the order at issue in new england power did not violate the dormant commerce clause simply because it conferred an economic benefit on new hampshire residents,however.rather,by preventing a power plant from exporting its output to other states,the effect of the order was to overtly block the flow of interstate commerce at a state borders.city of phila.new jersey,d.such laws have the undeniable effect of controlling commercial activity occurring wholly outside the boundary of the state.healy,at.while a state may seek lower prices for its consumers,it may not insist that producers or consumers in other states surrender whatever competitive advantages they may possess.brown forman distillers state liquor,d.although the record shows that vermont was interested in obtaining favorable pricing for the power produced by vermont yankee for vermont retail utilities,it does not show that vermont was also seeking to prevent retail utilities in other states from negotiating favorable rates with entergy as well.spggc,llc blumenthal,cir holding that a statute prohibiting the sale of certain types of gift certificates did not violate the dormant commerce clause because it did not,by its terms or its effects,directly regulate sales of gift cards in other states or prevent other states from regulating gift card sales differently within their own territories.the record also does not demonstrate that vermont sought to impose a prohibition on access to resources,camps,town of harrison,d,by limiting the extent to which vermont yankee could sell power to other states,as was the case in new england power.
at present,in the absence of a completed ppa and without evidence regarding its effect on power consumers,we can not determine whether the ppa vermont has sought will have a direct impact on commerce in other states.we also do not have a factual record concerning incidental effects of such an agreement on interstate commerce and the commensurate benefits of the agreement within vermont.entergy claim can not be characterized as purely legal in that it may be decided without further factual development.gary peake excavating town bd.of town of hancock,cir.this case therefore does not present a concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns of the parties within the meaning of article iii,and is therefore not ripe within the constitutional sense.ehrenfeld mahfouz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
of course,we do not suggest that any ppa providing favorable pricing for vermont residents would pass muster under the dormant commerce clause.a regulation that evinces discriminatory purpose against interstate commerce,or unambiguously discriminates in its effect almost always is invalid per se.brown williamson tobacco pataki,cir quoting mfrs.ass sorrell,cir.for example,an agreement requiring entergy to seek regulatory approval in vermont before undertaking a transaction in another state would likely be per se invalid under the dormant commerce clause.brown forman,at see also baldwin seelig.holding that one state has no power to project its legislation into another state by regulating the price to be paid in that state for products acquired there.it is also likely that vermont could not require entergy to affirm that its prices are no higher than the prices being charged in other states.healy,at.an agreement requiring vermont yankee to allot a certain percentage of it output to satisfy local demand would also likely violate the dormant commerce clause.see new eng.power,at finally,we note that a statute that imposes an incidental burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with the local benefits secured,mfrs.ass n,at,would fail the balancing test articulated by the supreme court in pike bruce church,d 
however,no agreement is before us.accordingly,the analysis required under the dormant commerce clause may not be performed,and so entergy claim is unripe at this time.middle energy,city of new orleans,cir when and how the council exercises its option,if it ever does,are the critical determinants of the propriety of federal court jurisdiction over this matter.until the city council actually votes to exercise the purchase option,we must be careful to avoid imposition under our jurisdiction through obtaining futile or premature interventions,especially in the field of public law.quoting pub.serv.comm of utah wycoff.we therefore vacate the district court grant of a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from conditioning a new cpg for vermont yankee on the execution of a favorable ppa

entergy argues that vermont efforts to obtain a favorable ppa violate the tariff approved by ferc for the new england regional wholesale market.according to entergy,capping the prices it can charge vermont residents would interfere with the rates ferc has approved for the market,and so the ppa is preempted under the doctrine.however,the tariff approved by ferc for vermont yankee states only that entergy may sell electric energy and capacity from time to time at rates,terms and conditions established by agreement with the purchaser all such transactions shall be voluntary.the tariff only other guidance on rates is that a ll sales shall be made at rates established by agreement between the purchaser and entergy nuclear vy.
we agree with the district court determination that this claim is not ripe.in addition to the fact that a new favorable ppa has not yet been executed,entergy has not sought a determination from ferc about whether the terms of such a ppa would violate the tariff because ferc has the exclusive jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale rates or to insure that agreements affecting wholesale rates are reasonable,entergy recourse should be first to ferc to determine whether the ppa if and when executed complies with this standard.see.power light ex rel.moore,d see also in re permian basin area rate cases,d c ourts are without authority to set aside any rate selected by the commission which is within a zone of reasonableness.quoting fed.power comm natural gasi pipeline of.emphasis added pub.util.dist.of snohomish cnty.dynergy power,cir holding that a utility may not seek injunctive relief alleging manipulation of market based tariffs because doing so would encroach upon the substantive provisions of the tariff,an area reserved exclusively to ferc,both to enforce and to seek remedy internal quotation marks omitted cal.pub.utils.comm n,ferc,at the commission authority under the federal power act includes the exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the rates,terms and conditions of sales for resale of electric energy in interstate commerce by public utilities.emphasis added,clarified on reh g,ferc.we therefore agree with the district court that entergy claim under count two is unripe at the present time.entergy nuclear,d at.
