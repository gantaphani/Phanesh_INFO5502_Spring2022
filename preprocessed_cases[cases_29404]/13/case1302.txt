in this case,the new york state restaurant association nysra,a business association of over restaurants,challenges the constitutionality of new york city health code,which requires roughly ten percent of restaurants in new york city,including chains such as mcdonald,burger king and kentucky fried chicken,to post calorie content information on their menus and menu boards.see new york city,health code tit,regulation.nysra contends that regulation is unconstitutional because it is preempted by federal laws,specifically the nutrition labeling and education act of nlea,and infringes on its member restaurants first amendment rights.proceeding pursuant to our jurisdiction under a,we conclude that regulation survives both challenges.as we will explain,the federal statutory scheme regulating labeling and branding of food is a labyrinth and interpreting the statute are a series of agency regulations that sometimes appear to conflict and are difficult to harmonize.it is our view,however,that congress intended to exempt restaurant food from the preemption sections that are necessary to allow food to be sold interstate.in requiring chain restaurants to post calorie information on their menus,new york city merely stepped into a sphere that congress intentionally left open to state and local governments.furthermore,although the restaurants are protected by the constitution when they engage in commercial speech,the first amendment is not violated,where as here,the law in question mandates a simple factual disclosure of caloric information and is reasonably related to new york city goals of combating obesity.
background 
federal statutory scheme the nutrition labeling and education act of 
the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act the fdca,enacted in,generally prohibits misbranding of food.our discussion focuses on two sections of that act q and r which were added in through the passage of the nutrition labeling and education act the nlea,stat.the nlea sought to clarify and to strengthen the food and drug administration legal authority to require nutrition labeling on foods,and to establish the circumstances under which claims may be made about nutrients in foods,at,reprinted in,
sections q and r and their related preemption provisions,sections a and a,are the statutory bases from which the preemption questions in this case stem.section q,entitled n utrition information,addresses mandatory information on nutrients,and requires that basic nutrition facts be disclosed for most foods.the general public is with this provision through the nutrition facts panel on packaged foods that informs buyers of the the total number of calories per serving,along with the quantities of various nutrients contained in the foods.q restaurants,nysra membership,are exempt from section q mandatory nutrition information labeling requirements they do not have to attach a nutrition facts panel to food they serve.id.q a i.
section r,entitled n utrition levels and claims,addresses voluntary information,that is,those claims that a food purveyor may choose to add to its product label about the nutrient content for example,low sodium or health benefits for example,fiber reduces cholesterol of its product.see id.r.it prohibits the use of terms that characterize the level of any nutrient in a food unless they conform to definitions established by the fda,and requires that claims about the relationship between nutrients and health conditions be supported by scientific consensus see c fda will promulgate regulations authorizing a health claim only when it determines that there is significant scientific agreement,among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims,that the claim is supported by such evidence.specifically,that section states that 
a food shall be deemed misbranded if it 
a characterizes the level of any nutrient which is of the type required by section q or q to be in the label or labeling of the food unless the claim is made in accordance with section r,or 
b characterizes the relationship of any nutrient which is of the type required by section q or q to be in the label or labeling of the food to a disease or a condition unless the claim is made in accordance with section r or d.
r a b.however,section r adds that a statement of the type required by section q that appears as part of the nutrition information required or permitted by such paragraph is not a claim which is subject to this paragraph.id.r.in contrast to section q,restaurants are not exempt from section r regulation of claims.thus,when a restaurant chooses to characterize the level of any nutrient which is of the type required by section q to be in the label or labeling of the food,id.r a,it must conform to section r requirements.
the nlea contains two express preemption provisions relating to both sections q and r.section a,which relates to section q,preempts any state or local requirement for nutrition labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of s ection q,except a requirement for nutrition labeling of food which is exempt under section q a i,that is,the restaurant exception.id.a emphasis added section a,which relates to section r,expressly preempts state or local governments from imposing any requirement on nutrient content claims made by a food purveyor in the label or labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of s ection r,except a requirement respecting a claim made in the label or labeling of food which is exempt under s ection r b.id.a emphasis added q a.thus,states are not preempted from adopting nutrition information labeling laws as defined by section q,but are preempted from adopting nutrient claim laws as defined by section r.
though appearing complex,this scheme is simple when it comes to restaurant food the nlea does not regulate nutrition information labeling on restaurant food,and states and localities are free to adopt their own rules.the nlea,however,does generally regulate nutrition content claims on restaurant foods,and states and localities may only adopt rules that are identical to those provided in the nlea.
new york city adopts regulations governing calorie labeling in restaurants nysra challenges those regulations.
seeking to combat rising rates of obesity and associated health care problems,in december,the new york city board of health adopted the precursor to the current regulation,by amending article of the health code and adding a new section.the regulation,which was to become effective on july,mandated that any food service establishment voluntarily publishing calorie information post such information on its menus and menu boards.this regulation was met with vigorous objection from the restaurants and prompted many to stop voluntarily making such information available.on behalf of the restaurants,nysra subsequently sued the new york city board of health,the new york city department of health and mental hygiene,and thomas frieden also appellees here,together new york city or the city in the southern district of new york.in a decision issued on september,the district court concluded that regulation as adopted was preempted by a the claims preemption provision because,to the extent it applied only to restaurants that had voluntarily provided calorie information,it regulated nutrient content claims.state rest.ass city bd.of health nysra i,d.however,in so holding,the district court stated that 
by making its requirements contingent on a voluntary claim,regulation directly implicates section r and its corresponding preemption provision.new york city,although free to enact mandatory disclosure requirements of the nature sanctioned by section q and proposed or enacted in other jurisdictions,has adopted a regulatory approach that puts it in the heartland of section r and has subjected its regulation to preemption under section a.
id.at footnote omitted.having decided for nysra on preemption,the district court did not reach nysra first amendment claim.
taking its cue from the district court opinion,on january,the new york city board of health repealed and modified the regulation,producing the current version of regulation.see dep t of health and mental hygiene bd.of health,notice of adoption of a resolution to repeal and reenact of the new york city health code,hereinafter notice of adoption the revised regulation requires all chain restaurants with fifteen or more establishments nationally to make statements showing calorie content in the precise manner prescribed by the regulation.for those restaurants covered by the regulation,the calorie information must be presented clearly and conspicuously,adjacent or in close proximity to the menu item,and the font and format of calorie information must be as prominent in size and appearance as the name or price of the menu item.see notice of adoption at.now,every time new yorkers walk into or use the of certain chain restaurants,they are informed,for instance,that the taco salad contains calories,the sausage and egg breakfast sandwich contains calories,and the premium hamburger sandwich with mayonnaise contains calories but without mayonnaise contains calories.regulation expressly permits the restaurants to provide additional nutritional information and to provid e disclaimer s stating that there may be variations in calorie content values across servings based on slight variations in serving size,quantity of ingredients,or special ordering.id.at.
nysra member restaurants,some of which already provided nutrition information to their customers,just not on their menus and menu boards,were not much happier with the city latest effort at calorie disclosure on menus and menu boards specifically.they proposed alternatives to board posting including signs directing consumers to nutrition information at the restaurants,posters,food wrappers,counter mats,stanchions,and brochures,with such information.failing to convince the city which concluded that customers often did not see the nutrition information already provided by the restaurants,see id.at of the superiority of these alternatives,nysra filed another action in the southern district of new york,again seeking to declare the revised regulation preempted by federal law unconstitutional,and to enjoin its enforcement new york for summary judgment on the preemption claim.reasoning that regulation is not preempted by the nlea because that statute explicitly leaves to state and local governments the power to impose mandatory nutrition labeling by restaurants,the district court rejected nysra preemption challenge and granted the city summary judgment on this claim.state rest.ass city bd.of health nysra ii,wl,at.nysra also asked the district court to conclude that regulation impermissibly infringed on its members first amendment rights.but,the district court instead concluded that the required disclosure of caloric information is reasonably related to the government interest in providing consumers with accurate nutritional information and therefore does not unduly infringe on the first amendment rights of nysra members.id.nysra then appealed.it also sought a stay pending appeal,which we denied without prejudice to renewal at or after oral argument,based upon the city representations that the no fines period would be extended.we set an expedited briefing schedule,and subsequently denied the renewed motion for a stay.state rest.city bd.of health,cv cir,june,orders denying stay.we held oral argument on june,during which we heard from counsel for nysra,the city,and the fda.

preemption 
under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect,altria group,good.ed d,quotation marks omitted,and are preempted.the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case,id.quotation marks omitted,and we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.united states locke,d quoting rice santa fe elevator.the presumption against preemption is heightened where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation.state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.given the traditional primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,medtronic,lohr,d,courts assume that state and local regulation related to those matters can normally coexist with federal regulations.hillsborough county automated med,d see also desiano warner lambert,cir,aff by equally divided court sub nom warner lambert kent,d.as a result,where the text of a preemption clause is ambiguous or open to more than one plausible reading,courts have a duty to accept the reading that disfavors.bates dow agrosciences llc,d.
helpfully,the nlea is clear on preemption,stating that it shall not be construed to preempt any provision of state law,unless such provision is expressly preempted under a of the fdca,c,stat,note emphasis added.as already noted,as it pertains to restaurants,the nlea does not preempt new york city from adopting its own requirements for nutrition information labeling,see a,but it does generally preempt it from adopting different rules for nutrient content claims,id.a.in light of the nlea express preemption provisions,therefore,the issue in this case is less whether the nlea is clear on preemption,but more whether the quantitative calorie disclosures regulation mandates that chain restaurants place on their menus and menu boards are claims falling under section r and are thus preempted,or are nutrition information falling under section q and thus are not preempted.since nysra argument that regulation pertains to claims turns primarily on the meaning of claim as used in the nlea,some exposition of that term,especially as compared to the meaning of nutrition information,is required.
as explained,the nlea defines nutrition information,to include the total number of calories in a food product.id.q c see also c the declaration of nutrition information on the label and in labeling of a food shall contain a statement of the caloric content per serving.nutrition claims are statements made in the label or labeling of the food which expressly or by implication characterize the level of any nutrient which is of the type required by section q.r a emphasis added.however,a statement of the type required by section q that appears as part of the nutrition information required or permitted by such paragraph is not a claim.id.r emphasis added.
an initial reading of these sections of the statute suggests a distinction according to which nutrition information refers to quantitative statements such as calories and nutrition claims refers to descriptive or qualitative statements,such as heart healthy.see webster third int l dictionary defining to characterize as to describe the essential character or quality of id.at defining claim as an assertion,statement,or implication as of value,effectiveness,qualification,eligibility often made or likely to be suspected of being made without adequate justification.by that view,regulation,a regulation which merely requires the disclosure of quantitative information listed in section q,would not be preempted by the nlea.
such a simple path is not to be ours,however,because the fda,as the agency charged with implementing the fdca and nlea,has defined claims with more nuance.see united states mead,d when congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation quotation marks omitted see also,b a i,stat,stating that the fda shall identify claims described in section r a which comply with s ection r.r a listing conditions under which a claim can be made.in several regulations,the fda embraces the distinction using terms such as characterizes,describes,and suggests,to define claims in listing terms that characterize nutrient levels,the regulations point to terms and phrases such as rich in,excellent source of,enriched,fortified.see.as is particularly pertinent here,the regulations describe calorie content claims to include calorie free,free of calories,without calories,trivial source of calories,negligible source of calories,and dietarily insignificant source of calories.id.b.further,the regulations that discuss the labeling requirements for restaurants making nutrient content claims differentiate between nutrient amounts a phrase indicative of a quantitative statement,and claims,by permitting restaurants to provide the nutrient amounts that are the basis for the claim.id.
but,other fda regulations provide for a definition of claims that includes quantitative statements of the sort listed in section q.first,regulation b defines an expressed nutrient content claim as any direct statement about the level or range of a nutrient in a food including contains calories.b.as the district court pointed out in nysra i,the fda treats contains as either a nutrient content claim or a simple verb depending on how it is used.d at see also fda,guidance for a labeling guide for rests.and other retail establishments selling away from home foods,available at last visited,hereinafter fda,guidance for indus.in the phrase contains fiber,contains is a nutrient content claim meaning good source of fiber.see c defining contains see also fda,guidance for,at.in the phrase contains grams of fiber,by contrast,contains is a simple verb and the fda considers the quantitative declaration grams to be a nutrient content claim whether or not the word contains is employed.fda,guidance for,at.and,at other points,by emphasizing that quantitative statements such as calories are not implicit characterizations,the regulations seem to suggest that they can be express characterizations.for instance,i states that 
except as provided in or,as applicable,or in paragraph q product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if t he statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the food and it is not false or misleading in any respect,calories or grams of fat,in which case no disclaimer is required.
i emphases added 
if we were merely faced with such ambiguous regulations,we might adhere to the distinction.however,regulation c unequivocally provides that quantitative statements can be claims 
information that is required or permitted to be declared in nutrition labeling,and that appears as part of the nutrition label,is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section.if such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling,it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.
c emphases added.this regulation reflects the fda view that a quantitative statement as to a nutrient amount,calories for example,is not a claim when such a statement appears in the nutrient panel required by section q,but is one when it does not.and asked,during the notice and comment period,to exclude statements about simple factual information from the definition of nutrient content claim on the theory that such a statement is not a claim that characterizes the level of any nutrient within the meaning of the nlea,the fda refused,stating that the regulations pertaining to claims apply to statements of the amount of a nutrient in food as well as to statements of the level of a nutrient in food,
though we might have interpreted the nlea differently,we owe deference to the fda reading,as it has some support in the statute.see r a statement of the type required by paragraph q that appears as part of the nutrition information required or permitted by such paragraph is not a claim emphasis added,b a iv,stat,instructing fda to promulgate regulations to implement section r,to define terms that characterize the level of any nutrient in food unless the secretary finds that the use of any such term would be misleading,and to permit statements describing the amount and percentage of nutrients in food which are not misleading and are consistent with the terms defined in section r.see also mead,at.a ny ensuing regulation ensuing from authority delegated by congress to agencies is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.thus,like the district court,we conclude that under the fda regulations,statements as to nutrient amount,including calorie content,may be a claim subject to the requirements of section r and its implementing regulations.nysra i,d at.
since quantitative statements of the type listed in section q can be claims,we are brought back,almost full circle,to the question of when such statements are claims and state and local regulations are thus preempted,and when they are simply labeling requirements and state and local regulations are not preempted.the district court concluded that such statements,that is,of the type listed in section q,are claims when voluntary,but not so when mandatory.nysra ii,wl,at.in contending that the district court erred,nysra states that the statute and fda regulations compel the conclusion that while new york city is free to require restaurants to disclose nutrition information under section a,it may do so only if its regulations are identical to federal regulation of such information under section q otherwise the nutrition information becomes a claim,subject to section r,and preempted by section a.thus,nysra goes one step further than the district court to avoid preemption,it is not sufficient for regulation to be mandatory,it must also be identical to section q.
we do not agree.in urging this interpretation of the statute,nysra points to section r,which,as we have noted,states that a statement of the type required by section q that appears as part of the nutrition information required or permitted by such paragraph is not a claim,r emphasis added,and reads these words to mean that in order for a section q type statement not to be a claim,it must appear with all the other information listed in section q complete nutrition fact panel.however,in promoting this view,nysra renders meaningless sections q a i and a.we are not at liberty to do likewise.together,these sections provide that states are not preempted from establishing,or put differently,are permitted to establish any requirement for restaurants for nutrition labeling of food that is not identical to the requirement of s ection q.id.a emphasis added.since those sections permit states to adopt labeling rules for restaurants,section r reference to nutrition labeling required or permitted by section q,does not necessarily pertain to the complete list of nutrient information noted in section q,but rather to whatever identical or requirements that states or localities choose to adopt as it relates to restaurant food.thus,we read section r to provide that in order for a section q type statement not to be a claim,it must appear with the other information required or permitted by the nlea for packaged food,or applicable state or local law for restaurant food,which here,would be that required by regulation the total number of calories.as nysra notes,therefore,isolated quantitative statements of the type listed in section q can be claims,but only if section q,or the state law addressing restaurant food,requires it to appear along with other nutrient information such as those required by section q 
but nysra further contends that the fda regulations do not read the statute as we have.placing particular emphasis on regulation c,it states that the fda regulations provide that in order not to be a claim,the nutrition information must meet three criteria.thus,
information that is required or permitted by or,as applicable,to be declared in nutrition labeling,and that appears as part of the nutrition label,is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section.if such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling,it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.
nysra supp.br.quoting c alterations in nysra supp.br.however,this regulation,even as parsed by nysra,does not change our reading of the statute,because we conclude that it does not address nutrition information on restaurant food,but rather on food.this conclusion is based both on the understanding,as explained by the fda to us,that regulation was adopted with packaged food in mind,see fda amicus br,and the language of the regulation itself.as an initial matter,the first prong provides that for regulation c to transform a section q statement into a claim,the information at issue must first be required or permitted by either fda regulation,which pertains to the federal requirements for nutrition labeling of food or fda regulation,which addresses federal requirements for nutrition labeling of dietary supplements,and is inapplicable here.the regulation counterpart to section q a is regulation j i,which exempts restaurant food from regulation labeling requirements thus,since the regulations noted in regulation and do not apply to nutrition information mandated by state or local law to be placed on restaurant food,the third prong reference to such information does not speak to information relating to restaurant food finally,the second prong which references information that appears as part of the nutrition label,confirms this reading.the fdca defines label as any display of written,printed,or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any article,k emphasis added,and labeling as all labels and other written,printed,or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers,or accompanying such article,id.m.therefore,although restaurant food might have labeling,most would not have labels.stated differently,an order of pasta at olive garden italian restaurant does not come with a label printed on the bowl.
our above analysis perhaps simply comes down to this accepting nysra position that states or municipalities choosing to regulate nutrition information labeling by restaurants may do so only by adopting labeling requirements that are identical to those listed in section q and regulation would render section a exception for preemption meaningless see fda brown williamson tobacco,d it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.quotation marks omitted.it is well settled that in view of the primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,medtronic,at,state and local regulation related to those matters can normally coexist with federal regulations,hillsborough county,at.therefore,if there is any ambiguity in the nlea and fda regulations,we are bound to accept the reading that disfavors.bates,at.see also cong.rec.july,statement of waxman a ny preemption provision must recognize the important contribution that the state can make in regulation,and it must leave a role for the states.that our decision might result in nysra members being subject to multiple,inconsistent local regulations is the result of the choice that congress made to permit localities to mandate restaurants to disclose nutrition information about the food they serve.it is not a permissible basis to conclude that the nlea preempts regulation 
as previously noted,prior to oral argument in this appeal,we invited the fda to submit an amicus brief to enlighten us as to its views on preemption.it did so and we may consider the views expressed therein for persuasive value.see skidmore swift.stating that agency interpretations constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.the weight of an agency judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.schneider feinberg,cir explaining skidmore deference the fda advances the view that a statement is nutrition information exempt from the nlea preemption provisions if two criteria are met.
first,the statement must be of the type required by section q that appears as part of the nutrition information required or permitted by section q.r.second,a state or municipal regulatory authority must require the statement to be disclosed with regard to restaurant food as part of nutrition labeling and the information must be disclosed pursuant to that authority.id.a noting exceptions that are inapplicable here.
fda amicus br.the first criterion tracks our above analysis,and thus we find it persuasive the second criterion,plainly stated as above,is also unobjectionable since section a exception to preemption concerns nutrition labeling.a.in defending the second criterion,the fda attempts to reconcile regulation c to restaurant food by asking us to conclude that labeling requirements are met when a nutrition information statement appears,for packaged food,in the nutrition information section of the food label or,for foods that bear no label,as part of the nutrition information for food in a place appropriate for such information at the point of purchase.fda amicus br.that is,that the term nutrition label as used in regulation c should be interpreted to include,in the context of restaurant food,nutrition information whose disclosure is required by a state or local regulatory body,whether it is placed somewhere that meets the narrow definition of label advanced by nysra,or whether it instead is placed,as under regulation,in appropriate labeling.id.at see a nutrition labeling information should be displayed at the point of purchase by an appropriate means such as by a label affixed to the food or through labeling including shelf labels,signs,posters,brochures,notebooks,or leaflets that are readily available and in close proximity to the foods.id.stating as to nutrition labeling of restaurant foods that presentation of nutrition labeling may be in various forms,including those provided in and other reasonable means.put simply,the fda asks us to read label as stated in regulation reference to nutrition label,as appropriate labeling.accordingly,for restaurants,a menu or menu board would fall within section definition of label.we have concerns about reading the regulation as the fda proposes,but might be required to do so if it were the only way to keep the structure and meaning of the nlea intact.however,we think a better approach is to conclude,as we have,that regulation c does not pertain to restaurant food,but we adopt the fda test,quoted above,see supra,at,as our own.
first amendment 
nysra other objection to regulation is that it impermissibly infringes on nysra member restaurants first amendment rights.it is undisputed that commercial speech is entitled to the protection of the first amendment.zauderer office of disciplinary counsel,d.as commercial speech is speech that proposes a commercial transaction,and regulation requires disclosure of calorie information in connection with a proposed commercial transaction the sale of a restaurant meal,nysra ii,wl,at,the form of speech affected by regulation is clearly commercial speech.however,the protection afforded commercial speech is somewhat less extensive than that afforded noncommercial speech.zauderer,at.quotation marks omitted.and,within the class of regulations affecting commercial speech,we accord varying levels of protection depending on the type of commercial speech at issue.
this is where nysra objection to the district court decision lies.it argues that regulation should be subjected to heightened scrutiny,and not,as the district court concluded,rationality.however,the district court conclusion was compelled by this circuit law,which rested on our interpretation of supreme court precedent.the supreme court has stated that there are material differences between purely factual and uncontroversial disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech,id.at,and that regulations that compel purely factual and uncontroversial commercial speech are subject to more lenient review than regulations that restrict accurate commercial speech.id.at.in light of zauderer,this circuit thus held that rules mandating that commercial actors disclose commercial information are subject to the rational basis test.mfrs.ass sorrell,cir.we explained that 
commercial disclosure requirements are treated differently from restrictions on commercial speech because mandated disclosure of accurate,factual,commercial information does not offend the core first amendment values of promoting efficient exchange of information or protecting individual liberty interests.such disclosure furthers,rather than hinders,the first amendment goal of the discovery of truth and contributes to the efficiency of the marketplace of ideas.protection of the robust and free flow of accurate information is the principal first amendment justification for protecting commercial speech,and requiring disclosure of truthful information promotes that goal.in such a case,then,less exacting scrutiny is required than where truthful,nonmisleading commercial speech is restricted.
id.at footnote and citations omitted riley fed of the blind of,d stating that p urely commercial speech is more susceptible to compelled disclosure requirements than is personal or political speech.
in arguing both that sorrell was incorrectly decided and that it does not govern this case,nysra makes the following three arguments.first,united states united foods,d,issued three months before sorrell and which sorrell does not discuss,limited the rational basis test described in zauderer to those situations in which the law at issue furthers the state interest in preventing deception of consumers.second,international dairy foods association amestoy idfa,cir,in which we applied intermediate scrutiny pursuant to central hudson gas pub.serv.commission of new york,d,is more akin to this case third,the parties in sorrell did not dispute the significance of the facts that they were being asked to disclose.in contrast,nysra member restaurants,which do not believe that disclosing calorie information would reduce obesity,and would prefer to provide complete nutrition information,are instead forced,as counsel informed us during oral argument,to cram calorie information down the throats of their customers.
we think nysra reads too much into united foods.the paragraph on which nysra relies simply distinguishes zauderer on the basis that the compelled speech in zauderer was necessary to prevent deception of consumers it does not provide that all other disclosure requirements are subject to heightened scrutiny.united foods,at.of course,there is no error in this distinction as zauderer addressed deceptive advertising.nor was this distinction lost on us in sorrell,when we held that zauderer holding was broad enough to encompass nonmisleading disclosure requirements.sorrell,at we stated 
to be sure,the compelled disclosure at issue here was not intended to prevent consumer confusion or deception per se,zauderer,at.internal quotation marks omitted,but rather to better inform consumers about the products they purchase.although the overall goal of the statute is plainly to reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment,it is inextricably intertwined with the goal of increasing consumer awareness of the presence of mercury in a variety of products.accordingly,we can not say that the statute goal is inconsistent with the policies underlying first amendment protection of commercial speech,described above,and the reasons supporting the distinction between compelled and restricted commercial speech.we therefore find that it is governed by the rule in zauderer.
sorrell,at.we have not been alone in accepting this broader reading.see pharm.care mgmt.ass rowe,cir w e have found no cases limiting zauderer to potentially deceptive advertising directed at consumers.decided four years after united foods.thus,zauderer,not central hudson,describes the relationship between means and ends demanded by the first amendment in compelled commercial disclosure cases.sorrell,at 
with nyrsa challenge to sorrell holding disposed of,its claim that this case is more akin to idfa,clearly fails.in sorrell,we explained that our decision in idfa was expressly limited to cases in which a state disclosure requirement is supported by no interest other than the gratification of consumer curiosity.sorrell,at.given new york interest in preventing obesity,which is further explained below,see also mem.of law in supp.of pl.mot.for declaratory relief and a preliminary injunction,at,filed,conceding that new york city has a substantial interest in passing regulation,idfa is inapplicable.
nysra final objection is also resolved by sorrell,which clearly held that laws that compel the reporting of factual and uncontroversial information by commercial entities are scrutinized for rationality.sorrell,at see also zauderer,at.thus,t he question that we must answer is whether regulation labeling requirements are compelled speech in violation of the constitution or simply requirements of purely factual disclosures.entm t software ass blagojevich,cir applying strict scrutiny to disclosure requirement requiring placement of sticker that met the statute definition of sexually explicit because it was more than the question of whether a particular chemical is within any given product unlike in sorrell.nysra does not contend that disclosure of calorie information is not factual it only claims that its member restaurants do not want to communicate to their customers that calorie amounts should be prioritized among other nutrient amounts,such as those listed in section q nutrition fact panel.however,the first amendment does not bar the city from compelling such factual disclosures,see zauderer,at,where as discussed below,the city decision to focus its attention on calorie amounts is rational.
rational basis review 
accordingly,rational basis applies and nysra concedes that it will not prevail if we apply that test.our review reveals the concession to be warranted new york city has plainly demonstrated a reasonable relationship between the purpose of regulation disclosure requirements and the means employed to achieve that purpose.citing what it termed an obesity epidemic,new york city enacted regulation to reduce consumer confusion and deception and to promote informed consumer so as to reduce obesity and the diseases associated with it.see notice of adoption.identifying numerous studies,the notice of adoption made the following relevant findings first,that obesity is epidemic and is a serious and increasing cause of disease in new york city,of adults,and of elementary school children are overweight or obese and obesity is a contributing factor for heart disease,diabetes,stroke,and cancer,which caused of deaths in new york city in.id.at.second,that the obesity epidemic is mainly due to excess calorie consumption,often resulting from meals eaten away from the home.americans,including new yorkers,are eating out more than in the past and when doing so,typically eat more than they do at home,and in just one meal ordered in a fast food restaurant,might consume more than the advised daily caloric intake.id.at.third,that chain restaurants serve food that is associated with excess calorie consumption and weight gain.id.at.fourth,that consumers distorted perceptions about how many calories food contained led to unhealthy food choices.id.fifth,that providing calorie information,similar to that provided in the nlea nutrition fact panel,at the would help consumers make informed,healthier food choices.id.at.finally,it noted that voluntary activities by restaurants were woefully inadequate and failed to inform the vast majority of customers,only of whom in a study,reported noticing calorie information,id.at,and that leading health authorities recommend posting calorie information at the point of purchase,id.at.
new york city was not alone in making these observations.a report concluded that obesity has become a public health crisis of epidemic proportions.keystone report at.in addition,a study by the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc estimated that approximately deaths in were associated with obesity in the united states.katherine flegal et,excess deaths associated with underweight,overweight,and obesity,am.med.ass.another study concluded that rising obesity rates led to increasing diabetes rates,finding that as of,million americans had diabetes,almost triple the number from.ctr.for disease control,ctr.for health statistics,diabetes surveillance,prevalence of diabetes,available at diabetes last visited.yet another study concluded that with these increased rates of obesity and associated health problems,have come increased costs.see eric finkelstein et,state level estimates of annual medical expenditures attributable to obesity,obesity research,listing increased annual medical expenditures of states attributable to obesity in several states including new york.
further,studies have linked obesity to eating out.the keystone report also concluded that the consumption of meals at restaurants is a significant cause of obesity,stating that e ating out more frequently is associated with obesity,higher body fatness,and higher body mass index.keystone report at.and,it found,among other things that,whereas in american spent just of their food budget on food prepared away from home,they now spend of their food dollars on such items and that foods provided of american daily total caloric intake in,nearly double the intake in.id.at.the united states department of agriculture has observed that foods have lower nutritional quality than home foods and found a correlation between increased caloric intake and eating out.see biing hwan lin,et,dep t of,econ.research,agric.info.bull,away from home foods increasingly important to quality of american diet,available at last visited.yet another study found that between and of diabetes cases are associated with obesity,unhealthy eating and physical inactivity.hu,et,diet,lifestyle,and the risk of type diabetes mellitus in women,new eng.med.
stating that calorie information is most relevant to obesity prevention,keystone report at,the keystone report concluded that restaurants should provide consumers with calorie information in a standard format that is easily accessible and easy to use,id.at,allowing consumers to view the information when standing at a counter,while reviewing a menu board,in a car when reading a menu,or when sitting down at a table reviewing a menu,id.at in arriving at this conclusion the keystone report stated that w ithout nutrition information,consumers typically are unable to assess the caloric content of foods,id.at,a statement which we do not doubt upon being informed,that a smoked turkey sandwich at chili contains calories,more than a sirloin steak,which contains,or that doughnuts at donuts have fewer calories than a sesame bagel with cream cheese.city and county of san francisco,ca et.amicus br.see also scot burton et,attacking the obesity epidemic the potential health benefits of providing nutrition information in restaurants,am.pub.health,finding that calories in restaurant items were almost two times more than what consumers expected.indeed,nysra expert does not assert that provision of information about the calorie content of food at the point of purchase in restaurants will not be beneficial in reducing obesity levels,and only states that it might not.
in view of all the above findings,regulation calorie disclosure rules are clearly reasonably related to its goal of reducing obesity we thus conclude that nysra has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on its first amendment claims and affirm the district court denial of an injunction.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we reject nysra challenge to regulation because we conclude that it is not preempted by the nlea and does not violate nysra member restaurants first amendment rights.because this panel did not grant a stay of enforcement of the district court order and nysra and its member restaurants are complying with regulation,or facing fines for,no further action is required by this court.
the fda filed an amicus brief at our request.numerous cities,counties,government officials,and associations also appear as amici.all ask us to affirm the district court.
specifically,section q provides in relevant part,that a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is a food intended for human consumption and is offered for sale,unless its label or labeling bears nutrition information that provides a i the serving size,b the number of servings,c the total number of calories i derived from any source,and ii derived from the total fat,in each serving size,d the amount of the following nutrients total fat,saturated fat,cholesterol,sodium,total carbohydrates,complex carbohydrates,sugars,dietary fiber,and total protein contained in each serving size,e any vitamin,mineral,or other nutrient required to be placed on the label and labeling of food under this chapter before october,if the secretary determines that such information will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices q.
fda regulations define nutrient content claims for a range of specific descriptive terms such as free,low good source,antioxidant,and high potency.for instance,the fda regulations provide that the term high potency may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at percent or more of the reference daily intake per reference amount customarily consumed.id.f i see also id.c iv establishing the nomenclature and reference daily intakes for various vitamins and minerals.
only the restaurant exception is relevant in this case,but we note that section a also provides a preemption exception for food which is exempt under section q a ii.that subsection refers to food sold for immediate consumption in retail establishments such as grocery stores.
section r b refers to claims relating to cholesterol,saturated fat,dietary fiber,or nutrients that increase the risk of health conditions,and is,as nysra agrees,inapplicable here.see nysra br.
new york city also filed a notice of appeal to nysra i,however,the parties stipulated that the appeal should be dismissed as moot with prejudice in view of the modifications to regulation.state rest.ass city bd.of health,cv cir,stipulation and order dismissing appeal.
nysra argues that the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents new york city from relitigating the distinction because it chose to dismiss its appeal from nysra i with prejudice.as we do not ground our decision in this distinction,we do not reach this question.
for instance,regulation b defines a nutrient content claim as a claim that expressly or implicitly characterizes the level of a nutrient of the type required to be in nutrition labeling under the regulations implementing section q.b emphasis added.regulation b defines an implied nutrient content claim as any claim that i describes the food or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount,high in oat bran or ii suggests that the food,because of its nutrient content,may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient,healthy,contains grams g of fat.id.b emphases added.
