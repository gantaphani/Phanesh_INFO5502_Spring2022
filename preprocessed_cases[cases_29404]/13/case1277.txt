frontera resources azerbaijan corporation frontera appeals from the dismissal by the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard holwell,judge of its petition to enforce a swedish arbitration award against state oil corporation of the azerbaijan republic socar.the district court granted socar motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.see frontera res.azer.state oil of the azer.republic,d.we conclude that socar is not entitled to the due process clause jurisdictional protections if it is an agent of the azerbaijani state.accordingly,we vacate and remand for the district court to reconsider its analysis.
background 
frontera and socar are two companies in the oil industry.frontera is based in the cayman islands,and socar is based in and owned by the republic of azerbaijan azerbaijan.in november,the parties entered into a written agreement the agreement under which frontera developed and managed oil deposits in azerbaijan and delivered oil to socar.in,a dispute arose over socar refusal to pay for some of this oil,and in response,frontera allegedly sought to sell oil that was supposed to be sold to socar to parties outside of azerbaijan instead.in november,after instructing local customs authorities to block frontera oil exports,socar seized the oil.
in march,the bank that had financed frontera involvement in azerbaijan foreclosed on its loan,forcing frontera to assign its rights in the project to the bank.in july,the bank settled its claims with socar.frontera,however,continued to seek payment for both previously delivered and seized oil.based on its settlement with the bank,socar denied liability to frontera.
after frontera and socar were unable to settle their dispute amicably,frontera served socar in july with a request for arbitration as per the agreement.in january,after a hearing on the merits with full participation by both parties,a swedish arbitral tribunal awarded frontera approximately million plus interest.
on february,frontera filed a petition in the southern district of new york to confirm the award pursuant to article ii of the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards new york convention,opened for signature june,implemented at.the district court dismissed the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction,on the basis that socar had insufficient contacts with the united states to meet the due process clause requirements for the assertion of personal jurisdiction.the district court questioned the soundness of according due process protections to socar,a company owned by azerbaijan,but nonetheless applied the traditional due process test based on our precedent in texas trading milling federal republic of nigeria,cir.the district court also declined to find quasi in rem jurisdiction over socar,because frontera had not identified specific socar assets within the court jurisdiction.the district court denied jurisdictional discovery and dismissed frontera petition.this appeal followed.
discussion 
frontera contends that a court does not need personal jurisdiction over a party in order to confirm a foreign arbitral award against that party,and that texas trading should be overruled,because the due process clause protections should not apply to foreign states or their instrumentalities.frontera also challenges the district court denial of jurisdictional discovery.
personal jurisdiction over socar 
when considering a district court dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction,we review its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see sunward,mcdonald,cir.
generally,personal jurisdiction has both statutory and constitutional components.a court must have a statutory basis for asserting jurisdiction over a defendant,see grand river enters.six nations,pryor,cir,and the due process clause typically also demands that the defendant,if not present within the territory of the forum,have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quoting milliken meyer.the parties do not challenge the district court reliance on the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,a,as the statutory basis for jurisdiction over socar.see frontera,d at see also argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d stating that the fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.this appeal instead is focused on the due process clause place in the district court analysis.
the district court dismissed frontera petition because it concluded that socar contacts with the united states were insufficient to meet the due process clause demands for personal jurisdiction.frontera contends that this was in error both because personal jurisdiction is not necessary for the requested relief,and because socar is not entitled to the due process clause protections.we address each argument in turn.
a.the need for jurisdiction 
frontera argues that a district court does not need personal jurisdiction over a respondent to confirm a foreign arbitral award against that party.yet,frontera contends,the district court dismissal of its petition necessarily rest ed upon an assumption that personal jurisdiction over socar was indispensable.appellant br.at.
we read the district court decision differently.although the district court considered whether it could assert personal jurisdiction over socar,it did not make that question dispositive.instead,after finding socar contacts with the united states insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction,the district court examined whether it had jurisdiction over any of socar assets,because in the absence of minimum contacts,quasi in rem jurisdiction may be exercised to attach property to collect a debt.frontera,d at.thus,by suggesting that the district court required personal jurisdiction,frontera misunderstands the framework of the court analysis.and to the extent that frontera challenge is to the district court requirement of either personal or quasi in rem jurisdiction,it is without merit.
we have previously avoided deciding whether personal or quasi in rem jurisdiction is required to confirm foreign arbitral awards pursuant to the new york convention.see dardana yuganskneftegaz,cir.however,the numerous other courts to have addressed the issue have each required personal or quasi in rem jurisdiction.see,telcordia tech telkom sa,cir glencore grain rotterdam shivnath rai harnarain,cir base metal trading,ojsc novokuznetsky aluminum factory,cir see also transatl.bulk shipping saudi chartering.
frontera contends that none of these courts addressed the precise argument it advances here that there is no positive statutory or treaty basis for such a jurisdictional requirement appellant reply br.at.the federal statute that implements the new york convention requires a court to confirm an award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.article v of the new york convention provides the exclusive grounds for refusing confirmation,yusuf ahmed alghanim sons,toys r us,cir,and specifies seven grounds for refusing to enforce an arbitral award,none of which include a lack of jurisdiction over the respondent or the respondent property,see new york convention at,at.frontera accordingly argues that we can not impose a jurisdictional requirement if the convention does not already have one.we disagree.
unlike state courts,which are courts of general jurisdiction,federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction which thus require a specific grant of jurisdiction.foxhall realty law offices,telecomm.premium,cir citing sheldon sill,how.the validity of an order of a federal court depends upon that court having jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the parties.ins.of,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d.while the requirement of subject matter jurisdiction functions as a restriction on federal power,id.at,the need for personal jurisdiction is fundamental to the court power to exercise control over the parties,leroy great united,d.some basis must be shown,whether arising from the respondent residence,his conduct,his consent,the location of his property or otherwise,to justify his being subject to the court power.glencore grain,at quoting transatl.bulk shipping.at.
because of the primacy of jurisdiction,jurisdictional questions ordinarily must precede merits determinations in dispositional order.sinochem int l malay.int l shipping,d.t he items listed in article v as the exclusive defenses pertain to substantive matters rather than to procedure.monegasque de reassurances nak naftogaz of,cir emphasis added.article v exclusivity limits the ways in which one can challenge a request for confirmation,but it does nothing to alter the fundamental requirement of jurisdiction over the party against whom enforcement is being sought.
frontera argues that the supreme court suggested otherwise in shaffer heitner,d,in the following footnote 
once it has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the defendant is a debtor of the plaintiff,there would seem to be no unfairness in allowing an action to realize on that debt in a state where the defendant has property,whether or not that state would have jurisdiction to determine the existence of the debt as an original matter.
id.at.but while this footnote indicated,in dicta,that a court might not need jurisdiction over a respondent person when enforcing a debt the shaffer principle that frontera makes much of,appellant br.at it nonetheless assumed that such a court would still have jurisdiction over the respondent property.and in this regard,the district court approach in no way conflicted with shaffer.the district court did not view its lack of personal jurisdiction over socar as fatal to frontera petition instead,the court then appropriately considered whether it could assert jurisdiction over socar property.
we therefore hold that the district court did not err by treating jurisdiction over either socar or socar property as a prerequisite to the enforcement of frontera petition.the district court may,however,have given the constitution due process clause an unwarranted place in its analysis,which we discuss next.
socar rights under the due process clause 
the district court recognized that our precedent texas trading compelled it to hold that socar possessed rights under the due process clause,thus requiring that jurisdiction over socar meet the minimum contacts requirements of international shoe.the district court,however,questioned texas trading soundness.these doubts were.
the due process clause famously states that no person shall be deprived of life,liberty or property without due process of law.const.amend.v emphasis added.in texas trading,we held that a foreign state was a person within the meaning of the due process clause,and that a court asserting personal jurisdiction over a foreign state addition to complying with the engage in a due process scrutiny of the court power to exercise its authority over the state.at,t he fsia can not create personal jurisdiction where the constitution forbids it.texas trading reached this conclusion without much analysis,while also noting that cases on point were rare.id.at.the fsia had been enacted only five years earlier,and suits against foreign states were generally supported by quasi in rem jurisdiction.id.subsequently,we applied texas trading not only to foreign states but also to their agencies and instrumentalities.see,seetransport wiking trader schiffarhtsgesellschaft mbh navimpex centrala navala,cir applying texas trading to a foreign trading company wholly owned by romania that promoted ship sales through its governmental office in manhattan.
since texas trading,however,the case law has marched in a different direction.in republic of argentina weltover,the supreme court assum ed,without deciding,that a foreign state is a person for purposes of the due process clause,d,but then cited south carolina katzenbach,d,which held that states of the union are not persons for purposes of the due process clause,at.weltover did not require deciding the issue because argentina contacts satisfied the due process requirements,see id.at,but the court implication was plain if the states of the union have no rights under the due process clause,why should foreign states 
after weltover,we noted that we are uncertain whether texas trading remains good law.hanil bank pt bank negara,cir.but we went no further in hanil bank because the due process requirements were satisfied in that case.see id.the instant case is different,however,as only the due process clause prevented the district court from asserting personal jurisdiction over socar.
in price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,the circuit reasoned that because the word person in the context of the due process clause of the fifth amendment can not,by any reasonable mode of interpretation,be expanded to encompass the states of the union,katzenbach,at,absent some compelling reason to treat foreign sovereigns more favorably than states of the union,it would make no sense to view foreign states as persons under the due process clause,at.the price court found no such reason,see id.at,and we find that case analysis persuasive.as the price court noted,the states of the union both derive important benefits from the constitution and must abide by significant limitations as a consequence of their participation in the union,id.at yet a foreign state lies outside the structure of the union,id.quoting principality of monaco mississippi.
if the states,as sovereigns that are part of the union,can not avail themselves of the fundamental safeguards of the due process clause,price,at,we do not see why foreign states,as sovereigns wholly outside the union,should be in a more favored position.this is particularly so when the supreme court has n ever suggested that foreign nations enjoy rights derived from the constitution,and when courts have instead relied on principles of comity and international law to protect foreign governments in the american legal system.id.for the reasons discussed by the price court in its thorough opinion,we are unwilling to interpret the due process clause as conferring rights on foreign nations that states of the union do not possess.id.at.thus,we hold that the district court erred,albeit understandably in light of texas trading,by holding that foreign states and their instrumentalities are entitled to the jurisdictional protections of the due process clause.
socar argues otherwise by defending not texas trading reasoning but its significance as precedent.and,to be sure,our court decisions are binding until overruled by us sitting en banc or by the supreme court,united states wilkerson,cir,neither of which has happened to texas trading.we do,however,recognize an exception to this general rule where there has been an intervening supreme court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent.gelman ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although weltover arguably casts sufficient doubt on texas trading to justify its overruling by this panel,see hanil bank,at,we have nonetheless circulated this opinion to all active members of our court,and none has objected to our departure from texas trading.see united states parkes,cir describing our banc process.accordingly,to the extent that texas trading conflicts with our holding today that foreign states are not persons entitled to rights under the due process clause,it is overruled.
simply overruling texas trading,however,and holding that a sovereign state does not enjoy due process protections does not decide the precise question in this case,because socar is not a sovereign state,but rather an instrumentality or agency of one.frontera contends that,because the fsia treats foreign states and their agencies and instrumentalities identically,see kensington int l itoua,cir citing a,we should treat socar just as we would treat azerbaijan for constitutional purposes.the simple fact that socar is deemed a foreign state as a statutory matter,however,does not answer the constitutional question of socar due process rights.socar may indeed lack due process rights like a foreign state
