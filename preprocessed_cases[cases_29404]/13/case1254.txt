petitioner william seeks review of a february,decision of the united states department of homeland security,immigration and customs enforcement ice,reinstating a prior order of deportation for illegal entry,entered in july against.the first issue before us is whether the reinstatement of removal statute,section a of the immigration and naturalization act ina,as added by section a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,a,is impermissibly retroactive as applied to,an alien who illegally reentered the united states and married a united states citizen prior to the statute enactment.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that section a is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to.we further hold,as discussed below,that section a forecloses from applying for certain additional types of relief and that section a does not deprive him of due process.
background 
initial illegal entry,deportation,and subsequent illegal reentry 
a native and citizen of colombia,illegally entered the united states in at the age of.in,he pled guilty to two crimes simple possession of a controlled substance cocaine in nebraska and fraudulent practices in the third degree in iowa.on june,was served with an order to show cause charging that he had entered the united states without inspection.on july,an immigration judge ordered him deported from the united states to colombia based on the charges contained in the order to show cause.waived appeal of that decision,and on october,he was deported from the united states to colombia.
in,shortly after being deported to colombia,reentered the united states without inspection.he asserts that he then married rosa haydee garofalo in in a mormon church in texas but that the record of their marriage was misplaced by the church.subsequently,on july,and his wife had a child,william herrera,who is a united states citizen.garofalo became a naturalized united states citizen in march,and on may,remarried garofalo and obtained an official marriage license from the state of new york.
ii.proceedings below applications for relief and reinstatement of prior order of deportation 
in late,garofalo filed on behalf of a petition for alien relative form and an application to adjust status form.in connection with these applications,paid a fee for having entered the united states without inspection.in addition,in,filed an application for permission to reapply for admission into the united states after deportation or removal form,which was denied on march.
on february,ice reinstated prior order of deportation from its original date,july,pursuant to ina a,a,and placed him in custody.on the same date,an ice officer interviewed,at which time he indicated that he feared for his life if forced to return to colombia.on april,an asylum officer issued a reasonable fear determination finding that was credible and that he had a reasonable fear of returning to colombia on account of his mormon faith in conclusion,the asylum officer opined that should be allowed to pursue his withholding of removal claim before an immigration judge.based on the asylum officer findings,was placed in withholding of removal proceedings before an immigration judge ij,and on november,the ij denied his application for withholding of removal.appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia on december,on july,the bia dismissed appeal,concluding that the ij was not clearly erroneous in his determination that failed to provide credible testimony and evidence in support of his assertion that his family has been targeted for persecution 
on october,we granted motion for a stay of removal pending disposition of present petition for review of the reinstatement of his prior deportation order.
discussion 
argues that section a the provision pursuant to which his prior order of deportation was impermissibly retroactive as applied to him.further argues that,even if section a is not impermissibly retroactive,the statute nevertheless deprives him of due process and we should interpret section a to allow him to apply for additional types of relief.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that section a is not impermissibly retroactive as applied,does not deprive him of due process,and forecloses him from applying for certain additional types of relief.
jurisdiction 
before reaching the merits of arguments,we first address whether we have jurisdiction over this matter.the parties initially disputed our jurisdiction because,at the time that the parties filed their briefs,appeal of the ij denial of withholding of removal was still pending before the bia.due to the pendency of the appeal,the attorney general argued that the reinstated order of deportation was not a final order of removal over which we could exercise jurisdiction.see chupina holder,cir noting that our jurisdiction is limited to review of final orders of removal and that,when a petitioner pending applications for relief directly affect whether he may be removed,the order of removal is not final until those applications have been resolved by the agency.after the attorney general filed his brief,however,the bia subsequently dismissed appeal of the denial of withholding of removal.as a result,the attorney general has withdrawn his argument that we lack jurisdiction to review the reinstatement of prior deportation order.see resp t supp.letter br.of,at with the board dismissal of appeal of the denial of withholding of removal,the instant petition for review has ripened from a premature petition into a petition for review of a final order of removal.likewise,by supplemental letter brief dated october,concurred with the attorney general position and represented that he has elected not to seek review of the bia july,decision dismissing his appeal from the ij denial of withholding of removal.
a premature petition for review of a order of removal can become a reviewable final order upon the adjudication of remaining applications for relief and protection,provided that the attorney general has not shown prejudice.see lewis gonzales,cir foster ins,cir despite his premature petition to us,we exercised jurisdiction noting that the bia has since affirmed petitioner removal order and the respondent has not shown prejudice.internal quotation marks omitted.in the present case,the bia has now rendered a decision resolving appeal of the denial of withholding of removal,and the attorney general does not claim that he was prejudiced by filing a petition for review prior to the bia do we see how he could have been prejudiced.accordingly,even if initial petition were premature,we conclude that the reinstatement of his prior deportation order is now a reviewable final order and proceed to the merits of his arguments.
ii.the reinstatement provisions of section a 
before analyzing specific arguments regarding section a,it is necessary to summarize briefly how section a changed the law regarding reinstatement of removal orders,formerly known as deportation orders section a provides that 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
a.the statute became effective on april,the first day of the first month beginning more than days after it was enacted on september,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
prior to april,only aliens who had previously been deported on certain specified grounds,such as a conviction for an aggravated felony,were subject to having their original deportation orders reinstated,and even those aliens subject to reinstatement could seek certain kinds of discretionary relief.id.at.see e f,a.by contrast,section a applies to all illegal reentrants,explicitly insulates the removal orders from review,and generally forecloses discretionary relief from the terms of the reinstated order,at.emphases added.
iii.retroactivity analysis 
as noted earlier,although applied for adjustment of status after section a became effective,he illegally reentered the united states and married a united states citizen before section a became effective.on this basis,contends that section a is impermissibly retroactive as applied to him because long standing ins practice created a reasonable expectation that petitioner could defend against later deportation by seeking a discretionary adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.opening br.for pet r at.for the reasons discussed below,argument is unavailing.
in one of its seminal retroactivity cases,the supreme court noted that e lementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.landgraf usi film,d.in the same case,however,the supreme court observed that congress may,within constitutional limits,enact laws that operate retroactively.id.at.the court further acknowledged that r etroactivity provisions often serve entirely benign and legitimate purposes,whether to respond to emergencies,to correct mistakes,to prevent circumvention of a new statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage,or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law congress considers salutary.id.
in light of these principles,the supreme court developed a test for determining whether a statute may be applied retroactively.at step one,a court must ascertain,using the ordinary tools of statutory construction,whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.martinez ins,cir quoting landgraf,at.if the answer is yes,the inquiry is over id.applying ordinary tools of statutory construction,the supreme court in found that congress did not expressly prescribe whether section a should apply to individuals who illegally reentered the united states before section a went into effect on april.at.
because the statute contains no express command,we therefore proceed to step two of the analysis,which ask s whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights,liabilities,or duties on the basis of conduct arising before its enactment.id.at.alterations in original quoting landgraf,at.under step two of the relevant inquiry,a statute is impermissibly retroactive when it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.martinez,at quoting landgraf,at.when determining whether a statute is impermissibly retroactive,courts must exercise commonsense,functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.ins cyr,d internal quotation marks omitted.this analysis is further informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these principles at step two,the supreme court held that section a is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to aliens who reentered the united states prior to its enactment,at.the court noted that,w hile the law looks back to a past act in its application to an alien who has reentered illegally,it is the conduct of remaining in the country after entry that is the predicate action.id.at.emphasis added.thus,i t is the alien choice to continue his illegal presence,after illegal reentry and after the effective date of the new law,that subjects him to the new and less generous legal regime,not a past act that he is helpless to undo up to the moment the government finds him out.id.the court further noted that,although section a became law on september,it did not become effective and enforceable until april.id.at.unlawful alien reentrants thus had the advantage of a grace period between the unequivocal warning that a tougher removal regime lay ahead and actual imposition of the less opportune terms of the new law.id.the court observed that,i n that stretch of six months,could have ended his illegal presence and potential exposure to the coming law by crossing back into mexico.id.at.furthermore,and most pertinent to the present case,the court noted that could have married the mother of his son and applied for adjustment of status during that period,in which case he would at least have had a claim about which we express no opinion that proven reliance on the old law should be honored by applying the presumption against retroactivity.id.at.emphasis added.
in the present case,married a united states citizen before section a went into effect,but he did not apply for adjustment of status until after section a became effective.accordingly,reliance on the supreme court petitioner might have had a claim had he married and applied for adjustment of status before section a became unavailing.it is true that several courts of appeals have found section a impermissibly retroactive as applied to individuals who submitted applications for adjustment of status before section a became effective.see gonzales,cir finding section a impermissibly retroactive as applied to a petitioner who had both applied for and obtained adjustment of status prior to section a effective date ashcroft,cir finding section a impermissibly retroactive as applied to a petitioner who had applied for adjustment of status prior to section a effective date sarmiento cisneros attorney,cir same arevalo ashcroft,cir same.however,unlike the petitioners in those cases,as we just noted,did not apply for adjustment of status before section a effective date.
in addition,the only court of appeals decision that found section a impermissibly retroactive as applied to a petitioner who married,but did not apply for adjustment of status,before section a effective date was an eighth circuit decision issued before was decided.see generally ashcroft,cir.after the supreme court issued,however,the eighth circuit acknowledged that was overruled to the extent that it conflicted with.see gonzalez chertoff,cir holding that a different immigration provision enacted at the same time as section a was not impermissibly retroactive as applied to a petitioner who married before the statute became effective and who could have pursued adjustment of status as a defense to removal prior to the statute effective date id.at to the extent our decision in suggests a different result,it is overruled by.
argues here that did not address whether section a is impermissibly retroactive as applied to a petitioner who married,but did not apply for adjustment of status,before section a effective date.accordingly,concludes that does not conflict with and,therefore,has not been overruled.careful analysis of,however,illustrates that its reasoning conflicts with and,therefore,has been overruled.the decision analogized the retroactive effect at issue there,section a effect on aliens who had reentered before section a enactment,to the retroactivity issue in hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d.see,at.after,it became clear that this analogy was misplaced.hughes aircraft dealt with the retroactive application of a statutory amendment to conduct completed before the amendment enactment.at.by contrast,as discussed earlier,made clear that the conduct which section a regulates is ongoing and is not a past act that petitioner is helpless to undo up to the moment the government finds him out,at.accordingly,the reasoning of conflicts with,and therefore,as the eighth circuit itself has recognized,was overruled.
unlike the eighth circuit decision,the fourth and fifth circuits decisions on this hold that section a is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to petitioners who married,but did not apply for adjustment of status,before section a effective fully in line with.silva rosa gonzales,cir holding that section a was not impermissibly retroactive because,although the petitioner married and applied for a visa prior to section a effective date,he did not apply for
