defendant luis valentine appeals from the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from his car and his residence.valentine contends that the district court erred in concluding that his arrest and the subsequent search of his car were legal and his wife consent to search their apartment was voluntary and that the firearms found during the search should not be suppressed 
background 
a.the controlled delivery 
on friday,october,members of a drug enforcement task force based at john kennedy airport in new york learned that boxes containing a sofa and loveseat had arrived from puerto rico,and that approximately kilograms of cocaine were hidden inside the furniture.the boxes were shipped via fedex and addressed to luis lebron,basement apartment of vernon avenue,brooklyn,new york.the task force officers,consisting of nypd officers and dea agents,intercepted the shipment and planned a controlled delivery for the following monday.
because there were no fedex trucks available for the controlled delivery that monday,dea special agent christopher banzer and nypd detective rodney perez dressed in fedex uniforms,rented a delivery van and put magnetic fedex signs on its sides.another group of agents and police officers parked an undercover surveillance van across the street from vernon,where they recorded video of the location and received audio transmissions from a wireless device worn by perez.other officers were positioned in various locations within a few blocks of vernon.
as the officers pulled up in the delivery van at approximately,they saw valentine getting out of a sedan parked near the building.valentine walked toward the building and said something that special agent banzer interpreted as paolo,fedex,fedex,and waved to a man named pedro rodriguez further down the street.perez asked valentine if he could help unload the heavy boxes and valentine agreed so long as perez paid him.rodriguez then approached the officers and valentine and the group discussed who would sign for the delivery.valentine then went inside vernon and came out with a man identified only as angel.angel said he would call lebron to ask him to come home to sign for the delivery.angel called lebron and gave the phone to perez.the person on the phone purporting to be lebron stated that he was at work and could not leave,but they should leave the delivery on the sidewalk for him.valentine was not present for the phone call.ultimately,no one signed for the boxes and perez and special agent banzer went back to their office at jfk without making the delivery 
after the delivery van left,several of the officers continued surveilling vernon.special agent robert yoos,a veteran of the dea,watched the apartment building from an unmarked police car.nypd detective michael johnson,with seven years experience with the police department,continued surveillance from a van across the street.the officers observed valentine going in and out of vernon and talking with various individuals on the sidewalk.
at approximately,valentine,dressed in a gray hooded sweatshirt,came out of vernon and gestured to other people standing nearby and proceeded to walk up the block.special agent yoos and johnson observed valentine and the other people enter a vacant lot.none of the officers could see what transpired in the lot a few minutes later,valentine reappeared alone at the other end of the block,holding a cup of coffee or some other beverage.valentine walked back to vernon and later removed his sweatshirt and placed it in his car.
a supervising agent,who was not on the scene,authorized valentine arrest based on information furnished to him by special agent yoos and johnson.yoos then told nypd sergeant allan hoehl and nypd detective paul crockett to move in and arrest valentine,while special agent yoos walked up the street to arrest the other people loitering on the block who had entered the vacant lot with valentine 
valentine arrest 
valentine had stepped out of his car and was walking toward the trunk area at approximately when sergeant hoehl and crockett blocked his car with their unmarked police cars.the officers,wearing plainclothes and badges,approached valentine from the front and rear of his car and told him they were police officers and that he was under arrest.valentine struggled with the officers,and johnson and at least two other officers ran over to assist in valentine arrest.sergeant hoehl stated that because he felt valentine reach for his gun at one point during the scuffle,sergeant hoehl hit him on the head with handcuffs to subdue him.once the officers had valentine handcuffed,they called an ambulance to treat valentine resulting head wound.
after valentine arrest,johnson searched valentine car and found the gray sweatshirt valentine had been wearing earlier in the day.inside a pocket of the sweatshirt,he found some glassine bags of heroin.no other contraband was found in the car.
c.the search of valentine apartment 
special agent yoos,parked up the street a few blocks,arrived at vernon shortly after valentine arrest.special agent yoos then called for sergeant hoehl and crockett to accompany him to valentine apartment.when they knocked on the door,valentine wife,annette pena morales,answered.she appeared as though she had just awakened and looked nervous,concerned,but also calm.special agent yoos told morales that he and the other officers were working on a narcotics case and that they had just arrested valentine.morales told the officers that she lived there with valentine and their two children.she stated that she had been looking out the window and had witnessed valentine arrest.
special agent yoos then asked morales if they could come inside to discuss the matter further.morales allowed the officers to enter the apartment.special agent yoos informed her that her husband had just been arrested for a very serious narcotics offense.he then asked morales if other people had been in the apartment earlier that day,and morales said that her daughter and her daughter boyfriend had visited.special agent yoos asked if other people were currently in the apartment,and morales said no.
as to what next transpired,morales testimony varies significantly from that of the officers according to the officers,special agent yoos asked morales if any guns or drugs were in her apartment and she denied that such items were present.she said that she had been asleep until a few moments before valentine was arrested.special agent yoos then asked her if they could search the apartment.morales agreed,and special agent yoos gave morales a consent to search form.he read the form to morales and told her that it allowed the officers to search her apartment.the consent form provides 
i have been asked to permit special agents of the drug enforcement administration to search vernon avenue,brooklyn,apartment.
i have not been threatened or forced in any way.
i freely consent to the search.
morales signed the form.
morales initially denied that there was any contraband in the apartment as the officers began to search special agent yoos warned her that if they found a gun that she had not told them about,she would be in trouble.eventually,she told the officers that there was a gun in a corner closet and two guns in a locked box.crockett discovered a shotgun inside a drawstring bag hanging on a door in the bedroom.in the upper corner of the bedroom closet,crockett found a locked fireproof box.after he found the key and unlocked it,he discovered two pistols inside the box.morales told the officers that the guns belonged to valentine.crockett also found a few glassine bags of heroin in a bedside table drawer.the officers then arrested morales.
when the officers later questioned valentine at their office,he told them that morales was not involved and that he took responsibility for the evidence seized in the apartment.
indictment and motion to suppress 
a grand jury charged valentine with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of possessing heroin with intent to distribute.valentine filed a motion to suppress the evidence relied upon by the grand jury,arguing that law enforcement officers had arrested him without probable cause,that the warrantless searches of his car and his apartment were tainted by his unlawful arrest,and that his wife did not consent to the search of their apartment.
the district court held a suppression hearing on valentine motion on september and.at the hearing,the government presented five witnesses special agents banzer and yoos,dets.johnson and crockett,and sergeant hoehl.valentine presented morales as his witness.
the district court denied valentine motion to suppress.though the district court found that valentine actions during the attempted fedex delivery were too ambiguous to provide probable cause for his arrest,the court found that valentine entry into the vacant lot with other individuals and reappearance with a beverage a few minutes later was sufficient to provide probable cause for the officers to arrest him.the court relied on the testimony of johnson and special agent yoos that,in their experience,valentine actions were consistent with those of a narcotics dealer.specifically,johnson stated that selling drugs to a group of people simultaneously minimized the chances of getting caught,and valentine purchase of a beverage afterwards was the way drug dealers typically rid themselves of possibly marked buy money used by undercover agents.special agent yoos stated that,in his experience,valentine actions were consistent with a drug sale.the court explained its finding of probable cause as follows 
while the court agrees with the defense that,standing alone,defendant conduct,up until the failed controlled delivery,was too ambiguous to give rise to probable cause for an arrest,the totality of the circumstances,including defendant conduct after the delivery attempt,amply supports the court conclusion that there was probable cause for defendant arrest.
the court then concluded that the search of valentine car was incident to his arrest and therefore lawful.
with respect to the search of valentine apartment,the court held that the government witnesses were credible,and morales testimony was incredible to the extent that it differed from that of the officers.the court found that morales consented to the search and signed the consent form before the search began.the court also found that morales consent was given freely and that she never objected to the officers search.
finally,the court found that valentine statements to the officers after his arrest were voluntary because valentine waived his miranda rights and did not claim that he was forced to provide statements to the officers.
valentine conditional guilty plea and sentencing 
on february,valentine pleaded guilty to count one of the indictment,namely being a felon in possession of a firearm,pursuant to a written plea agreement.although the plea agreement contained a provision by which valentine waived his right to appeal or otherwise challenge his conviction or sentence if the district court imposed a term of imprisonment of months or less,the plea agreement permitted valentine to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress physical evidence.
thereafter,the district court sentenced valentine to months of imprisonment.valentine now brings this appeal.
ii.standard of review 
on an appeal from a ruling on a motion to suppress,we review a district court findings of historical fact for clear error,but analyze de novo the ultimate determination of such legal issues as probable cause,united states smith,cir accord ornelas united states,d,including whether the exception for a search incident to that arrest is applicable,united states gagnon,cir.
iii.discussion 
valentine arrest was not supported by probable cause 
the officers arrested valentine without a warrant.such an arrest must be supported by probable cause or else it violates the fourth amendment.beck ohio,d united states fisher,cir.valentine argues on appeal that the district court incorrectly concluded that his arrest was supported by probable cause.he further contends that the physical evidence subsequently found by the officers after his the search of his car and the fruits of that illegal arrest.thus,the first issue raised by his appeal is whether the facts as found by the district court were sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest valentine.
probable cause to arrest a person exists if the law enforcement official,on the basis of the totality of the circumstances,has sufficient knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information to justify a person of reasonable caution in believing that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.united states patrick,cir citing brinegar united states.beck,at.while probable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity,not an actual showing of such activity,mere suspicion is not enough.illinois gates,d.in determining whether probable cause exists to arrest a suspect,t he experience of a police officer is a factor to be considered but the relevance of the suspect conduct should be sufficiently articulable that its import can be understood by the average reasonably prudent person.fisher,at.
based on evidence heard at the suppression hearing,the district court concluded that valentine actions prior to the failed controlled delivery did not establish probable cause to arrest him.the district court noted that valentine merely talked to rodriguez in front of the apartment,entered and exited both his car and the apartment building several times,called rodriguez when the undercover officers arrived with the furniture for the controlled delivery,and told perez that he would help carry the furniture if compensated.relying on fisher,at,where we held that probable cause to arrest was not present where the suspect emerged from a house in the vicinity of a house under observation by the officers,hesitated and then the house,the district court concluded that valentine conduct up to this point was too ambiguous to give rise to probable cause to arrest.
we agree that valentine conduct prior to the controlled delivery did not support probable cause.the undercover officers had never met valentine before they arrived for the controlled delivery and had no information from which they could conclude that valentine was involved in the sale of narcotics.and while they suspected that lebron,the intended recipient of the delivery,was involved in narcotics trafficking,nothing valentine had done gave them an articulable basis for concluding that valentine was associated with lebron.at most,a reasonably prudent person could conclude that valentine was familiar with other residents of the apartment building,but not that he was associated with lebron or anyone else involved in criminal activity.
the district court went further,however,and concluded that valentine conduct after the failed controlled delivery,coupled with his actions prior to the controlled delivery,gave the officers probable cause to believe that he had sold narcotics to a group of unidentified males loitering near the apartment building.in particular,the district court relied on the fact that valentine exited his apartment building after changing into a sweatshirt that he gestured to the unidentified men standing outside his apartment building,conversed with them,and walked together with them into an adjacent vacant lot through a fence,where the officers could not see what took place that he a few minutes later from a different direction,carrying a beverage and that he entered and exited his car.based on this conduct and the officers interpretation of a dealer,in their experience,would come down and do everybody at once because it was less chance of him getting caught by the police and then purchase something to get rid of the money used by the buyers in case that money was district court found that probable cause existed to arrest valentine for the sale of narcotics.with that conclusion,we respectfully disagree.
we have previously held that no probable cause exists to arrest where a suspect actions are too ambiguous to raise more than a generalized suspicion of involvement in criminal activity.in united states ceballos,for example,poli
