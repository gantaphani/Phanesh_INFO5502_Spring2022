respondent driehaus,a former congressman,filed a complaint with the ohio elections commission alleging that petitioner susan anthony list sba violated an ohio law that criminalizes certain false statements made during the course of a political campaign.specifically,driehaus alleged that sba violated the law when it stated that his vote for the patient protection and affordable care act aca was a vote in favor of taxpayer funded abortion.after driehaus lost his bid,the complaint was dismissed,but sba continued to pursue a separate suit in federal district court challenging the law on first amendment grounds.petitioner coalition opposed to additional spending and taxes coast also filed a first amendment challenge to the ohio law,alleging that it had planned to disseminate materials presenting a similar message but refrained due to the proceedings against sba.the district court consolidated the two lawsuits and dismissed them as nonjusticiable,concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness.the sixth circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds.
held petitioners have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for article iii purposes.
a to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must show,inter alia,an injury in fact,which must be concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife.when challenging a law prior to its enforcement,a plaintiff satisfies the requirement where he alleges an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.babbitt farm workers.
b petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement of the ohio law.
petitioners have alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest by pleading specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.
petitioners intended future conduct is also arguably proscribed by the statute.the ohio false statement statute sweeps broadly,and a panel of the ohio elections commission already found probable cause to believe that sba violated the law when it made statements similar to those petitioners plan to make in the future.golden zwickler,is distinguishable the threat of prosecution under an electoral leafletting ban in that case was wholly conjectural because the plaintiff sole concern related to a former congressman who was unlikely to run for office again.here,by contrast,petitioners speech focuses on the broader issue of support for the aca,not on the voting record of a single candidate.nor does sba insistence that its previous statements were true render its fears of enforcement misplaced.after all,that insistence did not prevent the commission from finding probable cause for a violation the first time.
finally,the threat of future enforcement is substantial.there is a history of past enforcement against petitioners.past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not chimerical.steffel thompson.the credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that a complaint may be filed with the state commission by any person,ohio code ann.a,not just a prosecutor or agency.
the threatened commission proceedings are of particular concern because of the burden they impose on electoral speech.moreover,the target of a complaint may be forced to divert significant time and resources to hire legal counsel and respond to discovery requests in the crucial days before an election.but this court need not decide whether the threat of commission proceedings standing alone is sufficient here,those proceedings are backed by the additional threat of criminal prosecution.
c the sixth circuit separately considered two other prudential factors fitness and hardship.this court need not resolve the continuing vitality of the prudential ripeness doctrine in this case because those factors are easily satisfied here.see lexmark int l,static control components.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
petitioners in this case seek to challenge an ohio statute that prohibits certain false statements during the course of a political campaign.the question in this case is whether their preenforcement challenge to that law is justiciable and in particular,whether they have alleged a sufficiently imminent injury for the purposes of article iii.we conclude that they have.
the ohio statute at issue prohibits certain false statement s during the course of any campaign for nomination or election to public office or office of a political party.ohio code ann.b lexis.as relevant here,the statute makes it a crime for any person to m ake a false statement concerning the voting record of a candidate or public official,b,or to p ost,publish,circulate,distribute,or otherwise disseminate a false statement concerning a candidate,either knowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,b 
a ny person acting on personal knowledge may file a complaint with the ohio elections commission or commission alleging a violation of the false statement statute.a lexis supp.if filed within days of a primary election or days of a general election,the complaint is referred to a panel of at least three commission members.a,b lexis.the panel must then hold an expedited hearing,generally within two business days,b,to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the alleged violation occurred,c.upon a finding of probable cause,the full commission must,within days,hold a hearing on the complaint.c see also ohio admin.code e.
the statute authorizes the full commission to subpoena witnesses and compel production of documents.ohio code ann.b lexis supp.at the full hearing,the parties may make opening and closing statements and present evidence.ohio admin.code b c,d,g.if the commission determines by clear and convincing evidence that a party has violated the false statement law,the commission shall refer the matter to the relevant county prosecutor.ohio code ann.d lexis supp.alternatively,the commission regulations state that it may simply issue a reprimand.see ohio admin.code d.violation of the false statement statute is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months of imprisonment,a fine up to,or both.ohio code ann.lexis,v lexis supp.a second conviction under the false statement statute is a felony that carries a mandatory penalty of disfranchisement.
petitioner susan anthony list sba is a advocacy organization.fed.appx.during the election cycle,sba publicly criticized various members of congress who voted for the patient protection and affordable care act aca.in particular,it issued a press release announcing its plan to educat e voters that their representative voted for a health care bill that includes abortion.app.the press release listed steve driehaus,a respondent here,who voted for the aca.sba also sought to display a billboard in driehaus district condemning that vote.the planned billboard would have read shame on steve driehaus driehaus voted for abortion.at.the advertising company that owned the billboard space refused to display that message,however,after driehaus counsel threatened legal action.
on october,driehaus filed a complaint with the ohio elections commission alleging,as relevant here,that sba had violated b and by falsely stating that he had voted for abortion.because driehaus filed his complaint days before the general election,a commission panel held an expedited hearing.on october,the panel voted to to find probable cause that a violation had been committed.the full commission set a hearing date for business days later,and the parties commenced discovery.driehaus noticed depositions of three sba employees as well as individuals affiliated with similar advocacy groups.he also issued discovery requests for all evidence that sba would rely on at the commission hearing,as well as sba communications with allied organizations,political party committees,and members of congress and their staffs.
on october,after the panel determination,but before the scheduled commission hearing sba filed suit in federal district court,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that b and violate the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.the district court stayed the action under younger harris,pending completion of the commission proceedings.the sixth circuit denied sba motion for an injunction pending appeal.driehaus and sba eventually agreed to postpone the full commission hearing until after the election.
when driehaus lost the election in november,he moved to withdraw his complaint against sba.the commission granted the motion with sba consent.once the commission proceedings were terminated,the district court lifted the stay and sba amended its complaint.as relevant here,the amended complaint alleged that ohio code ann.b and are unconstitutional both facially and as applied.specifically,the complaint alleged that sba speech about driehaus had been chilled that sba intends to engage in substantially similar activity in the future and that it face d the prospect of its speech and associational rights again being chilled and burdened,because a ny complainant can hale it before the commission,forcing it to expend time and resources defending itself.app.
the district court consolidated sba suit with a separate suit brought by petitioner coalition opposed to additional spending and taxes coast,an advocacy organization that also alleged that the same ohio false statement provisions are unconstitutional both facially and as applied according to its amended complaint,coast intended to disseminate a mass and other materials criticizing driehaus vote for the aca as a vote to fund abortions with tax dollars,but refrained from doing so because of the commission proceedings against sba,at.coast further alleged that it desires to make the same or similar statements about other federal candidates who voted for the aca,but that fear of finding itself subject to the same fate as sba has deterred it from doing so,at,
the district court dismissed both suits as,concluding that neither suit presented a sufficiently concrete injury for purposes of standing or ripeness.the sixth circuit affirmed on ripeness grounds.fed.appx.the court of appeals analyzed three factors to assess whether the case was ripe for review the likelihood that the alleged harm would come to pass whether the factual record was sufficiently developed and the hardship to the parties if judicial relief were denied.
regarding the first factor,the sixth circuit concluded that sba prior injuries the determination and the billboard rejection do not help it show an imminent threat of future prosecution,particularly where the commission never found that sba violated ohio law.at.the court further reasoned that it was speculative whether any person would file a complaint with the commission in the future,in part because driehaus took a assignment with the peace corps in africa after losing the election.finally,the court noted that sba has not alleged that it plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech in the future,but rather maintains that the statements it intends to make are factually true,at.
as for the remaining factors,the court concluded that the factual record was insufficiently developed with respect to the content of sba future speech,and that withholding judicial relief would not result in undue hardship because,in the time period leading up to the election,sba continued to communicate its message even after commission proceedings were initiated.the sixth circuit therefore determined that sba suit was not ripe for review,and that its analysis as to sba compelled the same conclusion with respect to coast.
we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and controversies.art.iii.the doctrine of standing gives meaning to these constitutional limits by identify ing those disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process.lujan defenders of wildlife.the law of article iii standing,which is built on principles,serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.clapper amnesty int l usa,slip,at.to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must show an injury in fact,a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,and a likel ihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.
this case concerns the requirement,which helps to ensure that the plaintiff has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.warth seldin,internal quotation marks omitted.an injury sufficient to satisfy article iii must be concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,supra,at some internal question marks omitted.an allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending,or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.clapper,at,slip,at,emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted.
the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing.at slip,at.e ach element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.lujan,supra,at.
one recurring issue in our cases is determining when the threatened enforcement of a law creates an article iii injury.when an individual is subject to such a threat,an actual arrest,prosecution,or other enforcement action is not a prerequisite to challenging the law.see steffel thompson,i t is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights see also medimmune,genentech,w here threatened action by government is concerned,we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat instead,we have permitted review under circumstances that render the threatened enforcement sufficiently imminent.specifically,we have held that a plaintiff satisfies the requirement where he alleges an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.babbitt farm workers.several of our cases illustrate the circumstances under which plaintiffs may bring a preenforcement challenge consistent with article iii.
in steffel,for example,police officers threatened to arrest petitioner and his companion for distributing handbills protesting the vietnam war.petitioner left to avoid arrest his companion remained and was arrested and charged with criminal trespass.petitioner sought a declaratory judgment that the trespass statute was unconstitutional as applied to him.
we determined that petitioner had alleged a credible threat of enforcement he had been warned to stop handbilling and threatened with prosecution if he disobeyed he stated his desire to continue handbilling an activity he claimed was constitutionally protected and his companion prosecution showed that his concern with arrest was not chimerical.at.under those circumstances,we said,it is not necessary that petitioner first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.ibid.
in babbitt,we considered a preenforcement challenge to a statute that made it an unfair labor practice to encourage consumers to boycott an agricultural product by the use of dishonest,untruthful and deceptive publicity.at.the plaintiffs contended that the law unconstitutionally penalize d inaccuracies inadvertently uttered in the course of consumer appeals.ibid.
building on steffel,we explained that a plaintiff could bring a preenforcement suit when he has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.babbit,supra,at.we found those circumstances present in babbitt.in that case,the law on its face proscribe d dishonest,untruthful,and deceptive publicity.at.the plaintiffs had actively engaged in consumer publicity campaigns in the past and alleged an intention to continue those campaigns in the future,at.and although they did not plan to propagate untruths,they argued that erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate.ibid.we concluded that the plaintiffs fear of prosecution was not imaginary or wholly speculative,and that their challenge to the consumer publicity provision presented an article iii case or controversy,at.
two other cases bear mention.in virginia american booksellers,we held that booksellers could seek preenforcement review of a law making it a crime to knowingly display for commercial purpose material that is harmful to juveniles as defined by the statute,at.at trial,the booksellers introduced books they believed were covered by the statute and testified that costly compliance measures would be necessary to avoid prosecution for displaying such books.just as in babbitt and steffel,we determined that the nature of the suit was not troubl ing because the plaintiffs had alleged an actual and fear that the law will be enforced against them.at.
finally,in holder humanitarian law project,we considered a preenforcement challenge to a law that criminalized knowingly provid ing material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.at.the plaintiffs claimed that they had provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations prior to the law enactment and would provide similar support in the future.the government had charged persons with violating the law and declined to disavow prosecution if the plaintiffs resumed their support of the designated organizations.we held that the claims were justiciable the plaintiffs faced a credible threat of enforcement and should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.at.
here,sba and coast contend that the threat of enforcement of the false statement statute amounts to an article iii injury in fact.we agree petitioners have alleged a credible threat of enforcement.see babbitt,at.
first,petitioners have alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest.ibid.both petitioners have pleaded specific statements they intend to make in future election cycles.sba has already stated that representatives who voted for the aca supported abortion,and it has alleged an inten t to engage in substantially similar activity in the future.app.see also humanitarian law project,supra,at observing that plaintiffs had previously provided support to groups designated as terrorist organizations and alleged they would provide similar support to the same terrorist organizations again if the statute allegedly unconstitutional bar were lifted coast has alleged that it previously intended to disseminate materials criticizing a vote for the aca as a vote to fund abortions with tax dollars,and that it desires to make the same or similar statements about other federal candidates who voted for the aca.app.because petitioners intended future conduct concerns political speech,it is certainly affected with a constitutional interest.babbitt,supra,at see also monitor patriot roy,t he constitutional guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office 
next,petitioners intended future conduct is arguably proscribed by the statute they wish to challenge.babbitt,supra,at.the ohio false statement law sweeps broadly,see supra,at,and,and covers the subject matter of petitioners intended speech.both sba and coast have alleged an intent to m ake statements concerning the voting record of a candidate or public official,b,and to disseminate statements concerning a candidate to promote the election,nomination,or defeat of the candidate,b.and,a commission panel here already found probable cause to believe that sba violated the statute when it stated that driehaus had supported abortion the same sort of statement petitioners plan to disseminate in the future.under these circumstances,we have no difficulty concluding that petitioners intended speech is arguably proscribed by the law.
respondents incorrectly rely on golden zwickler.in that case,the plaintiff had previously distributed anonymous leaflets criticizing a particular congressman who had since left office,at,and.the court dismissed the plaintiff challenge to the electoral leafletting ban as nonjusticiable because his sole concern was literature relating to the congressman and his record,and it was most unlikely that the congressman would again be a candidate.at emphasis added.under those circumstances,any threat of future prosecution was wholly conjectural.ibid.
here,by contrast,petitioners speech focuses on the broader issue of support for the aca,not on the voting record of a single candidate.see reply brief identifying other elected officials who plan to seek reelection as potential objects of sba criticisms.because petitioners alleged future speech is not directed exclusively at driehaus,it does not matter whether he may run for office again.brief for respondents internal quotation marks omitted.as long as petitioners continue to engage in comparable electoral speech regarding support for the aca,that speech will remain arguably proscribed by ohio false statement statute.
respondents,echoing the sixth circuit,contend that sba fears of enforcement are misplaced because sba has not said it plans to lie or recklessly disregard the veracity of its speech.at quoting fed,at.the sixth circuit reasoned that because sba can only be liable for making a statement knowing it is false,sba insistence that its speech is factually true makes the possibility of prosecution for uttering such statements exceedingly slim.at.
the sixth circuit misses the point.sba insistence that the allegations in its press release were true did not prevent the commission panel from finding probable cause to believe that sba had violated the law the first time around.and,there is every reason to think that similar speech in the future will result in similar proceedings,notwithstanding sba belief in the truth of its allegations.nothing in this court decisions requires a plaintiff who wishes to challenge the constitutionality of a law to confess that he will in fact violate that law.see,babbitt,at case was justiciable even though plaintiffs disavowed any intent to propagate untruths 
finally,the threat of future enforcement of the false statement statute is substantial.most obviously,there is a history of past enforcement here sba was the subject of a complaint in a recent election cycle.we have observed that past enforcement against the same conduct is good evidence that the threat of enforcement is not chimerical.steffel,at clapper,at slip,at plaintiffs theory of standing was substantially undermine d by their fail ure to offer any evidence that their communications ha d been monitored under the challenged statute.here,the threat is even more substantial given that the commission panel actually found probable cause to believe that sba speech violated the false statement statute.indeed future complainants may well invoke the prior finding to prove that sba knowingly lied.brief for petitioners.
the credibility of that threat is bolstered by the fact that authority to file a c
