petitioner spokeo,an alleged consumer reporting agency,operates a people search engine,which searches a wide spectrum of databases to gather and provide personal information about individuals to a variety of users,including employers wanting to evaluate prospective employees.after respondent thomas robins discovered that his profile contained inaccurate information,he filed a federal complaint against spokeo,alleging that the company willfully failed to comply with the fcra requirements.
the district court dismissed robins complaint,holding that he had not properly pleaded injury in fact as required by article iii.the ninth circuit reversed.based on robins allegation that spokeo violated his statutory rights and the fact that robins personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized,the court held that robins had adequately alleged an injury in fact.

spokeo,petitioner thomas robins 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether respondent robins has standing to maintain an action in federal court against petitioner spokeo under the fair credit reporting act of fcra or act,stat,as amended,et.
spokeo operates a people search engine.if an individual visits spokeo web site and inputs a person name,a phone number,or an address,spokeo conducts a computerized search in a wide variety of databases and provides information about the subject of the search.spokeo performed such a search for information about robins,and some of the information it gathered and then disseminated was incorrect.when robins learned of these inaccuracies,he filed a complaint on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals.
the district court dismissed robins complaint for lack of standing,but a panel of the ninth circuit reversed.the ninth circuit noted,first,that robins had alleged that spokeo violated his statutory rights,not just the statutory rights of other people,and,second,that robins personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.based on these two observations,the ninth circuit held that robins had adequately alleged injury in fact,a requirement for standing under article iii of the constitution,at.
this analysis was incomplete.as we have explained in our prior opinions,the requirement requires a plaintiff to allege an injury that is both concrete and particularized.friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc,emphasis added.the ninth circuit analysis focused on the second characteristic particularity,but it overlooked the first concreteness.we therefore vacate the decision below and remand for the ninth circuit to consider both aspects of the requirement.
the fcra seeks to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting.a.to achieve this end,the act regulates the creation and the use of consumer report s by consumer reporting agenc ies for certain specified purposes,including credit transactions,insurance,licensing,business transactions,and employment.see d a c.enacted long before the advent of the internet,the fcra applies to companies that regularly disseminate information bearing on an individual credit worthiness,credit standing,credit capacity,character,general reputation,personal characteristics,or mode of living.d.
the fcra imposes a host of requirements concerning the creation and use of consumer reports.as relevant here,the act requires consumer reporting agencies to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of consumer reports,b to notify providers and users of consumer information of their responsibilities under the act,d to limit the circumstances in which such agencies provide consumer reports for employment purposes,b and to post numbers for consumers to request reports,a.
the act also provides that a ny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement of the act with respect to any is liable to that individual for,among other things,either actual damages or statutory damages of to per violation,costs of the action and attorney fees,and possibly punitive damages.a.
spokeo is alleged to qualify as a consumer reporting agency under the fcra it operates a web site that allows users to search for information about other individuals by name,address,or phone number.in response to an inquiry submitted online,spokeo searches a wide spectrum of databases and gathers and provides information such as the individual address,phone number,marital status,approximate age,occupation,hobbies,finances,shopping habits,and musical preferences.app.according to robins,spokeo markets its services to a variety of users,including not only employers who want to evaluate prospective employees,but also those who want to investigate prospective romantic partners or seek other personal information.brief for respondent.persons wishing to perform a spokeo search need not disclose their identities,and much information is available for free.
at some point in time,someone robins complaint does not specify who made a spokeo search request for information about robins,and spokeo trawled its sources and generated a profile.by some means not detailed in robins complaint,he became aware of the contents of that profile and discovered that it contained inaccurate information.his profile,he asserts,states that he is married,has children,is in his,has a job,is relatively affluent,and holds a graduate degree.app.according to robins complaint,all of this information is incorrect.
robins filed a complaint in the united states district court for the central district of california,claiming,among other things,that spokeo willfully failed to comply with the fcra requirements enumerated above.
the district court initially denied spokeo motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,but later reconsidered and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.app.to pet.for cert.the court found that robins had not properly pled an injury in fact,as required by article iii.ibid.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed.relying on circuit precedent the court began by stating that the violation of a statutory right is usually a sufficient injury in fact to confer standing.at.the court recognized that the constitution limits the power of congress to confer standing.at.but the court held that those limits were honored in this case because robins alleged that spokeo violated his statutory rights,not just the statutory rights of other people,and because his personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.ibid.emphasis in original.the court thus concluded that robins alleged violations of his statutory rights were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of article iii.at.
we granted certiorari.
the constitution confers limited authority on each branch of the federal government.it vests congress with enumerated legislative powers,art.i,it confers upon the president t he executive power,art.ii,cl.and it endows the federal courts with t he judicial power of the united states,art.iii.in order to remain faithful to this tripartite structure,the power of the federal judiciary may not be permitted to intrude upon the powers given to the other branches.see daimlerchrysler cuno,lujan defenders of wildlife.
although the constitution does not fully explain what is meant by t he judicial power of the united states,art.iii,it does specify that this power extends only to cases and controversies,art.iii.and n o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.raines byrd.
standing to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy.the doctrine developed in our case law to ensure that federal courts do not exceed their authority as it has been traditionally understood.see,at.the doctrine limits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek redress for a legal wrong.see valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,warth seldin.in this way,t he law of article iii standing serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches,clapper amnesty int l usa,slip,at lujan,supra,at,and confines the federal courts to a properly judicial role,see warth,supra,at.
our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three elements.lujan,at.the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant,and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision,at friends of the earth,at.the plaintiff,as the party invoking federal jurisdiction,bears the burden of establishing these elements,dallas.where,as here,a case is at the pleading stage,the plaintiff must clearly allege facts demonstrating each element.warth,supra,at 
this case primarily concerns injury in fact,the f irst and foremost of standing three elements.steel citizens for better environment.injury in fact is a constitutional requirement,and i t is settled that congress can not erase article iii standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.raines,supra,at,see summers earth island institute,gladstone,realtors village of bellwood,in no event may congress abrogate the art.iii minima 
to establish injury in fact,a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted.we discuss the particularization and concreteness requirements below.
for an injury to be particularized,it must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.see also,cuno,supra,at plaintiff must allege personal injury whitmore arkansas,distinct allen wright,personal valley forge,supra,at standing requires that the plaintiff personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury united states richardson,not undifferentiated public citizen,national hwy.traffic safety,cadc collecting cases 
particularization is necessary to establish injury in fact,but it is not sufficient.an injury in fact must also be concrete.under the ninth circuit analysis,however,that independent requirement was elided.as previously noted,the ninth circuit concluded that robins complaint alleges concrete,de facto injuries for essentially two reasons,at.first,the court noted that robins alleges that spokeo violated his statutory rights,not just the statutory rights of other people.ibid.second,the court wrote that robins personal interests in the handling of his credit information are individualized rather than collective.ibid.emphasis added.both of these observations concern particularization,not concreteness.we have made it clear time and time again that an injury in fact must be both concrete and particularized.see,susan anthony list driehaus,slip,at summers,supra,at sprint communications apcc services,massachusetts epa.
a concrete injury must be de facto that is,it must actually exist.see black law dictionary ed.when we have used the adjective concrete,we have meant to convey the usual meaning of the term real,and not abstract.webster third new international dictionary random house dictionary of the english language.concreteness,therefore,is quite different from particularization.
concrete is not,however,necessarily synonymous with tangible.although tangible injuries are perhaps easier to recognize,we have confirmed in many of our previous cases that intangible injuries can nevertheless be concrete.see,pleasant grove city summum,free speech church of lukumi babalu aye,hialeah,free exercise.
in determining whether an intangible harm constitutes injury in fact,both history and the judgment of congress play important roles.because the doctrine of standing derives from the requirement,and because that requirement in turn is grounded in historical practice,it is instructive to consider whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in english or american courts.see vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens.in addition,because congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum article iii requirements,its judgment is also instructive and important.thus,we said in lujan that congress may elevat e to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete,de facto injuries that were previously inadequate in law.at.similarly,justice kennedy concurrence in that case explained that congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to a case or controversy where none existed before.at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment.
congress role in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.article iii standing requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.for that reason,robins could not,for example,allege a bare procedural violation,divorced from any concrete harm,and satisfy the requirement of article iii.see summers,at d eprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation is insufficient to create article iii standing see also lujan,supra,at.
this does not mean,however,that the risk of real harm can not satisfy the requirement of concreteness.see,clapper amnesty int l usa.for example,the law has long permitted recovery by certain tort victims even if their harms may be difficult to prove or measure.see,restatement first of torts libel,slander per se.just as the common law permitted suit in such instances,the violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact.in other words,a plaintiff in such a case need not allege any additional harm beyond the one congress has identified.see federal election comm akins,confirming that a group of voters inability to obtain information that congress had decided to make public is a sufficient injury in fact to satisfy article iii public citizen department of justice,holding that two advocacy organizations failure to obtain information subject to disclosure under the federal advisory committee act constitutes a sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing to sue 
in the context of this particular case,these general principles tell us two things on the one hand,congress plainly sought to curb the dissemination of false information by adopting procedures designed to decrease that risk.on the other hand,robins can not satisfy the demands of article iii by alleging a bare procedural violation.a violation of one of the fcra procedural requirements may result in no harm.for example,even if a consumer reporting agency fails to provide the required notice to a user of the agency consumer information,that information regardless may be entirely accurate.in addition,not all inaccuracies cause harm or present any material risk of harm.an example that comes readily to mind is an incorrect zip code.it is difficult to imagine how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code,without more,could work any concrete harm 
because the ninth circuit failed to fully appreciate the distinction between concreteness and particularization,its standing analysis was incomplete.it did not address the question framed by our discussion,namely,whether the particular procedural violations alleged in this case entail a degree of risk sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement.we take no position as to whether the ninth circuit ultimate conclusion that robins adequately alleged an injury in fact was correct.
the judgment of the court of appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice thomas,concurring.
the court vacates and remands to have the court of appeals determine whether the particular procedural violations alleged in this case entail a degree of risk sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement.ante,at.in defining what constitutes a concrete injury,the court explains that concrete means real,and not abstract,but is not necessarily synonymous with tangible.ante,at.
i join the court opinion.i write separately to explain how,in my view,the requirement applies to different types of rights.the judicial power of courts was historically limited depending on the nature of the plaintiff suit.courts more readily entertained suits from private plaintiffs who alleged a violation of their own rights,in contrast to private plaintiffs who asserted claims vindicating public rights.those limitations persist in modern standing doctrine.
standing doctrine limits the judicial power to cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to,and resolved by,the judicial process.vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,quoting steel citizens for a better environment.to understand the limits that standing imposes on the judicial power,therefore,we must refer directly to the traditional,fundamental limitations upon the powers of commonlaw courts.honig doe,scalia,dissenting.these limitations preserve separation of powers by preventing the judiciary entanglement in disputes that are primarily political in nature.this concern is generally absent when a private plaintiff seeks to enforce only his personal rights against another private party.
courts imposed different limitations on a plaintiff right to bring suit depending on the type of right the plaintiff sought to vindicate.historically,courts possessed broad power to adjudicate suits involving the alleged violation of private rights,even when plaintiffs alleged only the violation of those rights and nothing more.private rights are rights belonging to individuals,considered as individuals.blackstone,commentaries hereinafter blackstone.private rights have traditionally included rights of personal security including security of reputation,property rights,and contract rights.see,at woolhander nelson,does history defeat standing doctrine.in a suit for the violation of a private right,courts historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a de facto injury merely from having his personal,legal rights invaded.thus,when one man placed his foot on another property,the property owner needed to show nothing more to establish a traditional case or controversy.see entick carrington,wils,eng.many traditional remedies for causes of action such as for trespass,infringement of intellectual property,and unjust enrichment are not contingent on a plaintiff allegation of damages beyond the violation of his private legal right.see brief for restitution and remedies scholars as amici curiae see also webb portland,cas,me.stating that a legal injury imports damage in the nature of it internal quotation marks omitted.
courts,however,have required a further showing of injury for violations of public rights rights that involve duties owed to the whole community,considered as a community,in its social aggregate capacity.blackstone.such rights include free navigation of waterways,passage on public highways,and general compliance with regulatory law.woolhander nelson,at.generally,only the government had the authority to vindicate a harm borne by the public at large,such as the violation of the criminal laws.see,at.even in limited cases where private plaintiffs could bring a claim for the violation of public rights,they had to allege that the violation caused them some extraordinary damage,beyond the rest of the community.blackstone discussing nuisance see also commonwealth webb,an action to redress a public nuisance,for example,was historically considered an action to vindicate the violation of a public right at common law,lest every subject in the kingdom be able to harass the offender with separate actions.blackstone see also,at same.but if the plaintiff could allege special damage as the result of a nuisance,the suit could proceed.the existence of special,individualized damage had the effect of creating a private action for compensatory relief to an otherwise claim.see,at.similarly,a plaintiff had to allege individual damage in disputes over the use of public lands,robert marys case,eng,commoner must establish not only injuria legal injury but also damnum damage to challenge another overgrazing on the commons.
these differences between legal claims brought by private plaintiffs for the violation of public and private rights underlie modern standing doctrine and explain the court description of the requirement.injury in fact is the first of three irreducible requirements for article iii standing.lujan defenders of wildlife.the requirement often stymies a private plaintiff attempt to vindicate the infringement of public rights.the court has said time and again that,when a plaintiff seeks to vindicate a public right,the plaintiff must allege that he has suffered a concrete injury particular to himself.see schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,explaining this where plaintiffs sought to enforce the incompatibility clause,art.i,cl,against members of congress holding reserve commissions in the armed forces see also lujan,supra,at evaluating standing where plaintiffs sought to enforce the endangered species act friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc,clean water act.this requirement applies with special force when a plaintiff files suit to require an executive agency to follow the law at that point,the citizen must prove that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of that challenged action and it is not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public.ex parte levitt,per curiam.thus,in a case where private plaintiffs sought to compel the forest service to follow certain procedures when it regulated small and projects,we held that deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation is insufficient to create article iii standing,even if accorded by congress.summers earth island institute.
but the requirement does not apply as rigorously when a private plaintiff seeks to vindicate his own private rights.our contemporary decisions have not required a plaintiff to assert an actual injury beyond the violation of his personal legal rights to satisfy the requirement.see,carey piphus,holding that nominal damages are appropriate when a plaintiff constitutional rights have been infringed but he can not show further injury.
the concerns underlying our decisions are not implicated when private individuals sue to redress violations of their own private rights.but,when they are implicated,standing doctrine keeps courts out of political disputes by denying private litigants the right to test the abstract legality of government action.see schlesinger,supra,at.and by limiting congress ability to delegate law enforcement authority to private plaintiffs and the courts,standing doctrine preserves executive discretion.see lujan,supra,at to permit congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive officers compliance with the law into an individual right vindicable in the courts is to permit congress to transfer from the president to the courts the chief executive most important constitutional duty,to take care that the laws be faithfully executed but where one private party has alleged that another private party violated his private rights,there is generally no danger that the private party suit is an impermissible attempt to police the activity of the political branches or,more broadly,that the legislative branch has impermissibly delegated law enforcement authority from the executive to a private individual.see hessick,standing,injury in fact,and private rights,cornell.
when congress creates new private causes of action to vindicate private or public rights,these article iii principles circumscribe federal courts power to adjudicate a suit alleging the violation of those new legal rights.congress can create new private rights and authorize private plaintiffs to sue based simply on the violation of those private rights.see warth seldin.a plaintiff seeking to vindicate a statutorily created private right need not allege actual harm beyond the invasion of that private right.see havens realty coleman,recognizing standing for a violation of the fair housing act tennessee power tva,recognizing that standing can exist where the right invaded is a legal right,one of property,one arising out of contract,one protected against tortious invasion,or one founded on a statute which confers a privilege a plaintiff seeking to vindicate a public right embodied in a federal statute,however,must demonstrate that the violation of that public right has caused him a concrete,individual harm distinct from the general population.see lujan,supra,at noting that,whatever the scope of congress power to create new legal rights,it is clear that in suits against the government,at least,the concrete injury requirement must remain thus,congress can not authorize private plaintiffs to enforce public rights in their own names,absent some showing that the plaintiff has suffered a concrete harm particular to him.
given these principles,i agree with the court decision to vacate and remand.the fair credit reporting act creates a series of regulatory duties.robins has no standing to sue spokeo,in his own name,for violations of the duties that spokeo owes to the public collectively,absent some showing that he has suffered concrete and particular harm.see supra,at.these consumer protection requirements include,for example,the requirement to post a telephone number on spokeo website through which consumers can request free annual file disclosures.app,first amended complaint see cfr a.
but a remand is required because one claim in robins complaint rests on a statutory provision that could arguably establish a private cause of action to vindicate the violation of a privately held right.section b requires robins to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.b emphasis added.if congress has created a private duty owed personally to robins to protect his information,then the violation of the legal duty suffices for article iii injury in fact.if that provision,however,vests any and all consumers with the power to police the reasonable procedures of spokeo,without more,then robins has no standing to sue for its violation absent an allegation that he has suffered individualized harm.on remand,the court of appeals can consider the nature of this claim.

justice ginsburg,with whom justice sotomayor joins,dissenting.
in the fair credit reporting act of fcra or act,et,congress required consumer reporting agencies,whenever preparing a consumer report,to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.b.to promote adherence to the act procedural requirements,congress granted adversely affected consumers a right to sue noncomplying reporting agencies.willful noncompliance negligent noncompliance thomas robins instituted suit against spokeo,alleging that spokeo was a reporting agency governed by the fcra,and that spokeo maintains on its web site an inaccurate consumer report about robins.app.
in particular,robins alleged that spokeo posted a picture purport ing to be an image of robins that was not in fact of him,and incorrectly reported that robins was in his,married,employed in a professional or technical field,and has children.at.robins further alleged that spokeo profile of him continues to misrepresent that he has a graduate degree,that his economic health is very strong,and that his wealth level is in the top.ibid.spokeo displayed that erroneous information,robins asserts,when he was out of work and actively seeking employment.ibid.because of the misinformation,robins stated,he encountered imminent and ongoing actual harm to his employment prospects.ibid as robins elaborated on brief,spokeo report made him appear overqualified for jobs he might have gained,expectant of a higher salary than employers would be willing to pay,and less mobile because of family responsibilities.see brief for respondent.
i agree with much of the court opinion.robins,the court holds,meets the particularity requirement for standing under article iii.
