defendant state officials appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york lawrence kahn,district judge permanently enjoining enforcement of a new york state statute against plaintiff consolidated edison company of new york,con ed on the grounds that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the bill of attainder clause of article i,section of the united states constitution.we affirm solely on the basis of art.i,but remand to the district court to correct a scrivener error in the judgment.
background 
plaintiff con ed is a public utility that provides electrical power to new york city.among con ed power plants is the indian point nuclear generating facility located in westchester county,new york.the statute at the heart of this appeal was enacted in response to a power outage at caused by a defective generator.
until recently,produced electricity with four model steam generators that con ed had purchased from the westinghouse corporation westinghouse in.in the late,westinghouse learned that the steam generator tubes on both its model and steam generators were subject to corrosion and failure.by,seven of the eight nuclear power plants using the model had replaced their generators.although other power plants apparently continued to use the similarly flawed model steam generators,only continued to use the flawed model generators.con ed purchased replacement generators for in,but,prior to the incident at issue in this litigation,had never installed them.
on february,a steam tube in one of model developed a crack which released radioactive steam into the surrounding nonradioactive water that is converted to steam to turn turbines.a subsequent investigation by the federal nuclear regulatory commission nrc and the new york state public service commission psc or the commission revealed no evidence of elevated radiation levels offsite due to the incident.the cracked tube was promptly discovered and con ed took offline to replace the generator.by january,it had finished replacing the damaged generator with one purchased in and restarted.to cover electricity demand while was offline,con ed was forced to purchase electricity from other sources.
con ed operates in a complex regulatory environment.the public health and safety aspects of its operations are regulated by the nrc under the atomic energy act of,et.the rates that con ed charges its customers are regulated by the psc,an independent state regulatory body created early in the twentieth century.
a settlement agreement resolved a number of outstanding disputes between con ed and the psc that have no bearing on this appeal.the agreement amended con ed rate and was adopted in the form of a rate order by consent.of relevance to this appeal,the agreement includes a fuel adjustment clause fac,which allows con ed to pass certain costs along to its ratepayers in the form of temporary rate increases.con ed authority to pass costs through to ratepayers under the fac is subject to statutory review by the psc to determine whether those costs are prudently or reasonably incurred,in order to ensure just and reasonable rates.pub.serv.law k see long island lighting pub.serv.comm n.the psc is empowered to bar con ed from passing imprudently incurred costs along to ratepayers and to force the utility to refund imprudently incurred costs already recouped.pub.serv.law k.
pursuant to the fac,con ed increased its rates to incorporate the cost of purchasing replacement electricity and the other costs associated with the outage.soon after the incident,the psc staff began a prudence investigation of the outage,and on march,the psc itself initiated a prudence review.it is our understanding that this review is still incomplete as of the issuance of this opinion.
on february,three days after the outage,the new york state assembly issued a notice of a joint public hearing of the assembly committees of energy,environmental conservation,and corporations,authorities,and commissions,to be held on a variety of topics related to the outage and con ed operation of.the notice listed potential topics including the environmental effects of the incident,deterioration of facilities at,the need for greater regulatory oversight of nuclear power in new york,and the potential sale of the plant.the hearing was held on march,and it covered the range of topics listed in the notice.con ed chief operating officer,michael evans,and its vice president of maintenance and construction,stephen quinn,testified.they later supplemented their testimony in a letter to several members of the committee.
on march,representatives brodsky and silver introduced the bill that is the subject of the present lawsuit.see,assembly.one week later,on march,the assembly and senate passed the bill without amendment.governor pataki signed it into law on august as chapter of the laws of chapter.see act of,ch,laws,hereinafter,laws.chapter reads,in full,as follows 
declaration of legislative findings.the operator of a nuclear generating facility has a high duty of care to protect the health,safety and economic interests of its customers.rate regulation of nuclear operators should discourage the taking of risks with regard to potential threats to public health and safety.
by continuing to operate steam generators known to be defective,and thereby increasing the risk of a radioactive release an expensive plant outage,the consolidated edison company failed to exercise reasonable care on behalf of the health,safety and economic interests of its customers.therefore it would not be in the public interest for the company to recover from ratepayers any costs resulting from the february,outage at the indian point nuclear facility.
with respect to the february,outage at the indian point nuclear facility,the new york state public service commission shall prohibit the consolidated edison company from recovering from its ratepayers any costs associated with replacing the power from such facility.such prohibition shall apply to any such costs incurred until the conclusion of such outage,or incurred at any time until all defective steam generation equipment at the facility has been replaced,whichever occurs later.such prohibition shall apply to automatic adjustment mechanisms as well as base rates or any other rate recovery mechanism.the commission shall order the company to refund any such costs which have been recovered from ratepayers.
this act shall take effect immediately.
the psc has estimated that con ed would have been able to pass on to its customers approximately million in increased costs that chapter requires it to internalize.
on august,con ed filed suit in the district court for the northern district of new york,seeking a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction barring enforcement of the statute on various constitutional grounds and on august moved for a preliminary injunction.con ed alleged that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the bill of attainder clause of article i,section,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment alleging a violation of procedural due process and an uncompensated taking,the supremacy clause,and the contracts clause of article i,section.on september,the district court granted a motion by representative brodsky,a member of the assembly,and representative silver,the speaker of the assembly,to intervene in the suit.
in a memorandum order dated october,the district court granted con ed request for a permanent injunction and denied as moot con ed motion for a preliminary injunction.con ed pataki,d.the district court agreed with con ed that the statute violated the equal protection clause,finding that chapter was not rationally related to the state legitimate interest in deterring negligence at nuclear power plants.id.at.the district court also held that chapter constituted an impermissible bill of attainder because the statute named con ed and was the product of a legislative intent to punish con ed.id.at.the court expressly refused to reach con ed other constitutional claims.after judgment was entered on december,the defendants appealed.
discussion 
because we conclude that chapter is an unconstitutional bill of attainder,we affirm the district court.we need not and do not address con ed other constitutional theories 
i.the bill of attainder clause of article i,section 
the constitution includes two clauses prohibiting enactment of bills of attainder section applies to congress,section to the states.see const.art.i.the history of bills of attainder and of pains and penalties in england which gave rise to the constitutional prohibitions in and,has been aptly described elsewhere,and we see no need to reiterate it here.see in re extradition of mcmullen,cir in banc.briefly stated,a constitutionally proscribed bill of attainder is a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.nixon adm r of,d see also united states lovett.l egislative acts,no matter what their form,that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the constitution.put another way,the clause bars the imposition of punishment resulting from trial by legislature.united states brown,d.
under the definition quoted above from nixon,a statute can be a bill of attainder only if it determines guilt and inflicts punishment,upon an identifiable individual,and without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.nixon,at.in the present case,the lack of a judicial trial is incontrovertible.chapter was enacted by the state legislature using purely legislative processes,without any additional protections akin to those present in a judicial trial.at issue,then,are only the questions of whether con ed,singled out as it was by chapter,is an individual that may invoke the protection of the clause,chapter determines guilt,and chapter inflicts punishment.we answer all three questions in the affirmative 
a.the clause applicability to corporations 
chapter unquestionably singles out con ed the utility is expressly named in the statute.the legislator defendants argue,however,that the bill of attainder clause applies only to legislation that targets natural persons,not corporations such as con ed.we disagree.
although a corporation is an artificial being,invisible,intangible,and existing only in contemplation of law,dartmouth coll.woodward,wheat,a wide variety of constitutional rights may be asserted by corporations.see,metro.life ins.ward,d equal protection marshall barlow,d reasonable search and seizure united states martin linen supply,d double jeopardy.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d freedom of speech.nevertheless,not all constitutional protections apply to corporations or apply as fully as they do to natural persons.see,united states morton salt.privacy wilson united states.fifth amendment privilege against.the distinction between rights that may be asserted by corporations and those that may not is that c ertain purely personal guarantees are unavailable to corporations and other organizations because the historic function of the particular guarantee has been limited to the protection of individuals.first bank of boston bellotti,d.whether a right is purely personal depends on its nature,history,and purpose.id.
the applicability of the bill of attainder clause to corporations remains unsettled in every circuit.without directly ruling on the question,the supreme court has stated,without discussion,that the clause provides protections for individual persons and private groups,those who are peculiarly vulnerable to nonjudicial determinations of guilt,south carolina katzenbach,d emphasis added.a corporation shares some of the characteristics of a private group,but we need not decide whether corporations are included within the category of private groups because the reference to private groups plainly contemplates protection for some entities in addition to individual natural persons.the court has also indicated in dictum that a bill of attainder may target a single individual or firm.plaut spendthrift farm,d emphasis added.no court of appeals has held as much,though several have expressly assumed without deciding that the clause is applicable to corporations,finding the clause inapplicable in the particular cases for other reasons.see club misty,laski,cir navegar,united states,sbc communications,fcc,cir.for several reasons,we think the protection afforded by the bill of attainder clauses is not a purely personal guarantee and therefore is one of the constitutional rights enjoyed by corporations.
first,the historical function of the clause has been to ensure the procedural protections of the judicial process for the attribution of guilt and imposition of punishment.see nixon,at.brown,at.lovett,at.cummings missouri,wall.that guarantee is closely related to the right to procedural due process.see coniston village of hoffman estates,cir discussing the relationship between procedural due process rights and the prohibition on bills of attainder see also screws united states.stating that it is plain that basic to the concept of due process of law in a criminal case is a trial in a court of law.the right to procedural due process has been applied to corporations.see,helicopteros nacionales de,hall,d 
second,the cases in which the court has refused to apply constitutional rights to corporations have uniformly involved competing state interests in regulating corporate conduct and investigating corporate wrongdoing,which depend on a high degree of transparency.wilson united states,in which the court held the fifth amendment privilege against inapplicable to corporations,rested its holding primarily on the visitatorial power that remains vested in the state after it grants a corporation its charter.see at.likewise,in united states morton salt,the court justified its decision that corporations enjoy narrower rights to privacy by the state interest in investigating corporate wrongdoing agencies have a legitimate right to satisfy themselves that corporate behavior is consistent with the law and the public interest.at.unlike visitatorial powers which do not directly affect the bottom line,punishment necessarily affects shareholder assets.although new york unquestionably has an interest in investigating,regulating,and prosecuting the malfeasance of corporations within its borders,it has no interest in inflicting punishment for such malfeasance on the corporation shareholders through the legislative process.indeed,in the instant circumstances,a agency,the psc,has an existing administrative procedure to vindicate the interest in exploring utilities wrongdoing the prudence review process.that process addresses the state interest in investigating and punishing utilities misfeasance,and to the extent it does not do so adequately,the legislature may enact generally applicable legislation modifying that process.
because punishment can frequently take the form of economic injury,a comparison with the takings clause of the fifth amendment is apt.the protection against targeted economic injury in the takings clause is fully applicable to corporations.see,united states acres of land,cir.for both the takings clause and the bill of attainder clauses,if the protections did not extend to corporations,their protections would be significantly undermined for individuals.when a corporation suffers an economic injury,its shareholders suffer the same economic injury.in order to protect shareholders from the economic injuries prohibited by the takings clause and the bill of attainder clauses,corporations must be allowed to raise the clauses directly.
we have been unable to unearth any case in which a corporation has ultimately prevailed in challenging legislation as a bill of finding a bill of attainder targeting any party are extraordinarily rare.nevertheless,bills of attainder historically have targeted corporations as well as natural persons.con ed cites several english statutes that imposed disabilities on english boroughs,hardly natural persons.see,geo,eng.moreover,one of the types of punishment most frequently imposed by bills of pains and penalties,punitive confiscation of private property,see selective serv.pub.interest research group,d,is one that may injure a corporation in the same way it injures an individual.indus.of,kelco disposal,d,concurring in part and dissenting in part arguing that eighth amendment excessive fines clause applies to corporations,in part because a corporation,as an entity,may be subject to such penalties.
we therefore hold that corporations must be considered individual s,nixon,at,that may not be singled out for punishment under the bill of attainder clause in article i,section.
retrospective focus guilt 
another indispensible element of a bill of attainder is its retrospective focus it defines past conduct as wrongdoing and then imposes punishment on that past conduct.see nixon,at.cummings,wall.at.such a bill attributes guilt to the party or parties singled out in the legislation.see nixon,at.de veau braisted,d the distinguishing feature of a bill of attainder is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt.cummings,wall.at in enacting a bill of attainder the legislative body assumes judicial magistracy it pronounces upon the guilt of the party,without any of the forms or safeguards of trial.
although on its face chapter does not speak in terms of guilt or innocence,we have no doubt that the legislature considered con ed guilty of wrongdoing in allowing the outage to occur.the primary evidence of this is the statute focus on con ed conduct related to a single,past incident,the outage,as the basis for the sanction it imposes.chapter makes explicit findings about the outage and concludes that the consolidated edison company failed to exercise reasonable care on behalf of the health,safety and economic interests of its customers.laws.the legislature response is also limited to the incident,prohibiting con ed from recovering from its ratepayers any costs associated with replacing the power from such facility.laws.the statute thus imposes liability determined by no previous law or fixed rule.lovett,at.internal quotation marks omitted.although an established procedure existed for determining whether con ed had been imprudent in incurring the costs associated with the outage,the legislature bypassed it and,in a single stroke,found guilt on the facts of con ed case.the legislature,as the source of the psc authority,retains the power to reclaim authority over from the psc.however,the decision to bypass the psc reinforces our conclusion that the legislature decision was to find guilt and order punishment directly.
the retrospective focus of chapter is essential to our determination that the statute is a bill of attainder.the power of legislatures to enact purely prospective changes to utility rates,even to the rates of a single utility,is considerably broader than their authority to act retrospectively.
punishment 
to invalidate legislation as a bill of attainder,the bill of attainder clause requires not merely singling out but also punishment.plaut,at.accord nixon,at.holding that the act fact that it refers to appellant by not automatically offend the bill of attainder clause.a legislature may legitimately create a class of one for many purposes,see,nixon,at,but not for punishment.we therefore must ascertain whether chapter punishes con ed.
punishment of wrongdoing is,of course,a legitimate state interest reflected in the penal laws of the fifty states.where a statute establishing a punishment declares and imposes that punishment on an identifiable party,however,the bill of attainder clauses undermine the usual solicitude we have for such purposes.in such cases,we look beyond simply a rational relationship of the statute to a legitimate public purpose for less burdensome alternatives by which the legislature could have achieved its legitimate nonpunitive objectives.nixon,at.
legislated punishment is not always easy to identify outside the traditional punishments of death or incarceration.neither the fact that harm is inflicted by governmental authority,lovett,at.frankfurter,concurring,nor the severity of the sanction is determinative of its character as punishment,flemming nestor,d.indeed,as traditionally conceived,punishment implicates a variety of values that,in other contexts,bear no necessary relation to punishment.for example,a judicial order of compensation in a negligence action imposes harm on the must pay the damage that harm is merely compensatory for the plaintiff injury,not punitive.compensation may be part of a punishment,on the other hand,as where a criminal defendant is ordered to make restitution to his victim.similarly,deterrence may be a legitimate,nonpunitive goal,such as deterrence of unreasonable conduct produced by a damages award for it is also a core component of punishment.see,brown,at.retribution may be one value that is limited to the arena of punishment,but it is not a necessary part of punishment.see selective serv,at.brown,at.it would be archaic to limit the definition of punishment to retribution.
the supreme court articulated three factors to guide a court determination of whether a statute directed at a named or readily identifiable party is punitive whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment whether the statute,viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed,reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes and whether the legislative record evinces a legislative intent to punish.selective serv,at.quoting nixon,at.nixon makes it clear that a statute need not fit all three factors to be considered a bill of attainder rather,those factors are the evidence that is weighed together in resolving a bill of attainder claim.nixon,at.the party challenging the statute has the burden of establish ing that the legislature action constituted punishment and not merely the legitimate regulation of conduct.id.at.unfortunately,because the supreme court bill of attainder jurisprudence is limited,it provides us with little guidance for determining whether a statute is impermissibly punitive.
traditional punishments 
we look first to the infamous history of bills of attainder to determine whether chapter imposes the sorts of deprivations and disabilities so disproportionately severe and so inappropriate to nonpunitive ends that they unquestionably have been held to fall within the proscription of the clause.id.at.some types of legislatively imposed harm,in other words,are considered to be punitive per se.the classic example is death,but others include imprisonment,banishment,the punitive confiscation of property,and prohibition of designated individuals or groups from participation in specified employments or vocations.id.at.accord selective serv,at.
the only traditional punishment implicated here is punitive confiscation of property.on the one hand,chapter clearly deprived con ed of a property interest by prohibiting the ordinarily permitted of costs.all told,chapter deprives con ed of approximately million that it would otherwise have been able to obtain from its customers.on the other,we are not certain that a deprivation is the same thing as a confiscation,and indeed,the supreme court has held that an adverse decision is not confiscatory for the purposes of the takings clause unless it produces an overall unfair rate of return for the utility.see duquesne light barasch,d.
a statute need not fit within the historical category of punishment to be considered such.such a rule would render the clauses unable to respond to attempts by contemporary legislatures to punish individuals in new and heretofore unforeseen ways.see nixon,at.we need not resolve this close question to conclude that chapter is nonetheless a bill of attainder.accordingly,we do not decide whether chapter imposes a traditional attainder and turn instead to the next component of the test.
the functional test nonpunitive statutory goals 
the second component of the supreme court test is functional,looking to 
whether the law under challenge,viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed,reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes where such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear,it is reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decisionmakers.
see also flemming,at.describing inability to discern any alternative nonpunitive purpose which the statute could be thought to serve as a basis for finding a statute to be punitive citing trop dulles,d plurality opinion brown,at.white,dissenting the imposition of a particularly harsh deprivation without any discernible legitimate legislative purpose has been characterized as penal.in doing so,we inquire into the existence of less burdensome alternatives by which the legislature could have achieved its legitimate nonpunitive objectives.nixon,at.try as we may,we can discern no wholly purpose to justify the entire prohibition in chapter.
to be sure,part of the statute prohibition has an arguably purpose.by preventing con ed from passing through the costs associated with the outage that it would not have incurred ordinarily,the legislature prevented con ed ratepayers from being forced to bear costs that the legislature viewed as negligently incurred.con ed would be forced to compensate its ratepayers for costs passed through prior to chapter enactment and could not force ratepayers to bear any further due to the outage.this is not necessarily a punitive purpose.the legislature could legitimately conclude that,as between con ed,the party that caused the outage,and the ratepayers,parties having nothing whatsoever to do with the outage,con ed should bear the costs attributable to its negligence.the legislature could decide that it would be unfair to force ratepayers to absorb the costs of con ed error.if such a conclusion were reached by a court in a negligence action,for instance,no one would reasonably conclude that the court had punished con ed this is a distributional fairness rationale that has nothing inherently to do with punishment.
nevertheless,eliminating harm to innocent third parties is a purpose consistent with punishment.see brown,at.noting that a number of english bills of attainder were enacted for preventive purposes.however,because there is a clear component to,we think that,if that were all that chapter did,it would be insufficient to justify a conclusion that the statute punishes con ed.
chapter also functions to deter similar conduct by con ed and other public utilities in the future.by forcing con ed to absorb the costs of the outage,the statute encourages con ed and other utilities to be more diligent thereafter in avoiding similar outages.in this respect,chapter serves an function.as a regulated monopoly,con ed does not face the same incentives to minimize costs as does an actor in a competitive market.indeed,that fact is the basic justification of regulation of such monopolies the state may act to encourage the monopoly to minimize costs as if it were faced with competition.see paul samuelson william nordhaus,economics ed.chapter can be viewed,in part,as accomplishing that regulatory function,enhancing economic efficiency rather than punishing con ed for wrongdoing.state regulation of utilities to promote economic efficiency is a longstanding and unquestionably legitimate goal of state legislation.see new orleans pub,council of new orleans,d t he regulation of utilities is one of the most important of the functions traditionally associated with the police power of the states.quoting.coop.pub.serv.comm n,d alteration in original.
chapter might also deter negligent conduct with an eye toward protecting public health the legislative findings in chapter focus to a considerable extent on the potential threats to public health and safety from nuclear power plant accidents.laws.all other things being equal,this would be an ample justification for the deterrent function of chapter.however,the field of public health and safety regulation of nuclear power generation has been occupied by congress through the atomic energy act,et,and therefore any regulation in that area by the states is preempted.see pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d suffolk county long island lighting,cir.consequently,we can not consider public health and safety as a valid,justification for chapter.
general and specific deterrence are also traditional justifications for punishment,however.see selective serv,at.punishment is not limited solely to retribution for past events,but may involve deprivations inflicted to deter future misconduct.wayne lafave austin scott,substantive criminal law,a.if the entirety of the prohibition served the function described above,we might be willing to conclude that chapter deterrent function was.our view of the type and severity of burdens imposed,nixon,at,by chapter,however,leads us to a different conclusion.
our reading of the record and statements made by counsel at oral argument indicate that some indefinite but quite substantial proportion of the costs that con ed has sought to pass through to its ratepayers that are denied by chapter could have been passed through unchallenged if con ed had installed the new generators in the ordinary course of business at any time after they received them in.to install new generators,con ed must take offline for an extended period of time.during this period,con ed must purchase power on the open market to cover the lost generating capacity at.further,con ed would have to pay the cost of labor and parts necessary to remove the old generators and install the new ones.these costs would be incurred whenever the generators are replaced,whether during scheduled maintenance prior to the generators failure or,as here,after that failure had occurred.such costs are ordinary to the business and thus may be ordinarily passed through.
of course,there would be some differences in the costs incurred during a scheduled outage and those incurred during an accidental outage.the failure might cause damage to other facility components,which would need to be repaired or replaced.there may be some differences in the cost of labor between a scheduled and unscheduled replacement for instance,con ed might be required to pay more overtime to workers in the event of an unplanned outage.the cost of power would also likely differ between the time at which a scheduled outage could have occurred and the time at which the accidental outage occurred.indeed,if con ed had replaced the generators during a planned outage,it presumably would have intentionally timed the outage to coincide with a period of reduced energy prices.the bulk of the labor and costs under either scenario,however,appear to be the same 
it is undisputed that con ed would have been allowed to pass through to ratepayers the costs of covering power demand while replacing the generators during a scheduled outage.what,then,we must ask,other than punishment can justify forcing con ed to absorb those same costs after the accidental outage neither of the legitimate purposes set out of harm to ratepayers and deterrence of inefficient,monopolistic justify preventing con ed from passing these costs along to ratepayers.it does not protect ratepayers from,or compensate them for,new unjustified costs,because those costs would have been incurred even if con ed had acted as a prudent,model corporate citizen.nor does it deter con ed or other utilities from incurring excess costs in the future if con ed were faced with precisely the same situation in the future,it might be discouraged from delaying the installation of replacement generators,but in acting more quickly it would incur substantially the same costs that it now is being precluded from passing through to its ratepayers.there is no connection between these costs and the sort of lax monopolistic conduct that utility regulation would ordinarily seek to deter.
moreover,there are plainly less burdensome alternatives by which the legislature could have achieved its legitimate nonpunitive objectives.nixon,at.the legislature easily could have tailored chapter to exclude from the prohibition those substantial costs that would have been incurred absent mi
