this appeal concerns the proposed use of a public school building for sunday worship services by an evangelical christian church.courts often struggle to reconcile the principle of equal access to government buildings with a competing principle of american public life,that is,the separation of church and state.in the case before us,the district court resolved this tension in favor of allowing religious speech on public property.recent supreme court precedent requires that we affirm.
background 
prior legal proceedings 
plaintiff,the bronx household of faith church,is an evangelical christian church founded in and located in the bronx,new york.plaintiffs robert hall and jack roberts are its.this litigation represents plaintiffs second attempt to compel defendants,the board of education of the city of new york and community school district collectively defendants or appellants,to allow plaintiffs to rent space in public school,anne cross mersereau middle school middle school,for sunday morning meetings that include,at least in part,activities that may be characterized fairly as religious worship.
plaintiffs first application to rent space in middle school was rejected by defendants in,resulting in litigation between the present plaintiffs and defendants in the southern district of new york.in that case,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.bronx household of faith cmty.sch.dist,civ,wl.we affirmed,and the supreme court denied certiorari.bronx household of faith cmty.sch.dist,cir,cert.denied,d bronx household i.
in plaintiffs again applied for use of space in middle school and,when their application was denied,brought the present action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska.the plaintiffs central point before the district court was that the supreme court decision in good news club milford central school,d,effectively overruled our holding in bronx household plaintiffs contend that,as a result,the education board policy of excluding community groups from renting school premises for purposes of religious services or religious instruction while allowing most other types of community groups to hold their first amendment right to freedom of speech.
agreeing that plaintiffs were substantially likely to prevail on the merits of their claim,judge preska granted their motion for a preliminary injunction.bronx household of faith bd.of,d bronx household ii.the preliminary injunction enjoins defendants from enforcing the new york city board of education standard operating procedure so as to deny plaintiffs application to rent space in a public school operated by the board of education for morning meetings that include religious worship or the application of any individual or entity.from the grant of this preliminary injunction,defendants appeal.the district court and we denied defendants application for a stay pending appeal.
in reviewing the grant of this preliminary injunction,we revisit a dispute that is no stranger to this court.although we have reached the merits in this litigation previously,the issues now raised return to us in a different procedural posture,requiring employment of a different standard of review than that used in bronx household i.the instant litigation also arises against a backdrop of additional supreme court precedent.in good news club,a recent school and religion case with facts that parallel in many respects those here,the supreme court held that quintessentially religious activities could be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint.at.the supreme court also reiterated in its good news club decision that speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects can not be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint.id.at.the defendants in this case,like the defendant in good news club,have opened the relevant limited public forum to the teaching of morals and character development.accordingly,we affirm and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.
on july,plaintiffs wrote to the school district renewing their prior request to rent middle school,citing the supreme court good news club decision as the basis for the renewed request.plaintiffs sought to meet at the school from to each sunday morning,beginning on september,to engage in singing,the teaching of adults and children from the viewpoint of the bible,and social interaction among the members of the church,in order to promote their welfare and the welfare of the community.
frank pagliuca,director of school facilities and planning for the school district,responded in writing to the church request,stating that it appeared to intend to use the school for the same,weekly worship service that the school district had denied in.pagliuca letter reminded plaintiffs that the district prior denial was upheld by the federal appeals court,and advised them that if plaintiffs intended different usage than before,they should submit additional information.plaintiffs state that on august,their counsel was informed by deborah king,an attorney for the board of education,that defendants were denying the church request for rental space because the meetings would violate the defendants policy prohibiting religious services or instruction in the school buildings.
although in this second request to rent space in middle school,the church did not describe its proposed use as religious service or religious instruction likening it instead to other uses permitted under school board school board correctly perceived that plaintiffs were,in substance,renewing their prior request to conduct activities that included a weekly worship service.plaintiffs have since offered a fuller description of the activities in which they seek to engage 
the sunday morning meetings service consists of the singing of christian hymns and songs,prayer,fellowship with other church members and biblical preaching and teaching,communion,sharing of testimonies and social fellowship among the church members.
in our church service,we seek to give honor and praise to our lord and savior jesus christ in everything that we do.to that end we sing songs and hymns of praise to our lord.we read the bible and the pastors teach from it because it tells us about god,what he wants us to do and how we should live our lives in keeping with ancient tradition,we have a light fellowship meal after the service,which consists basically of coffee,juice and bagels.this gives us opportunity to meet new people,talk to one another,share one another joys and sorrows so as to be a mutual help and comfort to each other.
the sunday morning meeting is the indispensable integration point for our church.it provides the theological framework to engage in activities that benefit the welfare of the community.those who attend the sunday morning meetings are taught to love their neighbors as themselves,to defend the weak and disenfranchised,and to help the poor regardless of their particular beliefs.it is a venue where people can come to talk about their particular problems and needs.over the years we have helped people with basic needs such as food,clothing,and rent.we have also provided,by means of counseling,friendship and encouragement,help for people to get out of the welfare cycle,to lead productive lives,to leave a life of crime drugs to become responsible citizens,and to counsel people whose personal finances are out of control.
in one recent case we helped an individual who was about to get evicted it is through the sunday meeting where we directly or indirectly learn of these situations and where we can converse with the individuals involved in order to monitor the progress of the issue to be resolved.
in years past,the church meeting was a very important place for cambodian refugees to come in order for us to get to know them so that we could help them with food,clothing and to help them get acclimated to american society.most of them were buddhists.
the sunday morning meetings of the church are open to all members of the public.the church currently conducts its sunday meetings in a large house or outdoors under a tent or canopy.the church also owns a vacant lot and asserts that it eventually intends to construct its own building.
the school district denial of the church request to rent school and again in based on the education board standard operating procedures sop manual that sets forth a hierarchy of permitted uses of school facilities.according to the sop manual,the primary use of school premises must be for programs and activities of the board of education.after the board programs and activities,school premises may be used for a variety of community activities,including social,civic and recreational meetings and entertainment,and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community,as long as these uses are and open to the general public.
section of the sop as section at the time of bronx household any outside organization or group from conducting religious services or religious instruction on school premises after school.the same section permits the use of school premises for the purpose of discussing religious material or material which contains a religious viewpoint or for distributing such material.
the school district has over the years permitted a variety of organizations to use school premises for meetings and activities after school hours and on weekends.examples of organizations that received such permission during the school year include girl scouts the mosholu community center,which organizes sports and other recreational activities university heights,which sponsored sports events,holiday shows and activities relating to black history month and lehman college,which held classes in teaching english as a second language.at the same time,the school district has never granted an application seeking to use school facilities for religious services.
we pass now to a discussion of the rules governing the issuance of a preliminary injunction in general,and then apply those rules to this case.
discussion 
i standard of review 
a district court grant of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.such an abuse occurs when the district court bases its ruling on an incorrect legal standard or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts.see too,gemmy indus,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states gypsum.in cases raising first amendment issues,an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.bose consumers union of united states,d quoting new york times sullivan,d.
to obtain a preliminary injunction a party must demonstrate that it will be irreparably harmed if an injunction is not granted,and either a a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation,and a balance of the hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.see forest city daly,town of north hempstead,cir.where the requested preliminary injunction would stay government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory it does less rigorous burden of proof standard envisioned by the phrase fair ground for litigation does not apply,and instead the party seeking injunctive relief must satisfy the more rigorous prong of likelihood of success.this higher standard of proof requires judicial deference to those regulations developed through reasoned democratic processes.see id.
moreover,an even higher standard of proof comes into play when the injunction sought will alter rather than maintain the status quo.in such case,the movant must show a clear or substantial likelihood of success.see rodriguez ex rel.rodriguez debuono,cir per curiam.because the plaintiffs here sought an injunction that commands a positive act that alters the status quo,the district court correctly required that plaintiffs demonstrate a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits.
ii irreparable harm 
in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion in the grant of injunctive relief,we first address the issue of irreparable harm.in finding irreparable harm,the district court observed that the plaintiffs claims implicate first amendment speech rights that are the bedrock of our liberties,and concluded that the church will suffer serious damage were an injunction not to issue.although t he loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,elrod burns,d,we have not consistently presumed irreparable harm in cases involving allegations of the abridgement of first amendment rights,see amandola town of babylon,cir per curiam.
on the one hand,we have said that since violations of first amendment rights are presumed to be irreparable,the allegation of a first amendment violation satisfies the irreparable injury requirement.tunick safir,cir.on the other hand,we have suggested that,even when a complaint alleges first amendment injuries,irreparable harm must still be than simply establishing an actual chilling effect.see latino officers ass safir,cir.
whatever tension may be said to exist in our case law regarding whether irreparable harm may be presumed with respect to complaints alleging first amendment violations,we think is more apparent than real.where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or regulation that directly limits speech,the irreparable nature of the harm may be presumed.for example,in tunick an artist was denied a city permit to conduct a photographic shoot of nude models on a residential street.at.in bery city of new york,cir,groups of visual artists opposed enforcement of a city regulation prohibiting them from exhibiting or selling their work in public places without a general vendor license under the regulation,only a limited number of the licenses could be in effect at any time.id.at.in both cases the challenged government action directly limited speech and irreparable harm was presumed.see tunick,at bery,at.
in contrast,in instances where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or regulation that may only potentially affect speech,the plaintiff must establish a causal link between the injunction sought and the alleged injury,that is,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the injunction will prevent the feared deprivation of free speech rights.the supreme court instructs us on this issue in laird tatum,d,that to establish a cognizable claim founded on the chilling of first amendment rights,a party must articulate a specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.id.at.
thus,in latino officers ass n,plaintiffs challenged a police department requirements that all officers notify the department of their intention to speak before a governmental agency or a private organization about department policy,and that they provide an summary of their comments.at.we found the theoretical possibility of a chilling effect on officers speech too conjectural and insufficient to establish irreparable harm.id.at.in charette town of oyster bay,cir,we ruled the record insufficient to decide a topless bar operator motion to enjoin enforcement of a zoning regulation that resulted in the bar closing.the record contained no evidence indicating how soon after the issuance of the injunction,if at all,the bar could be reopened.id.at,see also am.postal workers union,postal,cir reversing a preliminary injunction enjoining employee discharge pending arbitration because discharge did not chill first amendment rights of members of union sufficiently to cause irreparable harm.
here,the alleged deprivation of plaintiffs first amendment rights results directly from a policy of the defendant board of education that prohibits religious services or religious instruction in school facilities.since it is this policy that led to a denial of the church request to rent space in middle school and directly limits plaintiffs speech,irreparable harm may be presumed.because the plaintiffs allegations entitle them to a presumption of irreparable harm,the district court finding that the plaintiffs have fulfilled this requirement for the issuance of a preliminary injunction can not be said to be an abuse of discretion.
iii likelihood of success on the merits 
given that plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable harm,we now reach the more difficult issue of whether the district court properly found that plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of success on the merits.as noted earlier,because they seek an injunction that alters rather than preserves the status quo plaintiffs must satisfy a more rigorous standard of proof and demonstrate a clear or substantial likelihood of such success.rodriguez,at.
in determining whether defendants denial of the plaintiffs application to rent the school violates plaintiffs first amendment rights,we tread familiar ground.faced with the same parties and identical facts,we reached the merits of this issue in bronx household i,upholding the district court summary judgment ruling in favor of the defendants board of education and school district.plaintiffs now insist that the supreme court decision in good news club,in effect,overruled our holding in bronx household judge preska was persuaded to this view and hence ruled plaintiffs had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the litigation.in order to ascertain whether this holding was an abuse of discretion,we examine our earlier decision in bronx household i and the supreme court opinion in good news club.
bronx household i 
in bronx household i,we observed that the right to exercise free speech on government property depends on the kind of forum where the speech occurs,noting that the supreme court has identified three kinds the traditional public forum,the designated public forum or limited public forum,and the nonpublic forum.at citing cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.although the church argued that middle school is an open public forum where the exercise of first amendment rights can not be excluded absent a compelling state interest,see at,we were not persuaded that the school was a place that has been devoted to general,unrestricted public assembly by long tradition or by policy or practice,id.at.instead,we reasoned that the board of education,by restricting access to certain speakers and subjects,had created a limited public forum.id.within such a limited forum,the government may restrict access based on speaker identity and subject matter,but only if the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.id.at quoting cornelius,at.
having decided that the school was a limited public forum,we next addressed the question of whether the education board rule prohibiting religious services and instruction is reasonable and viewpoint neutral.we held it reasonable for state legislators and school authorities to avoid identifying a public school with a particular church,when considering the effect of such identification on the minds of school children.id.at.we also deemed the regulation viewpoint neutral,since it specifically permits any and all speech from a religious viewpoint.id.we recognized that religious worship services were barred,but believed a permissible distinction could be drawn between religious worship and other forms of speech from a religious viewpoint.id.at.for those reasons and because middle school was a limited public forum,we affirmed the summary judgment ruling in favor of the defendants.
good news club 
subsequent to our decision in bronx household i,the supreme court decided good news club milford central school.at issue in good news club was defendant milford central school community use policy that prohibited the use of school premises by any individual or organization for religious purposes.at.because of this policy the school refused to allow plaintiff good news club,a private christian organization for children between the ages of six and,to use school premises for activities that included praying,singing,reading,and learning the bible.the school denied plaintiff request to use its facilities because it thought the kinds of activities proposed to be engaged in by the good news club were not a discussion of secular subjects such as child rearing,development of character and development of morals from a religious perspective,but were in fact the equivalent of religious instruction itself.id.at.
the good news club sued challenging the school policy on first amendment grounds.the district court granted the school motion for summary judgment and we affirmed,reasoning that the exclusion of the club quintessentially religious activities was constitutional content discrimination,not unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.good news club milford cent,cir.the supreme court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the circuits on the question whether speech can be excluded from a limited public forum on the basis of the religious nature of the speech.good news club,at.in the context of stating its intention to resolve that conflict,the court mentioned our opinion in bronx household i and noted that it was on the same side of the split as campbell tammany school board,cir,a decision relying in part on our opinion in bronx household i,and one which the supreme court subsequently vacated and remanded in light of good news club,see campbell tammany sch,d.see good news club,at.
in reversing the judgment of this court,a divided supreme court found that by excluding the meetings of the good news club while allowing other types of instruction on moral and ethical issues the school maintained an exclusionary policy that constitutes viewpoint discrimination.id.at.the majority characterized the club proposed activities as teaching morals and character from a religious perspective.it did not think something that is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature can not also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint.id.at.because the school allowed teachings about morals and character from a variety of other,secular perspectives,the court continued,the school could not legally exclude the club meetings solely because of the religious viewpoint it advocated.id.at.the court concluded by stating,what matters for purposes of the free speech clause is that we can see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of christianity by the club and the invocation of teamwork,loyalty,or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons.id.at.
significantly,the majority found no meaningful distinction between the case before it and lamb chapel center moriches union free school district,d.good news club,at.in lamb chapel,the supreme court held that a school could not prohibit an outside group demonstration of a film about family values simply because the film addressed the issue from a religious perspective,where the school admittedly would have allowed demonstration of a film addressing family values from a secular perspective.at.the good news club majority reasoned that the the lamb chapel seeking to address a subject otherwise permitted in the school,the teaching of morals and character,from a religious standpoint.the fact that the good news club proposed to conduct the teaching through storytelling and prayer rather than through film,as in lamb chapel,was an inconsequential distinction.at.
the dissenting members of the supreme stevens,souter,and the speech at issue in good news club to be sufficiently different from that in lamb chapel to require the opposite result.justice stevens drew a distinction between three types of speech for religious purposes religious speech that is simply speech about a particular topic from a religious point of view,such as the film at issue in lamb chapel,religious speech that amounts to worship,or its equivalent,and an intermediate category that is aimed principally at proselytizing or inculcating belief in a particular religious faith.the good news club meetings,in his estimation,fell into the third or proselytizing category.at.stevens,dissenting.
justice souter was of the opinion that good news intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular,christian point of view,but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of christian conversion.id.at.souter,dissenting.he emphasized that the club intended activities included elements of worship that made the case as different from lamb chapel as night from day.id.at.justice souter further observed that the club meetings opened and closed with prayer,and that at the heart of each meeting was the challenge,when the already saved children were invited to ask god for strength and the invitation,when the teacher would invite the unsaved children to receive jesus as their savior from sin.id.at.this dissenting justice criticized the majority characterization of the club activities as teaching of morals and character,from a religious standpoint as ignoring reality.id.at.
the supreme court majority was not persuaded by the distinction drawn by the dissenters between speech from a religious perspective on the one hand and worship or proselytizing on the other.it did agree with justice souter description of the club activities,which we just related,but concluded that those activities do not constitute mere religious worship,divorced from any teaching of moral values.at.the majority saw no reason to treat the club use of religion as something other than a viewpoint merely because of any evangelical message it conveys.notwithstanding justice souter forcefully expressed challenge,it explicitly rejected his characterization of the club activities as an evangelical service of worship,saying that r egardless of the label justice souter wishes to use,what matters is the substance of the club activities,which we conclude are materially indistinguishable from the activities in lamb chapel and rosenberger rector and visitors of of,d holding that a university refusal to pay a contractor for the printing costs of a student publication,based on the publication religious editorials,was viewpoint discrimination.id.
iv resolution of instant appeal 
free speech 
having laid out for purposes of comparison our holding in bronx household i and the supreme court good news club opinion,we turn to an analysis of bronx household ii,the appeal presently before us.we start with the holding of the trial court.in granting plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction it relied on the supreme court holding in good news club,believing that the activities proposed by the plaintiff church are similar to those in good news club.the trial court also thought that,after good news club,religious worship could not be treated as an inherently distinct type of activity,and was instead comparable to other activities involving ritual and ceremony,such as boy and girl scout meetings.additionally,it viewed the distinction between worship and other types of religious speech as one that can not meaningfully be drawn by the courts.
based upon our reading of the supreme court decision in good news club,we do not think the district court abused its discretion in determining that the plaintiffs were substantially likely to establish that defendants violated their first amendment free speech rights.central to our conclusion is a candid acknowledgment of the factual parallels between the activities described in good news club and the activities at issue in the present litigation.
although the majority in good news club characterized the club activity as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint,at,this characterization can not be divorced from justice souter detailed description of the club activities that the majority adopted as accurate.id.at.in justice souter view,the club meetings did not consist solely of teaching,but also included elements consistent with an evangelical service of worship.id.at.souter,dissenting.the majority did not say that the meetings were somehow distinct from worship services,but simply observed that they were not mere religious worship,divorced from any teaching of moral values.id.at.
we find no principled basis upon which to distinguish the activities set out by the supreme court in good news club from the activities that the bronx household of faith has proposed for its sunday meetings at middle school.like the good news club meetings,the sunday morning meetings of the church combine preaching and teaching with such quintessentially religious elements as prayer,the singing of christian songs,and communion.the church sunday morning meetings also encompass secular elements,for instance,a fellowship meal during which church members may talk about their problems and needs.on these facts,it can not be said that the meetings of the bronx household of faith constitute only religious worship,separate and apart from any teaching of moral values.at.
because the board of education has authorized other groups,like scout groups,to undertake the teaching of morals and character development on school premises,there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs would be able to demonstrate that the board can not exclude,under supreme court precedent,the church from school premises on the ground that the church approaches the same subject from a religious viewpoint.additionally,the defendants school building use policy permits social,civic and recreational meetings and entertainments,and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community,so long as these uses are and open to the public.therefore,there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs would be able to demonstrate that the defendants can not bar the church proposed activities without engaging in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.
we hold the district court did not commit an error of law or fact and therefore did not abuse its discretion by determining that plaintiffs were substantially likely to establish that defendants violated their first amendment free speech rights.our ruling is confined to the district court finding that the activities plaintiffs have proposed for their sunday meetings are not simply religious worship,divorced from any teaching of moral values or other activities permitted in the forum.
we decline to review the trial court further determinations that,after good news club,religious worship can not be treated as an inherently distinct type of activity,and that the distinction between worship and other types of religious speech can not meaningfully be drawn by the courts.we recognize that these conclusions are in obvious tension with our previous holding that a permissible distinction may be drawn between religious worship and other forms of speech from a religious viewpoint,bronx household i,at,a proposition that was seriously undermined but not explicitly rejected in good news club.it is unnecessary for us to reach these issues in order to affirm the trial court grant of a preliminary injunction in this case.
we pause,however,to note some unresolved issues that arise from the recent supreme court precedent that,as an appellate court,we are bound to follow.would we be able to identify a form of religious worship that is divorced from the teaching of moral values should we continue to evaluate activities that include religious worship on a basis,or should worship no longer be treated as a distinct category of speech how does the distinction drawn in our earlier precedent between worship and other forms of speech from a religious viewpoint relate to the dichotomy suggested in good news club between mere worship on the one hand and worship that is not divorced from the teaching of moral values on the other 
further,how would the state,without imposing its own views on religion,define which values are morally acceptable and which are not and,if such a choice is impossible to make,would the state be required to permit the use of public school property by religious sects that preach ideas commonly viewed as hateful when several religious groups seek to use the same property at the same time,would not the state have to choose between them what criteria would govern that choice in all of this process,is there not a danger of excessive entanglement by the state in religion 
how the supreme court answers these difficult questions will no doubt have profound implications for relations between church and state.the american experiment has flourished largely free of the religious strife that has stricken other societies because church and state have respected each other autonomy.religion and government thrive because each,conscious of the corrosive perils of intrusive entanglements,exercises restraint in making claims on the other.the beneficiaries are a diverse populace that enjoys religious liberty in a nation that honors the sanctity of that freedom.
establishment clause 
we must resolve one final issue,that is,whether it is substantially likely that defendants will not succeed in demonstrating that their denial of plaintiffs application is necessary to avoid a violation of the establishment clause.
the first amendment to the united states constitution,applicable to the states under the fourteenth amendment,prohibits the enactment of any law respecting an establishment of religion.const.amend defendants maintain that,even if their actions infringe on plaintiffs first amendment rights,the infringement is justified because it is necessary to avoid an appearance of state endorsement of religion and excessive entanglement between state and religion,in violation of the establishment clause.
in good news club,the majority acknowledged that a state interest in avoiding an establishment clause violation may be characterized as compelling,and therefore may justify discrimination.at.the court then noted that,although its precedent did not yet establish whether that interest may also justify discrimination,it did not need to resolve the issue because the school did not have a valid establishment clause interest.id.at.in so ruling,the supreme court emphasized that the good news club meetings were held after school hours,were not sponsored by the school,and were open to all students who obtained parental consent.it also noted that the school had made its forum equally available to other organizations.id.
in addition,the supreme court rejected the argument that the young age of the children attending the elementary school impermissibly increased the danger of misperception of endorsement,stating that the court had never extended its establishment clause jurisprudence to foreclose private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.id.at.the court emphasized that even if it were to inquire into the minds of schoolchildren in that case,it could not say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement of religion was any greater than the danger that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the club were excluded from the public forum.id.at.
relying on the supreme court good news club rationale,the district court here concluded that there was a substantial likelihood that the church would be able to demonstrate that the school board does not have a valid establishment clause interest because the proposed meetings occur on sunday mornings,during nonschool hours are not endorsed by the school district are not attended by any school employee are open to all members of the public and there is no evidence that any school children would be on the school premises on sunday mornings or would attend the meetings.to this list the district court might have added that the church apparently intended to pay rent for the use of the space.the district court believed that by allowing the meetings defendants were more likely to demonstrate neutrality toward religion,and would therefore probably not violate the establishment clause.
in light of the supreme court refusal to find a valid establishment clause interest in good news club,and the strong factual similarities between this case and good news club,the district court ruling is adequately supported at this stage of the litigation.the dissent conclusion to the contrary,in our estimation,misapplies the necessarily deferential standard of review.we hasten to add,however,that this issue is factual and its resolution in favor of plaintiffs now does not foreclose the possibility that defendants may,with further development of the record,ultimately prevail on it 
res judicata and collateral estoppel 
as an endnote in our analysis,we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs claims were not barred by the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.although defendants contend that plaintiffs claims are barred by these doctrines they concede that a change in a controlling legal principle precludes their application.the defendants argument that no such change has occurred is answered by our discussion.
conclusion 
in sum,in the district court grant of plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction we find no errors of law or clearly erroneous findings of fact that could be said to constitute an abuse of discretion.the trial court properly found that the plaintiffs claims are entitled to a presumption of irreparable harm and that,in light of the supreme court opinion in good news club,plaintiffs are substantially likely to prevail on the merits.
the grant of a preliminary injunction is accordingly affirmed.
today,the majority permits a public school building in the bronx to be designated middle school and the bronx household of faith.for more than sixty years,the sovereign state of new york has not included religious worship services in the list of uses permitted in public school buildings.the board of education of the city of new york and community school district collectively,the school board have specifically excluded such usage.more than five years ago,in a case brought by the same parties as those before us today concerning the use of the same public school facilities,a panel of this court unanimously held that this longstanding legislative policy did not violate the free speech clause of the first amendment.review of our decision was sought in the supreme court,and that request for review was denied.in concluding that plaintiffs have a clear or substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their first amendment claim,the majority thwarts the will of the people of the state and city of new york to regulate a sphere of public life that has been traditionally left to state and local democratically elected bodies,as well as casts aside a binding precedent of this court.the sole justification offered by the majority for these actions is that facts from the rather undeveloped record in the case before us parallel those in a supreme court decision involving religious instruction.because i believe that,on the record before us,such a parallel does not exist,i respectfully dissent.

as is apparent from the foregoing,there is no provision in new york law for the use of public schoolhouses for purposes of religious worship.nor is there provision for partisan political meetings and various other purposes.moreover,it is of note that,where admission fees are charged for uses that are ordinarily permitted,such as entertainments,meetings and similar occasions,such uses are barred where the proceeds are to be applied for the benefit of a society,association or organization of a religious sect or denomination.id.d.it is the clear policy of the state of new york to bar religious activities from the public schools to the greatest extent possible.in furtherance of the new york policy,and in accordance with the authority conferred to promulgate regulations that conform to the purposes and intent of the statute relating to the uses of schoolhouses and grounds,the board of education of the city of new york has adopted the following regulation 
no outside organization or group may be allowed to conduct religious services or religious instruction on school premises after school.however,the use of school premises by outside organizations or groups after school for the purposes of discussing religious material or material which contains a religious viewpoint or for distributing such material is permissible.

w e reaffirm our holding in lamb chapel center moriches union free school district,d,and rosenberger rector and visitors of the university of virginia,d,that speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects can not be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint.thus,we conclude that the school district exclusion of the good news club,an evangelical christian organization for children ages six to twelve from use of a public school pursuant to its community use policy,constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination.

the linchpin of the majority conclusion that the policies described above violate the free speech clause is its conclusion that o n these facts,it can not be said that the meetings of the bronx household of faith constitute only religious worship,separate and apart from any teaching of moral values.the facts relied on by the majority are taken from a letter written by bronx household of faith robert hall and jack roberts requesting the use of middle school and a affidavit submitted by pastor hall after his deposition was taken in this case.both written with the assistance of counsel tellingly decline to mention the church intent to use for worship services and instead attempt to persuade the reader that the church proposed use of the public school involves instruction from a religious viewpoint.while the majority sees through this ruse by correctly observing that plaintiffs were,in substance,renewing their prior request to conduct activities that included a weekly worship service,the majority declines to focus on the undisputed facts elicited during pastor hall deposition that put to rest any doubts about whether the church proposed meetings are anything but religious worship services.
according to pastor hall,the reason why the bronx household of faith requested to use on sundays between the hours of and was that this was the regular weekly time when it held its religious worship services.these services are held on sundays because that day is the christian day of worship.the purpose of these meetings is to engage in singing of christian songs and psalms,to pray,to do bible preaching and to do fellowship with other church members.the service is led by one of four men,two of whom are pastors,but the preaching is done primarily by the two pastors.
the service,which is preceded by an hour of sunday school,begins at approximately and lasts for about two hours.the meeting usually opens with a prayer,which is typically followed by a reading from a psalm,the singing of psalms,and a prayer from the congregation.sometimes,personal testimonials are then made by members of the congregation about how the church helped them with a personal problem.personal testimonials are followed by communion,which is feeding a piece of bread that speaks to us of the body of christ and drinking a cup of grape juice that speaks to us of the blood of christ.it is the picture of the person and work of christ.only members in good standing and those who feel that they are in good standing before the lord,in their own consciences,and have been baptized may participate in communion.following communion is preaching of the word of god,then more singing,and then a coffee and bagel hour,where people frequently engage in conversation and discussion and sometimes even counseling.baptisms are performed on rare occasions.finally,donations are collected by attendees placing money in a gray offering box with a slit in the top of it.
the services are attended mostly by church members from the community,although they are open to all.church membership is open to anyone who has been baptized,attends a membership class and demonstrates that he believe s in the basic historic al christian gospel.there are currently approximately members of the church,and attendance at sunday services ranges from to people.if the church were permitted to use for its sunday services,it would use a flyer to tell people where to meet.
at his deposition,pastor hall defined worship services as ascrib ing worth,our supreme worth,to jesus christ.he distinguished the church from traditional clubs because it engage s in the teaching and preaching of the word of god,and it administer s the sacraments of baptism and the lord supper.thus,he also said that the church is not composed of a group of people who have a common interest in the same way that stamp collecting and coin collecting bring people together.indeed,pastor hall stated his belief that the church differs from a bible study club or group because the latter groups do not administer the sacraments of baptism and the lord supper.finally,pastor hall noted that the church attaches no religious significance to a structure called a church.thus,it does not build churches it builds meeting houses.therefore,anywhere the congregation of the bronx household of faith meets for sunday services is,in the church view,a church.
i agree with the majority statement that,to prevail on their request for a mandatory preliminary injunction seeking to stay government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,plaintiffs must show a clear or substantial likelihood of success on their first amendment claim.for the reasons set forth below,i find not only that plaintiffs have fallen far short of carrying this heavy burden but also that their attempt to do so is barred by the doctrines of stare decisis,res judicata and collateral estoppel 
as the majority correctly observes,we are tread ing on familiar ground.in bronx household of faith community school district,cir bronx household i,the same plaintiffs that are currently before us challenged the constitutionality of the school board denial of their request to hold religious worship services at.after concluding that was a limited public forum,see id.at,we turned to the question of whether the distinctions drawn by the school board were reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and were viewpoint neutral,id.at quoting cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.we answered these questions in the affirmative,finding that it was reasonable for a state and a school district to adopt legislation and regulations denying a church permission to use school premises for regular religious worship and that it was reasonable for state legislators and school authorities to avoid the identification of a middle school with a particular church.bronx household i,at.with respect to viewpoint neutrality,we found that the regulation in question specifically permit ted any and all speech from a religious viewpoint but that it did not permit religious worship services,which had never been permitted to be conducted at the school.id subsequent to our decision,certiorari was sought and denied.see,d.
our decision in bronx household i thus presents plaintiffs with several obstacles to overcome in making their showing of a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their first amendment claim.first,plaintiffs face the doctrine of stare decisis.a decision of a panel of this c ourt is binding unless and until it is overruled by the c ourt en banc or by the supreme court.jones coughlin,cir.second,plaintiffs must overcome the additional hurdles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.a claim bought in a subsequent proceeding is barred by the doctrine of res judicata if i the prior action involved an adjudication on the merits,ii the prior action involved the same parties or their privies and iii the claims asserted in the subsequent action were or could have been raised in the prior action,and by the doctrine of collateral estoppel if a the issues in both proceedings were identical,b the issue in the prior proceeding was actually litigated and actually decided,c there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate in the prior proceedings and d the issue previously litigated was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits.irish lesbian gay org.giuliani,cir.to overcome these hurdles,plaintiffs rely on good news case decided by the supreme court more than three years after our decision in bronx household plaintiffs argue effectively overruled bronx household 
in good news club,a divided panel of this court rejected a bible club challenge brought under the free speech clause to a school district policy prohibiting the club from holding weekly meetings on school premises after hours,where the activities conducted at the meetings included singing hymns,prayer,memorizing scripture and bible lessons.see cir,rev,d.while never characterizing these activities as religious worship services,my opinion for the majority found that it was constitutionally legitimate for the school district to draw a distinction between discussing secular subjects from a religious viewpoint and religious instruction.these activities,we held,did not involve merely a religious perspective on the secular subject of morality.good news club,at.rather,they offered children the opportunity to pray with adults,to recite biblical verse,and to declare themselves saved.id.
accepting that these practices were necessary because the bible club viewpoint was that a relationship with god was necessary to make moral values meaningful,we nevertheless concluded that it was clear from the conduct of the meetings that the bible club went far beyond merely stating its viewpoint.id.instead,it was focused on teaching children how to cultivate their relationship with god through jesus christ,and thus under,even the most restrictive and archaic definitions of religion,such subject matter was quintessentially religious.id.indeed,while characterizing the bible club activities as religious instruction instead of religious worship,we found it difficult to see how the activities differ ed materially from religious worship,for each ha d prayers and devotional songs each ha d a central sermon or story with a message each ha d a portion in which attendees were called upon to be saved.id.accordingly,because a pplying a different label to the same activities d id not change their nature or import,we found the school board restrictions to be permissible restrictions rather than impermissible restrictions.id.at.
judge jacobs dissented,although he characterized his agreement with the majority as being substantial.id.jacobs,dissenting.significantly,judge jacobs view that the bible club message was in fact the teach ing of morals from a religious perspective was based on the fact that its focus appear ed to be on teaching lessons for the living of a morally fit life,and not on worship.id.at internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.
the supreme court granted certiorari in good news club and reversed,rejecting the notion that something that is quintessentially religious or decidedly religious in nature can not also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint,d.what mattered for purposes of the free speech clause,the court stated,was that there was no logical difference in kind between the invocation of christianity by the bible club and the invocation of teamwork,loyalty,or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons.id.thus,the court rejected the notion that any time religious instruction and prayer are used to discuss morals and character,the discussion is simply not a pure discussion of those issues.id.r eliance on christian principles,the court continued,did not taint moral and character instruction in a way that other foundations for thought or viewpoints do not.id.rather,the court reaffirm ed the principle that speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects can not be excluded from a limited public forum on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint.id.at.thus,the court concluded that the school district exclusion of the bible club from using the school to provide religious instruction constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination.id.at.
our holding in bronx household ithat religious worship services could be prohibited from being held in public school buildings without running afoul of the free speech clause remains good law,notwithstanding the supreme court holding in good news club that constitutionally meaningful distinctions could not be drawn between religious and secular viewpoints in the context of religious instruction conducted in those same school buildings the majority recognizes as much when it seeks to distance itself from the district court determinations that religious worship can not be treated as an inherently distinct type of activity,and that the distinction between worship and other types of religious speech can not meaningfully be drawn by the courts.as the majority correctly observes,these determinations are in obvious tension with our previous holding that a permissible distinction may be drawn between religious worship and other forms of speech from a religious viewpoint a proposition that was not explicitly rejected in good news club.thus,the majority appears to concede that,if the activities conducted at bronx household of faith meetings are inherently religious worship and nothing else,our decision in bronx household i would govern and this action would be dismissed on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel.
in reaching its conclusion that plaintiffs have shown a substantial or clear likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their free speech clause claim,the majority finds no principled basis upon which to distinguish the activities set out by the supreme court in good news club from the activities that plaintiffs have proposed for its sunday meetings at.in particular,the majority concludes that these activities do not constitute only religious worship,separate and apart from any teaching of moral values.for the reasons set forth below,i do not believe that such a conclusion can be supported on the present record.indeed,my view of the record is that it supports the exact opposite conclusion.
even though the supreme court analysis in good news club was confined to religious instruction rather than religious worship services,the majority attempts to extrapolate that analysis to the case at bar based on the court response to the characterization of the facts in good news club by justice souter in his dissenting opinion.in particular,justice souter opined that the bible club intend ed to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular,christian point of view,but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of christian conversion.good news club,at.souter,dissenting.
the specific facts to which justice souter alluded were that the bible club meetings began and ended with a prayer and that at the heart of the meeting was the challenge and invitation,which were repeated at various times throughout the lesson and which involved saved children being challenged to stop and ask god for the strength and the want to obey him and unsaved children being invite d to trust the lord jesus to be their savior from sin,and receiv e him as their savior from sin.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the good news club majority responded to justice souter in a footnote by characterizing his recitation of the bible club activities as accurate,but it declined to characterize the bible club activities as mere religious worship,divorced from any teaching of moral values.id.at.what mattered,according to the good news club majority,was that the substance of the bible club activities involved conveying ideas from a religious viewpoint.id.
based on the interchange between justice souter and his colleagues,the majority concludes that the factual parallels between the activities described in good news club and the activities at issue here justify its conclusion that there is a substantial or clear likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail in showing that the school board prohibition against religious worship services in public schools constitutes viewpoint discrimination.to quote from justice souter dissent in good news club,the activities at issue here make this case as different from good news club as day from night.id.at.souter,dissenting.
here,the meeting is led by a member of the clergy,who leads the attendees largely made up of members of the church congregation in prayer and the singing of psalms,administers communion only to those who have been baptized,delivers a sermon from the pulpit and collects a religious offering from those present.to say that these activities are no different from secular meetings such as a scouts meeting where people eat,drink,sing,learn,socialize and engage in certain rituals like saluting the flag is to blink reality.as judge cabranes observed in bronx household i 
unlike religious instruction,there is no real secular analogue to religious services,such that a ban on religious services might pose a substantial threat of viewpoint discrimination between religion and secularism.indeed,the dictionary definition of the term services in this context suggests as much a public worship b any religious ceremony because services are by definition religious in nature,it does not appear that they could ordinarily be understood to serve as a vehicle for both religious and secular viewpoints.
at cabranes,concurring in part and dissenting in part quoting webster new world dictionary see also santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d in holding that prayer at public school athletic events violated establishment clause,court relied on definition of invocation in webster third new international dictionary,which defined the term to mean a prayer of entreaty that is usual ly a call for the divine presence and is offered at the beginning of a meeting or service of worship.indeed,in the context of the free exercise clause,the supreme court has held that worship services constitute the exercise of religion in pure form.see employment div.smith,d t he exercise of religion often involves not only belief and profession but the performance of or abstention from physical acts assembling with others for a worship service,participating in sacramental use of bread and wine,proselytizing,abstaining from certain foods or certain modes of transportation.
i have no quarrel with the findings of the majority that the school board has authorized other groups,like the boy scouts and girl scouts,to teach morals and character development on school premises,that the school board permits social,civic and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community,and that therefore organizations or activities that undertake and promote speech from a religious viewpoint can not be barred from school property.but i can not abide the majority leap of logic that,based on plaintiffs statements that their teaching comes from the viewpoint of the bible and their emphasis on the s
