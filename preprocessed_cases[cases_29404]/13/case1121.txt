mark maraschiello,a white male employed as a captain in the city of buffalo police department the department,sued the department and its police chief,mccarthy gipson collectively defendants,claiming that their failure to promote him was impermissibly motivated by race.maraschiello scores on a civil service examination rendered him eligible for promotion to the position of inspector.after buffalo adopted the results of a new exam two years later,however,another officer was promoted to an open inspector position.maraschiello contends that this amounted to racial discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,a and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the united states district court for the western district of new york arcara,adopted magistrate judge leslie foschio report and recommendation granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.see maraschiello city of buffalo police dep t,cv f,wl.we affirm.
maraschiello,a white man,has at all relevant times been employed by the department as a captain.the department bases its promotional decisions for several positions,including that of inspector,on the results of a civil service exam.in accordance with new york law,the city of buffalo the city may promote any one of the three top scorers on a given exam.see civ.serv.law appointment or promotion from an eligible list to a position in the competitive class shall be made by the selection of one of the three persons certified by the appropriate civil service commission as standing highest on such eligible list who are willing to accept such appointment or promotion.maraschiello took the exam required for the inspector position on september.he received the highest grade on the exam and ranked first on a list of candidates that was certified on december.the parties do not dispute that the exam qualified maraschiello and the other two top scorers for promotion to inspector at any time while the list remained in effect.for most of this period,however,there were no open inspector positions.
during this time,the city of buffalo the city was going through the process of adopting a new police promotion exam.defendants submitted evidence that,in october,the city engaged personnel psychologist nancy abrams to review the civil service exams.abrams submitted an affidavit stating that i n part prompted by several federal civil rights actions challenging the city use of examinations prepared by the new york state department of civil service,the city requested that she review the police promotional exams prepared by nys civil service to evaluate whether they were valid examinations that selected the candidates best suited for the job and otherwise complied with applicable legal and professional standards for employment examinations.joint app x.abrams concluded that the civil service agency had not updated the job analysis in nearly thirty years and that it was out of date,in part because its reliance on questions was not optimal for police work and other fields requiring qualities such as effective oral communication and the ability to assume command of situations that are difficult to evaluate through such traditional methods.id.at.abrams discussed these conclusions with city officials,and a fter receiving her conclusions,the city published a request for proposals rfp in april for an independent consultant to develop new civil service examinations.id.at.abrams assisted the city in designing the rfp and evaluating the responses received to accomplish these goals and provide buffalo with a better exam.id.at.
the city issued the request for proposals for development of police promotional examinations on april.the rfp began by reciting the regulations governing the bidding.id.at.of note is that the section includes a provision entitled method of tendering proposals.id.at.that provision contains three subsections.the first establishes that all bidders must tender their proposal on the form furnished with these specifications the second states that no entity shall submit more than one proposal and the third states the following 
all bidders must submit with their bid a statement indicating that they will work toward a minority workforce goal of,and woman workforce goal of.in addition,a statement must be submitted indicating that the bidder will work toward a business utilization goal for minority business enterprise of and woman business enterprise of.
id.emphasis omitted.
after the regulations section,the rfp describes in detail the sort of examinations it sought.it begins with the following paragraph 
the city of buffalo the city has traditionally used examinations prepared by the new york state department of civil service for examining candidates for promotional titles within the buffalo police and fire departments.in and,civil lawsuits were brought against the city alleging discrimination in hiring in the police and fire departments.in,the court found there was discrimination,and the court has been overseeing various remedies since that time.the city remains under court supervision with respect to hiring in both departments.further,in and in,civil lawsuits were brought against the city in which the examination for promotion to fire lieutenant was alleged to have a discriminatory impact against african american candidates.those lawsuits are still pending as of the date of this request for proposals.although the city denies that the examinations previously used were discriminatory,it has decided to cease using the examinations prepared by the new york state department of civil service for police officer and firefighter promotional titles and therefore is issuing this request for proposals for the development of its own examinations.
id.at.the rfp contains further provisions detailing the scope of the work establishing,inter alia,that the proposed tests must deal with job requirements and scoring procedures.id.at.it also states that testing instruments and procedures must conform to title vii to this end,they must be free from related factors which might function as biases against any group on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,age,national origin,or any other classification protected by law.id.at.
in late and early,the city selected solutions,from among various bidders,and the two entities collaborated in developing a promotional exam consisting of both a written test and an oral assessment.after the development process was complete,the city announced and administered the new exam for the inspector position in two parts the written component in february and the oral component on march.maraschiello elected not to take the test he does not allege that he was in any way prevented from doing so.
on march,gipson issued special order,which stated inspector philip ramunno,assigned to the b district,has been granted a service pension in the new york state retirement system effective march.id.at.
on april,after the new test was scored,the city adopted a new inspector list,and the eligibility list automatically expired.patrick reichmuth,who is a white male as was every candidate on both the and lists,placed first on the list.reichmuth had been second on the list.maraschiello did not appear on the list,which is not surprising given his failure to take the test.on june,reichmuth was appointed to fill the vacancy created by ramunno retirement.
district court proceedings 
after exhausting his administrative remedies,maraschiello filed a complaint in district court on march.he asserted claims of unlawful discrimination under title vii,and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.he also asserted a claim for defamation based on an alleged statement by gipson,in the context of promotion discussions,that maraschiello was a racist.joint app x.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b,asserting that maraschiello claim did not involve the sort of impermissibly action described in ricci destefano,d.the district court denied the motion,noting that maraschiello had alleged that after the adoption of the exam results,the city solicited bids for new exams with the purpose of increas ing minority representation on the force.joint app x.the court then noted 
defendants have failed to distinguish ricci from the facts of this case.based upon plaintiff allegations,it would appear that ricci applies to plaintiff discrimination claims.plaintiff asserts that the city discarded the exam results because it wanted to increase minority representation on the police force.defendants do not dispute this point,and,in fact,expressly acknowledge that the city had endured numerous legal challenges to the validity of the civil service examinations over the past few decades and that the new exams were created to avoid further litigation with respect to those exams.in light of ricci and plaintiff allegations that the exam results were discarded for the purpose of avoiding further claims of racial discrimination,defendant motion to dismiss plaintiff discrimination claims is denied.
id.at internal citation omitted.
in january,after some discovery,maraschiello moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.gipson for summary judgment dismissing the title vii claims against him in his individual capacity.magistrate judge foschio recommended that the district court deny maraschiello motion,grant summary judgment sua sponte for all defendants on the federal claims,and decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the defamation claim.
judge foschio first found that defendants could not be held liable under title vii based on ricci because the case was factually distinguishable.maraschiello,wl,at.judge foschio found further that the other evidentiary bases for maraschiello claim were insufficient maraschiello contentions that the rfp statement regarding a minority workforce referred to the police workforce rather than a bidding contractor workforce were unavailing maraschiello never sat for the exam and the person who was eventually promoted was,like maraschiello,a white man.id.at.
judge foschio went on to determine that maraschiello could not maintain a claim under because he had no cognizable property right to the inspector position and that maraschiello equal protection claim was moot in the absence of a viable discrimination claim under the other two statutes.id.at.finally,judge foschio recommended that the district court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the defamation claim because the case was at a relatively early stage and a action would not be barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.
after judge foschio issued the recommendation and report on september,maraschiello filed objections.on december,the district court held oral argument on whether the recommendation and report should be adopted.in order to provide additional notice to maraschiello before acting on the recommendation to grant summary judgment to all defendants sua sponte,the district court permitted supplemental briefing,which the parties filed in due course.on january,the district court held a second hearing to afford the parties a further opportunity to present their respective positions.finally,on february,the district court issued a decision adopting judge foschio proposed findings and dismissing the case.
discussion 
maraschiello brief on appeal contains no discussion of the or defamation claims and only three sentences of unsupported argument regarding his equal protection claim.see appellant br.at.merely mentioning or simply stating an issue in an appellate brief is insufficient to preserve it for our review an appellant must advance an argument,and we generally will decline to consider issues that are not sufficiently argued.niagara mohawk power hudson river black river regulating,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.thus,it is only necessary for us to consider maraschiello arguments regarding title vii 
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party.ment.iron works,interstate fire cas,cir.w e affirm only where we are able to conclude,after construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.costello city of burlington,cir quoting.a.
title vii claims are generally analyzed under the familiar framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,and its progeny.mathirampuzha potter,cir.at the first stage of mcdonnell douglas,a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,which includes demonstrating that he suffered an adverse employment action under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.id.once the prima facie case has been shown,the burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.united states brennan,cir quoting mcdonnell douglas,at.
a plaintiff may also attempt more directly to convince the trier of fact that an impermissible criterion in fact entered into the employment decision by focus ing his proof directly at the question of discrimination and prov ing that an illegitimate factor had a motivating or substantial role in the employment decision.tyler bethlehem steel,cir citation omitted.if the employee does so,he is entitled to succeed subject only to the employer opportunity to prove its affirmative defense,that is,that it would have reached the same decision as to the employee employment even in the absence of the impermissible factor.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
maraschiello central contention is that ricci establishes that defendants actions violated title vii.repeated references in his brief to a ricci theory or ricci analysis suggest that he is arguing that the case established a new framework for title vii litigation.it did not.as we have explained,ricci does not impose a new framework,but instead constitutes a straightforward application of the first two steps of mcdonnell douglas.brennan,at.because ricci involved a factual scenario somewhat similar to maraschiello,however,it is worth discussing that case in some detail.
in ricci,a group of new haven firefighters had taken examinations necessary to qualify for promotions.at.when the examination results showed that white candidates had outperformed minority candidates,new haven agreed with other firefighters who argued that the tests should be discarded prior to certification of the results because the results showed the tests to be discriminatory.id.new haven threw out the examinations based on the racial disparity reflected in the results.id.the plaintiff firefighters alleged that discarding the results discriminated against them based on their race,in violation of title vii prohibition of disparate treatment.new haven countered that if they had certified the results,they could have faced liability under title vii for adopting a practice that had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.id.at.
the supreme court analysis began with the premise that,absent a valid defense,new haven actions would violate the prohibition because a ll the evidence demonstrate d that new haven chose not to certify the examination results because of the statistical disparity based on race,because too many whites and not enough minorities would be promoted were the lists to be certified.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.whatever new haven ultimate aim however well intentioned or benevolent it might have seemed new haven made its employment decision because of race and rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white.id.at.t he original,foundational prohibition of title vii bars employers from taking adverse action because of race.id.at quoting a.this prohibition was violated when the firefighters saw their efforts invalidated by new haven in sole reliance upon statistics.id.at.
in other words,because new haven decision to reject the test results was explicitly based on a statistical racial disparity,it was beyond dispute that the plaintiffs had made out a prima facie case,so the burden shifted to the defendants to give a legitimate justification for the adve
