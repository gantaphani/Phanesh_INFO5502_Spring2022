westchester county the county appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denise cote,finding the county in violation of its duty to promote legislation under a stipulation and order of settlement and dismissal consent decree entered into by the county with the united states to resolve a qui tam action initially brought by relator,the anti discrimination center of metro new york,adc,under the false claims act alleging the submission of false claims by the county to the united states department of housing and urban development hud in order to obtain federal grant monies for fair housing.we hold that the district court indeed had jurisdiction to review the decision of the reviewing magistrate judge under the consent decree.we further hold that the county violated the terms of the consent decree.
background 
in april,the adc brought a qui tam action against the county under the false claims act.the action charged that from through,the county submitted false claims to hud in order to obtain millions of dollars in funds that were required,under b,to be used to affirmatively further fair housing.hud regulations require grantees,as part of the requirement to affirmatively further fair housing,to consider the existence and impact of racial discrimination in analyzing the barriers to housing opportunities in their areas as a condition to receive these federal funds.see,office of fair hous.equal opportunity,dep t of hous.urban,fair housing planning guide to to,available at see also exec.order.the adc contended that the county failed to comply with hud regulations but nonetheless certified its compliance with the grant requirements.in initial proceedings before the district court,the court ruled that the county was obligated to consider race in connection with its certification to hud,united states ex rel.anti discrimination ctr.of metro,westchester,d,and that the county certifications to hud were false as a matter of law,united states ex rel.anti discrimination ctr.of metro,westchester,d.
in august,the united states intervened and,on the same day,presented the court with a consent decree to which all the parties had agreed.the consent decree obligated the county to pay million to the united states,million of which would be credited to the county hud account to fund fair housing,and pay million to the adc as relator.the county also made various commitments to affirmatively further fair housing and to eliminate discrimination in housing opportunities.the county exposure under the false claims act would have been million treble damages based on million in false claims.see a.in order to ensure compliance with the consent decree,the district court appointed james johnson of debevoise plimpton to serve as monitor,authorized to oversee the steps taken by the county to affirmatively further fair housing as contemplated by the consent decree.the monitor was charged with reviewing the county actions,recommending additional actions needed to ensure compliance,and to resolve disputes between the united states and the county.the dispute resolution provision of the consent decree reads 
within ten business days of receipt of the monitor report and recommendation,the county or the government may seek additional review from the magistrate judge assigned to this case otherwise,the monitor resolution shall be final,binding and.should the county or the government seek such additional review from the assigned magistrate judge,the relevant provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure,the local rules and the court individual rules governing reports and recommendations from a magistrate judge shall apply.
as part of the county obligation to affirmatively further fair housing,the county agreed to,among other things,promote,through the county executive,legislation currently before the board of legislators to ban discrimination in housing.legislation bans housing discrimination based upon an individual source of income,primarily whether an individual lawful income comes in the form of social security benefits or any form of state or federal public assistance,including section vouchers.
in,as recognized by the consent decree,the county board of legislators was considering the passage of legislation.following the county commitment to the consent decree,the county executive at the time,andrew spano,sent five brief letters to advocacy organizations expressing his hope that they would continue the work in which they were already engaged in advocating for the legislation.spano also sent a letter to the leadership of the board of legislators encouraging enactment of the legislation.the legislation was not approved by the board by the end of the legislative session,but it was reintroduced in in a form identical to the legislation pending when the consent decree was ratified at the board of legislators.the board passed the legislation in june.the version passed by the board contained three alterations made throughout the legislative process that rendered the passed legislation less protective against discrimination than the initial version had been it removed payments and inheritance,annuities,pensions,and child and spousal support from the definition of source of income,set a monetary penalty of for wanton,willful or malicious discrimination,while previous versions set the penalty at for discrimination and for wanton,willful or malicious discrimination,and exempted cooperative apartments and condominiums.it is undisputed that,at the reintroduction of the legislation in january,newly elected county executive robert astorino took no steps to promote the legislation and subsequently vetoed the amended version on june.
per the consent decree,on july,the county submitted its revised analysis of impediments ai plan to hud.by letter dated july,hud notified the county that the ai did not meet the requirements of the consent decree because it did not incorporate the corrective actions that hud had earlier specified,including promotion of legislation or plans to overcome exclusionary zoning practices.hud thus rejected the county certification that it would affirmatively further fair housing and its fiscal year action plan plan.once the plan was rejected,the county was removed as a grantee eligible for hud funds,and thus their federal funding was discontinued.in response to this rejection and the of federal funding,the county sought review by the monitor on july.on august,the united states also sought review of several disputes from the monitor,including the claim that county executive astorino veto of the legislation breached the consent decree.the other disputes addressed by the monitor and the lower courts at that time are not at issue in the current appeal.
on november,the monitor issued his amended report which found,among other things,that the county is in breach of its obligation to promote certain source of income legislation and concluded that,under the consent decree,promote included an obligation to help bring such legislation into being.on december,the county objected to the monitor determination and sought review from the magistrate judge.the magistrate judge,in a march,opinion and order,sustained the county objection on the dispute over legislation.in response to this decision,the united states filed an objection with the district court seeking review of the portion of the magistrate judge opinion concluding that the county did not violate its duty to promote legislation.
before the district court,the county argued that,based upon the terms of the consent decree,the court was without jurisdiction to review the magistrate judge opinion and order.further,the county argued that the magistrate judge decision had been correct and that an alternate reading of the consent decree duty to promote would violate the federal constitution.as an initial matter,the district court addressed the county jurisdictional argument,finding that,under the terms of the consent decree,it did indeed have authority to review the magistrate determination.united states ex rel.anti discrimination ctr.of metro,westchester,civ,wl,at may.on the merits,the district court reversed the magistrate judge decision regarding the county obligation with respect to the legislation and affirmed the monitor initial decision that the county was in breach of its duty to promote that legislation.id.at.the county now appeals.

we first look to the terms of the consent decree to determine if the district court had jurisdiction to review the decision of the magistrate judge.under the terms of the consent decree,the district court retains jurisdiction over both enforcement and interpretation 
notwithstanding any other provisions of this stipulation and order,this court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over this stipulation and order,including,but not limited to,any application to enforce or interpret its provisions,and over each party to the extent its obligations herein remain unsatisfied.
the county urges this court to read the provision of the consent decree that contemplates review of decisions of the monitor to divest the district court of its reserved jurisdiction.this provision of the consent decree reads 
the county or the government may seek additional review from the magistrate judge assigned to this case otherwise,the monitor resolution shall be final,binding and.should the county or the government seek such additional review from the assigned magistrate judge,the relevant provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure,the local rules and the court individual rules governing reports and recommendations from a magistrate judge shall apply.
in addition to the fact that the agreement reserves jurisdiction in the district court n otwithstanding any other provisions of the consent decree,the section concerning review of the monitor decisions can not be read in the way the county urges.contrary to the county arguments,this provision does not invoke the jurisdiction of c,whereby parties can agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge and authorize him or her to make binding decisions,and instead clearly invokes the relevant provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure,the local rules and the court individual rules governing reports and recommendations from a magistrate judge.once the county chose to seek review from the magistrate judge,it also consented to the application of the rules that govern all magistrate reports and recommendations.federal rule of civil procedure expressly governs this scenario.far from making the decision of a magistrate final,that rule specifically states that the district judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge disposition that has been properly objected to.b.it is plain from the face of the consent decree that the district court did indeed have jurisdiction to review the decision of the magistrate judge once it had been properly objected to by one of the this case,the united states.as we have determined that the district court had jurisdiction below,we now turn to the merits of this appeal.
at issue here is whether the county has breached the consent decree requirement,laid out in paragraph g,that it promote,through the county executive,legislation currently before the board of legislators to ban discrimination in housing.
this court has recently observed that t he ordinary meaning of promote includes to bring or help bring into being,to contribute to the growth,enlargement,or prosperity of,or to encourage or further.united states awan,cir citation omitted.the plain meaning of the word promote naturally remains the same here.thus,in entering into the consent decree,the county agreed to help bring the legislation into being through the county executive.while such a duty certainly does not require the county executive to ensure that the legislation be enacted into law,united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d,promotion requires affirmative action by the obligated party to help bring the object in question into being.while promotion does not require insurance,promotion is also not met by taking no action or taking an action that detracts from,rather than furthers,the end goal.the fact that the county executive does not fulfill the duty to promote if he takes no action or takes affirmative steps to detract from the passage of this legislation does not convert the duty to promote into a duty to ensure.for example,if the board never passed the legislation,but the county executive undertook numerous active steps trying to bring the legislation into being,the duty to promote could be discharged even while the passage would not have been ensured.
despite the requirement imposed by the word promote,the county,relying on suter artist,d,would have us conclude that the obligation contemplated in this provision of the consent decree is unclear in what it requires and is thus intended to be merely hortatory.suter actually holds the converse that where language was intended to be hortatory,it could not be said to provide unambiguous notice of what was required.id.at.to rely on the logic of suter,this court need first consider whether the language at issue is hortatory.in the instant case,the plain language of the agreement belies any claim that the duty to promote was merely hortatory.rather,the duty to promote is one of a series of enumerated duties that the county shall undertake,and thus suter does not provide grounds upon which the county could somehow be relieved of this duty.
the county also insists that because other obligations taken on by the county in this section of the consent decree used terms such as adopt or amend,paragraph g does not actually impose a particular duty upon the county executive.the mere fact that other parts of this section of the consent decree used different verbs to describe other obligations does not change the clear meaning of the duty to promote.by its express terms,paragraph g contemplates a duty of the county to be carried out through the county executive.as the county has repeatedly noted throughout this litigation,the passage of legislation takes both a majority vote from the board and signing by the county executive.a duty to adopt or amend could not apply where the county executive is the operative party because the county executive could not force the board to pass the given legislation.imposing a duty to adopt instead of a duty to promote on the county executive would be attempting to bind the executive to do something not solely within his power.as written,the provision places an affirmative duty on the county executive,one that requires him to help bring the legislation into being.furthermore,the fact that this paragraph is not styled as the duty of the county executive to sign passed legislation does not undermine the plain reading that there is an affirmative duty imposed upon the county executive.namely,the duty to promote is actually broader than a duty merely to sign a legislative enactment once passed by the board.the duty to promote imposes affirmative duties on the executive even before legislative enactment,whereas a duty simply to sign would only impose a duty on the executive after the board had passed the legislation in question.thus,we hold that the plain language of the consent decree imposes a duty on the county,through the county executive,to help bring the legislation into being.
having determined what constitutes promotion,we next consider whether the obligation under paragraph g was a continuing one,as the united states urges and the district court found,or if it was extinguished with the close of the legislative session,as argued by the county.paragraph g calls for the county executive to promote legislation currently before the board of legislators to ban discrimination in housing.the use of currently in this sentence is most naturally read as a descriptor of the legislation in question,providing great detail as to what legislation would be required in a few words by making reference to potential legislation being considered by the board at the time the consent decree was entered.the county urges this provision be read as creating a time period in which the duty to promote would have existednamely,what would have amounted to less than five months from the time of the august entry into the agreement to the end of the legislative session in december.the terms of the agreement do not support this reading.language that would have limited the duty to the scant five months left in the legislative session would have either explicitly set a time limitation or read something like promote before the current board of legislators the consent decree does neither of these things rather,this provision is best read to attach the duty to promote to legislation of the kind pending before the board at the entry of the consent decree.elsewhere in the consent decree,the parties demonstrate that they clearly knew how to establish a temporal obligation if one was intended and to provide mechanisms for the county to apply for the extension of such deadlines,lending further support to interpreting the provisions that lack such deadlines as imposing continuing obligations upon the county.
it is ordinary practice that when a bill is not passed by a legislature during one session,it is introduced again in the next legislative session,which indeed is what occurred in this case.the exact same legislation that was pending at the time of the entry of the consent decree was reintroduced at the start of the board legislative session.because the duty to promote did not expire with the end of the legislative session,the county executive had a continuing duty to promote this legislation that was reintroduced in january.
having concluded that the duty to promote requires the county executive to help bring the legislation into being and that it was not temporally limited to the legislative session,the final question at issue is whether the county breached this duty.the total sum of action taken by the county,through two successive county executives,in relationship to the legislation amounted to a single letter to the board of supervisors from county executive spano in october five identical letters to community organizations from spano in november,thanking them for their work and stating,i hope you will continue your advocacy and efforts in reaching out to members of the board of legislators,in an effort perhaps best characterized as preaching to the choir and county executive astorino june,veto of the legislation passed by the board.while the first two actions do constitute promotion,the veto was wholly inconsistent with the county executive duty to promote.moreover,because the three aforementioned actions were the sum total of what the county executive did with respect to the legislation,and no affirmative steps had been taken to promote the legislation since the november letters to the advocacy organizations,we hold that the county breached its duty to promote under the consent decree.
the county further argues that because the county executive and members of the board are subject to term limits,they can not bind their successors to the obligations of the consent decree a proposition that,if accepted,would terminate all of the obligations under the consent decree at the close of the terms of office during which the agreement was entered.such a conclusion would amount to a sea change in the operation of consent decrees in the united states.elected officials,when entering into such agreements,are serving as representatives of their unit of governance.and this court has had no difficulty concluding that a consent decree is binding on successor public officials a lthough the individual defendants named in the caption no longer serve,no one disputes that the consent decree remains binding on their successors.barcia sitkin,cir.the third circuit has been even more explicit that the election of a new administration does not relieve a local government of valid obligations assumed by previous administrations.harris city of,cir.just as the county would not have been free to break its contract with a vendor or other contractor because of the election of a new administration,so too the election of new officeholders,even into offices,does not permit the county to unilaterally default on its obligations to the court and other litigants.id.we now explicitly hold what we implied in barcia a local government is not relieved of its obligations under a consent decree taken on by a previous administration merely because new local officials will and do take office.
virtually all of the terms of the consent decree require future and continuing action by the county government.while it is true that in new york,the term limits rule prohibits one municipal body from contractually binding its successors in areas relating to governance unless specifically authorized by statute or charter provisions to do so,karedes colella,emphasis added,that rule is inapposite to the case at hand.the cases construing the term limits rule all deal with the actual structure of governance and not with a duty to undertake a substantive action in accordance with a consent decree.see morin foster,county legislature could not amend charter to allow county manager to be removed at will city of utica urban renewal agency doyle,public officials and agency appointees could not enter into agreement extending term of agency executive director hampton heights dev.bd.of water supply,mayor serving term could not appoint water board member serving term.these cases illustrate that governance does not include each and every action taken by an elected official,but rather refers to the actual structuring of the local government and not the enactment of any legislation or the promotion of such legislation.thus,the argument that the term limits rule in new york prevents the county from entering into the consent decree fails.further,the cases cited by the county to the contrary perkins city of chi.heights,cir,and overton city of austin,cir are inapposite on this same ground.both of these cases deal with the restructuring of the local government,changing elections systems from to districts.in addition to the fact that these precedents would not bind this circuit in any event,they remain inapplicable where the structure of governance has not been altered.here,the county entered into the consent decree,agreeing that the county executive would promote the legislation.requiring action on one piece of legislation does not alter the structure of county governance,as occurred in each of the cases cited by the county.we thus hold that the county did have the authority to enter into the consent decree and that the consent decree continues to bind successive elected county officials.
we also note that for the county to now claim that it was without power to do what it expressly represented was in its power as it sought to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in liability is all the more problematic.in entering into the consent decree,the county chose to bind itself to these terms rather than have the district court adjudicate the merits.badgley santacroce,cir.the strong policy encouraging settlement
