background 
the parties in both cases adopt the facts as found by the district courts,with a single exception.quental objects to the district court adoption of testimony given by karen wilson,a representative of the mental health association of connecticut,as discussed below.our recitation thus borrows heavily from the district courts opinions.

on october,knight visited the home of a couple,one of whom was in the end stages of aids.id.at some point,apparently after finishing the survey,knight and the two men began discussing religion.id.knight said she experienced a strong sense of compassion for both men and a leading of the holy spirit to talk with the men regarding salvation.id.after asking the men about their religious beliefs,she told them that good works are not unto salvation,and that salvation was confessing with the mouth that jesus is the son of god and believing in one heart that god raised him from the dead.id.subsequently,after one man stated he did not believe he would be punished for his homosexual lifestyle,knight told him,although god created us and loves us,he does like the homosexual lifestyle.id.after the visit,the men filed complaints against the department with the commission on human rights and opportunities alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the provision of state services and ultimately filed a lawsuit against knight,which was later dismissed.id.
on january,knight received a letter from the department suspending her for four weeks without pay for the good of the service and specifically,for misconduct in her dealings with a homosexual couple during a home visit.id.alteration in the original.knight and the department entered into an agreement reducing the suspension to a period without pay and restricting knight duties to exclude home visits to patients.the agreement required knight to create a plan of correction,to be approved by the program manager,before resuming home visits.id.
knight brought suit on october.both sides moved for summary judgment.in granting defendants motion,the district court found knight religious speech to her clients caused them distress and interfered with the performance of her duties,permitting the state to take action.id.at.further,the district court found knight did not show she was treated differently than other similarly situated employees,or that the state intentionally discriminated against her.id.at.finally,the district court found permitting knight to evangelize to clients would require the imposition of her ideas on a diverse patient population,such that accommodating this religious practice would constitute an undue hardship for the defendants.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii nicolle quental 
quental works as a interpreter for one of the defendants,the state of connecticut commission on the deaf and hearing impaired the commission.quental.comm on the deaf and hearing impaired,d.quental clients include people with mental health disabilities.id.soon after quental was hired,she took and passed a written examination on the national registry of interpreters for the deaf rid code of ethics.id.the code of ethics is a national standard of ethics interpreters follow when providing interpreting services.id.the code is incorporated by reference into the collective bargaining agreement cba governing quental employment.id.the cba states the code shall be honored by both the commission and its employees.id.quental testified that she understood the code to be part of the terms and conditions of her employment.id.

in,quental was on an interpreting assignment for the commission at a mental health facility.id.during a break in the interpreting session,quental spoke with the client about smoking.id.she told the client that the lord had delivered her from smoking.id.alteration in the original.she asked the client if she could pray for him so that he might also quit smoking,and then verbally prayed for the client in his presence.id.the client told quental supervisor,defendant stacie eusko mawson,of the incident the next day.id.mawson told quental it was inappropriate to pray for a client in a client presence,especially clients in mental health facilities.id.at.quental testified that she understood the discussion to mean she should not pray for clients in their presence,especially mentally ill clients,because you do know what could set them off.id.at.
in october,quental was on an interpreting assignment at the university of connecticut health center.id.during the language assessment time when interpreter and client make small talk so the interpreter can assess the client signing shared some of her personal history and religious beliefs with the client.id.when the client told quental she had been sexually abused,quental informed the client that quental had a relationship with the lord and god had helped quental in her past dealing with her past and that he could help her also.id.she also told the client that she used to smoke and that the lord had delivered her from that.id.alterations in the original.quental then gave the client religious tracts entitled should i go to church the key and what does it mean to believe.id.the tracts contained passages from the bible and were stamped with the name of a church.quental testified that even after she familiarized herself with the client signing style,she kept up the conversation about religion because it was obvious that the client was very upset and quental was hopeful that her conversation would give her hope.id.

i.the pickering test 
knight and quental seek the right to discuss and promote their religious beliefs while working with clients receiving government services.both argue the district courts erred in applying the pickering balancing test,which determines the right of the government to discipline its employees for their speech.pickering,at.
public employees do not surrender their first amendment free speech rights by working for the state.lewis cowen,cir.to determine whether a state violates the first amendment by disciplining public employees for their speech requires arriv ing at a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering,at.rankin mcpherson,d.this balancing,commonly called the pickering test,is required because of the state dual role as employer and sovereign.lewis,at.the state role as sovereign constrains its ability to regulate speech,while its role as employer provides the state with greater leeway to control employees speech that threatens to undermine its ability to perform its legitimate functions.id.the courts,however,are charged with ensuring governments do not use their status as employers as a subterfuge to undermine free speech.id.
we first inquire if the speech at issue addressed a matter of public concern.rankin,at.lewis,at.if the public employee speech does not touch on a matter of public concern,it is not entitled to first amendment protection if,however,it does touch upon a matter of public concern,we must balance the interests of the employer in providing effective and efficient public services,against the employee first amendment right to free speech.lewis,at quoting connick myers,d see also rankin,at.in so balancing,we must consider whether the statement sought to be protected impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among,has a detrimental impact on close working relationships or impedes the performance of the speaker duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.lewis,at quoting rankin,at.modification in the original.further,t he more the employee job requires confidentiality,policymaking,or public contact,the greater the state interest in firing her for expression that offends her employer.mcevoy spencer,cir citation omitted.also important is the manner,time,and place of the speech.lewis,at.while the burden of proof lies with the government,t he state need show only a likely interference with its operations,and not an actual disruption.id.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in the original.
on appeal,none of the parties argued the issue of whether the speech in question touched on a matter of public concern.the district court in knight assumed arguendo that the comments touched on a matter of public concern,while the district court in quental failed to address the point.knight,wl,at.in the absence of analysis by the parties,and because we find no violation of appellants first amendment rights,we assume arguendo that the religious speech at issue touches on a matter of public concern.we turn,then,to the second pickering prong balancing the interests of the employer in providing effective and efficient public services with the employees right to free speech.lewis,at quoting connick,at.here,the state showed permitting religious speech when working with clients was and would continue to be disruptive,and that disruption outweighed appellants free speech interests.because appellants jobs both require a great deal of public contact,the state has a significant interest in regulating speech related to that contact.mcevoy,at.knight clients were so upset by her religious speech they brought legal action against the state and knight personally.wilson testified quental interpreting client was upset and agitated by quental religious speech.prohibiting discrimination against an employee speech does not require employers to accept speech that impedes an employee performance of her duties.hankard town of avon,cir quoting domiano village of river grove,cir see also rankin,at.pickering,at.thus,the harmful side effects of the use of religious speech with a client outweigh its benefits to the,so that the employer is justified in taking adverse action against the employee in order to mitigate the negative effects.mcevoy,at.
in addition,the state raised valid establishment clause concerns in limiting the use of religious speech with clients.at a minimum,t he establishment clause prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief county of allegheny am.civil liberties union,d.thus,the interest of the state in avoiding an establishment clause violation may be a compelling one justifying an abridgment of free speech otherwise protected by the first amendment.lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d alteration in the original internal citations and quotations omitted.the supreme court recently recognized that the state interest in avoiding an establishment clause violation may be characterized as compelling,and therefore may justify discrimination.good news club milford cent,d quoting widmar vincent,d.in good news,a christian club for children challenged milford refusal to allow the club use of its facilities after school,based on the club religious nature.id.at.the supreme court found the school had no valid establishment clause interest,in large part because the school did not sponsor the activity.id.at.in contrast,knight and quental are both government employees who engaged in religious speech while providing services.see,santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d prohibiting prayer at football games where prayer offered pursuant to school policy and during a event lee weisman,d prohibiting school sponsorship of prayer at graduation ceremonies.
further,we have held that 
w hen government endeavors to police itself and its employees in an effort to avoid transgressing establishment clause limits,it must be accorded some leeway,even though the conduct it forbids might not inevitably be determined to violate the establishment clause and the limitations it imposes might restrict an individual conduct that might well be protected by the free exercise clause if the individual were not acting as an agent of government.
