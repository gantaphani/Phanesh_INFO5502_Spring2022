held because exemption encompasses only records relating to employee relations and human resources issues,the explosives maps and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that exemption.
a exemption shields only those records relating to personnel rules and practices.when used as an adjective in this manner,the key statutory word personnel refers to human resources matters.for example,a personnel department deals with employee problems and interviews applicants for jobs.foia exemption provides another example,protecting certain personnel files from disclosure.b.t he common and congressional meaning of personnel file is a file maintained by a human resources office collecting personal information about employees,such as examination results and work performance evaluations.rose,supra,at.exemption uses personnel in the exact same way.an agency personnel rules and practices all share a critical feature they concern conditions of employment in federal agencies such matters as hiring and firing,work rules and discipline,compensation and benefits.these items currently fall within the low exemption.and under this court construction of the statutory language,low is all of.
foia purpose reinforces this reading.the statute goal is broad disclosure,and the exemptions must be given a narrow compass.department of justice tax analysts.a narrow construction stands on especially firm footing with respect to exemption,which was intended to hem in the expansive withholding that occurred under the prior apa exemption for internal management records.
exemption,as interpreted here,does not reach the requested explosives information.the data and maps,which calculate and visually portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations,in no way relate to personnel rules and practices,as that term is most naturally understood.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the freedom of information act foia,requires federal agencies to make government records available to the public,subject to nine exemptions for specific categories of material.this case concerns the scope of exemption,which protects from disclosure material that is related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.b.respondent department of the navy navy or government invoked exemption to deny a foia request for data and maps used to help store explosives at a naval base in washington state.we hold that exemption does not stretch so far.
congress enacted foia to overhaul the section of the administrative procedure act apa,ed.that section of the apa was plagued with vague phrases and gradually became more a withholding statute than a disclosure statute.epa mink.congress intended foia to permit access to official information long shielded unnecessarily from public view.at.foia thus mandates that an agency disclose records on request,unless they fall within one of nine exemptions.these exemptions are explicitly made exclusive,at,and must be narrowly construed,fbi abramson.
at issue here is exemption,which shields from compelled disclosure documents related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.b.congress enacted exemption to replace the apa exemption for any matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,ed.believing that the sweep of the phrase internal management had led to excessive withholding,congress drafted exemption to have a narrower reach.department of air force rose.
we considered the extent of that reach in department of air force rose.there,we rejected the government invocation of exemption to withhold case summaries of honor and ethics hearings at the united states air force academy.the exemption,we suggested,primarily targets material concerning employee relations or human resources use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours,statements of policy as to sick leave,and the like.at quoting,hereinafter see rose,at.t he general thrust of exemption,we explained,is simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining such information for public inspection.at.we concluded that the case summaries did not fall within the exemption because they d id not concern only routine matters of merely internal significance.at.but we stated a possible caveat to our interpretation of exemption that understanding of the provision coverage governed,we wrote,at least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.at.
in crooker bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,the circuit converted this caveat into a new definition of exemption scope.crooker approved the use of exemption to shield a manual designed to train government agents in law enforcement surveillance techniques.the circuit noted that it previously had understood exemption to refe r only to pay,pensions,vacations,hours of work,lunch hours,parking,at quoting jordan department of justice.but the court now thought exemption should also cover any predominantly internal materials crooker,at,whose disclosure would significantly ris k circumvention of agency regulations or statutes,at.this construction of exemption,the court reasoned,flowed from foia overall design,its legislative history,and even common sense,because congress could not have meant to enac t a statute whose provisions undermined the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.ibid.
in the ensuing years,three courts of appeals adopted the circuit interpretation of exemption.see,case below massey fbi,kaganove epa,and that interpretation spawned a new terminology courts applying the crooker approach now refer to the low exemption when discussing materials concerning human resources and employee relations,and to the high exemption when assessing records whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.see,at schiller nlrb,cadc.congress,as well,took notice of the circuit decision,borrowing language from crooker to amend exemption e when next enacting revisions to foia.the amended version of exemption e shields certain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes if their disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.b e see freedom of information reform act of,a,stat.
the foia request at issue here arises from the navy operations at naval magazine indian island,a base in puget sound,washington.the navy keeps weapons,ammunition,and explosives on the island.to aid in the storage and transport of these munitions,the navy uses data known as explosive safety quantity distance esqd information,at.esqd information prescribes minimum separation distances for explosives and helps the navy design and construct storage facilities to prevent chain reactions in case of detonation.ibid.the esqd calculations are often incorporated into specialized maps depicting the effects of hypothetical explosions.see,app.
in and,petitioner glen milner,a puget sound resident,submitted foia requests for all esqd information relating to indian island,at.the navy refused to release the data,stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and surrounding community.in support of its decision to withhold the records,the navy invoked exemption.ibid 
the district court granted summary judgment to the navy,and the court of appeals affirmed,relying on the high interpretation developed in crooker,at.the court of appeals explained that the esqd information is predominantly used for the internal purpose of instructing agency personnel on how to do their jobs.at.and disclosure of the material,the court determined,would risk circumvention of the law by point ing out the best targets for those bent on wreaking havoc for example,a terrorist who wished to hit the most damaging target.at.the esqd information,the court concluded,therefore qualified for a high exemption,at.
we granted certiorari in light of the circuit split respecting exemption meaning,and we now reverse.
our consideration of exemption scope starts with its text.see,park fly,dollar park fly,statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose judicial decisions since foia enactment have analyzed and reanalyzed the meaning of the exemption.but comparatively little attention has focused on the provision simple words related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
the key word in that dozen the one that most clearly marks the provision boundaries is personnel.when used as an adjective,as it is here to modify rules and practices,that term refers to human resources matters.personnel,in this common parlance,means the selection,placement,and training of employees and the formulation of policies,procedures,and relations with or involving employees or their representatives.webster third new international dictionary hereinafter webster.so,for example,a personnel department is the department of a business firm that deals with problems affecting the employees of the firm and that usually interviews applicants for jobs.random house dictionary hereinafter random house.personnel management is similarly the phase of management concerned with the engagement and effective utilization of manpower to obtain optimum efficiency of human resources.webster.and a personnel agency is an agency for placing employable persons in jobs employment agency.random house.
foia itself provides an additional example in exemption.see ratzlaf united states,a term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears that exemption,just a few short paragraphs down from exemption,protects from disclosure personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.here too,the statute uses the term personnel as a modifier meaning human resources.see tr.of oral arg.the court it an file,right the government that generally true as we recognized in rose,the common and congressional meaning of personnel file is the file showing,for example,where an employee was born,the names of his parents,where he has lived from time to time,his school records,results of examinations,and evaluations of his work performance.at.it is the file typically maintained in the human resources office otherwise known to recall an example offered above as the personnel department.ibid.
exemption uses personnel in the exact same way.an agency personnel rules and practices are its rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources.the circuit,in a decision,gave as examples matters relating to pay,pensions,vacations,hours of work,lunch hours,parking.jordan,at see supra,at.that is important we doubt any court could know enough about the federal government operations to formulate a comprehensive list.but all the rules and practices referenced in exemption share a critical feature they concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies such matters as hiring and firing,work rules and discipline,compensation and benefits courts in practice have had little difficulty identifying the records that qualify for withholding under this reading they are what now commonly fall within the low exemption.our construction of the statutory language simply makes clear that low is all of and that high is not at all,see infra,at.
the statute purpose reinforces this understanding of the exemption.we have often noted the act goal of broad disclosure and insisted that the exemptions be given a narrow compass.department of justice tax analysts,see department of interior klamath water users protective,this practice of constru ing foia exemptions narrowly,department of justice landano,stands on especially firm footing with respect to exemption.as described earlier,congress worded that provision to hem in the prior apa exemption for any matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency,which agencies had used to prevent access to masses of documents.see rose,at.we would congress purpose by construing exemption to reauthorize the expansive withholding that congress wanted to halt.our reading instead gives the exemption the narrower reach congress intended,at,through the simple device of confining the provision meaning to its words.
the government resists giving personnel its plain meaning on the ground that congress,when drafting exemption,considered but chose not to enact language exempting internal employment rules and practices.brief for respondent,and.this drafting history,the navy maintains,proves that congress did not wish to limit the exemption to matters,at,even if the adjective personnel conveys that meaning in other contexts,at.but we think the navy evidence insufficient the scant history concerning this word change as easily supports the inference that congress merely swapped one synonym for another.mead tilley,noting with respect to the unexplained disappearance of one word from an unenacted bill that mute intermediate legislative maneuvers are not reliable aids to statutory interpretation internal quotation marks omitted.those of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text.we will not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.
exemption,as we have construed it,does not reach the esqd information at issue here.these data and maps calculate and visually portray the magnitude of hypothetical detonations.by no stretch of imagination do they relate to personnel rules and practices,as that term is most naturally understood.they concern the physical rules governing explosives,not the workplace rules governing sailors they address the handling of dangerous materials,not the treatment of employees.the navy therefore may not use exemption,interpreted in accord with its plain meaning to cover human resources matters,to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data.
the government offers two alternative readings of exemption to support withholding the esqd information.we can not square either with the statute.
the navy first encourages us to adopt the construction of exemption pioneered by crooker,which shields material not only if it meets the criteria set out above low,but also if it is predominant ly interna l and its disclosure would significantly risk circumvention of federal agency functions high.brief for respondent internal quotation marks omitted.the dissent,too,favors this reading of the statute.post,at.but the crooker interpretation,as already suggested,suffers from a patent flaw it is disconnected from exemption text.the high test in addition to substituting the word predominantly for solely,see,supra ignores the plain meaning of the adjective personnel,see supra,at,and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or referent in exemption language.indeed,the only way to arrive at high is by taking a red pen to the statute cutting out some words and pasting in others until little of the actual provision remains.elliott department of agriculture,cadc.because this is so,high is better labeled non and low just.
in support of its approach to the statute,the government relies primarily on legislative history,placing particular emphasis on the house report concerning foia.see brief for respondent.a statement in that report buttresses the high understanding of the exemption and,indeed,specifically rejects the low construction.according to the report operating rules,guidelines,and manuals of procedure for government investigators or examiners would be exempt from disclosure under exemption,but this exemption would not cover employee relations and working conditions and routine administrative procedures.but the senate report says exactly the opposite,explaining in support of a low interpretation that the phrase internal personnel rules and practices of an agency means rules as to personnel use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,statements of policy as to sick leave,and the like.at in rose,we gave reasons for thinking the senate report the more reliable of the two.see,at.but the more fundamental point is what we said before legislative history,for those who take it into account,is meant to clear up ambiguity,not create it.see supra,at wong yang sung mcgrath,declining to consult legislative history when that history is more conflicting than the text is ambiguous when presented,on the one hand,with clear statutory language and,on the other,with dueling committee reports,we must choose the language.
the government also advances,in support of crooker high approach,an argument based on subsequent legislative action.congress,the government notes,amended exemption e in to cover law enforcement records whose production would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions,or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could be expected to risk circumvention of the law.b e.that amendment,the government contends,codified crooker circumvention of the law standard and,in so doing,ratified crooker holding.brief for respondent.the dissent likewise counts as significant that congress t ook note of crooker in revising foia.post,at see post,at.
but the government and the dissent neglect the key feature of the amendment congress modified not exemption the subject of crooker,but instead exemption e.and the crooker construction of exemption renders exemption e superfluous and so deprives that amendment of any effect.see,trw andrews,noting canon that statutes should be read to avoid making any provision superfluous,void,or insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.we can not think of any document eligible for withholding under exemption e that the high reading does not capture the circumvention standard is the same,and the law enforcement records listed in exemption e are predominantly internal.so if congress had agreed with crooker reading of exemption,it would have had no reason to alter exemption e.in that event,congress would either have left the statute alone on the theory that crooker would do the necessary work or would have amended exemption specifically to ratify crooker.the decision instead to amend exemption e suggests that congress approved the circumvention standard only as to law enforcement materials,and not as to the wider set of records high covers.perhaps this legislative action does not show that congress affirmatively disagreed with crooker maybe congress was agnostic about whether the circumvention standard should apply to other records.but one thing is clear the amendment does not ratify,approve,or otherwise signal agreement with crooker interpretation of exemption.this argument therefore can not save the high construction.
the dissent offers one last reason to embrace high,and indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.crooker,the dissent asserts,has been consistently relied upon and followed for years by other lower courts.post,at see post,at.but this claim,too,trips at the starting gate.it would be immaterial even if true,because we have no warrant to ignore clear statutory language on the ground that other courts have done so.and in any event,it is not true.prior to crooker,three circuits adopted the reading of exemption we think right,and they have not changed their minds.see,supra since crooker,three other circuits have accepted the high reading.see supra,at.one circuit has reserved judgment on the high debate.see audubon society forest.and the rest have not considered the matter.no one should think crooker has been extensively discussed or debated in the courts of appeals.in the past three decades,crooker analysis of exemption has been cited a sum total of five times in federal appellate decisions outside the circuit on average,once every six years.the result is a to split among the circuits we will not flout all usual rules of statutory interpretation to take the side of the bare majority.
presumably because crooker so departs from exemption language,the government also offers another construction,which it says we might adopt on a clean slate,based on the plain text alone.brief for respondent.on this reading,the exemption encompasses records concerning an agency internal rules and practices for its personnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental functions.at see also,at exemption applies generally to matters concerning internal rules and practices to guide agency personnel in performing their duties according to the government,this interpretation makes sense because the phrase personnel rules and practices of an agency is logically understood to mean an agency rules and practices for its personnel.at emphasis added.
but the purported logic in the government definition eludes us.we would not say,in ordinary parlance,that a personnel file is any file an employee uses,or that a personnel department is any department in which an employee serves.no more would we say that a personnel rule or practice is any rule or practice that assists an employee in doing her job.the use of the term personnel in each of these phrases connotes not that the file or department or is for personnel,but rather that the file or department or is about personnel,that it relates to employee relations or human resources.this case well illustrates the point.the records requested,as earlier noted,are explosives data and maps showing the distances that potential blasts travel.this information no doubt assists navy personnel in storing munitions.but that is not to say that the data and maps relate to personnel rules and practices.no one staring at these charts of explosions and using ordinary language would describe them in this manner.
indeed,the government clean slate construction reaches such documents only by stripping the word personnel of any real meaning.under this interpretation,an agency internal personnel rules and practices appears to mean all its internal rules and practices.that is because agencies necessarily operate through personnel,and so all their internal rules and practices are for personnel.the modifier personnel,then,does no modifying work it does not limit the class of internal rules and practices that exemption covers.what is most naturally viewed as the provision key word the term that ought to define its scope does nothing more than state the truism that in an agency it is personnel who follow internal rules and practices.
and this odd reading would produce a sweeping exemption,posing the risk that foia would become less a disclosure than a withholding statute.mink,at.many documents an agency generates in some way aid employees in carrying out their responsibilities.if exemption were to reach all these records,it would tend to engulf other foia exemptions,rendering ineffective the limitations congress placed on their application.exemption,for example,shields records compiled for law enforcement purposes,but only if one of six specified criteria is met.b.yet on the government view,an agency could bypass these restrictions by invoking exemption whenever law enforcement records guide personnel in performing their duties.indeed,an agency could use exemption as an provision to withhold sensitive records that do not fall within any of foia more targeted exemptions 
interpreted in this way,exemption call it super now would extend,rather than narrow,the apa former exemption for records relating to the internal management of an agency.ed.we doubt that even the internal management provision,which congress thought allowed too much withholding,see supra,at,would have protected all information that guides employees in the discharge of their duties,including the explosives data and maps in this case.and perhaps needless to say,this reading of exemption violates the rule favoring narrow construction of foia exemptions.see,abramson,at rose,at.super in fact has no basis in the text,context,or purpose of foia,and we accordingly reject it.
although we can not interpret exemption as the government proposes,we recognize the strength of the navy interest in protecting the esqd data and maps and other similar information.the government has informed us that p ublicly disclosing the esqd information would significantly risk undermining the navy ability to safely and securely store military ordnance,brief for respondent,and we have no reason to doubt that representation.the ninth circuit similarly cautioned that disclosure of this information could be used to wrea k havoc and make catastrophe more likely.at.concerns of this kind a sense that certain sensitive information should be exempt from disclosure in part led the crooker court to formulate the high standard.see,at contending that common sense supported the high interpretation because congress would not have wanted foia to undermin e the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies and we acknowledge that our decision today upsets three decades of agency practice relying on crooker,and therefore may force considerable adjustments.
we also note,however,that the government has other tools at hand to shield national security information and other sensitive materials.most notably,exemption of foia prevents access to classified documents.b see,at fletcher,dissenting exemption is specifically designed to allow government agencies to withhold information that might jeopardize our national security the government generally may classify material even after receiving a foia request,see exec.order,d,fed.reg.an agency therefore may wait until that time to decide whether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of classification.see tr.of oral arg.exemption also may mitigate the government security concerns.that provision applies to records that any other statute exempts from disclosure,b,thus offering congress an established,streamlined method to authorize the withholding of specific records that foia would not otherwise protect.and exemption,as already noted,protects information compiled for law enforcement purposes that meets one of six criteria,including if its release could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.b f.the navy argued below that the esqd data and maps fall within exemption f,see,supra,and that claim remains open for the ninth circuit to address on remand.
if these or other exemptions do not cover records whose release would threaten the nation vital interests,the government may of course seek relief from congress.see tr.of oral arg.all we hold today is that congress has not enacted the foia exemption the government desires.we leave to congress,as is appropriate,the question whether it should do so.
exemption,consistent with the plain meaning of the term personnel rules and practices,encompasses only records relating to issues of employee relations and human resources.the explosives maps and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that exemption.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice alito,concurring.
i agree with the court that the text of exemption of the freedom of information act of can not support the high interpretation that courts have adopted and applied over the years.as the court explains,however,the government may avail itself of numerous other exemptions,see ante,at exemptions that may have been overshadowed in recent years by the broad reach of high.i write separately to underscore the alternative argument that the navy raised below,which rested on exemption f and which will remain open on remand.see ante,at.
exemption applies to specific categories of information compiled for law enforcement purposes.b.in particular,exemption f permits withholding of records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that,if disclosed,could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.b f.in most cases involving security information,it is not difficult to show that disclosure may endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.a more difficult question,however,is whether the information is compiled for law enforcement purposes.see john doe agency john doe,before it may invoke exemption,the government has the burden of proving the existence of a compilation for such a purpose in my view,this phrase reasonably encompasses information used to fulfill official security and crime prevention duties.
law enforcement purposes.the ordinary understanding of law enforcement includes not just the investigation and prosecution of offenses that have already been committed,but also proactive steps designed to prevent criminal activity and to maintain security.a law enforcement officer is defined as one whose duty it is to preserve the peace,black law dictionary ed,and fulfilling that duty involves a range of activities.police on the beat aim to prevent crime from occurring,and they no less carry out law enforcement purposes than officers investigating a crime scene.similarly,a agency is charged with the apprehension of alleged offenders as well as crime detection and prevention.de sola,crime dictionary emphasis added.
crime prevention and security measures are critical to effective law enforcement as we know it.there can be no doubt,for example,that the secret service acts with a law enforcement purpose when it protects federal officials from attack,even though no investigation may be ongoing.likewise,steps by law enforcement officers to prevent terrorism surely fulfill law enforcement purposes.particularly in recent years,terrorism prevention and national security measures have been recognized as vital to effective law enforcement efforts in our nation.indeed,a fter the september attacks on america,the priorities of the federal bureau of investigation shifted dramatically,and the fbi top priority became the prevention of another terrorist attack.hearings before the subcommittee on science,the departments of state,justice,and commerce,and related agencies of the house committee on appropriations,pt,testimony of fbi director robert mueller iii.today,t he fbi number one priority continues to be the prevention of terrorist attacks against the united states.hearings before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs,sess,testimony of mueller.if crime prevention and security measures do not serve law enforcement purposes,then those charged with law enforcement responsibilities have little chance of fulfilling their duty to preserve the peace.
the context of exemption confirms that,read naturally,law enforcement purposes involve more than just investigation and prosecution.as exemption subparagraphs demonstrate,congress knew how to refer to these narrower activities.see,b a information that could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings b e information that would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions congress decision to use different language to trigger exemption confirms that the concept of law enforcement purposes sweeps in activities beyond investigation and prosecution.see sosa,applying the usual rule that when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended internal quotation marks omitted.
compiled for law enforcement purposes.this court has given a fairly broad meaning to compiled under b.in john doe agency,we held that information need not have been originally compiled for law enforcement purposes to satisfy exemption threshold requirement.rather,even though documents were put together at an earlier time for a different purpose,they may fall within exemption if they are later assembled for law enforcement purposes,at.for example,documents originally gathered for routine business purposes may fall within exemption if they are later compiled for use in a criminal investigation.similarly,federal building plans and related information which may have been compiled originally for architectural planning or internal purposes may fall within exemption if that information is later compiled and given to law enforcement officers for security purposes.
documents compiled for multiple purposes are not necessarily deprived of exemption protection.the text of exemption does not require that the information be compiled solely for law enforcement purposes.b related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency therefore,it may be enough that law enforcement purposes are a significant reason for the compilation.
in this case,the navy has a fair argument that the explosive safety quantity distance esqd information falls within exemption f.the esqd information,the navy argues,is used for the purpose of identifying and addressing security issues and for the protection of people and property on the base,as well as in the nearby community,from the damage,loss,death,or injury that could occur from an accident or breach of security.brief for appellee in.if,indeed,the esqd information was compiled as part of an effort to prevent crimes of terrorism and to maintain security,there is a reasonable argument that the information has been compiled for law enforcement purposes.b.assuming that this threshold requirement is satisfied,the esqd information may fall comfortably within exemption f.

justice stevens has explained that,once a statute has been construed,either by this court or by a consistent course of decision by other federal judges and agencies,it can acquire a clear meaning that this court should hesitate to change.see express mcmahon,opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part emphasis added.see also commissioner fink,stevens,dissenting cardozo,the nature of the judicial process.i would apply that principal to this case and accept the decision by the circuit in crooker bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,en banc,as properly stating the law.
for one thing,the crooker decision,joined by of the sitting circuit judges,has been consistently followed,or favorably cited,by every court of appeals to have considered the matter during the past years.see ibid.written by judge edwards,and joined by chief judge robinson and judges wright,mackinnon,robb,wald,mikva,and ginsburg,with judge tamm concurring in the result and judge wilkey dissenting massey fbi,kaganove epa,cert.denied,dirksen hhs.three circuits adopted a different approach in the before crooker was decided,see ante,at,but i read subsequent decisions in two of those circuits as not adhering to their early positions.see abraham rose,plc united states,finding crooker textual analysis sound and persuasive,and noting that fbi symbols used internally to identify confidential sources may be withheld sladek bensinger,expressly reserving judgment on the crooker issue.as for the remaining circuit,its district courts understand crooker now to apply.see,gavin sec,wl,d,see also mcqueen united states,supp,sd,aff,fed.appx.per curiam tickel irs,wl,ed.i recognize that there is reasonable ground for disagreement over the precise status of certain precedents,but the crooker interpretation of exemption has guided nearly every freedom of information act foia case decided over the last years.see generally of justice,guide to freedom of information act,foia guide identifying over district court decisions applying the crooker approach,and one appearing to reject it.
congress,moreover,well aware of crooker,left exemption,b,untouched when it amended the foia five years later.see,discussing crooker freedom of information reform act of,stat.amending exemption,b.
this court has found that circumstances of this kind offer significant support for retaining an interpretation of a statute that has been settled by the lower courts.see general dynamics land systems,cline,evans united states,monessen southwestern morgan,lindahl office of personnel management,herman maclean huddleston,cannon university of chicago,blue chip stamps manor drug stores,gulf oil copp paving,blau lehman.see generally eskridge,frickey,garrett,cases and materials on legislation ed.t he acquiescence rule can also support implicit congressional ratification of a uniform line of federal appellate interpretations 
for another thing,even if the majority analysis would have persuaded me if written on a blank slate,crooker analysis was careful and its holding reasonable.the circuit court examined the statute language,the legislative history,and the precedent.it recognized that the exemption words related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency could easily be read,as the court reads them today,to refer only to human resources rules and practices.see,at.but it also thought that those words could be read more broadly as referring to internal rules or practices that set forth criteria or guidelines for agency personnel to follow in respect to purely internal matters as long as the information at issue was not of legitimate public interest at.
the circuit agreed with today court that the senate report described the exemption as referring to internal personnel matters,giving as examples personnel use of parking facilities,sick leave,and the like.at quo
