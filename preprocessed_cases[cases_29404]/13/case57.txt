the federal power act fpa authorizes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to regulate the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce,including both wholesale electricity rates and any rule or practice affecting such rates.b,a,a.but it places beyond ferc power,leaving to the states alone,the regulation of any other sale any retail sale of electricity.b.
in an increasingly competitive interstate electricity market,ferc has undertaken to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rates,a,by encouraging the creation of nonprofit entities to manage regions of the nationwide electricity grid.these wholesale market operators administer their portions of the grid to ensure that the network conducts electricity reliably,and each holds competitive auctions to set wholesale prices.these auctions balance supply and demand continuously by matching bids to provide electricity from generators with orders from utilities and other entities lses that buy power at wholesale for resale to users.all bids to supply electricity are stacked from lowest to highest,and accepted in that order until all requests for power have been met.every electricity supplier is paid the price of the bid,known as the locational marginal price lmp.
in periods of high electricity demand,prices can reach extremely high levels as the least efficient generators have their supply bids accepted in the wholesale market auctions.not only do rates rise dramatically during these peak periods,but the increased flow of electricity threatens to overload the grid and cause substantial service problems.faced with these challenges,wholesale market operators devised wholesale demand response programs,which pay consumers for commitments to reduce their use of power during these peak periods.just like bids to supply electricity,offers from aggregators of multiple users of electricity or large individual consumers to reduce consumption can be bid into the wholesale market auctions.when it costs less to pay consumers to refrain from using power than it does to pay producers to supply more of it,demand response can lower these wholesale prices and increase grid reliability.wholesale operators began integrating these programs into their markets some years ago and ferc authorized their use.congress subsequently encouraged further development of demand response.
spurred on by congress,ferc issued order,which,among other things,requires wholesale market operators to receive demand response bids from aggregators of electricity consumers,except when the state regulatory authority overseeing those users retail purchases bars demand response participation.cfr g.concerned that the order had not gone far enough,ferc then issued the rule under review here,order.g v rule.it requires market operators to pay the same price to demand response providers for conserving energy as to generators for producing it,so long as a net benefits test,which ensures that accepted bids actually save consumers money,is met.the rule rejected an alternative compensation scheme that would have subtracted from lmp the savings consumers receive from not buying electricity in the retail market,a formula known as.the rule also rejected claims that ferc lacked statutory authority to regulate the compensation operators pay for demand response bids.
the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the rule,holding that ferc lacked authority to issue the order because it directly regulates the retail electricity market,and holding in the alternative that the rule compensation scheme is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act.
the fpa provides ferc with the authority to regulate wholesale market operators compensation of demand response bids.the court analysis proceeds in three parts.first,the practices at issue directly affect wholesale rates.second,ferc has not regulated retail sales.taken together,these conclusions establish that the rule complies with the fpa plain terms.third,the contrary view would conflict with the fpa core purposes.
a the practices at issue directly affect wholesale rates.the fpa has delegated to ferc the authority and,indeed,the duty to ensure that rules or practices affecting wholesale rates are just and reasonable.a,a.to prevent the statute from assuming breadth,see,new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,this court adopts the circuit construction limiting ferc affecting jurisdiction to rules or practices that directly affect the wholesale rate,california independent system operator ferc,emphasis added.that standard is easily met here.wholesale demand response is all about reducing wholesale rates so too the rules and practices that determine how those programs operate.that is particularly true here,as the formula for compensating demand response necessarily lowers wholesale electricity prices by displacing generation bids.
b the rule also does not regulate retail electricity sales in violation of b.a ferc regulation does not run afoul of b proscription just because it affects the quantity or terms of retail sales.transactions occurring on the wholesale market have natural consequences at the retail level,and so too,of necessity,will ferc regulation of those wholesale matters.that is of no legal consequence.see,mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore.when ferc regulates what takes place on the wholesale market,as part of carrying out its charge to improve how that market runs,then no matter the effect on retail rates,b imposes no bar.here,every aspect of ferc regulatory plan happens exclusively on the wholesale market and governs exclusively that market rules.the commission justifications for regulating demand response are likewise only about improving the wholesale market.oneok,learjet.
c in addition,epsa position would subvert the fpa.epsa arguments suggest that the entire practice of wholesale demand response falls outside what ferc can regulate,and epsa concedes that states also lack that authority.but under the fpa,wholesale demand response programs could not go forward if no entity had jurisdiction to regulate them.that outcome would flout the fpa core purposes of protecting against excessive prices and ensuring effective transmission of electric power.pennsylvania water power fpc,see gulf states util.fpc.the fpa should not be read,against its clear terms,to halt a practice that so evidently enables ferc to fulfill its statutory duties of holding down prices and enhancing reliability in the wholesale energy market.
ferc decision to compensate demand response providers at lmp the same price paid to generators instead of at,is not arbitrary and capricious.under the narrow scope of review in motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins,this court important but limited role is to ensure that ferc engaged in reasoned decisionmaking that it weighed competing views,selected a compensation formula with adequate support in the record,and intelligibly explained the reasons for making that decision.here,ferc provided a detailed explanation of its choice of lmp and responded at length to contrary views.ferc serious and careful discussion of the issue satisfies the arbitrary and capricious standard.

justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal power act fpa or act,stat,as amended,et,authorizes the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission to regulate the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce,including both wholesale electricity rates and any rule or practice affecting such rates.b,a.but the law places beyond ferc power,and leaves to the states alone,the regulation of any other sale most notably,any retail sale of electricity.b.that statutory division generates a steady flow of jurisdictional disputes because in point of fact if not of law the wholesale and retail markets in electricity are inextricably linked.
these cases concern a practice called demand response,in which operators of wholesale markets pay electricity consumers for commitments not to use power at certain times.that practice arose because wholesale market operators can sometimes say,on a muggy august day offer electricity both more cheaply and more reliably by paying users to dial down their consumption than by paying power plants to ramp up their production.in the regulation challenged here,ferc required those market operators,in specified circumstances,to compensate the two services equivalently that is,to pay the same price to demand response providers for conserving energy as to generators for making more of it.
two issues are presented here.first,and,does the fpa permit ferc to regulate these demand response transactions at all,or does any such rule impinge on the states authority second,even if ferc has the requisite statutory power,did the commission fail to justify adequately why demand response providers and electricity producers should receive the same compensation the court below ruled against ferc on both scores.we disagree.
federal regulation of electricity owes its beginnings to one of this court decisions.in the early century,state and local agencies oversaw nearly all generation,transmission,and distribution of electricity.but this court held in public util.comm of attleboro steam,that the commerce clause bars the states from regulating certain interstate electricity transactions,including wholesale sales,sales for resale across state lines.that ruling created what became known as the attleboro gap a regulatory void which,the court pointedly noted,only congress could fill.see,at.
congress responded to that invitation by passing the fpa in.the act charged ferc predecessor agency with undertaking effective federal regulation of the expanding business of transmitting and selling electric power in interstate commerce.new york ferc,quoting gulf states util.fpc.under the statute,the commission has authority to regulate the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.b.
in particular,the fpa obligates ferc to oversee all prices for those interstate transactions and all rules and practices affecting such prices.the statute provides that a ll rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility for or in connection with interstate transmissions or wholesale sales as well as all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges must be just and reasonable.a.and if any rate or charge,or any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate or charge,falls short of that standard,the commission must rectify the problem it then shall determine what is just and reasonable and impose the same by order.a.
alongside those grants of power,however,the act also limits ferc regulatory reach,and thereby maintains a zone of exclusive state jurisdiction.as pertinent here,b the same provision that gives ferc authority over wholesale sales states that this subchapter,including its delegation to ferc,shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy.accordingly,the commission may not regulate either wholesale sales or,more pertinent here,retail sales of electricity,sales directly to users.see new york,at.state utility commissions continue to oversee those transactions.
since the fpa passage,electricity has increasingly become a competitive interstate business,and ferc role has evolved accordingly.decades ago,state or local utilities controlled their own power plants,transmission lines,and delivery systems,operating as vertically integrated monopolies in confined geographic areas.that is no longer so.independent power plants now abound,and almost all electricity flows not through the local power networks of the past,but instead through an interconnected grid of scope.see,at electricity that enters the grid immediately becomes a part of a vast pool of energy that is constantly moving in interstate commerce,linking producers and users across the country.in this new world,ferc often forgoes the traditionally used to prevent monopolistic pricing.the commission instead undertakes to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rates by enhancing competition attempting,as we recently explained,to break down regulatory and economic barriers that hinder a free market in wholesale electricity.morgan stanley capital group public util.dist.of snohomish.
as part of that effort,ferc encouraged the creation of nonprofit entities to manage wholesale markets on a regional basis.seven such wholesale market operators now serve areas with roughly of the country electricity load an industry term for the amount of electricity used.see ferc,energy primer a handbook of energy market basics energy primer.each administers a portion of the grid,providing generators with access to transmission lines and ensuring that the network conducts electricity reliably.see ibid.and still more important for present purposes,each operator conducts a competitive auction to set wholesale prices for electricity.
these wholesale auctions serve to balance supply and demand on a continuous basis,producing prices for electricity that reflect its value at given locations and times throughout each day.such a mechanism is needed because,unlike most products,electricity can not be stored effectively.suppliers must generate every day,hour,and minute the exact amount of power necessary to meet demand from the utilities and other entities lses that buy power at wholesale for resale to users.to ensure that happens,wholesale market operators obtain orders from lses indicating how much electricity they need at various times and bids from generators specifying how much electricity they can produce at those times and how much they will charge for it.operators accept the generators bids in order of cost least expensive first until they satisfy the lses total demand.the price of the last unit of electricity purchased is then paid to every supplier whose bid was accepted,regardless of its actual offer and the total cost is split among the lses in proportion to how much energy they have ordered.so,for example,suppose that at on august four plants serving washington,can each produce some amount of electricity for,respectively,and.and suppose that lses demand at that time and place is met after the operator accepts the three cheapest bids.the first three generators would then all receive.that amount is think back to econ the marginal cost,the added cost of meeting another unit of demand which is the price an efficient market would produce.see kahn,the economics of regulation principles and institutions.ferc calls that cost in jargon that will soon become oddly familiar the locational marginal price,or lmp 
as in any market,when wholesale buyers demand for electricity increases,the price they must pay rises correspondingly and in those times of peak load,the grid reliability may also falter.suppose that by on august,it is degrees in c.in every home,store,or office,people are turning the air conditioning up.to keep providing power to their customers,utilities and other lses must ask their market operator for more electricity.to meet that spike in demand,the operator will have to accept more expensive bids from suppliers.the operator,that is,will have to agree to the bid that it spurned before and maybe,beyond that,to bids of or or.in such periods,operators often must call on extremely inefficient generators whose high costs of production cause them to sit idle most of the time.see energy primer.as that happens,lmp the price paid by all lses to all suppliers climbs ever higher.and meanwhile,the increased flow of electricity through the grid threatens to overload transmission lines.see,at.as every consumer knows,it is just when the weather is hottest and the need for air conditioning most acute that blackouts,brownouts,and other service problems tend to occur.
making matters worse,the wholesale electricity market lacks the mechanism of other markets.usually,when the price of a product rises,buyers naturally adjust by reducing how much they purchase.but consumers of electricity and therefore the utilities and other lses buying power for them at wholesale do not respond to price signals in that way.to use the economic term,demand for electricity is inelastic.that is in part because electricity is a necessity with few ready substitutes when the temperature reaches degrees,many people see no option but to switch on the ac.and still more many state regulators insulate consumers from fluctuations in wholesale prices by insisting that lses set stable retail rates.see,at.that,one might say,the normal rules of economic behavior.even in peak periods,as costs surge in the wholesale market,consumers feel no pinch,and so keep running the ac as before.that means,in turn,that lses must keep buying power to send to those users no matter that wholesale prices spiral out of control and increased usage risks overtaxing the grid.
but what if there were an alternative to that scenario consider what would happen if wholesale market operators could induce consumers to refrain from using and so lses from buying electricity during peak periods.whenever doing that costs less than adding more power,an operator could bring electricity supply and demand into balance at a lower price.and simultaneously,the operator could ease pressure on the grid,thus protecting against system failures.that is the idea behind the practice at issue here wholesale demand response,as it is called,pays consumers for commitments to curtail their use of power,so as to curb wholesale rates and prevent grid breakdowns.see,at 
these demand response programs work through the operators regular auctions.aggregators of multiple users of electricity,as well as individual users like factories or stores,submit bids to decrease electricity consumption by a set amount at a set time for a set price.the wholesale market operators treat those offers just like bids from generators to increase supply.the operators,that is,rank order all the bids both to produce and to refrain from consuming electricity from least to most expensive,and then accept the lowest bids until supply and demand come into equipoise.and,once again,the lses pick up the cost of all those payments.so,to return to our prior example,if a store submitted an offer not to use a unit of electricity at on august for,the operator would accept that bid before calling on the generator that offered to produce a unit of power for.that would result in a lower lmp again,wholesale market price than if the market operator could not avail itself of demand response pledges.see council,harnessing the power of demand how isos and rtos are integrating demand response into wholesale electricity markets estimating that,in one market,a demand response program reducing electricity usage by in peak hours would lead to price declines of to.and it would decrease the risk of blackouts and other service problems.
wholesale market operators began using demand response some years ago,soon after they assumed the role of overseeing wholesale electricity sales.recognizing the value of demand response for both system reliability and efficient pricing,they urged ferc to allow them to implement such programs.see,pjm interconnection,order accepting tariff sheets as modified,ferc california independent system operator,order conditionally accepting for filing tariff revisions,ferc.and as demand response went into effect,market participants of many kinds came to view it in the words of respondent electric power supply association epsa as an important element of robust,competitive wholesale electricity markets.app,epsa,comments on proposed rule on demand response compensation in organized wholesale energy markets may.
congress added to the chorus of voices praising wholesale demand response.in the energy policy act of,stat.epact,it declared as the policy of the united states that such demand response shall be encouraged.f,stat,note.in particular,congress directed,the deployment of technology and devices that enable electricity customers to participate in demand response systems shall be facilitated,and unnecessary barriers to demand response participation in energy markets shall be eliminated.ibid 
spurred on by congress,the commission determined to take a more active role in promoting wholesale demand response programs.in,ferc issued order,which among other things requires wholesale market operators to receive demand response bids from aggregators of electricity consumers,except when the state regulatory authority overseeing those users retail purchases bars such demand response participation.see fed.reg,codified cfr g.that original order allowed operators to compensate demand response providers differently from generators if they so chose.no party sought judicial review.
concerned that order had not gone far enough,ferc issued the rule under review here in,with one commissioner dissenting.see demand response competition in organized wholesale energy markets,order,fed.reg.rule codified cfr g v.the rule attempts to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rates by requiring market operators to appropriately compensate demand response providers and thus bring about meaningful participation in the wholesale markets.fed.reg,a.the rule most significant provision directs operators,under two specified conditions,to pay lmp for any accepted demand response bid,just as they do for successful supply bids.see fed.reg.in other words,the rule requires that demand response providers in those circumstances receive as much for conserving electricity as generators do for producing it.
the two specified conditions ensure that a bid to use less electricity provides the same value to the wholesale market as a bid to make more.first,a demand response bidder must have the capability to provide the service offered it must,that is,actually be able to reduce electricity use and thereby obviate the operator need to secure additional power,at.second,paying lmp for a demand response bid must be,as measured by a standard called the net benefits test.that test makes certain that accepting a demand response bid over a supply bid will actually save lses,wholesale purchasers money.in some situations it will not,even though accepting a bid by definition reduces lmp.that is because to oversimplify a bit lses share the cost of paying successful bidders,and reduced electricity use makes some lses drop out of the market,placing a proportionally greater burden on those that are left.each remaining lse may thus wind up paying more even though the total bill is lower or said otherwise,the costs associated with an lse increased share of compensating bids may exceed the savings that the lse obtains from a lower wholesale price the net benefits test screens out such counterproductive demand response bids,exempting them from the rule compensation requirement.see,at.what remains are only those offers whose acceptance will result in actual savings to wholesale purchasers along with more reliable service to end users.see,at.
the rule rejected an alternative scheme for compensating demand response bids.several commenters had urged that,in paying a demand response provider,an operator should subtract from the ordinary wholesale price the savings that the provider nets by not buying electricity on the retail market.otherwise,the commenters claimed,demand response providers would receive a kind of relative to generators.see,at.that proposal,which the dissenting commissioner largely accepted,became known as lmp minus g,or more simply,where g stands for the retail price of electricity.see,at,moeller,dissenting.but ferc explained that,under the conditions it had specified,the value of an accepted demand response bid to the wholesale market is identical to that of an accepted supply bid because each succeeds in balanc ing supply and demand.at.and,the commission reasoned,that comparable value is what ought to matter given ferc goal of strengthening competition in the wholesale market rates should reflect not the costs that each market participant incurs,but instead the services it provides.see,at.moreover,the rule stated,compensating demand response bids at their actual value,lmp will help overcome various technological barriers,including a lack of needed infrastructure,that impede aggregators and users of electricity from fully participating in demand response programs.see,at.
the rule also responded to comments challenging ferc statutory authority to regulate the compensation operators pay for demand response bids.pointing to the commission analysis in order,the rule explained that the fpa gives ferc jurisdiction over such bids because they directly affect wholesale rates.at,citing,at,and.nonetheless,the rule noted,ferc would continue order policy of allowing any state regulatory body to prohibit consumers in its retail market from taking part in wholesale demand response programs.see fed.reg,at.accordingly,the rule does not require any action that would violate state laws or regulations.at.
a divided panel of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the rule as ultra vires agency action.the court held that ferc lacked authority to issue the rule even though demand response compensation affects the wholesale market.at.the commission jurisdiction to regulate practices affecting rates,the court stated,does not erase the specific limit that the fpa imposes on ferc regulation of retail sales,at.and the rule,the court concluded,exceeds that limit in luring retail customers into the wholesale market,and causing them to decrease levels of retail electricity consumption,the rule engages in direct regulation of the retail market.at.
the court of appeals held,alternatively,that the rule is arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act,a,because ferc failed to adequately explain why paying lmp to demand response providers results in just compensation.at.according to the court,ferc did not properly consider the view that such a payment would give those providers a windfall by leaving them with the full lmp plus the savings associated with reduced consumption.ibid.quoting demand response competition in organized wholesale energy markets order on rehearing and clarification,order rehearing order,ferc,moeller,dissenting.the court dismissed out of hand the idea that comparable contributions could be the reason for equal compensation.at.
judge edwards dissented.he explained that the rules governing wholesale demand response have a direct effect on wholesale electricity rates squarely within ferc jurisdiction.at.and in setting those rules,he argued,ferc did not engage in direct regulation of the retail market rather,a uthority over retail rates remains vested solely in the states.at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,judge edwards rejected the majority view that the rule is arbitrary and capricious.he noted the substantial deference due to the commission in cases involving ratemaking,and concluded that ferc provided a thorough and reasonable explanation for choosing lmp as the appropriate compensation formula,at.
we granted certiorari,to decide whether the commission has statutory authority to regulate wholesale market operators compensation of demand response bids and,if so,whether the rule challenged here is arbitrary and capricious.we now hold that the commission has such power and that the rule is adequately reasoned.we accordingly reverse.
our analysis of ferc regulatory authority proceeds in three parts.first,the practices at issue in the rule market operators payments for demand response commitments directly affect wholesale rates.second,in addressing those practices,the commission has not regulated retail sales.taken together,those conclusions establish that the rule complies with the fpa plain terms.and third,the contrary view would conflict with the act core purposes by preventing all use of a tool that no one not even epsa disputes will curb prices and enhance reliability in the wholesale electricity market 
the fpa delegates responsibility to ferc to regulate the interstate wholesale market for electricity both wholesale rates and the panoply of rules and practices affecting them.as noted earlier,the act establishes a scheme for federal regulation of the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.b see supra,at.under the statute,a ll rates and charges made,demanded,or received by any public utility for or in connection with interstate wholesale sales shall be just and reasonable so too shall all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges.a.and if ferc sees a violation of that standard,it must take remedial action.more specifically,whenever the commission shall find that any rate or charge or any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate or charge is unjust or unreasonable,then the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate,charge,rule,regulation,practice or contract and impose the same by order.a.that means ferc has the authority and,indeed,the duty to ensure that rules or practices affecting wholesale rates are just and reasonable.
taken for all it is worth,that statutory grant could extend ferc power to some surprising places.as the court below noted,markets in all electricity inputs steel,fuel,and labor most prominent among them might affect generators supply of power.see,at,at edwards,dissenting.and for that matter,markets in just about everything the whole economy,as it were might influence lses demand.so if indirect or tangential impacts on wholesale electricity rates sufficed,ferc could regulate now in one industry,now in another,changing a vast array of rules and practices to implement its vision of reasonableness and justice.we can not imagine that was what congress had in mind.
for that reason,an earlier circuit decision adopted,and we now approve,a construction of the fpa language,limiting ferc affecting jurisdiction to rules or practices that directly affect the wholesale rate.california independent system operator ferc,emphasis added see,at edwards,dissenting.as we have explained in addressing similar terms like relating to or in connection with,a reading is needed to prevent the statute from assuming breadth.see new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,if relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes the statute would never run its course maracich spears,slip,at the phrase in connection with is essentially indeterminat e because connections,like relations,stop nowhere internal quotation marks omitted.the commission itself incorporated the circuit standard in addressing its authority to issue the rule.see fed.reg,stating that ferc has jurisdiction because wholesale demand response directly affects wholesale rates we think it right to do the same.
still,the rules governing wholesale demand response programs meet that standard with room to spare.in general and as earlier described,wholesale market operators employ demand response bids in competitive auctions that balance wholesale supply and demand and thereby set wholesale prices.see supra,at.the operators accept such bids if and only if they bring down the wholesale rate by displacing generation.and when that occurs most often in peak periods,the easing of pressure on the grid,and the avoidance of service problems,further contributes to lower charges.see brief for grid engineers et as amici curiae.wholesale demand response,in short,is all about reducing wholesale rates so too,then,the rules and practices that determine how those programs operate.
and that is particularly true of the formula that operators use to compensate demand response providers.as in other areas of life,greater pay leads to greater participation.if rewarded at lmp,rather than at some lesser amount,more demand response providers will enter more bids capable of displacing generation,thus necessarily lowering wholesale electricity prices.further,the commission found,heightened demand response participation will put downward pressure on generators own bids,encouraging power plants to offer their product at reduced prices lest they come away from the bidding process.fed.reg.that,too,ratchets down the rates wholesale purchasers pay.compensation for demand response thus directly affects wholesale prices.indeed,it is hard to think of a practice that does so more.
the above conclusion does not end our inquiry into the commission statutory authority to uphold the rule,we also must determine that it does not regulate retail electricity sales.that is because,as earlier described,b limit s ferc sale jurisdiction to that at wholesale,reserving regulatory authority over retail sales as well as intrastate wholesale sales to the states.new york,at emphasis deleted see b supra,at ferc can not take an action transgressing that limit no matter how direct,or dramatic,its impact on wholesale rates.suppose,to take a example,that the commission issued a regulation compelling every consumer to buy a certain amount of electricity on the retail market.such a rule would necessarily determine the load purchased on the wholesale market too,and thus would alter wholesale prices.but even given that ineluctable consequence,the regulation would exceed ferc authority,as defined in b,because it specifies terms of sale at retail which is a job for the states alone 
yet a ferc regulation does not run afoul of b proscription just because it affects even substantially the quantity or terms of retail sales.it is a fact of economic life that the wholesale and retail markets in electricity,as in every other known product,are not hermetically sealed from each other.to the contrary,transactions that occur on the wholesale market have natural consequences at the retail level.and so too,of necessity,will ferc regulation of those wholesale matters.oneok,learjet,slip,at noting that in the similarly structured world of natural gas regulation,a platonic ideal of strict separation between federal and state realms can not exist.when ferc sets a wholesale rate,when it changes wholesale market rules,when it allocates electricity as between wholesale purchasers in short,when it takes virtually any action respecting wholesale transactions it has some effect,in either the short or the long term,on retail rates.that is of no legal consequence.see,mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore,holding that an order regulating wholesale purchases fell within ferc jurisdiction,and preempted contrary state action,even though it clearly affected retail prices nantahala power light thornburg,same fpc louisiana power light,holding similarly in the natural gas context.when ferc regulates what takes place on the wholesale market,as part of carrying out its charge to improve how that market runs,then no matter the effect on retail rates,b imposes no bar.
and in setting rules for demand response,that is all ferc has done.the commission rule addresses and addresses only transactions occurring on the wholesale market.recall once again how demand response works and forgive the coming italics.see supra,at.wholesale market operators administer the entire program,receiving every demand response bid made.those operators accept such a bid at the mandated price when and only when the bid provides value to the wholesale market by balancing supply and demand more ly at a lower cost to wholesale purchasers than a bid to generate power.fed.reg.the compensation paid for a successful bid lmp is whatever the operator auction has determined is the marginal price of wholesale electricity at a particular location and time.see,at.and those footing the bill are the same wholesale purchasers that have benefited from the lower wholesale price demand response participation has produced.see,at.in sum,whatever the effects at the retail level,every aspect of the regulatory plan happens exclusively on the wholesale market and governs exclusively that market rules.
what is more,the commission justifications for regulating demand response are all about,and only about,improving the wholesale market.oneok,at slip,at considering the target at which a law aims in determining whether a state is properly regulating retail or,instead,improperly regulating wholesale sales.in order,ferc explained that demand response participation could help create a competitive wholesale electric energy market with reduce d wholesale power prices and enhance d reliability.fed.reg.and in the rule under review,ferc expanded on that theme.it listed the several ways in which demand response in organized wholesale energy markets can help improve the functioning and competitiveness of those markets by replacing,inefficient generation exerting downward pressure on generator bidding strategies and support ing system reliability.at,see notice of proposed rulemaking for order,at,noting similar aims supra,at.ferc,that is,focused wholly on the benefits that demand response participation in the wholesale market could bring to the wholesale market.the retail market figures no more in the rule goals than in the mechanism through which the rule operates.
epsa primary argument that ferc has usurped state power echoed in the dissent maintains that the rule effectively,even though not nominal ly,regulates retail prices.see,brief for respondents,tr.of oral arg,post,at.the argument begins on universally accepted ground under b,only the states,not ferc,can set retail rates.see,fpc conway.but as epsa concedes,that tenet alone can not make its case,because ferc rule does not set actual rates states continue to make or approve all retail rates,and in doing so may insulate them from price fluctuations in the wholesale market.see brief for respondents.still,epsa contends,rudimentary economic analysis shows that the rule does the functional equivalen t of setting more particularly,of raising retail rates,at.that is because the opportunity to make demand response bids in the wholesale market changes consumers calculations.in deciding whether to buy electricity at retail,consumers now consider both the cost of making such a purchase and the cost of forgoing a possible demand response payment.so,epsa explains,if a factory can buy electricity for,but can earn for not buying power at peak times,then the effective retail rate at those times is the the factory paid at retail plus the it passed up.see,at.and by thus increasing effective retail rates,epsa concludes,ferc trespasses on the states ground.
the modifier effective is doing quite a lot of work in that argument more work than any conventional understanding of allows.the standard dictionary definition of the term rate as used with reference to prices is a n amount paid or charged for a good or service.black law dictionary ed.see,oxford english dictionary ed.rate means price,cost,or sum paid or asked for a thing to set a retail electricity rate is thus to establish the amount of money a consumer will hand over in exchange for power.nothing in b or any other part of the fpa suggests a more expansive notion,in which ferc sets a rate for electricity merely by altering consumers incentives to purchase that product and neither does anything in this court caselaw.our decisions uniformly speak about rates,for electricity and all else,in only their most prosaic,sense.as the solicitor general summarized that view,the rate is what it is.tr.of oral arg.it is the price paid,not the price paid plus the cost of a forgone economic opportunity.
consider a familiar scenario to see what is odd about epsa theory.imagine that a flight is overbooked.the airline offers passengers to move to a later plane that has extra seats.on epsa view,that offer adds the cost of not accepting the airline proffered payment to the price of every continuing passenger ticket.so a person who originally spent for his ticket,and decides to reject the airline proposal,paid an effective price of.but would any passenger getting off the plane say he had paid to fly that is highly unlikely.and airline lawyers and regulators including many,we are sure,with economics appear to share that view.it is in fact illegal to increase the price of air transportation after such air transportation has been purchased by the consumer.cfr a.but it is a safe bet that no airline has ever gotten into trouble by offering a payment not to fly 
and epsa effective price increase claim fares even worse when it comes to payments not to use electricity.in epsa universe,a wholesale demand response program raises retail rates by compelling consumers to pay the price of forgoing demand response compensation.but such a consumer would be even more surprised than our air traveler to learn of that price hike,because the natural consequence of wholesale demand response programs is to bring down retail rates.once again,wholesale market operators accept demand response bids only if those offers lower the wholesale price.see supra,at.and when wholesale prices go down,retail prices tend to follow,because state regulators can,and mostly do,insist that wholesale buyers eventually pass on their savings to consumers.epsa theoretical construct thus runs headlong into the real world of electricity sales where the rule does anything but increase retail prices.
epsa second argument that ferc intruded into the states sphere is more historical and purposive in nature.according to epsa,ferc deliberately lured retail customers into the wholesale markets and,more,ferc did so only because it was dissatisfied with the states exercise of their undoubted authority under b to regulate retail sales.brief for respondents see,at.in particular,epsa asserts,ferc disapproved of many states continued preference for stable pricing that is,for insulating retail rates from fluctuations in wholesale costs,at.in promoting demand response programs or,in epsa somewhat less neutral language,in forc ing retail customers to respond to wholesale price signals ferc acted for the express purpose of overriding that state policy,at.
that claim initially founders on the true facts of how wholesale demand response came about.contra epsa,the commission did not invent the practice.rather,and as described earlier,the impetus came from wholesale market operators.see supra,at.in designing their newly organized markets,those operators recognized almost at once that demand response would lower wholesale electricity prices and improve the grid reliability.so they quickly sought,and obtained,ferc approval to institute such programs.demand response,then,emerged not as a commission power grab,but instead as a innovation for more optimally balancing wholesale electricity supply and demand.
and when,years later after congress,too,endorsed the practice,ferc began to play a more proactive role,it did so for the identical reason to enhance the wholesale,not retail,electricity market.like the market operators,ferc saw that demand in peak periods threatened network breakdowns,compelled purchases from inefficient generators,and consequently drove up wholesale prices.see,fed.reg,at,see supra,at.addressing those problems which demand response does falls within the sweet spot of ferc statutory charge.so ferc took action promoting the practice.no doubt ferc recognized connections,running in both directions,between the states policies and its own.the commission understood that by insulating consumers from price fluctuations,states contributed to the wholesale market difficulties in optimally balancing supply and demand.see fed.reg,supra,at.and ferc realized that increased use of demand response in that market would by definition inhibit retail sales otherwise subject to state control.see fed.reg.but nothing supports epsa more feverish idea that the commission interest in wholesale demand response emerged from a yen to usurp state authority over,or impose its own regulatory agenda on,retail sales.in promoting demand response,ferc did no more than follow the dictates of its regulatory mission to improve the competitiveness,efficiency,and reliability of the wholesale market.
indeed,the finishing blow to both of epsa arguments comes from ferc notable solicitude toward the states.as explained earlier,the rule allows any state regulator to prohibit its consumers from making demand response bids in the wholesale market.see,at,at,supra,at.although claiming the ability to negate such state decisions,the commission chose not to do so in recognition of the linkage between wholesale and retail markets and the states role in overseeing retail sales.see fed.reg.the veto power thus granted to the states belies epsa view that ferc aimed to obliterate their regulatory authority or override their pricing policies.brief for respondents.and that veto gives states the means to block whatever effective increases in retail rates demand response programs might be thought to produce.wholesale demand response as implemented in the rule is a program of cooperative federalism,in which the states retain the last word.that feature of the rule removes any conceivable doubt as to its compliance with b allocation of federal and state authority.
one last point,about how epsa position would subvert the fpa.
epsa jurisdictional claim,as may be clear by now,stretches very far.its point is not that this single rule,relating to compensation levels,exceeds ferc power.instead,epsa arguments that rewarding energy conservation raises effective retail rates and that luring consumers onto wholesale markets aims to disrupt state policies suggest that the entire practice of wholesale demand response falls outside what ferc can regulate.epsa proudly embraces that point ferc,it declares,has no business regulating demand response at all.at.under epsa theory,ferc earlier order,although never challenged,would also be ultra vires because it requires operators to open their markets to demand response bids.and more ferc could not even approve an operator voluntary plan to administer a demand response program.see tr.of oral arg.that too would improperly allow a retail customer to participate in a wholesale market.
yet state commissions could not regulate demand response bids either.epsa essentially concedes this point.see brief for respondents that may well be true and so it must.the fpa leaves no room either for direct state regulation of the prices of interstate wholesales or for regulation that would indirectly achieve the same result.northern natural gas state corporation comm of.a state could not oversee offers,made in a wholesale market operator auction,that help to set wholesale prices.any effort of that kind would be preempted.
and all of that creates a problem.if neither ferc nor the states can regulate wholesale demand response,then by definition no one can.but under the act,no electricity transaction can proceed unless it is regulable by someone.as earlier described,congress passed the fpa precisely to eliminate vacuums of authority over the electricity markets.see supra,at.the act makes federal and state powers complementary and comprehensive,so that there will be no gaps for private interests to subvert the public welfare.louisiana power light,at.or said otherwise,the statute prevents the creation of any regulatory no man land.fpc transcontinental gas pipe line,see,at.some entity must have jurisdiction to regulate each and every practice that takes place in the electricity markets,demand response no less than any other 
for that reason,the upshot of epsa view would be to extinguish the wholesale demand response program in its entirety.under the fpa,each market operator must submit to ferc all its proposed rules and procedures.see c d cfr c,a.assume that,as epsa argues,ferc could not authorize any demand response program as part of that package.nor could ferc simply allow such plans to go into effect without its consideration and approval.there are no off the books programs in the wholesale electricity markets because,once again,there is no regulatory no man land.transcontinental,at.the fpa mandates that ferc review,and ensure the reasonableness of,every wholesale rule and practice.see a,a supra,at.if ferc could not carry out that duty for demand response,then those programs could not go forward.
and that outcome would flout the fpa core objects.the statute aims to protect against excessive prices and ensure effective transmission of electric power.pennsylvania water power fpc,see gulf states util.fpc.as shown above,ferc has amply explained how wholesale demand response helps to achieve those ends,by bringing down costs and preventing service interruptions in peak periods.see supra,at.no one taking part in the rulemaking process not even epsa seriously challenged that account.even as he objected to ferc compensation formula,commissioner moeller noted the unanimity of opinion as to demand response value n owhere did i review any comment or hear any testimony that questioned the benefit of having demand response resources participate in the organized wholesale energy markets.on this point,there is no debate.fed.reg.see also app,epsa,comments on proposed rule avowing full support for demand response participation in wholesale markets because of its economic and operational benefits congress itself agreed,encourag ing greater use of demand response participation at the wholesale level.epact f,stat.that undisputed judgment extinguishes any last flicker of life in epsa argument.we will not read the fpa,against its clear terms,to halt a practice that so evidently enables the commission to fulfill its statutory duties of holding down prices and enhancing reliability in the wholesale energy market.
these cases present a second,narrower question is ferc decision to compensate demand response providers at lmp the same price paid to generators arbitrary and capricious recall here the basic issue.see supra,at.wholesale market operators pay a single price lmp for all successful bids to supply electricity at a given time and place.the rule orders operators to pay the identical price for a successful bid to conserve electricity so long as that bid can satisfy a net benefits test meaning that it is sure to bring down costs for wholesale purchasers.in mandating that payment,ferc rejected an alternative proposal under which demand response providers would receive lmp minus g,where g is the retail rate for electricity.according to epsa and others favoring that approach,demand response providers get a windfall a kind of unless market operators subtract the savings associated with conserving electricity from the ordinary compensation level.fed.reg.epsa now claims that ferc failed to adequately justify its choice of lmp rather than.
in reviewing that decision,we may not substitute our own judgment for that of the commission.the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow.motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins.a court is not to ask whether a regulatory decision is the best one possible or even whether it is better than the alternatives.rather,the court must uphold a rule if the agency has examine d the relevant considerations and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action,including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.and nowhere is that more true than in a technical area like electricity rate design w e afford great deference to the commission in its rate decisions.morgan stanley,at.
here,the commission gave a detailed explanation of its choice of lmp.see fed.reg.relying on an eminent regulatory economist views,ferc chiefly reasoned that demand response bids should get the same compensation as generators bids because both provide the same value to a wholesale market.see,at,see also app,reply affidavit of alfred kahn,kahn affidavit.ferc noted that a market operator needs to constantly balance supply and demand,and that either kind of bid can perform that service,in a way that lowers costs for wholesale purchasers.see fed.reg.a compensation system,ferc concluded,therefore should place the two kinds of bids on a competitive par.at,quoting kahn affidavit see also app,kahn affidavit stating that economic efficiency requires compensating the two equally given their equivalent function in a competitive power market with both supply and demand response available on equal terms,the operator will select whichever bids,of whichever kind,provide the needed electricity at the lowest possible cost.see rehearing order,ferc,at,by ensuring that both receive the same compensation for the same service,we expect the final rule to enhance the competitiveness of wholesale markets and result in just and reasonable rates 
that rationale received added support from ferc adoption of the net benefits test.the commission realized during its rulemaking that in some circumstances a demand response bid despite reducing the wholesale rate does not provide the same value as generation.see fed.reg.as described earlier,that happens when the distinctive costs associated with compensating a demand response bid exceed the savings from a lower wholesale rate the purchaser then winds up paying more than if the operator had accepted the best even though higher priced supply bid available.see supra,at.and so ferc developed the net benefits test to filter out such cases.see fed.reg.with that standard in place,lmp is paid only to demand response bids that benefit wholesale purchasers in other words,to those that function as alternative s to the next generation.at.thus,under the commission approach,a demand response provider will receive the same compensation as a generator only when it is in fact providing the same service to the wholesale market.see.
the commission responded at length to epsa contrary view that paying lmp,even in that situation,will overcompensate demand response providers because they are also effectively receiv ing g,the retail rate that they do not need to pay.at.ferc explained that compensation ordinarily reflects only the value of the service an entity provides not the costs it incurs,or benefits it obtains,in the process.so when a generator presents a bid,the commission does not inquire into the costs or benefits of production.different power plants have different cost structures.and,indeed,some plants receive tax credits and similar incentive payments for their activities,while others do not.see rehearing order,ferc,at,and.but the commission had long since decided that such matters are irrelevant paying lmp to all generators although some then walk away with more profit and some with less encourages more efficient supply and demand decisions.fed.reg,internal quotation marks omitted.and the commission could see no economic reason to treat demand response providers any differently.like generators,they too experience a range of benefits and costs both the benefits of not paying for electricity and the costs of not using it at a certain time.but,ferc again concluded,that is immaterial to increase competition and optimally balance supply and demand,market operators should compensate demand response providers,like generators,based on their contribution to the wholesale system.see ferc,at.
moreover,ferc found,paying lmp will help demand response providers overcome certain barriers to participation in the wholesale market.see fed.reg.commenters had detailed significant expenses associated with demand response,including the cost of installing necessary metering technology and energy management systems.see,at,see also,app,viridity energy,comments on proposed rule on demand response compensation in organized wholesale energy markets may,noting the capital investments and operational changes needed for demand response participation.the commission agreed that such factors inhibit potential demand responders from competing with generators in the wholesale markets.see fed.reg.it concluded that rewarding demand response at lmp which is,in any event,the price reflecting its value to the market will encourage that competition and,in turn,bring down wholesale prices.see ibid.
finally,the commission noted that determining the g in the formula is easier proposed than accomplished.see.retail rates vary across and even within states,and change over time as well.accordingly,ferc concluded,requiring market operators to incorporate g into their prices,even though perhaps feasible,would create practical difficulties.ibid.better,then,not to impose that administrative burden.
all of that together is enough.the commission,not this or any other court,regulates electricity rates.the disputed question here involves both technical understanding and policy judgment.the commission addressed that issue seriously and carefully,providing reasons in support of its position and responding to the principal alternative advanced.in upholding that action,we do not discount the cogency of epsa arguments in favor of.nor do we say that in opting for lmp instead,ferc made the better call.it is not our job to render that judgment,on which reasonable minds can differ.our important but limited role is to ensure that the commission engaged in reasoned decisionmaking that it weighed competing views,selected a compensation formula with adequate support in the record,and intelligibly explained the reasons for making that choice.ferc satisfied that standard.
ferc statutory authority extends to the rule at issue here addressing wholesale demand response.the rule governs a practice directly affecting wholesale electricity rates.and although inevitably influencing the retail market too,the rule does not intrude on the states power to regulate retail sales.ferc set the terms of transactions occurring in the organized wholesale markets,so as to ensure the reasonableness of wholesale prices and the reliability of the interstate grid just as the fpa contemplates.and in choosing a compensation formula,the commission met its duty of reasoned judgment.ferc took full account of the alternative policies proposed,and adequately supported and explained its decision.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
justice alito took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.

i believe the federal power act fpa or act,et,prohibits the federal energy regulatory commission ferc from regulating the demand response of retail purchasers of power.i respectfully dissent from the court holding to the contrary.
i agree with the majority that ferc has the authority to regulate practices affecting wholesale rates.a,a mississippi power light mississippi ex rel.moore.i also agree that this affecting jurisdiction can not be limitless.and i suppose i could even live with the court direct effect test as a reasonable limit.ante,at.but as the majority recognizes,ante,at,that extratextual limit on the affecting jurisdiction merely supplements,not supplants,limits that are already contained in the statutory text and structure.i believe the court misconstrues the primary statutory limit.like the majority,i think that deference under chevron natural resources defense council,is unwarranted because the statute is clear.
the act grants ferc authority to regulate the generation and transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale.a.yet the majority frames the issue thusly t o uphold the r ule,we also must determine that it does not regulate retail electricity sales.ante,at.that formulation inverts the proper inquiry.the pertinent question under the act is whether the rule regulates sales at wholesale.if so,it falls within ferc regulatory authority.if not,the rule is unauthorized whether or not it happens to regulate retail electricity sales for,with exceptions not material here,the fpa prohibits ferc from regulating any other sale of electric energy that is not at wholesale.b emphasis added.the majority wisely ignores ferc specious argument that the rule does not regulate any sale,wholesale or retail.see brief for petitioner in.paying someone not to conclude a transaction that otherwise would without a doubt have been concluded is most assuredly a regulation of that transaction.gonzales raich,scalia,concurring in judgment.
properly framing the inquiry matters not because i think there exists some undefined category of electricity sales that is and,ante,at,but because a proper framing of the inquiry is important to establish the default presumption regarding the scope of ferc authority.while the majority would find every sale of electric energy to be within ferc authority to regulate unless the transaction is demonstrably a retail sale,the statute actually excludes from ferc jurisdiction all sales of electric energy except those that are demonstrably sales at wholesale.
so what,exactly,is a sale of electric energy at wholesale we need not guess,for the act provides a definition a sale of electric energy to any person for resale.d emphasis added.no matter how many times the majority incants and italicizes the word wholesale,ante,at,nothing can change the fact that the vast majority of and likely all participants a ggregators of multiple users of electricity,as well as individual users like factories or stores,ante,at do not resell electric energy they consume it themselves.ferc own definition of demand response is aimed at energy consumers,not resellers.cfr b.
it is therefore quite beside the point that the challenged r ule addresses and addresses only transactions occurring on the wholesale market,ante,at.for ferc regulatory authority over sales depends not on which market the transactions occu r on whatever that means,but rather on the identity of the putative purchaser.if the purchaser is one who resells electric energy to other customers,the transaction is one at wholesale and thus within ferc authority.if not,then not.or so,at least,says the statute.as we long ago said of the parallel provision in the natural gas act,t he line of the statute i s thus clear and complete.it cut s sharply and cleanly between sales for resale and direct sales for consumptive uses.no exceptions a re made in either category for particular uses,quantities,or otherwise.panhandle eastern pipe line public serv.comm of.the majority makes no textual response to this plain reading of the statute.
the bidders here indisputably do not resell energy to other customers.it follows that the rule does not regulate sales at wholesale,and b therefore forbids ferc to regulate these transactions.see new york ferc.that is so whether or not those transactions directly affect wholesale rates as we recently said in another context,we will not adopt a construction that needlessly produces a contradiction in the statutory text.shapiro mcmanus,slip,at.a faithful application of that principle would compel the conclusion that ferc may not do under a and a what it is forbidden to do under b.at slip,at.
the analysis could stop there.but the majority is wrong even on its own terms,for the rule at issue here does in fact regulate retail electricity sales,which are indisputably matters subject to regulation by the states and therefore to ferc.a see fpc conway,panhandle eastern pipe line,supra,at.the participants are retail customers they purchase electric energy solely for their own consumption.and ferc scheme is intentionally designed to induce lower consumption of electric energy in other words,to induce a reduction in retail electricity sales by offering incentive payments to those customers.cfr b.the incentive payments effectively increase the retail price of electric energy for participating customers because they must now account for the opportunity cost of using,as opposed to abstaining from using,more energy.in other words,it literally costs them more to buy energy on the retail market.in the court below,ferc conceded that offering credits to retail customers to reduce their electricity consumption would be an impermissible intrusion into the retail market because it would in effect regulate retail rates,cadc.incentive payments are identical in substance.
the majority resists this elementary economic conclusion notwithstanding its own exhortation to think back to econ,ante,at.why because its view dictates otherwise.ante,at.maybe the easiest way to see the majority error is to take its own example an airline passenger who rejects a voucher for taking a later flight.consider the following formulation of that example,in substance from the majority formulation.because the hypothetical passenger has exactly the same options and outcomes available to him.suppose the airline said to the passenger we have proactively canceled your ticket and refunded to your account and because we have inconvenienced you,we have also deposited an extra.the money is yours to use as you like.but if you insist on repurchasing a ticket on the same flight,you must not only pay us,but return the too.now what is the effective price of the ticket sometimes an allegedly commonsensical intuition is just that an intuition,often mistaken.
moving closer to home,recall that participants must choose either to purchase a unit of energy at the prevailing retail price say or to withhold from purchasing that unit and receive instead an incentive payment of say.the two options thus present a choice between having a unit of energy,on the one hand,and having more in the bank,on the other.to repeat take the energy,be poorer forgo the energy,be richer.is that not the very definition of price see black law dictionary ed.t he amount of money or other consideration asked for or given in exchange for something else in fact,is that not the majority definition of price ante,at the amount of money a consumer will hand over in exchange for power 
in any event,the majority appears to recognize that the effective price is indeed just as the effective price of the airline ticket in the hypothetical is.ante,at.that recognition gives away the game.for ferc is prohibited not just from directly setting or modifying retail prices it is prohibited from regulating retail sales,no matter the means.panhandle eastern pipe line,supra,at.whether ferc sets the real retail price to use the majority idiosyncratic terminology,ante,at,or the effective retail price is immaterial either way,the rule by design induces participants to forgo retail purchases they otherwise would have made.as noted,even ferc conceded that offering credits to retail customers would impermissibly regulate retail sales.the majority blithely overlooks this concession in favor of its own view of retail pricing all the while evading the fact that fiddling with the effective retail price of electric energy,be it through incentive payments or hypothetical credits,regulates retail sales of electric energy no less than does direct ratesetting.
the majority cites dicta in several of our opinions expressing the assumption that state jurisdiction and federal jurisdiction under ferc cover the field,so that there is no regulatory gap one entity or the other must have jurisdiction to regulate each and every practice that takes place in the electricity markets.ante,at.the cases that express such a principle,with respect to the federal power act and its predecessor the natural gas act,base it no surprise on legislative history.see,fpc louisiana power light,fpc transcontinental gas pipe line,panhandle eastern pipe line,at,and.one would expect the congressional proponents of legislation to assert that it is comprehensive and leaves no stone unturned.but even if one is a fan of legislative history,surely one can not rely upon such generalities in determining what a statute actually does.whether it is comprehensive and leaves not even the most minor regulatory gap surely depends on what it says and not on what its proponents hoped to achieve.i can not imagine a more irrational interpretive principle than the following,upon which the majority evidently relies 
w hen a dispute arises over whether a given transaction is within the scope of federal or state regulatory authority,we are not inclined to approach the problem negatively,thus raising the possibility that a no man land will be created.that is to say,in a borderline case where congressional authority is not explicit we must ask whether state authority can practicably regulate a given area and,if we find that it can not,then we are impelled to decide that federal authority governs.transcontinental gas pipe line,supra,at citation omitted.
that extravagant and method of establishing regulatory jurisdiction was not necessary to the judgments that invoked it,and should disappear in the court memory hole.
suppose ferc decides that eliminating the middleman would benefit the public,and therefore promulgates a rule allowing generators to sell directly to retail consumers across state lines and fixing generation,transmission,and retail rates for such sales.i think it obvious this hypothetical scheme would be forbidden to ferc.yet just as surely the states could not enact it either,for only ferc has authority to regulate the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.b see also new york,at.is this a regulatory gap has the sales scheme fallen into a regulatory no man land must ferc therefore be allowed to implement this scheme on its own applying the majority logic would yield nothing but yesses.yet the majority acknowledges that neither ferc nor the states have regulatory jurisdiction over this scheme.ante,at.such sales transactions,involving a mix of retail and wholesale players as the scheme does can be regulated if at all only by joint action.i would not call that a problem,ante,at i would call it an inevitable consequence of the division created by the fpa.
the majority is evidently distraught that affirming the decision below would extinguish the wholesale demand response program in its entirety.ante,at.alarmist hyperbole.excluding ferc jurisdiction would at most eliminate this particular flavor of demand response.nothing prevents ferc from tweaking its scheme by requiring incentive payments to be offered to wholesale customers,rather than retail ones.brief for respondent electric power supply epsa et brief for respondents midwest entities.and programs,run by the states,do and would continue to exist.see brief for respondent epsa et brief for respondents midwest entities.in fact congress seemed to presuppose that states,not ferc,would run such programs the relevant provisions of the energy policy act of,stat.et,are intended to encourage states to coordinate,on a regional basis,state energy policies to provide reliable and affordable demand response services.e,at,codified at note emphasis added.that statute also imposes several duties on the secretary of energy to assist states in implementing programs.e,e,stat.in context,f of the act is therefore best read as directing the secretary to eliminate unnecessary barriers to states adopting and implementing systems and not,as the majority contends,as praising wholesale demand response systems to be deployed and regulated by ferc,ante,at emphasis added.
moreover,the rule itself allows states to forbid their retail customers to participate in the existing scheme.cfr g i a see brief for petitioner in,at.the majority accepts ferc argument that this is merely a matter of grace,and claims that it puts the finishing blow to respondents argument that b prohibits the scheme.ante,at.quite the contrary.remember that the majority believes ferc authority derives from a and a,the grants of affecting jurisdiction.yet those provisions impose a duty on ferc to ensure that all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to wholesale rates or charges shall be just and reasonable.a emphasis added see a similar conway,at.if inducing retail customers to participate in wholesale transactions is necessary to render wholesale rates just and reasonable,how can ferc,consistent with its statutory mandate,permit states to thwart such participation see brief for united states as amicus curiae,in hughes talen energy marketing,llc,now pending before the court making an argument similar to ours new england power new hampshire.although not legally relevant,the fact that ferc ordinarily so jealous of its regulatory authority,see brief for united states as amicus curiae in is willing to let states opt out of its scheme serves to highlight just how far the rule intrudes
