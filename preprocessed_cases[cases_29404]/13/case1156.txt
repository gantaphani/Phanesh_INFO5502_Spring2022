background 
plaintiff evidence at trial was as follows 
shooting of malik jones 
on april,shortly after in east haven,connecticut,malik jones was driving an oldsmobile cutlass with samuel cruz,also an african american male,in the passenger seat.jones was followed by officer flodquist,in a police department vehicle,who reported to his dispatcher that he was trying to catch up with the oldsmobile.jones then made a and began heading in the direction of neighboring new haven.flodquist informed the dispatcher that the driver of the oldsmobile was taking off on him.officer depalma of the ehpd joined the pursuit in another vehicle.the officers followed the oldsmobile on to,and off of,interstate,and into new haven.
after entering new haven,jones lost control of the oldsmobile and veered into a vacant lot off grand avenue,made a,and then exited the lot back onto grand avenue.the oldsmobile came to a stop in the westbound lane of grand avenue when its path was blocked by flodquist and depalma police vehicles.flodquist approached the driver side of the vehicle with his weapon drawn and used the butt of his gun to break the driver window.
the witnesses testimony differed on exactly what happened between the time the oldsmobile stopped on grand avenue and the shooting.they agreed on several facts but disagreed as to the sequence.the witnesses agreed that after jones came to a stop,when his way was barred by the police vehicles,jones shifted into reverse.the oldsmobile moved backwards,in a circular path.at some point flodquist was in danger of being hit by the front end of the retreating oldsmobile,as it swerved out to the side.forensic evidence demonstrated that flodquist fired four shots after the oldsmobile had started moving in reverse.jones was pronounced dead at the scene.it was undisputed that neither jones nor cruz was armed.it is also undisputed that flodquist gun could hold twelve bullets,and after the shooting only seven bullets remained in the weapon.the witnesses did not agree on whether flodquist fired four or five shots or exactly when he fired the first shot.
flodquist testified that he was in the path of the moving car and would have been struck by it if he had not moved.he testified that he believed the driver of the car was trying to run him over,which is why he began shooting.he testified that he fired only four shots,all of which were fired after the oldsmobile started moving on its backwards circular path 
plaintiff contended that flodquist fired five shots,and that he fired the first shot immediately after breaking the driver side window of the oldsmobile,before the oldsmobile began moving in reverse,and before any issue arose of flodquist ability to get out of the retreating car path.the passenger cruz testified,with support from other witnesses,that the car began moving in reverse only after jones had been shot.
a witness testified that after the shooting,depalma and another ehpd officer,ranfone,left jones face down on the ground with his feet inside the car and his hands cuffed behind his back.another witness testified that ranfone approached a hispanic man who had witnessed the shooting and told him you did see nothing.now get out of here.
evidence relating to liability of the town 
to establish liability of the town,plaintiff contended that the town had a custom,policy,or usage of deliberate indifference to the rights of black people.the evidence on that question was as follows.

evidence was received relating to officer flodquist apprehension of shane gray,an african american male,on september.that evening an east haven resident was robbed at gunpoint on eastern circle in new haven.the new haven police department sent out a bulletin to surrounding departments that three unknown black males in their twenties were wanted for robbery with a firearm.the bulletin also stated the perpetrators had fled the scene in a light blue oldsmobile sierra and provided the vehicle license plate number.
gray testified that he exited his residence in new haven that evening and saw two of his neighbors taking joyrides in a car on eastern circle.they allowed gray to take the car for a ride.as gray approached an intersection in the car which matched the description given in the police bulletin,he saw two ehpd cruisers in front of him blocking the road.gray panicked and jumped out of the car while it was still moving and ran into a nearby field.flodquist pursued gray across the field in his police cruiser.gray testified that,as he ran across the field,flodquist cruiser caught up to him and hit him.once he was hit,gray rolled up onto the hood of the cruiser.the cruiser then slid into a ditch.gray rolled off the hood of the cruiser,jumped up,and ran out of the ditch.gray looked back and saw that flodquist had remained in the vehicle.gray testified that flodquist then shot at him,without saying freeze or providing any other kind of warning.gray ran to a nearby building,knocked on the door,and laid down on the porch.officers arrived at the porch,placed gray in handcuffs,and placed him in an ehpd cruiser.gray was charged with larceny,carrying a pistol without a permit,interfering with police,and reckless endangerment and was released on bond.
an internal investigation was conducted into whether flodquist discharge of his weapon was justified.the investigation was conducted by criscuolo.flodquist testified that,after the investigation,it was determined that his actions were justified.gray testified that he was never contacted by the ehpd about the incident.a report of the investigation was destroyed by the ehpd keeper of records in accordance with state regulations.
donald jackman 
donald jackman,a caucasian male,testified about the events surrounding his arrest by ehpd officers in the early morning hours of january.that morning four members of the ehpd sergeant daniel gilhully,and officers robert nappe,joseph peterson,and ed vecellio arrived at jackman home after jackman had made a series of phone calls to the ehpd in which he used profanity and called police officers offensive names.when the officers entered jackman home,there was a struggle.while the officers were attempting to handcuff jackman,they discovered he had a gun.jackman testified that during the struggle he bit one of the officers on the hand,causing serious injury.jackman testified that he was then beaten severely about the face and head by the officers,and had several teeth knocked out.at the end of the struggle,when jackman was facedown on his bed,according to his testimony,one of the officers pointed his gun at jackman head and said you lucky you not a nigger because you be fucking dead and in three days,you will be in jail in new haven being butt fucked by the niggers.
plaintiff also relied in part on testimony about worn by members of the ehpd.chief criscuolo testified that,around the time of the jones shooting,it came to his attention that members of the ehpd had been wearing which depicted two white police officers holding two white suspects on the hood of a police car,with the phrase boyz on the hood.the officers wore these shirts while they were playing softball.criscuolo testified that he thought the shirts were in bad taste and offensive to people of color.he learned about the from someone he encountered while walking on the street,but he could not remember who it was or whether that individual worked for the department.criscuolo said he told the person he was not happy that officers were wearing these and wanted it to stop,but did nothing further about the at the time.he assumed the practice had stopped because he heard nothing further about it.criscuolo stated that,in his opinion,he had sufficiently addressed the situation by telling the individual he encountered on the street that he wanted the officers to stop wearing the.
in late april or early may,an article appeared in a newspaper about the.on may,criscuolo circulated a memo to the ehpd,stating 
it was recently brought to my attention that a t shirt that appeared to be representing sponsorship by this department was being worn by a baseball team comprised of some east haven police officers.

independent investigation of the jones shooting 
the shooting of jones was investigated by the state of connecticut.no evidence was received at trial as to the conclusions of the investigation.there was no evidence that any agency ever found flodquist to be at fault in the incident or that any charges were brought against him relating to the incident.
the jury found that flodquist had used excessive force against malik jones,but found in flodquist favor on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity.a state officer who is sued under section for violation of federal law is entitled to qualified immunity from suit if there was no clear law at the time giving him notice that the challenged conduct was in violation of federal law.see,pearson callahan,d.the jury also found in favor of flodquist on the connecticut state law claims of battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.as for defendant depalma,the jury found he had not violated jones constitutional rights by failing to intervene to protect jones from flodquist use of excessive force.

the district court entered judgment for plaintiff and this appeal followed.the town contends the evidence was legally insufficient to show that the town had a custom,policy,or usage of deliberate indifference to abuse of the rights of persons of color

insufficiency of the evidence presented at trial 
given the standards summarized above,we conclude that the evidence plaintiff presented at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support a reasonable finding that plaintiff loss was attributable to a custom,policy,or usage of the town of east haven.
there are a number of different ways in which,given sufficient evidence,plaintiff might have satisfied the burden of showing municipal liability under the standards of monell.one would be to show a sufficiently widespread practice among police officers of abuse of the rights of black people to support reasonably the conclusion that such abuse was the custom of the officers of the department and that supervisory personnel must have been aware of it but took no adequate corrective or preventive measures or some combination of the two.another might be that officers of the department expressed among themselves an inclination to abuse the rights of black people with sufficient frequency or in such manner that the attitude would have been known to supervisory personnel,which then took no adequate corrective or preventive steps.a third might be a showing of deliberate indifference on the part of supervisory personnel to abuse of the rights of black people,which was communicated to line officers so as to give them the sense that they could engage in such abuse of rights without risking appropriate disciplinary consequences.the trial evidence was not sufficient to support a finding against the town on any such theory.furthermore,the district court itself found,in ruling on the town motion for judgment as a matter of law,that plaintiff failed to establish a custom,policy,or usage on the part of the town of not disciplining ehpd officers for violating the constitutional rights of black people,or that the town created a hostile environment for black people through a practice of harassing,stopping,and interfering with them,and plaintiff has not suggested on appeal that those rulings were erroneous.
the evidence,construed as it must be in the manner most favorable to the plaintiff,unquestionably showed instances of reprehensible and at times illegal and unconstitutional conduct by individual officers of the ehpd.but such a showing is not a sufficient basis for imposing liability on the municipality.to justify imposition of liability on the municipality,the plaintiff needed to show that her loss was attributable to a custom,policy,or usage of the town or its supervisory officials.the trial evidence failed to make such a showing.the evidence failed to show a pattern of abusive conduct or expressions of inclination toward such abusive conduct among officers,so widespread as to support an inference that it must have been known and tolerated by superiors.it failed to show sufficient instances of tolerant awareness by supervisors of abusive conduct to support an inference that they had a policy,custom or usage of acquiescence in s
