we consider in this opinion whether eleventh amendment sovereign immunity bars suits against the unified court system of the state of new york,and whether the imposition on plaintiff counsel of attorneys fees as a form of sanctions pursuant to was an abuse of discretion.
background 
plaintiff bernard gollomp appeals from a january,judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,judge,dismissing his second amended complaint and imposing sanctions on his attorneys pursuant to.are the state of new york,the new york state unified court system,new york state judiciary,several state and local officials including elliot spitzer,the former attorney general,and bruce muldoon,a law secretary to a deceased justice of the new york state supreme court,the town of orangetown,and several private citizens who are plaintiff neighbors.
state court proceedings 
the controversy underlying this litigation began in,when plaintiff sued his neighbors,defendants eric and michelle dubbs,over alleged damage to plaintiff property caused by water runoff from the dubbs property.on january,justice robert meehan of the new york state supreme court,rockland county,granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.see gollomp dubbs,slip op.at,gollomp i,reprinted in joint appendix.in may,the appellate division affirmed,concluding that plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether artificial means were used to divert surface water from the dubbs property onto his property,or whether the improvements to their property were made in good faith.gollomp dubbs,dep t gollomp ii.the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal on september.see gollomp dubbs,gollomp iii.
in september,plaintiff filed a claim against various state entities in the new york court of claims alleging c ontinuing and ongoing violations of laws,rules and regulations,including but not limited to environmental conservation law the freshwater wetlands act,highway law,public officers law,navigation law and transportation law.appellees special appendix appellees claim.plaintiff was represented in the court of claims by james morgan,who also represented plaintiff in this action before the district court.in may,the court of claims granted defendants motion to dismiss principally because plaintiff had not served a copy of his claim on the attorney general within days of the date of accrual,see.cl.act requiring that a claim be filed and served upon the attorney general within ninety days after the accrual of such claim,which plaintiff alleged was november.gollomp state of new york,claim,slip op.may,gollomp iv,reprinted in appellees.the court of claims added the following observation 
additionally,the claimant does not state a cause of action against the state of new york by merely alleging that there were acts or omissions of the defendants relative to a laundry list of state and federal statutes,at some unspecified time and place,nor does the pleading comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements for a pleading justiciable in the court of claims.
indeed,from a fair reading of the four corners of the claim and the vague language contained therein,the court can not tell the nature of the claim,and by what conduct the state is alleged to have caused this claimant any injury.
gollomp iv,appellees.
letter to chief judge kaye 
on march,while plaintiff claim was pending before the new york court of claims,plaintiff wrote to chief judge judith kaye of the new york court of appeals,alleging that justice meehan was medically incapacitated at the time he granted summary judgment against plaintiff,and that justice meehan signature on the january,order was forged.letter of bernard gollomp,at.plaintiff attached exhibits to his letter and sent a copy to james morgan of galvin morgan.on march,chief judge kaye responded through her counsel that the chief judge may exercise her judicial authority only in cases that are properly before the court of appeals,and that plaintiff h ad no case pending before that court.letter of mary mone,counsel to the chief judge.plaintiff replied in a letter dated april,that chief judge kaye response was perplexing,and urged the chief judge to expeditiously handle this violation of his civil rights.letter of bernard gollomp.plaintiff counsel,james morgan,was copied on his reply.
initial federal complaint 
plaintiff commenced a lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of new york in june month after the new york court of claims denied his claim.in his initial was pages long and contained numbered paragraphs and causes of action,plaintiff alleged violations of his rights under the first,fourth,fifth,sixth,and fourteenth all of the,including the new york state department of environmental conservation,the new york state department of health,the county of rockland,rockland county drainage,the board of rockland county soil and water conservation district,the rockland county clerk,and the town attorney for the town of orangetown.all of plaintiff causes of action were brought under the civil rights act of,and.his theory of the case was that justice meehan,who had since passed away,was not mentally competent to render a decision that justice meehan signature on the january,order was forged and that the the new york unified court to the forgery and deprived plaintiff of his civil rights.so far as we can tell,plaintiff decision to name the unified court system in his complaint was a consequence of his correspondence with chief judge kaye.
appearing below are two examples of the specific claims made in plaintiff initial complaint,taken from his third and thirteenth causes of action 
as and for a third cause of action 
pursuant to new york state constitution article vii,local governments enact,through their police power establish land use regulations through local zoning codes which are municipal specific.
as set forth herein,defendants,exercise zoning power through its land use regulation.
by allowing the forged meehan decision and order to stand,defendants effectively engaged in the unconstitutional delegation of authority by allowing the judicial arm of state government to assume what constitutes legislative power in the form of adopted laws,rules and regulations and in the process contravening applicable home rule requirements.
as a result of those constitutional violations by defendants,gollomp suffered and continues to suffer damage.
plaintiff suffered monetary damage in an amount in excess of two million five hundred thousand and dollars as a result of defendants actions.
compl.verbatim.
as and for a thirteenth cause of action 
defendants have deprived gollomp of the property rights guaranteed to him under and by virtue of the united states constitution.
defendants,acting under the color of state law,have followed a pattern of conduct designed to intimidate and retaliate against the gollomp for his attempt to exercise his civil rights.
defendants individually and collectively acted in such a manner as to create a hostile environment,including a hostile home environment in which gollomp and his family reside.
defendants engaged in and continue to engage in conduct designed to and intended to intimidate and harass gollomp.
defendants acted singly and in concert conspired and continue to and are conspire to restrict gollomp use of his home and property.
defendants actions complained of herein had caused gollomp and his family to incur expenses and to suffer physically from anger,frustration,suspicion and concern.
compl.verbatim.in addition to these and similar allegations contained in the causes of action,plaintiff also alleged that various government agencies and officials not named as the federal bureau of investigation,senator charles schumer,senator hillary rodham clinton,and the rockland county district not properly investigated his claims of judicial corruption and conspiracy.
first amended complaint 
in august,the state defendants new york state,the unified court system,the other named state agencies,and state officials in their official plaintiff counsel a draft memorandum of law in support of a motion for sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure the state defendants argued in their memorandum that plaintiff had,among other transgressions,asserted frivolous claims that were barred by the eleventh amendment and had filed prolix pleadings.some negotiations between plaintiff and the state defendants ensued and in september,and plaintiff filed a first amended complaint that contained only causes of action and dropped several defendants from the caption.as the district court observed,the allegations in the first amended complaint were substantially similar to the allegations in the second amended complaint,which is discussed in detail below.
the november,teleconference 
unconvinced that plaintiff alterations had cured the sanctionable defects in his initial complaint,the state defendants filed a rule motion on november.on november,magistrate judge randolph treece held a teleconference to discuss the motion.during the course of that proceeding,plaintiff counsel acknowledged that he understood the eleventh amendment objections raised by the state defendants in addition,magistrate judge treece inquired why the state defendants had filed a motion for sanctions instead of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the following exchange occurred 
the court w hy are you doing this by a b motion as opposed to a rule motion 
costello counsel for state defendants well,we are doing a rule motion because we believe that the plaintiff attorneys have persistently made these types of allegations against the state defendant,has been sanctioned in the past,and persist in making these allegations,and sanctions are warranted.
morgan counsel for plaintiff we were not sanctioned in the past,but that beside the point.
costello well,that not the information we have and there are cases that we can cite and have cited in our motion where you have been sanctioned 
morgan that has no e ffect on this case.
tr.of proceedings.later in the conference,plaintiff counsel added,we faced rule motions before we have always defeated these motions.tr.of proceedings.
in fact,just seven months earlier,plaintiff counsel had been sanctioned by the new york state appellate division,third department,for asserting false material factual statements.see korbel zoning bd.of appeals of town of horicon,dep t concluding that plaintiff and his counsel have engaged in conduct that is completely without merit and impos ing a sanction of against plaintiff personally and against his counsel,james morgan internal quotation marks omitted.seven years earlier,judge mcavoy of the united states district court for the northern district of new york sanctioned plaintiff counsel pursuant to rule for asserting frivolous claims against state government entities that were barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.see gaboury town of roxbury,wl,dist.lexis,at,imposing sanctions pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure upon finding that the firm of galvin morgan should have been aware of the fundamental subject matter jurisdiction issues imposed by the eleventh amendment the claims pursuant to lack ed factual support for their claims against the state defendants and claims raised under,like the claims under,were frivolous and egregious.
in addition,at the time of the november teleconference,plaintiff counsel was subject to an order to show cause why he should not be sanctioned pursuant to rule in another case before the district court.see kosich state dep t of health,slip op.at.that case also involved claims against state defendants that were barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.id.at.nevertheless,when questioned by magistrate judge treece,who had been alerted to the pending rule motion by defense counsel,plaintiff counsel refused to explain the circumstances of the pending motion 
the court and let me just ask one other question you have mentioned that judge scullin sua sponte has raised a rule violation.h as there been a ruling on that rule,and is that rule applicable to this case 
morgan the answer is,your honor.it pending decision.we responded pursuant to his direction.it tangentially related,but not directly on point.
the court okay,so what does that mean 
morgan not related to this case.
tr.of proceedings.in fact,kosich was directly on point.as the district court explained in that case,
t he court finds it troubling that morgan and galvin,despite having practiced in this district for more than years,continue to assert claims on behalf of their clients against the state of new york its departments and agencies despite this court repeated admonitions and the principles of eleventh amendment immunity accordingly,the court hereby directs morgan and galvin to show cause why they have not violated rule b and why,if this court finds that such a violation has occurred,it should not impose sanctions against them for violating rule b.
kosich,slip op.at.
at the close of the november conference,magistrate judge treece set a schedule for filing a second amended complaint,briefing on an amended on rule motion,and a motion to dismiss.
second amended complaint 
plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on november,alleging ten causes of from causes of action in the original complaint and in the first amended that spitzer violated his affirmative obligation to prevent wrongs conspired to be done according to several federal statutes that the unified court through chief judge not properly investigate plaintiffs allegations of a forged signature that all the state defendants individually and in concert engaged in conduct which violated plaintiff s constitutionally protected rights that all defendants violated plaintiff first amendment right to petition the courts and defamed him in the process and that the dubbs should have known that signatures on the state court orders had been forged.
the district court decisions 
on the same day that plaintiff filed his second amended complaint,the state defendants filed a motion to dismiss seeking,for the first time,sanctions in the form of attorney fees under 
the district court held oral argument on all the pending motions on january.in an oral decision from the bench at the close of oral argument,the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety and granted the state defendants request for sanctions pursuant to.the district court expanded its reasons for decision in a written memorandum decision and order dated february,see gollomp spitzer,wl,dist.lexis,gollomp v.
regarding the remaining state defendants spitzer and muldoon,in their official capacities,the state of new york,and the unified court district court concluded that plaintiff civil rights claims were barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.see id.at,dist.lexis at citing mcginty new york,cir the court dismissed the claims against spitzer and muldoon in their individual capacities because plaintiff had not specified how either defendant was personally involved in the alleged violation of his constitutional rights.gollomp v,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing.b.in the same vein,the court dismissed claims under and because p laintiff complaint is devoid of any specific factual allegations that would support his conclusory assertions that defendants spitzer and muldoon conspired against him because of his age,gollomp v,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see also id.at,dist.lexis at.the court also concluded that muldoon was entitled to absolute judicial immunity for his role as a law secretary.id.at,dist.lexis at quoting oliva heller,cir extending absolute judicial immunity to a law clerk to a federal judge.the district court also dismissed all claims against the town of orangetown,the town supervisor,and the dubbs for failure to state a claim under rule b.gollomp v,wl at,dist.lexis,at.
finally,the district court ordered plaintiff counsel to pay the state attorneys fees pursuant to.id.at,dist.lexis at.after acknowledging that requires a finding of bad faith,id.at,dist.lexis at,the district court made three findings in support of imposing statutory sanctions.first,the court deemed incredible the assertion by plaintiff counsel that they had researched all legal arguments and made no legal argument that lacked merit.id.at,dist.lexis at.the district court noted that several courts had already instructed them that similar claims against new york state were barred by the eleventh amendment.id.citing salvador lake george park comm n,wl,dist.lexis,at,gaboury,wl at,dist.lexis,at second,the district court found it unfathomable that plaintiff counsel would misrepresent his disciplinary record to magistrate judge treece.gollomp v,wl at,dist.lexis,at.third,the district court concluded that plaintiff counsel persisted in alleging legally unfounded claims despite ample opportunity in this case to withdraw the m.id.at,dist.lexis at.the court then ordered supplemental briefing on the amount of sanctions.
the state of new york filed a bill of costs with a proposed order imposing sanctions on february.although plaintiff was required to respond by february,he waited until february to address the imposition of sanctions in a motion for reconsideration pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure in the motion for reconsideration,plaintiff offered several reasons why his claims were not frivolous,including the following analysis 
the attorney general argued that this case is totally frivolous,having no merit,and that this is clear from the face of the pleadings before this court.
were that the case,then there would have been no need for the extensive legal research and drafting and work recorded by the attorney general as done on this case and in preparing defendant motions made before this court.
pl.aff.in supp.of mot.to reargue.
plaintiff filed his notice of appeal on february,the district court quantified the amount of sanctions on plaintiff counsel,ruled on plaintiff motion for reconsideration,or entered judgment.by the time we held oral argument in this appeal on january,the district court had not determined the amount of sanctions,ruled on plaintiff motion for reconsideration,or entered judgment.on january,the district court entered a memorandum decision and order denying plaintiff motion for reconsideration and ordering attorney fees in the amount of and costs in the amount of pursuant to.the clerk of the district court entered judgment for defendants on the same day.on january,we ordered supplemental briefing from the parties regarding the district court january memorandum decision and order and further directed that the notice of appeal shall be effective as of january.see fed.a b i if a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a before it disposes of any motion for relief under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order,in whole or in part,when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.united states owen,cir holding in abeyance an appeal in a criminal case pursuant to rule b b of the federal rules of appellate procedure because the notice of appeal had not become effective while a motion for a new trial was still pending before the district court.
before us now is the entire judgment of the district court.we therefore consider not only the february,order dismissing plaintiff claims and imposing sanctions,but also the january,order quantifying sanctions and dismissing plaintiff motion for reconsideration.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant or denial of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,including decisions based on eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.see,woods rondout valley cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir.
upon review of the record before us,we agree with the district court disposition of plaintiff civil rights claims substantially for the reasons stated in its february,order.the claims against the state and muldoon,in their official capacities,the state of new york,and the unified court barred by the eleventh amendment.see gollomp v,wl at,dist.lexis,at.plaintiff has failed to state a claim against spitzer and muldoon in their individual capacities,the town of orangetown,the town supervisor,and the dubbs pursuant to,and.see id.at,dist.lexis at.in addition,muldoon is entitled to absolute immunity as a law clerk to a state court judge because he was acting in a judicial capacity.see id.at,dist.lexis at see also oliva,at holding that a law clerk who was clearly assisting a judge in carrying out judicial functions was covered by the doctrine of absolute immunity sheppard beerman,cir commenting,in the context of state court employment,that in their role as employees,law clerks amount to extensions of the judges at whose pleasure they serve quoting oliva,at.
we take this opportunity to address two aspects of the district court decisions in greater detail the application of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity to plaintiff claims against the unified court system of the state of new york,and the district court imposition of sanctions pursuant to.
eleventh amendment sovereign immunity 
the eleventh amendment states the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi see also woods,at explaining that a lthough the amendment,by its terms,bars only federal suits against state governments by citizens of another state or foreign country,it has been interpreted also to bar federal suits against state governments by a state own citizens as well as state court actions against state governments citation omitted.stated as simply as possible,the eleventh amendment means that,as a general rule,state governments may not be sued in federal court unless they have waived their eleventh amendment immunity,or unless congress has abrogate d the states eleventh amendment immunity when acting pursuant to its authority under section of the fourteenth amendment.woods,at.in the instant case,there is no suggestion of congressional abrogation or state acquiescence,and so our inquiry is limited to the question of whether the new york state unified court system is,constructively,one of the united states,const.amend.xi.
as we have previously explained,t he immunity recognized by the eleventh amendment extends beyond the states themselves to state agents and state instrumentalities that are,effectively,arms of a state.woods,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a governmental entity is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity only if it is more like an arm of the state,such as a state agency,than like a municipal corporation or other political subdivision.id.internal quotation marks omitted.courts frequently consider many factors to determine whether an entity is an arm of the state.see,gorton gettel,cir considering how the entity is referred to in its documents of origin how the governing members of the entity are appointed how the entity is funded whether the entity function is traditionally one of local or state government whether the state has a veto power over the entity actions and whether the entity financial obligations are binding upon the state quoting mcginty,at internal quotation marks omitted.however,the ultimate inquiry involves an overall assessment of the relationship between the state and the entity in question.regents of the of cal.doe,d.a cardinal component of this relationship is the question whether a money judgment against a state instrumentality or official would be enforceable against the state.id.at.see also gorton,at inquiring,after an assessment of other factors,whether a suit against the entity in federal court would threaten the integrity of the state and expose its treasury to risk,and stating that i f the answer is in doubt,a concern for the state fisc will control internal quotation marks omitted woods,at observing that a claim of eleventh amendment immunity will occasion serious dispute only where a relatively complex institutional arrangement makes it unclear whether a given entity ought to be treated as an arm of the state internal quotation marks omitted.
so far as we can observe,every court to consider the question of whether the new york state unified court system is an arm of the state has concluded that it is,and is therefore protected by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.our court has previously reached this conclusion in two unpublished decisions.see davis new york,cir summary order specifically,we affirm the district court holding that the eleventh amendment bars plaintiff claims against the state of new york,the new york state unified court system,and individual defendants in their official capacities.kampfer county of fulton,wl.lexis,at cir,summary order the county court of the state of new york is an integral part of the state unified court system,see const.art.vi,and as such is an arm of the state of new york.other courts in this circuit have routinely concluded that the eleventh amendment shields the unified court system from civil liability.see,pennefather state unified court,civ,wl,dist.lexis,at june,it is apparent that defendant,the new york state unified court system,is entitled to immunity from suit under the eleventh amendment gollomp v,wl,dist.lexis,at defendant unified court system is an arm of the state for purposes of the eleventh amendment.darcy lippman,cv,wl,dist.lexis,at,t he court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff ada and adea claims against new york and the unified court system which is an arm of the state of new york.bland new york,d,the eleventh amendment renders the unified court system office of court administration and the state immune from suit here under or under state law because the state of new york has not consented to suit in federal court,and because no express override of state statutory authority has been enacted by congress in association with.
nevertheless,plaintiff contends that the district court improperly concluded that the eleventh amendment barred all plaintiff claims against the new york state unified court system.appellant br.other than another blanket assertion that the scope of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity is not cast in stone and is subject to revisiting and reconsider ation at all levels of review,appellant br,plaintiff has not provided any basis for maintaining his position indeed,the prior decisions of courts in this circuit indicate that,as often as the question has been revisited,the answer has been the same the new york state unified court system is immune from suit.
the unified court system is specifically authorized by the constitution of the state of new york.see const.art.vi,a there shall be a unified court system for the state.see also gorton,at considering,among other factors,how the entity is referred to in its documents of origin internal quotation marks omitted.its function is traditionally one of state government,gorton,at internal quotation marks omitted,and it is funded principally through state funds,see const.art.vi,a the legislature shall provide for the allocation of the cost of operating and maintaining the court of appeals,the appellate division of the supreme court in each judicial department,the supreme court,the court of claims,the county court,the surrogate court,the family court,the courts for the city of new york established pursuant to section fifteen of this article and the district court,among the state,the counties,the city of new york and other political subdivisions.accordingly,a lawsuit against the unified court system is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state,so that the state is the real,substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit.regents of the of,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also gorton,at considering,among other factors,how the entity is funded and stating that a concern for the state fisc will control internal quotation marks omitted.for these reasons,we hold that the new york state unified court system is unquestionably an arm of the state,woods,at,and is entitled to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.
we review all aspects of a district court decision to impose under or the court inherent abuse of discretion.revson cinque cinque,cir sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.
as the district court observed,authorizes sanctions when the attorney actions are so completely without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose,and upon a finding of conduct constituting or akin to bad faith.equities,sapir in re equities,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in addition to the substantive requirement of bad faith,we have imposed a procedural requirement of notice and an opportunity to be heard.see id.at requiring notification of the source of authority for the sanctions being considered and the specific conduct or omission for which the sanctions are being considered,but stating that,depending on the circumstances,a full evidentiary hearing is not required,and the opportunity to respond by brief or oral argument may suffice internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiff counsel do not argue that the sanctions imposed on them were procedurally flawed.instead,they assert that they lacked bad faith,their claims were not frivolous,defendants improperly threatened sanctions as a litigation tactic,letter of james morgan,galvin morgan,counsel for plaintiff,at,and sanctions will have a chilling effect on unpopular claims that have a legitimate legal basis.we address each of these arguments below.
as discussed above,the district court made three findings of conduct constituting or akin to bad faith,in re equities,at the incredible assertion by plaintiff counsel that they had researched all legal arguments and made no legal argument that lacked merit,despite prior warnings not to bring claims against new york state that were barred by the eleventh amendment,gollomp v,wl,at,dist.lexis,at the unfathomable misrepresentation by plaintiff counsel to magistrate judge treece regarding counsel disciplinary record,and plaintiff counsel persistence in asserting specious claims despite ample opportunity to withdraw the m,id.at,dist.lexis at.the record before us ably supports all three of the district court findings of conduct that amounted to bad faith.
first,the record demonstrates that several courts had already instructed plaintiff counsel that similar claims against new york state were barred by the eleventh amendment.see gollomp v,wl at,dist.lexis,at.the district court cited two,wl at,dist.lexis,at,and gaboury,wl at,dist.lexis,at which plaintiff counsel were specifically instructed that new york state enjoyed sovereign immunity from suit.in gaboury,in which plaintiff counsel was fined for bringing frivolous claims,judge mcavoy explained at length that eleventh amendment sovereign immunity is not a mercurial area of law,but has been definitively settled by the supreme court since with respect to actions against the state itself,and with respect to actions against state agencies or state officials named in their official capacity.wl at,dist.lexis,at internal citation omitted.nonetheless,plaintiffs persisted in bringing claims against the state of new york that were unquestionably barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.
we take judicial notice that plaintiff counsel has filed other lawsuits in the northern district of new york containing claims that were clearly barred by the eleventh amendment.see,motorola credit uzan,cir taking judicial notice of related proceedings.in kosich,which was decided in august,judge scullin dismissed a complaint filed by plaintiff counsel because all of the claims against new york state,the new york state department of health,and the bureau of professional medical conduct were barred by eleventh amendment sovereign immunity.see kosich,slip op.at.the court further ordered plaintiff counsel to show cause why they should not be sanctioned pursuant to rule after finding that plaintiff counsel failed to make a reasonable inquiry into whether the claims alleged in the complaint were legally cognizable,and were sanctioned for bringing frivolous claims against new york state in the past.id.at.in addition,this court stated ten years another case from the northern district of new york brought by plaintiff eleventh amendment immunity protects state defendants,including the state employees acting in their official capacity.evans,wl.lexis,at summary order.
second,the record supports the district court finding that it was unfathomable for plaintiff counsel to misrepresent his disciplinary record to magistrate judge treece during the november,teleconference.gollomp v,wl at,dist.lexis,at.plaintiff counsel misrepresented his record three times.after initially stating that w e were not sanctioned in the past,tr.of proceedings,plaintiff counsel later represented that his firm had faced rule motions before and ha d always defeated these motions,tr.of proceedings.in addition,upon questioning by the court,plaintiff counsel stated that the rule motion then pending before the district court in kosich was not directly on point and n ot related to this case.tr.of proceedings.as the district court found,these assertions are flatly contradicted by the record.
in august months before the teleconference with magistrate judge district court ordered plaintiff counsel to show cause why they should not be sanctioned pursuant to rule for filing frivolous claims that were barred by the eleventh amendment.see kosich,slip op.at.the district court stated unambiguously that it was entertaining sanctions against plaintiff counsel for continu ing to assert claims on behalf of their clients against the state of new york its departments and agencies despite this court repeated admonitions and the principles of eleventh amendment immunity.id.at.contrary to plaintiff representation,this was the very same issue raised in the state defendants rule motion in this case.
in april months before the teleconference with magistrate judge appellate division,third department levied a sanction against plaintiff counsel for making misrepresentations to the court in a zoning dispute.see korbel,at,ordered that the appeal is dismissed,as moot,with costs,defendants request for sanctions is granted and sanctions in the amount of each are imposed against plaintiff and plaintiff counsel pursuant to nycrr emphases added.
in april years before the teleconference with magistrate judge mcavoy expressly sanctioned plaintiff counsel pursuant to rule.see gaboury,wl at,dist.lexis,at noting that the court ordered the galvin morgan firm to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed pursuant to rule id.at,dist.lexis,at finding that t he galvin firm also has neglected to learn from its past failures id.at,dist.lexis,at find ing that sanctions are appropriate because the galvin firm did not conduct an objectively reasonable analysis of whether the state defendants were amenable to suit in this court in light of the eleventh amendment and id.at,dist.lexis,at ordering james morgan and madeline sheila galvin,the members of the galvin and morgan firm who signed the papers submitted to this court,to each complete eight hours of a continuing legal education course on federal practice or federal civil rights litigation and to remit a total of two hundred fifty dollars to the pro bono fund of the northern district of new york.
third,the record demonstrates that plaintiff counsel persisted in alleging legally unfounded claims despite ample opportunity in this case to withdraw the m.gollomp v,wl,dist.lexis,at.upon reviewing the initial complaint,state defendants promptly warned plaintiff counsel that they intended to file a rule motion if the causes of action barred by the eleventh amendment were not withdrawn.at the november,teleconference,magistrate judge treece attempted to explain that the eleventh amendment precluded many of the claims alleged in the first amended complaint.nonetheless,plaintiff counsel signed the second amended complaint,which contained multiple claims that were barred by the eleventh amendment.plaintiff failure to correct these deficiencies,combined with their other conduct,satisfies the bad faith requirement in and supports the district court decision to impose sanctions under that statute.
in addition to the three findings made by the district court,our own review of the record reveals additional support for a determination of bad faith.since plaintiff counsel became involved in this litigation,courts have commented that they have brought claims that are or otherwise.as the new york court of claims observed in may this litigation moved into federal claims pursued by plaintiff counsel were nothing more than a recounting of acts or omissions of the state defendants relative to a laundry list of state and federal statutes,at some unspecified time and place,such that the court could not tell the nature of the claim,and by what conduct the state is alleged to have caused this claimant any injury.gollomp iv,appellees.the initial complaint filed in the instant action was equally incomprehensible.for example,we are at a loss to any defending party would plaintiff meant by allegations that the various defendants collectively engaged in the unconstitutional delegation of authority by allowing the judicial arm of state government to assume what constitutes legislative power in the form of revamping duly adopted laws,rules and regulations and in the process contravening applicable home rule requirements,causing plaintiff in damages.compl.even less clear is how defendants,who included the new york state judiciary,the former attorney general,and various departments and agencies,individually and collectively acted in such a manner as to create a hostile environment,including a hostile home environment in which gollomp and his family reside caus ing gollomp and his family to incur expenses and to suffer physically from anger,frustration,suspicion and concern.compl.the state defendants have had to rebut these and similarly vague claims for years.
we also note that plaintiff counsel have been repeatedly admonished for the extreme length of their pleadings.see,kosich,slip op.at noting that plaintiff complaint was pages in length and include d paragraphs and causes of action glasheen city of albany,wl,dist.lexis,at,finding that the complaint,which was pages and contained paragraphs and causes of action,is rife with irrelevant information and prolix in the extreme,and admonish ing plaintiff counsel,james morgan of galvin morgan,against refiling a complaint in this action that still contains irrelevant background information and fails to make a connection between the causes of action and facts asserted in the complaint gaboury,wl at,dist.lexis,at in fact,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure places an obligation upon the galvin firm to submit a short and plain statement of the claim,not a page,paragraph long conspiracy theory novel.although the district court did not cite the pleadings in this case as a reason for awarding sanctions,we observe that the initial complaint in this in at pages and containing numbered paragraphs and causes of similarly prolix.although the second and third iterations of the complaint were shorter,there is simply no justification for ignoring prior instructions to submit pleadings containing short and plain statement s of the claim s showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,fed civ.a.
frivolous claims 
plaintiff offers several explanations of why his claims are not frivolous,none of which are persuasive.first,plaintiff argues before our court,as he did before the district court,that his claims could not have been frivolous because the state defendants undertook substantial efforts to defend themselves.see,pl.aff.in supp.of mot.to reargue,arguing that,had plaintiff claims actually been frivolous,there would be no need for the extensive legal research and drafting and work in preparing defendants motion s made before this court appellant br.either the legal research hours were unnecessary if the case were totally frivolous,or there was a valid basis and leg
