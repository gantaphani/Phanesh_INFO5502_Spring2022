defendant damion hardy,who is being detained at a hospital facility operated by the united states bureau of prisons bop pending trial on charges of,inter alia,drug trafficking,racketeering,and murder,and who has been found incompetent to stand trial,appeals from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,frederic block,judge,granting the government motion to authorize bop medical personnel to treat hardy with antipsychotic medications despite his unwillingness to undergo such treatment.the district court concluded that involuntary medication of hardy is warranted because such treatment is medically appropriate,and it both is necessary for the protection of others,see washington harper,harper,and is appropriate in order to restore hardy competence to stand trial,see sell united states.on appeal,hardy contends principally that involuntary medication pursuant to harper is not necessary because his actions are can be controlled by bop staff and procedures and that the district court erred in concluding that the sell test had been met because the government failed to show that there was a substantial likelihood that his competency could be restored with the use of antipsychotic medication.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order.
background 
hardy was arrested in august.the indictment filed against him in that month alleged,inter alia,that he was an organizer and leader of an extensive narcotics trafficking gang it charged him with conspiring to distribute at least kilograms of cocaine base or crack,in violation of.the current count superseding indictment,filed in january,charges hardy in counts with,inter alia,racketeering conspiracy,narcotics trafficking conspiracy,use of firearms,and six murders in aid of racketeering.with respect to one of the murders,the government has filed notice of its intent to seek the death penalty.
psychological evaluations of hardy competence to stand trial 
in september,the district court granted a motion by the government pursuant to for a psychiatric or psychological examination of hardy to evaluate his competence to stand trial.in a competency to stand trial evaluation dated october,bop report,the bop psychologist who had attempted to interview hardy reported that those attempts had been impeded by hardy refusal to cooperate with psychological testing.however,the report stated,inter alia,that hardy was fully oriented to time,place,person,and circumstance that h e exhibited no trouble with attention and concentration that he showed no signs of expressive or receptive speech difficulties that h is speech was logical and coherent and that h is thinking appeared organized bop report at.the report noted that hardy appeared to be preoccupied with religion,that much of his speech was irrelevant to the question of his comprehension and competency,and that the irrelevance appeared to be a matter of choice.see see also id.at hardy continuously repeated when the interviewer attempted to discuss topics other than religion that he was choosing not to discuss them.the psychologist noted that hardy defense attorney stated that hardy knows what the charges are,the background,specific events,legal arguments,and the court process that hardy mind is clear and h e is very sharp and that hardy was able to assist in his defense.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the psychologist concluded by giving her opinion 
that hardy does not possess a mental disease or defect that interferes with his ability to have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against him,to assist legal counsel in his defense if he chooses to,and to rationally make decisions regarding legal strategy.therefore,it is the opinion of this evaluator that hardy is competent to stand trial.
id.at.thereafter,hardy mental condition deteriorated.
in,judge david trager,to whom the case was then assigned,granted the government motion for an order that hardy undergo a new psychiatric or psychological examination.in a competency to stand trial evaluation dated january,bop january report,the bop psychologist who conducted the new examination stated that since,hardy appears to have become less cooperative with counsel and has made increasingly bizarre statements he opined that hardy had grandiose and beliefs that are genuinely delusional in nature.bop january report at.this report concluded with the opinion that b ecause hardy did not cooperate with the evaluation,conclusions are speculative and lack the usual level of psychological certainty.however,it is the opinion of this evaluator that hardy is currently not competent to stand trial.id.at.
in march,the district court ordered another psychiatric or psychological examination.in the ensuing forensic report dated july,bop july report,the bop psychologist who conducted this examination concluded that hardy suffers from schizophrenia and that his mental disease or defect renders him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,or to assist properly in his defense.bop july report at.thereafter,the district court found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that hardy was presently incompetent to stand trial.order dated july,competency order.in that order,the court committed hardy to the custody of the attorney general for days hospitalization in order to determine whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future he will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward.id.
pursuant to the competency order,hardy was transferred to bop medical center for federal prisoners in springfield,missouri springfield in october.
medical evaluations in as to the likely success of treating hardy with antipsychotic medication 
the original impetus for hardy psychiatric and psychological examinations was the issue of his competence to stand trial the initial focus of the evaluations at springfield was whether medication would restore him to that level of competency.hardy conduct at that facility and at other bop facilities led the psychiatric and psychological inquiry to encompass the additional issue of whether such medication was needed for the safety of bop staff and other inmates.
the proceedings spanned several years.as described below,administrative hearings were held in and written reports were submitted by bop medical personnel in opinions were submitted by medical experts retained by the defense in and and the authors of those reports and opinions testified at district court hearings in.at the hearing,the court also heard testimony from numerous bop guards as to hardy aggressive conduct,which had been described in incident reports,copies of which were submitted to the court.
the administrative hearing 
following hardy arrival at springfield,given his lack of consent to receive medication,an administrative hearing was held as a matter of bop routine policy to determine whether hardy posed a danger to himself or others and whether involuntary medication should be recommended.the resulting involuntary medication report dated january,bop january report,written by carlos tomelleri,a nontreating bop psychiatrist who conducted the hearing,concluded that involuntary medication was not recommended at that time 
for the last nine months hardy has not engaged in behavior that would appear dangerous to others.the episode of pulling away from officers was explained by hardy as being upset that he was not being released.he did not verbalize any further thoughts of aggression toward officers or other staff.likewise,hardy has not manifested any thoughts or actions indicative of potential self injury.
bop january report at.however,tomelleri also noted that 
r egarding restoration of competency,treatment of psychotropic medication has a substantial probability of improving hardy mental condition to the point where he could fulfill conditions necessary to proceed with his legal case.
bop doctors views as to the likely value of treatment 
pursuant to the competency order,bop medical personnel at springfield observed hardy and issued two reports in february,giving their opinions as to whether there was a substantial likelihood that medication would be effective to render hardy competent to stand trial.in a february,psychiatric report bop february,report,bop psychiatrist robert sarrazin diagnosed hardy with schizophrenia,stating,inter alia,that hardy remains extremely delusional,particularly in light of the fact that he states that there is no case against him bop february,report at.sarrazin concluded,however,that with antipsychotic medications there is a substantial probability that hardy competency status can be restored id.at.
in so concluding,sarrazin relied in part on the american psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia,which indicated that generally about of patients receiving antipsychotic medications have little or no response to medication and that an additional have only a partial response to such treatment.see id.at.thus,under the least optimistic interpretation of the data,hardy had a chance of restoration to competency under the most optimistic,he had a chance.see id.at.sarrazin estimated that greater,rather than less,optimism was warranted for hardy prognosis because,although patients who have prominent negative symptoms are less likely to respond to medication treatment than those who do not,hardy lacked such symptoms and had a relatively high level of social functioning despite his low level thought disorder.id.at.sarrazin also cited several empirical studies that had shown that involuntary treatment with antipsychotic medication to restore the competency of various inmates who suffered from mental conditions similar to hardy had resulted in favorable responses in the range of of the patients.see id.at.the bop february,report ultimately estimated that the likelihood of success for hardy would be in that range.see id.at.
sarrazin described possible side effects of antipsychotic medications and noted that the most serious side effects were also the most rare.see bop february,report at.the report stated,moreover,that any side effects could be prevented controlled through a,progressive treatment plan.see id.at.in particular,sarrazin wrote that,with respect to the proposed treatment plan for hardy,
t he goal is to achieve clinical improvement at the lowest effective dose starting at the low end of the dosing range and gradually increasing the dose as clinically indicated.if hardy developed intolerable side effects to any one of the medications that was sic not amenable to dosage adjustment or addition of adjunctive medication,the treatment regimen would be switched to another of the antipsychotic medications 
id.at.in the event that hardy was not amenable to oral medication,injections of long acting antipsychotic medication would be given after hardy received a test dose to identify any rare idiosyncratic reactions to this medication.id.
a forensic report dated february,bop february,report,by lea ann preston baecht,the bop psychologist attending hardy,detailed hardy background and medical history.this report indicated that hardy family reportedly had noted changes in his behavior in or when he converted to islam and became increasingly preoccupied with religion.see bop february,report at.preston baecht also relayed the contents of a january interview of hardy on a new york city radio program,in which hardy had made repeated references to conspiracies among the masons and jews,had stated that his relationship with lil kim had ended because she was part of the secret society of the masons,and he had insisted various rappers were masonic members and homosexuals and that the masons had tried to get lil kim to get me join the homo club.id.the report continued that i n april,hardy traveled to the middle east,where he stayed for four months.he reportedly flew to jordan and went to the royal palace in order to urge the king of jordan to step down he reportedly traveled to morocco and was arrested after he twice tried to visit the king of morocco.he was returned to jordan and arrested for speaking against the king of jordan.id.
as to her interactions with hardy,preston baecht commented that hardy consistently refused to speak with her,and when he did,hardy spoke about something he called ethou law 
it goes into effect four years,two months and days from when the court learns there is no case if they do do it,it over.that it.if a person is not released on day of the time limit,then the president of the united states signs an order for soldiers to go into the jail and get that person it an unusual law.no one can change it.not even the supreme court.
bop february,report at.hardy continued that the judge in his case in august s tated i was to be released on november,id,and hardy insisted that he was being held illegally id.at.
based on her observations and her review of hardy background,preston baecht diagnosed hardy with paranoid schizophrenia.see id.at.she believed,however,that t reatment with medication would likely reduce the intensity of hardy psychotic symptoms and improve his mental status to the level where he would be considered competent to stand trial.id.at.further,preston baecht opined that alternative,less intrusive treatments,psychotherapy,education,are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results.id.at.finally,preston baecht noted that medication side effects are routinely managed by thousands of american psychiatrists in daily clinical practice,who assess the risks and benefits of any particular medication in treating their patients id.at,and it is in the literature that the standard treatment for hardy mental illness is medication id.at.
the views of doctors retained by the defense 
to oppose the conclusions reached by sarrazin and preston baecht,hardy submitted two written opinions in by psychiatrist richard dudley,and a similar opinion by a psychologist in.dudley had met with hardy on two occasions,reviewed hardy medical records,and interviewed hardy family.in opinion letters dated august,dudley august opinion,and september,dudley september opinion,dudley concluded that there was not a substantial likelihood that hardy could be restored to competency through the administration of antipsychotic medication.see dudley august opinion at dudley september opinion at.dudley relied principally on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,fourth edition,text revision to evaluate factors that would influence hardy prognosis.in dudley opinion,all of the prognostic factors were negative in light of,inter alia,the facts that hardy ha d suffered from schizophrenia for much more than years,that he had never been treated for his illness,that there is a family history of schizophrenia,that his thinking is not only paranoid but also often disorganized,and that there was poor premorbid functioning.dudley september opinion at see also dudley august opinion at i t has been well established that some persons who suffer from schizophrenia,especially those who never obtain psychopharmacologic treatment,show a progressive worsening of the disease with a persistence of many of their symptoms and a resultant severe disability.because early intervention is so much more likely to result in a good response to treatment compared to initiating treatment in a person who has already become chronically ill,and because hardy condition had been untreated for several years and his symptoms were increasingly dudley august opinion at,dudley opined that the most pessimistic data cited by sarrazin are much more relevant to an understanding of the possibility of restoring hardy to competency and that hardy was in the group least likely to respond positively dudley september opinion at.dudley indicated that many of sarrazin cited studies would be relevant to a newly ill individual,but that they were not relevant to chronically ill persons such as hardy.dudley august opinion at.
finally,as to side effects,dudley wrote that because hardy was unlikely to accept oral medications,he would be subject to injections that are the group most likely to cause the more serious adverse effects,effects that are more likely to occur at higher potencies.dudley september report at.dudley also noted that hardy was at particular risk of seizures given that he has a history of seizures of unknown etiology.see id.at.
testimony at the hearing 
judge trager held a hearing on august,and november,to allow the respective experts to testify and be questioned.at the august hearing,sarrazin and preston baecht reiterated the views set forth in their respective february reports,described in part.above,that there was a substantial likelihood that hardy competency could be restored with the use of antipsychotic medications and that competency was unlikely to be restored without such medication.see,hearing transcript,august,tr,at.preston baecht added that in general the vast majority of her patients who have had to be involuntarily medicated have been restored to competency more than percent have been restored.id.at.
with respect to the likelihood of successful medication,sarrazin agreed with dudley that the earlier the patient receives treatment,the better the prospects for a positive response see id.at.sarrazin testified that among hardy positive prognostic factors were his ability to interact socially and the fact that hardy was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia as contrasted with undifferentiated or disorganized schizophrenia.see id.at.he acknowledged that hardy did not have many other positive prognostic indicators.see,id.at.
sarrazin also admitted that percent of the responsive patients relapsed within a year of treatment.see tr.however,responding to the district court concern that hardy might regain competency but not retain it for the duration of his case,sarrazin testified that such a relapse would be unlikely given the availability of constant psychiatric attention from bop medical personnel 
i can not think of a case where the individual was competent when they left on their medication,stayed on their medication,and became not competent within the time frame of the judicial hearing cause these occur within you know,sometimes,you know,after they competent their judicial part may occur within six months.it may be longer in certain trials but i not aware of one that i have looked at where an individual who stayed on 
the court here we have a death penalty case where it can go on for years.
sarrazin right.and could there be an exacerbation of his illness in the middle of his trial,in spite of the fact that he compliant on his medication that would be a possibility.
but i can not think of a case where as long as they getting their medication and mcc and mdc both have a psychiatrist that goes between the two.so,there would be psychiatric care available also.
in addressing hardy treatment plan and the possible side effects of haloperidol injections,sarrazin noted 
the dry mouth,the dry eyes stiffness we have medications such as cogentin or artane or benadryl.any of those medications can be given as a side effect medication.it helps with individuals so they do have the stiffness that can sometimes happen 
tardive dyskinesia is a involuntary movement of the tongue and mouth.it can occur with other parts of the body.it is usually with high dosages of antipsychotics,first generations,over a long period of time and it can be permanent.
so we monitor very closely 
a rare,extremely rare possible complication of any of the antipsychotics,but particularly first generation antipsychotics,is called neuroleptic malignant syndrome.that is where the body loses its ability to regulate its temperature individuals often require icu monitoring and treatment,and in rare cases it can be fatal.as i say,it a rare illness that we do monitor for.
tr.sarrazin stated that if hardy refused to take medication to alleviate the side effects,other injectable medications were available that could be used as alternatives.see id.at.he also testified that any side effects would not likely interfere significantly with hardy ability to assist his attorney in preparing his defense.id.at.
at the hearing in november,dudley reiterated the view stated in his august and september opinion letters that there was not a substantial likelihood that antipsychotic medications could render hardy competent to stand trial.see hearing transcript,november,november tr.at.while acknowledging that p sychopharmacologic intervention with medications was the treatment of choice for someone with hardy condition november tr.see also id.at,dudley stated that hardy prognostic factors indicated that that treatment would likely not be effective see id.at.moreover,because he viewed hardy as being in the more pessimistic group,dudley believed that a more rigorous intervention would be needed id.at,creating a risk of side effects see id.at although he could not express a view as to whether side effects of such medications would interfere with hardy ability to assist counsel see id.at.
following the close of the hearing,the parties submitted numerous memoranda,and the government asked the court to order involuntary medication.
hearings in and 
in early,judge trager passed away,and the case was reassigned to judge block.thereafter,judge block,in light of the delays resulting from,inter alia,reassignment of the case,ordered reassessments of hardy by sarrazin and preston baecht for the purpose of updating the views they had presented at the hearing.see order dated september,september order.the court also ordered an update of the bop january report with regard to whether involuntary medication was recommended.the september order stated that hardy was not to be subjected to involuntary medication without further order of the court.
hardy had been transferred from springfield to the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn shortly after the conclusion of the springfield evaluations in february.after attempts in to conduct the required reassessments at mdc failed,hardy was retransferred to springfield.before those examinations could be completed,hardy attempted to assault a springfield staff member,leading springfield medical personnel,apparently unaware of the district court september order,to subject him to involuntary medication with haloperidol on an emergency basis.
the administrative hearing 
at springfield,a new administrative hearing was held in november,eventually resulting in an amended involuntary medication report issued on december,bop report.bop psychiatrist tomelleri again presided,and he had before him,inter alia,a file of disciplinary incidents involving hardy at the various facilities in which he had been detained see part i.below.
hardy appeared at the hearing,accompanied by a staff representative assigned to assist him.no other witnesses appeared,although hardy defense attorneys submitted a letter dated november,celedonio ruhnke letter,stating that while hardy has been a discipline issue,his offenses have all been of a relatively minor nature and have never yielded a serious injury,and i t is implausible to suggest that he presents such a serious threat to others while confined to his cell that he requires medication.celedonio ruhnke letter at.the letter also stated that 
i t seems quite apparent to us that hardy inappropriate behavior can be managed with correctional measures we make no secret of our concern and suspicion that claiming the need to medicate hardy when no other bop facility over a period has ever suggested medication as an alternative is simply a convenient end run on the supreme court requirements as set forth in sell united states.
at the administrative hearing,hardy denied that there were any criminal charges against him denied any misconduct when asked about the facts leading to past incident reports and 
insistently stated that judge trager from the supreme court ordered his release in,so his present incarceration was invalid and his being kept in a locked unit was illegal.he also proceeded to indicate that since his incarceration was invalid he could not be held responsible for any transgression or criminal act occurring during that period of time.
bop report at emphasis added.after the hearing,tomelleri,citing hardy total lack of insight,grandiose delusions,the belief that he is not responsible for any misconduct because he is invalidly incarcerated,and his aggressive acts,concluded that involuntary medication was needed because hardy posed a danger to others,and that such medication was in hardy best medical interest.id.in finding that hardy was dangerous to others,tomelleri relied principally on incidents in which hardy had,inter alia,attempted to bite a bop officer,or had threatened to break an officer neck,or had attempted to stab a staff member with a sharpened object.see id.at.in finding that medication would be in hardy medical interest,tomelleri stated that p sychotropic medication is universally accepted as the treatment of choice for schizophrenia,and o ther modalities of treatment such as psychotherapy do not address the fundamental problem.id.at.
tomelleri decision was administratively appealed and affirmed.because of the district court september order,however,hardy has not been medicated since the november,incident.
hardy disciplinary incidents 
sarrazin had noted in the bop february,report that hardy,upon his arrival at springfield in,had been placed in a special housing unit shu not only because of his disorganized mental status,but also because of his history of agitation and aggression,such as stabbing another inmate at metropolitan correction center mcc in new york,new york.bop february,report at.hardy disciplinary record by also included the following incident reports,the facts of which are apparently not in dispute 
june,as staff were placing a second inmate into a cell,inmate hardy slipped his cuffs from behind him to in front of him.staff escorted hardy out of the cell as staff were escorting him to the holding cell area inmate hardy swung at the escorting officer with a closed fist and struck him in the chin area.staff then placed inmate hardy on the ground to gain control.the officer was examined with minor tenderness with redness to the chin area and was treated with minor first aid.emphases added capitalization omitted.

emphasis added.
the district court hearing 
judge block held a evidentiary hearing in january,at which the incident reports of hardy misconduct were introduced,and at which some of the involved bop officers testified.see,hearing transcript,january,tr.at and hearing transcript,january,tr,at officers henderson and santiago,respectively,describing the events of october,when hardy cut the hand of one officer with a shank and then attempted to stab santiago with the shank,striking santiago protective vest barely four inches away from an unprotected area,tr.officer kosakowski describing the events of october,when hardy attempted to bite him,tr.officer ferreira describing the june,incident in which hardy,whose hands had been cuffed behind his body,maneuvered them to the front of his body and struck ferreira in the face id.at and,tr.officers lorenzo and jamaica,respectively,describing the september,and december,incidents in which hardy threw irritating liquids in their faces,placing them at risk of infection or disease jan,tr.officer drake describing the november,incident in which hardy attempted to strike a force team member with a sock filled with batteries id.at officer rodriguez describing the february,incident in which hardy stabbed another inmate in the head,neck,and arm with a sharpened comb.
at the january hearing,the district court also heard testimony from sarrazin and preston baecht,who,inter alia,reaffirmed their prior views as to the efficacy of antipsychotic medication to restore hardy to competency.see,tr.sarrazin added that the gold standard treatment for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia is the medications,and that without such medication,he saw no possibility of restoring hardy competency.id.at.he testified that although hardy had some disorganized thought processes,they did not amount to disorganized schizophrenia which is associated with more severe communication issues and is more difficult than paranoid schizophrenia to treat.id.at.sarrazin also noted that hardy did not appear to have a cognitive disorder or a history of head injury,mental retardation,dementia,or other structural difficulty with the brain,the absence of which enables a more optimistic prognosis.see id.at.as a result,sarrazin remained of the view that hardy had a better than percent chance of having his competency restored through the use of antipsychotic medication.id.at see also id.at.
sarrazin also noted that the haloperidol administered to hardy in the emergency caused by his uncontrolled conduct on november,had not appeared to cause him any side effects.no untoward effects were noted,no abnormal physical findings were noted,abnormal movements,and hardy appeared to tolerate that medication without difficulty,tr.sarrazin also pointed out that he did not view the imposition of restraints on hardy as an acceptable alternative because it would not treat the illness.id.at.
both sarrazin and preston baecht opined that involuntary medication was preferable to cuffing hardy hands and for the health of the detainee and for the safety of others.sarrazin testified that if someone is in restraints for a long period of time,there a concern of deep vein thrombosis.they could get a clot in their leg.they have problems with moving their bowels because they not moving their arms and legs.there could be times when they may be develop abrasions on their arms or their legs.id.at.preston baecht agreed 
being in that position for a long period of time,obviously,you risk physical problems such as blood clots,other things of that nature 
additionally,it actually requires staff to have more physical contact with him because they have to give him food trays,they have to monitor his vitals every few hours,they have to somehow assist him from toiletingwhether or not they hand him a urinal or they change a diaper,it involves a lot more contact between the staff and an can still spit on staff,they can still try to bite staff.so,not only is it,i think,inherently risky to the patient,it also risky to the staff.
preston baecht also testified that hardy potential for violence,posing a high risk to staff,is linked to hardy most problematic symptom,psychotic symptom,which is his delusional belief that because he being held in his mind illegally,he can not be held responsible for any aggressive or violent behavior that he engages in.id.at.
preston baecht was questioned on her assessment of hardy as,given that she had filed periodic shu reports in which she had indicated that his threat to others was moderate.id.at.she testified that moderate was not an accurate assessment of her opinion of the risk that hardy posed to others,but that because of a technological oversight,she had copied moderate from other reports rather than indicating more accurately that hardy was a threat.id.
hardy submitted to the court an affidavit by psychologist xavier amador,whose opinion was consistent with the views submitted on hardy behalf in by dudley.see affidavit of xavier amador dated june.amador agreed that hardy could not be restored to competency without treatment with antipsychotic medication but his view was that,in light of hardy specific prognostic factors,such as the several years duration of his untreated delusions and his family history of schizophrenia,hardy was highly unlikely to respond.id.at.amador also criticized the studies on which sarrazin relied,contending that they had been poorly executed and were thus invalid or irrelevant to hardy given his individual prognostic factors.see id.at.amador concluded that there is presently no evidence that could support a finding that there is a substantial likelihood that hardy could be restored to competency within the foreseeable future.id.at.
amador testified at the hearing and reiterated those views.see,tr.he also acknowledged,however,that antipsychotic medication is the treatment of choice the of treatment when dealing with a schizophrenic patient and stated that even where the chance that a patient will respond is low,i n every case i want to give the person a chance.id.at.and he acknowledged on that for the majority of patients,t he most important prognostic indicator of whether they will be responsive to medication is whether or not they adhere fully to their prescribed medication regimen,and for that reason,longacting injectables,rather than oral medications were preferable.id.at.nonetheless,amador opined that a t absolute best i g i ve a percent chance that you could improve the delusions that are impairing hardy competency.id.at see id.at.
d.the decision of the district court 
in a july,memorandum and order reported at d,the district court concluded that involuntary medication of hardy was warranted under either the harper dangerousness test or the sell test.
dangerousness 
with respect to the harper dangerousness test,the court mentioned several of the above incidents principally those that occurred on october,hardy cutting the hand of one officer and attempting to stab the torso of another,october,hardy attempting to bite an officer,december,hardy throwing irritating liquid into an officer eyes,see d at,and january,hardy possession of the toothpaste tube refilled with urine and feces,see id.at.the court concluded that hardy posed a danger to others,reasoning as follows 
the incidents described at the january hearing are not themselves in dispute.defense counsel argues,however,that,given the circumstances,they do not support a finding that hardy presents a continuing danger to others.the court disagrees.the facts described at the hearing unequivocally show that hardy outbursts are not isolated incidents,but a pattern of violent behavior.
the of the opinions of sarrazin and preston baecht that hardy psychosis is at the root of his violent behavior is too powerful to dismiss.from hardy perspective,he is essentially a hostage or kidnapping victim that hardy has not,as far as the record reflects,had any incident reports since january does not assuage the court concern that addition al aggressive behavior is possible even likely as long as the reason for it exists.
the court has considered whether the bop interest in protecting the safety of its staff can be achieved through measures that do not impinge on hardy interest in refusing medication.but no such measures are apparent.as the supreme court noted in harper,p hysical restraints are effective only in the short term,and can have serious physical side effects when used on a resisting inmate,as well as leaving the staff at risk of injury while putting the restraints on or tending to the inmate who is in them.at physical isolation has also proven ineffective,inasmuch as some of the incidents described occurred while hardy was confined to the shu.
d at emphases added.
the district court also concluded that treatment with antipsychotic medication was in hardy medical interest,as 
i t is undisputed that such medication is the treatment of choice for hardy condition without it,no treatment can demonstrate the fallacy of the patient delusion.with medication,by contrast,there is at least the hope that hardy can be made aware that he is being lawfully detained pending trial.while that awareness may not be pleasant,it might at least allow hardy to cope in less antisocial ways.
id.in considering possible side effects,the district court credited,without qualification,sarrazin testimony that the most likely side effects are easily treatable,and that the less likely side effects can be avoided through a combination of careful monitoring,dosage adjustment and as a last resort discontinuation of the medication.id.at.
the court concluded 
defense counsel have raised the sensible concern that declaring an inmate to be a danger to himself or others is a tempting end run around the more stringent standard of sell but the evidence of hardy dangerousness is too concrete and persuasive to allow for the possibility that the bop is manufacturing a reason to medicate hardy.the court is convinced that hardy poses a danger to corrections staff,that that danger can not reasonably be abated without antipsychotic medication,and that such medication is in hardy medical interest
