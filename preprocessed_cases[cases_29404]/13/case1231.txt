on february,ira weinstein,a united states citizen and resident of new york,was severely injured during a suicide bombing in jerusalem organized by the terrorist organization hamas.on april,weinstein died from those injuries.see weinstein islamic of iran,d.on october,his widow,another administrator of his estate,and his children brought suit for wrongful death and other torts against the islamic republic of iran iran,the iranian ministry of information and security,and three iranian officials,alleging that these defendants had provided substantial monetary support for hamas terrorist attacks.see id.at.after defendants failed to appear,the district court determined that the plaintiffs had established their claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court,e,and entered default judgment for plaintiffs in the amount of approximately.see id.at.
plaintiffs registered the judgment in the district court for the eastern district of new york on october,and served an information subpoena on bank of new york that eventually led to the identification of respondent bank melli iran bank melli as a possible instrumentality of the iranian state.see weinstein islamic of iran,d.the district court found it unnecessary to determine whether bank belli was an agency or instrumentality for purposes of the tria because the court determined that bank melli accounts at the bank of new york were unattachable.id.at.however,on october,one of the creditors,jennifer weinstein hazi hazi,filed a motion in the eastern district proceeding,seeking appointment of a receiver pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and section a of the new york civil practice law and rules,to sell real property owned by respondent bank melli in forest hills,queens,which plaintiff sought to attach and sell in partial satisfaction of the judgment against the defendants.hazi argued that the forest hills property was now subject to attachment pursuant to the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,a,stat,codified at note,because on october,bank melli had been designated by the united states department of treasury,office of foreign assets control ofac as a proliferat or of weapons of mass destruction,and its assets had been frozen.see executive order.june,
on february,bank melli moved to dismiss the proceeding against it and to stay the appointment of a receiver pending resolution of its motion to dismiss.in its motion to dismiss,bank melli argued,inter alia,that attachment and sale of the forest hills property would violate the treaty of amity between the united states and iran,that attachment and sale would constitute a taking not for a public purpose and without just compensation in violation of the takings clause of both the fifth amendment of the united states constitution and article iv of the treaty of amity,and that the blocking of its assets violated the algiers accords and thus attachment and sale would constitute a further violation of the accords.on june,after receiving submissions from both hazi and bank melli the district court wexler,judge denied bank melli motion to dismiss and granted hazi motion to appoint a receiver,but stayed the proceedings pending this appeal.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
on this appeal,bank melli argues for the first time that the district court lacked ancillary jurisdiction to entertain hazi motion to appoint a receiver.according to bank melli,hazi motion was not simply a proceeding to collect on a debtor assets,but rather an independent controversy with a new party in an effort to shift liability,epperson entm t express,cir see also peacock thomas,for which tria a did not provide an independent source of jurisdiction.although not raised below,subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any point,grupo dataflux atlas global group,cave meadow union free sch,cir,and so the court must address this threshold matter 
the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,et,provides the exclusive basis for subject matter jurisdiction over all civil actions against foreign state defendants,and therefore for a court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a defendant the action must fall within one of the fsia exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.see,saudi arabia nelson,argentine amerada hess shipping,verlinden cent.bank of.in the underlying action that gave rise to the judgment on which plaintiff now seeks to collect,the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction over iran and the other defendants under a,which abrogates immunity for those foreign states officially designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the department of state where the foreign state commits a terrorist act or provides material support for the commission of a terrorist act and the act results in the death or personal injury of a united states citizen see weinstein,d at.when such an exception applies,the foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances see also verlinden,at.
bank melli was not itself a defendant in the underlying action.however,the fsia has a separate section,section,that provides that where a valid judgment has been entered against a foreign sovereign,property of that foreign state is immune from attachment and execution except as provided in the subsequent sections,sections and.section a of the tria,codified as a note to section of the fsia,provides as follows 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in subsection b,in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based on an act of terrorism,or for which a terrorist party is not immune under a,the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment in the aid of execution in order to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged liable.
tria a,stat.at emphasis supplied.
the parties do not dispute that each of the elements of section a is satisfied here.iran has been designated a terrorist party pursuant to section j of the export administration act of.j,beginning january,see weinstein,d at,and therefore is a terrorist party as defined by tria d,stat.at.the district court in the underlying action found jurisdiction under a,and thus iran was not immune from jurisdiction in the original proceeding.see id.at.bank melli assets were blocked as of october,designated as such pursuant to executive order and.finally,bank melli concedes that it is an instrumentality of iran.
bank melli contends,however,that the language of the tria does not provide an independent basis for jurisdiction over an instrumentality of a sovereign state when the instrumentality was not itself a party to the underlying tort action that gave rise to judgment on which plaintiff now seeks to recover.rather,bank melli argues,section a of the tria simply provides an additional ground for abrogating immunity from attachment for a party that has been the subject of a valid judgment,but does not provide jurisdiction for a court to permit attachment against a party that was not itself the subject of the underlying judgment.
although novel bank melli argument is belied by the plain language of section a,as well as by its history and purpose.section a clearly states that in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party,the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment tria a,stat.at emphasis supplied.under bank melli interpretation,the parenthetical language in section a of the tria that permits attachment of funds from agencies and instrumentalities would be rendered superfluous,since the agency or instrumentality would itself have been a terrorist party against which the underlying judgment had been obtained.see,corley united states,a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant quoting hibbs winn.instead,however,the statute clearly differentiates between the party that is the subject of the underlying judgment itself,which can be any terrorist party here,iran,and parties whose blocked assets are subject to execution or attachment,which can include not only the terrorist party but also any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party.if this did not constitute an independent grant of jurisdiction over the agencies and instrumentalities,the parenthetical would be a nullity.
although bank melli points out that section a of the tria has been codified as a note to section rather than in the sections of the fsia more directly addressed to exceptions to jurisdictional immunity,the plain language of the statute can not be overcome by its placement in the statutory scheme.see padilla rumsfeld,cir no accepted canon of statutory interpretation permits placement to trump text,especially where,as here,the text is clear and our reading of it is fully supported by the legislative history,rev on other grounds by rumsfeld padilla,see also.dep t of revenue piccadilly cafeterias,noting that a statutory provision placement in a particular section can not substitute for the operative text of the statute.this is even more clearly true in this case where the operative language begins with the phrase n otwithstanding any other provision of law,thus making plain that the force of the section extends everywhere.
any inquiry into the meaning of a statute generally ceases if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.barnhart sigmon coal,u,quoting robinson shell oil,other internal quotation marks omitted see also universal church geltzer,cir.but even if,contrary to fact,there were an ambiguity here,it would be resolved in plaintiff favor by the legislative history.according to senator harkin,one of tria sponsors 
the purpose of title ii is to deal comprehensively with the problem of enforcement of judgments issued to victims of terrorism in any court by enabling them to satisfy such judgments from the frozen assets of terrorist parties title ii operates to strip a terrorist state of its immunity from execution or attachment in aid of execution by making the blocked assets of that terrorist state,including the blocked assets of any of its agencies or instrumentalities,available for attachment execution of a judgment issued against that terrorist state.thus,for purposes of enforcing a judgment against a terrorist state,title ii does not recognize any juridical distinction between a terrorist state and its agencies or instrumentalities.
cong.rec,at,statement of harkin.senator harkin further stated that tria establishes once and for all,that such judgments are to be enforced against any assets available in the,and that the executive branch has no statutory authority to defeat such enforcement under standard judicial processes,except as expressly provided in this act.id.
accordingly,we find it clear beyond cavil that section a of the tria provides courts with subject matter jurisdiction over execution and attachment proceedings against property held in the hands of an instrumentality of the,even if the instrumentality is not itself named in the judgment.
constitutionality of tria 
the underlying judgment which plaintiff seeks to satisfy was obtained in february,but the tria was not enacted until november and bank melli was not designated a proliferat or of weapons of mass destruction until.in another argument raised for the first time on appeal,bank melli argues that the tria,as here applied,is unconstitutional because it mandates the reopening of a final judgment in violation of the separation of powers doctrine of article iii of the constitution.thus,to avoid any constitutional problem,bank melli urges this court to read the tria as applying,prospectively,only to judgments rendered final after the tria enactment,and thus not to apply here.
although plaintiff contends,with some force,that the constitutional challenge has been waived for failure to raise it below,a claim that a legislative enactment intrudes on the courts powers is the kind of claim that appropriately may be considered here,even if for the first time.see,freytag comm r,rejecting waiver and addressing constitutional challenge because of the strong interest of the federal judiciary in maintaining the constitutional plan of separation of powers internal quotation marks omitted.
bank melli constitutional challenge is largely derived from plaut spendthrift farm,in which the supreme court held that a section of the securities exchange act of violated separation of powers because it required federal courts retroactively to reopen final money judgments that had been dismissed as barred under the statute of limitations.see id.at.r etroactive legislation that requires its own application in a case already finally adjudicated does no more and no less than reverse a determination once made,in a particular case and thus exceeds the powers of congress.id.at quoting the federalist,at cooke,ed.
here,however,no such revision of the judgment is effectuated by the attachment of bank melli property pursuant to the tria.indeed,the judgment itself is unaffected.what the tria did,instead,was to override the supreme court reading in first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,bancec,that duly created instrumentalities of a foreign state are to be accorded a presumption of independent status.id.at.this presumption related to enforceability of judgments against state instrumentalities,but it had not nothing to do with the rendering of the judgment itself.moreover,even under bancec,the presumption could be overcome.id.at.the effect of the tria,therefore,was simply to render a judgment more readily enforceable against a related third party.the judgment itself was in no way tampered with,and separation of powers was thus in no way offended 
bank melli also argues that the delegation of authority to the treasury department to determine which entities assets would be blocked is,as applied here,tantamount to an unconstitutional vesting of review of the decisions of article iii courts in officials of the executive branch.plaut,at see hayburn case,dall.here,however,it is clear that no official from the executive branch stands in direct review of the district court decision regarding execution and attachment of assets pursuant to the tria.ofac simply made a factual determination that bank melli was a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction,pursuant to which bank melli assets were blocked.in so doing,ofac did not in any way review or alter the district court original entry of the default judgment.
nor does the district court reliance on ofac determination for its exercise of subject matter jurisdiction run afoul of separation of powers.in jones united states,the supreme court held that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over a murder trial where the crime occurred on an island that the state department had deemed was appertaining to the united states.id.at.in that case,the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction based on an executive branch determination did not exceed the bounds of article iii.similarly,in matimak trading khalily,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by jpmorgan chase bank traffic stream bvi infrastructure,this court found that alienage jurisdiction could depend on whether the executive branch had deemed a given foreign entity a state,and because the foreign entity in question had not been recognized as a state,jurisdiction was deemed lacking.
it is true that,in rein,at,this court,in dicta,raised the question of whether after the passage of the fsia,designation of a foreign state as a sponsor of terrorism by a branch other than congress raised a potential issue of separation of powers.specifically,in rein,we rejected libya argument that the state department designation of libya as a state sponsor of terrorism violated separation of powers,since libya had already been designated as such when section a was added to the fsia but we queried whether a different issue of delegation might be presente
