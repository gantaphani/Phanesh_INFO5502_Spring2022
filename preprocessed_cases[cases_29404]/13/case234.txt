the civil service reform act of csra permits a federal employee subjected to a particularly serious personnel action such as a discharge or demotion to appeal her agency decision to the merit systems protection board mspb or board.such an appeal may allege that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the csra itself but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency with discrimination prohibited by a federal statute.see a.when an employee alleges that a personnel action appealable to the mspb was based on discrimination,her case is known as a mixed case.see cfr.mixed cases are governed by special procedures set out in the csra and regulations of the mspb and equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.
under those procedures,an employee may initiate a mixed case by filing a discrimination complaint with the agency.if the agency decides against the employee,she may either appeal the agency decision to the mspb or sue the agency in district court.alternatively,the employee can bypass the agency and bring her mixed case directly to the mspb.if the mspb upholds the personnel action,whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so,the employee is entitled to seek judicial review.
section b of the csra provides that petitions for review of mspb decisions shall be filed in the federal circuit,except as provided in b.section b instructs that c ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of shall be filed under the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute.those enforcement provisions all authorize suit in federal district court.the cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of are those in which an employee a has been affected by an action which she may appeal to the mspb,and b alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by a listed federal statute in other words,mixed cases.
in,while an employee of the department of labor dol or agency,petitioner carolyn kloeckner filed a complaint with the agency civil rights office,alleging that dol had engaged in unlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work environment.following applicable eeoc regulations,dol completed an internal investigation and report,and kloeckner requested a hearing before an eeoc administrative judge.while the eeoc case was pending,kloeckner was fired.because kloeckner believed that dol decision to fire her was based on unlawful discrimination,she now had a mixed case.kloeckner originally brought her mixed case directly to the mspb.concerned about duplicative discovery expenses between her eeoc and mspb cases,she moved to amend her eeoc complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal and asked the mspb to dismiss her case without prejudice for four months to allow the eeoc process to go forward.both motions were granted.in september,the mspb dismissed her appeal without prejudice to her right to refile by january.the eeoc case,however,continued until april,when the eeoc judge terminated the proceeding as a sanction for kloeckner discovery conduct and returned the case to dol for a final decision.in october,dol ruled against kloeckner on all of her claims.kloeckner appealed to the board in november.the board dismissed kloeckner appeal as untimely,viewing it as an effort to reopen her old mspb case months after the january deadline.
kloeckner then brought this action against dol in federal district court,alleging unlawful discrimination.the court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.it held that,because the mspb dismissed kloeckner claims on procedural grounds,she should have sought review in the federal circuit under b in the court view,the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pursuant to b were those the mspb had decided on the merits.the eighth circuit affirmed.
held a federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the mspb violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in a should seek judicial review in district court,not the federal circuit,regardless whether the mspb decided her case on procedural grounds or on the merits.
a two sections of the csra,read naturally,direct employees like kloeckner to district court.begin with,which governs judicial review of mspb rulings.section b provides that petitions to review the board final decisions should be filed in the federal circuit e xcept as provided in paragraph of this subsection.section b then provides that c ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of shall be filed under the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute.each of the referenced enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.thus,c ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of shall be filed in district court.turn next to,which provides that the cases subject to its provisions are cases in which a federal employee has been affected by an action which she may appeal to the mspb,and alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by a listed federal statute.the cases of discrimination subject to are therefore mixed cases.putting and together,mixed cases shall be filed in district court.that is where kloeckner case should have been,and indeed was,filed.regardless whether the mspb dismissed her claim on the merits or threw it out as untimely,she brought the kind of case that the csra routes to district court.
b the government alternative view that the csra directs the mspb merits decisions to district court,while channeling its procedural rulings to the federal circuit is not supported by the statute.according to the government,that bifurcated scheme,though not specifically prescribed in the csra,lies hidden in the statute timing requirements.but the government can not explain why congress would have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.and taking the government analysis one step at a time makes it no more plausible.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
a federal employee subjected to an adverse personnel action such as a discharge or demotion may appeal her agency decision to the merit systems protection board mspb or board.see.in that challenge,the employee may claim,among other things,that the agency discriminated against her in violation of a federal statute.see a.the question presented in this case arises when the mspb dismisses an appeal alleging discrimination not on the merits,but on procedural grounds.should an employee seeking judicial review then file a petition in the court of appeals for the federal circuit,or instead bring a suit in district court under the applicable antidiscrimination law we hold she should go to district court.
the civil service reform act of csra,et,establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions taken against federal employees.that statutory framework provides graduated procedural protections depending on an action severity.if but only if the action is particularly serious involving,for example,a removal from employment or a reduction in grade or pay the affected employee has a right to appeal the agency decision to the mspb,an independent adjudicator of federal employment disputes see.such an appeal may merely allege that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the csra but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency with discrimination prohibited by another federal statute,such as title vii of the civil rights act of,et,or the age discrimination in employment act of,et.see a.when an employee complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the mspb and alleges that the action was based on discrimination,she is said by pertinent regulation to have brought a mixed case.see cfr.the csra and regulations of the mspb and equal employment opportunity commission eeoc set out special procedures to govern such a case different from those used when the employee either challenges a serious personnel action under the csra alone or attacks a less serious action as discriminatory.see,b ed.and supp.v cfr pt,subpt.e cfr pt,subpt.
a federal employee bringing a mixed case may proceed in a variety of ways.she may first file a discrimination complaint with the agency itself,much as an employee challenging a personnel practice not appealable to the mspb could do.see cfr a cfr b.if the agency decides against her,the employee may then either take the matter to the mspb or bypass further administrative review by suing the agency in district court.see cfr b cfr d i.alternatively,the employee may initiate the process by bringing her case directly to the mspb,forgoing the agency own system for evaluating discrimination charges.see cfr a cfr b.if the mspb upholds the personnel action whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so,the employee again has a choice she may request additional administrative process,this time with the eeoc,or else she may seek judicial review.see a,b cfr cfr.the question in this case concerns where that judicial review should take place.
section of the csra governs judicial review of the mspb decisions.section b gives the basic rule except as provided in paragraph of this subsection,a petition to review a final decision of the board shall be filed in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.section b then spells out the exception 
cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section of this title shall be filed under the enforcement sections of the civil rights act,age discrimination in employment act,and fair labor standards act,as applicable.notwithstanding any other provision of law,any such case filed under any such section must be filed within days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action under such section.
the enforcement provisions of the antidiscrimination statutes listed in this exception all authorize suit in federal district court.see c,f c b see also elgin department of treasury,slip,at.
section describes and provides for the cases of discrimination referenced in b exception.in relevant part,a states 
i n the case of any employee who 
a has been affected by an action which the employee may appeal to the merit systems protection board,and 
b alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by specified antidiscrimination statutes,
the board shall,within days of the filing of the appeal,decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the board appellate procedures.
the cases of discrimination in b exception,in other words,are mixed cases,in which an employee challenges as discriminatory a personnel action appealable to the mspb.
the parties here dispute whether,in light of these interwoven statutory provisions,an employee should go to the federal circuit pursuant to the general rule of b,or instead to a district court pursuant to the exception in b,when the mspb has dismissed her mixed case on procedural grounds.
petitioner carolyn kloeckner used to work at the department of labor dol or agency.in june,while still an employee,she filed a complaint with the agency civil rights office,alleging that dol had engaged in unlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work environment.at that point,kloeckner case was not appealable to the mspb because she had not suffered a sufficiently serious personnel action,a removal or demotion.see supra,at.her claim thus went forward not under the special procedures for mixed cases,but under the eeoc regulations for all other charges of discrimination.see cfr pt,subpts.a,d.in line with those rules,the agency completed an internal investigation and report in june,and kloeckner requested a hearing before an eeoc administrative judge.
the next month,dol fired kloeckner.a removal from employment is appealable to the mspb,see supra,at,and kloeckner believed the agency action was discriminatory she therefore now had a mixed case.as permitted by regulation,see supra,at,she initially elected to file that case with the mspb.her claim of discriminatory removal,however,raised issues similar to those in her hostile work environment case,now pending before an eeoc judge as a result,she became concerned that she would incur duplicative discovery expenses.to address that problem,she sought leave to amend her eeoc complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal,and she asked the mspb to dismiss her case without prejudice for four months to allow the eeoc process to go forward.see app.both of those motions were granted.the eeoc judge accepted the amendment and on september,the mspb dismissed her appeal without prejudice to her right to refile either a within days after a decision is rendered in her eeoc case or b by january,whichever occurs first.at.
discovery continued in the eeoc proceeding well past the mspb january deadline.in april,the eeoc judge found that kloeckner had engaged in conduct in connection with discovery.as a sanction,the judge terminated the eeoc proceeding and returned kloeckner case to dol for a final decision.six months later,in october,dol issued a ruling rejecting all of kloeckner claims.see,at.
kloeckner appealed dol decision to the board in november.that appeal was filed within days,the usual window for seeking mspb review of an agency determination of a mixed case.see cfr a cfr d ii.but the mspb declined to treat kloeckner filing as an ordinary appeal of such an agency decision.instead,the board viewed it as an effort to reopen her old mspb case many months after the january deadline for doing so had expired.the board therefore dismissed kloeckner appeal as untimely.see app.
kloeckner then brought this action against dol in federal district court,alleging unlawful discrimination.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.see kloeckner solis,civ.action ed.relying on the eighth circuit ruling in brumley levinson,per curiam,the court held that because the mspb had dismissed kloeckner claims on procedural grounds,she should have sought review in the federal circuit under b in the court view,the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pursuant to b were those the mspb had decided on the merits.the eighth circuit affirmed on the same reasoning.see.
we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split on whether an employee seeking judicial review should proceed in the federal circuit or in a district court when the mspb has dismissed her mixed case on procedural grounds we now reverse the eighth circuit decision.
as the above account reveals,the intersection of federal civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced a complicated,at times confusing,process for resolving claims of discrimination in the federal workplace.but even within the most intricate and complex systems,some things are plain.so it is in this case,where two sections of the csra,read naturally,direct employees like kloeckner to district court.
begin with,which governs judicial review of the mspb rulings.as already noted,see supra,at,b provides that petitions to review the board final decisions should be filed in the federal circuit e xcept as provided in paragraph of this subsection.paragraph,b,then sets out a different rule for one category of cases c ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section of this title.such a case,paragraph instructs,shall be filed under the enforcement provision of an enumerated antidiscrimination statute.and each of those enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.see supra,at.so c ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section shall be filed in district court.
