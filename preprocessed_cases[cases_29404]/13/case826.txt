in this political discrimination case from puerto rico,six plaintiffs were awarded a jury verdict in the total sum of,plus reinstatement,costs,and attorneys fees.we vacate the verdict and remand.
the appeal involves both the first amendment prohibition on discrimination based on political affiliation,elrod burns,d,and the healthy defense available to government employers,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.the supreme court decision in healthy established that even if a plaintiff can demonstrate that her political affiliation was a substantial factor in the adverse employment action taken against her,there is no constitutional violation if the defendant can show both i that it would have taken the same action in any event,and ii that it would have taken that action for reasons that are not unconstitutional.see healthy,at.in other words,it is not true that all a plaintiff needs to show in order to win is that political discrimination was a motivating reason for the employment action.the fact that the constitutionally protected activity played a substantial part in the actual decision to take adverse employment action does not necessarily amount to a constitutional violation.id.
the two distinct questions composing the healthy defense must be answered before a finder of fact may determine that political discrimination was the ultimate but for cause of an adverse employment action.in this case,a misapprehension of the healthy defense led to an error in the jury form and instructions.there is a sufficient likelihood of jury confusion from those errors that we vacate the judgment for plaintiffs and remand.
puerto rico has two major political parties that dominate the electoral landscape the popular democratic party pdp and the new progressive party npp.control of the government periodically switches between the two parties.entirely too often,the political party assuming office terminates the employment of public employees who are affiliated with the party going out of power and then fills those vacancies with its own members.by the same token,the outgoing party attempts to secure the continued tenure of its members in public jobs through a variety of devices,such as reclassifying appointments as career positions or making appointments in violation of puerto rico law.
in,the united states supreme court held that public employees have a first amendment right not to lose their jobs because of their political affiliation,unless political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the position involved.elrod,at.see also cordero de,cir.that doctrine has been refined over the years.in branti finkel,d,for example,the court held that an employee need not prove that he or she was coerced into changing political affiliation in order to prevail under the first amendment.id.at.in rutan republican party of,d,the court defined the scope of employment decisions subject to scrutiny to include promotion,transfer,recall,hiring,and firing.id.at.and in truck,city of northlake,d,the court extended the protections of elrod and branti to contractors and regular providers of services to the government.id.at.
in the original political discrimination cases,branti and elrod,there were already findings that the employment decisions at issue were made on political patronage grounds.see branti,at.elrod,at.the initial issue presented by those cases was whether historic patronage practices violated the first amendment at all.see elrod,at.the next set of issues concerned whether a plaintiff needed to show that there had been coercion to change political affiliation,see branti,at,and what types of jobs and job changes,reappointment could give rise to claims,see rutan,at.rutan presented the question whether a first amendment claim was stated where a governor had imposed an hiring freeze but had given his express permission for exceptions to the freeze only for members of his own party,thus denying hiring,promotion,transfer,and recall to applicants who were members of other parties.at.a majority of the court held that a first amendment claim was indeed stated on those facts.id.at.for present purposes,it is important that rutan did not involve the uniform application of a neutral employment policy,but rather the selective application of exceptions according to political party affiliation.see id.at.
to the best of our knowledge,the supreme court has never addressed the question whether a political discrimination claim may be pursued where the new party in power uniformly applies a personnel practice to all as by reviewing all personnel actions taken during a certain period to determine whether those actions conformed to local law and undoing them in every case in which there was a violation.
despite the thirty years since elrod,administrations in puerto rico have continued to take employment actions against public employees because of their political affiliations.with each change in both the commonwealth and municipal federal district courts in puerto rico are flooded with hundreds of political discrimination cases,many of which are appealed.see,gomez rivera rodriguez,cir claims by npp members who were fired from municipal jobs after the pdp won the mayoral election in gurabo,cir claims by npp members who were fired from municipal jobs after the pdp assumed power following the mayoral election in adjuntas,cir claims by six pdp members who were fired after the npp won the general election kauffman,cir claims by ten npp members who were fired after the pdp won the general election.the practice is so pervasive that jury awards in cases of political discrimination threaten to bankrupt local governments in puerto rico.see,cir verdict exceeded town budget.and yet the culture of political discrimination continues.
the most recent series of political discrimination cases to reach this court arose out of the general elections,in which the pdp prevailed over the npp at the commonwealth level.as a result of the elections,defendant puerto rico government development bank the bank came under the control of the pdp,and the bank npp board members were replaced with pdp board members.defendant maria fuentes was appointed the new president of the bank and,according to plaintiffs,defendant ada diaz constructively functioned as the new director of human resources of the bank.
under puerto rico law,there is a period of time,called the electoral moratorium period veda electoral,during which no movement s of personnel are to take place absent emergencies.see laws ann.the moratorium period comprises the two months preceding and the two months following a general election id.the law was enacted f or the purpose of guaranteeing the faithful application of the merit principle in public service during the period before and after elections.id.
in early,the fuentes decided to review all personnel actions taken by the former bank regime between august,one month prior to the beginning of the electoral moratorium and the elections in november.for purposes of this opinion,we will simply refer to that period as the review period.fuentes hired an outside consulting firm called applied management consulting,to perform the review,and a consultant named ana bonet conducted the audit.a total of personnel actions had taken place during the review period,and bonet audit determined that all were in violation of the bank personnel regulations.
the outside audit revealed that the positions of director of human resources and director of information systems,both formerly designated as positions,political appointees,had been converted to career positions in violation of the bank personnel regulations.those conversions affected the employment status of plaintiffs hector santiago and eric boneta,who held those respective positions at the time of the conversions.under the bank personnel regulations,the conversion of a position from to career can not happen unless there is either a structural reorganization of the bank or a significant change in the functions of the position being converted.according to applied management audit report,neither prerequisite was satisfied in this case.
the report also concluded that santiago conversion was invalid for additional reasons.first,because santiago held the position at the time the conversion occurred,it was valid under the regulations only if he had already occupied the position for six months before the date of the change.but santiago had only occupied the position for five months.second,the announcement of the position was deficient under the regulations because it listed the position as requiring a master degree when in fact the position actually called for either a master or a bachelor degree.as a result of that deficiency in the announcement,the conversion was invalid.and because santiago had never held a career position at the bank,the determination that the conversion was invalid returned him to a position from which he could be,and was,terminated by defendants.
the report concluded that boneta conversion,too,was invalid for an additional reason.under the regulations,a conversion may only occur if the incumbent meets the education criteria for the position.when boneta position was converted to a career position,he had not yet obtained a bachelor degree,which was a requirement for holding the position.boneta,who had held a career position at the bank before becoming director of information systems,was reinstated to that prior career position once the conversion was determined to be invalid.at trial,defendants said that they removed both santiago and boneta from their jobs because of the illegality of their appointments.
plaintiffs countered that the conversions were not illegal.they claimed that the outgoing administration had commissioned an outside study on the bank classification and compensation structure and that the bank board of directors had approved the conversions in accordance with the findings of that study in may.plaintiffs said that both santiago and boneta had vacated their positions following the conversions,in accordance with the bank regulations,and then had applied for and had been awarded the respective reclassified positions.according to plaintiffs,the specific requirements cited by six month occupancy requirement and the educational applied to conversions affecting incumbents and thus did not apply to either santiago or boneta because they had both vacated their positions.
the applied management report commissioned by defendants concluded that the other employees were either unlawfully appointed to career positions or excessively compensated in career positions lawfully held.
among those employees was plaintiff alicia sanchez,who held the position of administrative assistant.according to the report,her appointment was in violation of the bank regulations because the public announcement for the position had only been posted for eight days,rather than for ten days as required.the length of the posting had been shortened in order to make sure that the position was filled before the electoral moratorium took effect.sanchez had not previously held a career position at the bank to which she could be reinstated,so she was fired by the fuentes regime.
at trial,plaintiffs maintained that there was no illegality in the appointment.they said that there was an urgent need to fill the administrative assistant position prior to the electoral moratorium and that the bank president approved the shortened posting period as an emergency exception,in compliance with the regulations.
the applied management audit revealed that plaintiff nelly colon was granted a salary that exceeded by almost fifty percent the lawful maximum compensation for her position.following the audit,the bank corrected her salary to reflect the maximum compensation allowed for her position.
plaintiffs argued that colon salary was justified by an exception in the regulations that allows for a higher salary to be paid where the employee was already receiving a higher salary or possesses qualifications exceeding those required,or where the position is difficult to fill.
the audit determined that plaintiff elmer sauri occupied a position in january and that,in december,he had exercised his right to be reinstated to his prior career position as allowed by puerto rico law.however,instead of being reinstated to his prior career position,sauri was assigned to a higher position with higher compensation.as a result,the reinstatement effectively amounted to a promotion,and because it was done during the electoral moratorium,it was null and void under puerto rico law.consequently,defendants reinstated sauri to the position to which he was entitled under the regulation,and his salary was reduced accordingly.unhappy with his new position,sauri subsequently resigned.
plaintiffs argued at trial that under the regulations,sauri had a right to be reinstated to a position similar or equal to his last career position.they contended that the position to which he was originally reinstated was indeed similar to his previous career position,but the position to which he was reinstated by the fuentes regime was not similar.
at the time of the audit,the bank had just over employees,of whom about were npp members and about were pdp members.there is no evidence that the review process undertaken by defendants and their outside consultant itself was applied differentially or in a discriminatory manner all personnel actions taken during the review period were audited and corrective action was taken as to all employees affected.
of the employees as to whom corrective action was taken,the five described above now claim that the corrective actions that followed the audit were taken against them due to impermissible political discrimination.the defendants rejoinder is that this case is an instance of reverse political discrimination where the losing party,the npp,attempted to embed permanently its employees in public jobs by making appointments and reclassifying positions in violation of local law.defendants say that they took the corrective actions simply because the personnel actions taken during the review period were illegal they claim that they would have taken the same actions based on such illegality regardless of the party affiliation of the employees affected.they say they were trying to reinforce,not defeat,the merit system.defendants also argue that two of the plaintiffs,santiago and boneta,do not even have first amendment claims because they only held positions,for which political affiliation is an appropriate requirement,and the attempts to convert their positions to career positions were null and void.
the five employees and one of their spouses brought suit in federal court under,asserting both due process claims and first amendment political discrimination claims.the suit was brought against the bank,as well as against fuentes and diaz in both their official and individual capacities.the suit against the two individuals in their official capacities is in reality a suit against the bank,cir.fuentes and diaz in their individual capacities were represented by separate counsel.
the district court dismissed all of plaintiffs due process claims on summary judgment.the court held that even if plaintiffs did have a property interest in their jobs and thus could satisfy the first prong of the due process test,they nevertheless had not shown that adequate remedies were unavailable to them and thus could not satisfy the second prong of the due process test.
as to the first amendment claims,the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment on the ground that defendants evidence did not compel the conclusion that political discrimination was not the but for cause of the personnel actions.agrait,cir.
defendants argue to us,quite erroneously,that the district court necessarily must have found that the personnel actions taken during the review period were null and void under local law in order to enter judgment on the due process claims.but the district court was clear that it considered there to be a material dispute of fact as to whether the appointments were null and void under puerto rico law and that it need not resolve that dispute in order to rule on the summary judgment motion.plaintiffs have not the dismissal of their due process claims.
defendant fuentes,the president of the bank,also filed a motion for summary judgment,claiming that she was entitled to qualified immunity.inexplicably,the motion did not include defendant diaz.the district court denied the motion,finding that there were several disputed issues of fact.
this left the first amendment claims to be tried to a jury.at the trial,which lasted seven days,defendants position was that the personnel actions taken during the review period were null and void under local law and that this had two consequences first,it meant that there was insufficient evidence that political discrimination was a contributing cause to the corrective actions taken by the new regime,and second,it meant that even if political discrimination were a motivating factor,defendants would have authorized the audit in any event and uniformly corrected the irregular appointments under puerto rico law.the second argument is the healthy defense.at.
at the close of the evidence,fuentes moved to renew her claim for qualified immunity,which was again denied the case was submitted to the jury,which returned a verdict against defendants on march.the jury awarded compensatory damages to plaintiffs as follows to santiago,to sauri,to colon,to boneta,to sanchez,and to ivelisse velez de santiago santiago wife.the jury also assessed punitive damages against fuentes in the amount of for each a total of and against diaz in the amount of for each a total of.
the court required plaintiffs to indicate by march,which of them would seek injunctive relief,reinstatement.on march,defendants moved to be heard fully on reinstatement,pointing out that they needed to know who was seeking reinstatement and on what grounds.on tuesday,march,the plaintiffs filed their motion for reinstatement,but their motion was not received by defendants until march,a saturday.on tuesday,april,defendants filed their opposition to reinstatement.it was too late on monday,march,the district court,without hearing from defendants,had issued the judgment,which included an order allowing the reinstatement of all five.
defendants moved on april to alter or amend the judgment to deny reinstatement,arguing that they had not been heard on that issue.on may,the court denied the motion without comment.also on may,the court denied defendants motion for a new trial and motion for judgment as a matter of law.
the bank,together with fuentes and diaz in their official capacities,appeals from the jury verdict and also challenges the reinstatement of three of the plaintiffs santiago,boneta,and sauri.fuentes and diaz in their individual capacities appeal from the denial of qualified immunity.
before addressing defendants specific claims on appeal,we describe the healthy defense.
a.the healthy defense 
although healthy was a freedom of speech case,it is routinely applied to political discrimination cases of the variety.guillermo rodriguez,cir.in the aftermath of healthy,confusion still sometimes arises about the issue of causation.
on top of several subsidiary layers of causation,there is an ultimate constitutional question of but for causation.see givhan line consol.sch,d referring to but for causation aponte,cir.as the supreme court clarified in britton,d,
a t least with certain types of claims,proof of an improper motive is not sufficient to establish a constitutional must also be evidence of causation.accordingly,when a public employee shows that protected conduct was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision,the employer still prevails by showing that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of the protected conduct.
id.at.emphasis added.thus,even if a plaintiff meets his or her initial burden of showing that political affiliation was a motivating factor for an employment decision,that is insufficient to establish discrimination as a matter of law because the plaintiff case at that point does not distinguish between a result caused by a constitutional violation and one not so caused.healthy,at.as the supreme court noted,to adopt a view of causation that focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part in an employment view that plaintiffs argued put an employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied otherwise.id.at.
to give an example,a plaintiff political affiliation may have been an employer motivating reason for terminating the plaintiff.nevertheless,the employer may still defeat liability for that termination by meeting its dual burden under proving,for example,that the plaintiff had been caught stealing from the employer and that the employer fires every employee who steals from it.carrying that line of argument to this case,defendants here were entitled to defeat liability by showing that plaintiffs positions were obtained in violation of puerto rico law and that,even if political animus was a factor,defendants would have taken corrective action anyway against every employee whose position was obtained in violation of law if there is no dispute that the positions were obtained in violation of puerto rico law,then the only question left is whether defendants would have fired all employees holding such positions in any event.if defendants demonstrated that they in fact have a practice of taking corrective action against all employees in such positions,or could otherwise show that they would have taken the corrective action anyway,then they were entitled to prevail.
there are obvious difficulties with this model,which the supreme court may one day address.the first is that when an employer asserts a healthy defense in a political discrimination case,the trier of fact absent a prior determination under state law essentially becomes a kind of board making determinations about whether particular personnel actions violated state or local personnel laws.there is no evidence here that plaintiffs,if they had any administrative appeal rights under puerto rico law,ever exercised them,though each of the employee plaintiffs received a hearing.it would be different if this were a case in which a duly authorized agency determination had been made of the legality of the personnel actions under local law.the second difficulty concerns whether the supreme court would in the end,once the illegality of the personnel action to be corrected had been established under local law,require an employer who had shown a consistently applied practice of remedying all such illegal appointments to show anything more.
defendants argue that the law has recently shifted in their favor.they lean heavily on the supreme court decision in texas lesage,d,which they argue requires only that they show that plaintiffs appointments were in violation of law.they view lesage as excusing them from meeting their burden under healthy of showing that they would have acted to remove plaintiffs based on the illegality of their appointments in any event.
lesage is important,but it does not carry defendants as far as they would have it take them.lesage involved a challenge to a university affirmative action policy by an applicant for admission who,it was undisputed,would not have met the university admission criteria even if the university had not applied its challenged affirmative action criteria.at.the court held that the applicant alleged no cognizable injury.id.at.lesage has been most commonly applied in similar applicant situations and is sometimes interpreted as holding that an applicant lacks article iii standing to sue for damages if she can not show that she would have benefitted in the absence of the challenged government conduct.see cotter city of boston,cir donahue city of boston,cir.
importantly,in lesage it was undisputed that the plaintiff did not otherwise meet the admission criteria.see lesage,at.in cases such as this one,by contrast,plaintiffs frequently dispute whether there were any irregularities in their appointments and,even if there were,whether those irregularities would have led to their removal were it not for the employer alleged bad motive.defendants argument is that lesage has sub silentio overruled the second prong of healthy.we think not.the supreme court was explicit about the limits of its holding in lesage simply put,where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless,there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under.id.at emphasis added 
our cases have often presented situations in which defendants have not uniformly applied a neutral basis,such as illegality of appointment,for taking employment actions,but rather have taken action against members of the opposing party but not against similarly situated members of defendants own party.see,cir discriminatory application of an otherwise lawful layoff plan.by contrast,we have also affirmed entry of summary judgment for defendants in situations where plaintiffs had no evidence of differential treatment in the personnel actions taken against those who were illegally appointed.see,kauffman,at.and we have allowed for a possible claim of discrimination where,in the guise of restructuring,defendants eliminated only one job,but not others,at.those holdings are consistent with the notion that simply showing that an appointment was illegal under local law does not suffice to meet defendants healthy burden.
jury instruction and jury form issues 
two of defendants arguments on appeal involve the district court refusal to give certain jury instructions.our examination of jury instructions focuses on whether they adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on controlling issues.federico order of saint benedict,cir brown trs.of boston,cir.a properly preserved objection to the failure to give a requested jury instruction is reviewed de novo,gray genlyte group,cir,and such a refusal constitutes reversible error only if it was prejudicial in light of the entire record,tum barber foods,cir see also sheek asia badger,cir.a court choice of language in jury instructions,by comparison,is reviewed only for abuse of discretion.gray,at.
kauffman instruction 
defendants initial argument is that the district court erred in refusing to give their requested instruction based on kauffman puerto rico telephone,cir.kauffman was a case alleging political terminations in violation of both the first amendment and due process rights.here,defendants requested an instruction under kauffman to the effect that a public employee expectations of permanent employment as a result of holding a position for a period of time have no bearing on the illegality of his or her appointment and thus that an appointment made in violation of the regulations is necessarily null and void.the record reflects the following exchange 
counsel for defendants your honor,in the case of puerto rico telephone,and i argued it is clear that an employee ignores the fact that his employment might be null and void,that does go to the issue of nullity,and neither having occupied the position for some time period.it is an expectation to be kept in the position.
the court i think that the principles that i instructed the jury on are consistent with the case that is tried.
while the language referenced in the proposed instruction derives from the due process section of analysis in kauffman,at u nder puerto rico law any property right associated with a career position is rendered null and void if a violation of the personnel act attends the filling of such a position,portions of it are also applicable to a first amendment healthy defense.
the defense was entitled to an instruction that illegality of appointment was a neutral reason for corrective action,whatever the employee subjective expectation.but the requested instruction went beyond that to suggest that a mere showing of illegality of appointment sufficed to meet their defense.defendants overreached.
position instruction 
defendants equate the term trust position puesto de confianza with position and use the term to signify a position for which political affiliation is an appropriate requirement.for purposes of this opinion,we refer to such a position as a position.a new government in power can replace employees in such positions without violating the first amendment.see branti,at.
one of the bank defenses was that two of the plaintiffs had been in such positions until the former administration changed those positions to career positions puesto de carrera in violation of local law.defendants argued that because the change had been illegal,the two plaintiffs affected santiago and boneta should have been considered as holding only such positions,from which they could be removed without any first amendment issue.
defendants introduced evidence to this effect and requested a jury instruction that a first amendment claim is not stated as to positions for which political affiliation is an appropriate requirement.the requested instruction was rejected,and defendants properly preserved their objection.see.connelly hyundai motor,cir.in rejecting the instruction as irrelevant,the district court said 
those positions were career positions.whether it was advisable or wise to convert them is a different story,but they were converted to career.
when you took the adverse employment action,they were career positions,and we have to start from that.
this reasoning was error in light of defendants healthy defense.the theory of defendants case was that these formerly positions had been illegally converted into career positions,that the illegality of the conversions,in turn,meant that the positions remained only positions,and thus that no violation of the first amendment had occurred.
we consider the question of prejudice in light of defendants claims of cumulative error.
deficient jury form 
despite the fact that defendants asserted a healthy defense and the court provided an instruction on that defense,the jury verdict form did not reflect the law under healthy.instead,the form asked only the following questions as to liability with respect to each plaintiff 
do you find from a preponderance of the evidence 
that the plaintiff engaged in political activity,a form of free speech,as defined in this court instructions 
that such protected political activity by the plaintiff was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants decision to politically discriminate against the plaintiff 
that the defendants acts were the proximate or legal cause of damages sustained by plaintiff 
as to fuentes and diaz,t hat the defendants acted with malice or with reckless indifference to the plaintiff rights 
standard of review 
a verdict form must be reasonably capable of an interpretation that would allow the jury to address all factual issues essential to the judgment.sheek,at internal quotation marks omitted.to determine whether the issues were fairly presented to the jury,we examine the court instructions and the wording of the verdict form as a whole.johnson teamsters local,cir.we review the court instructions de novo,unless the objection to the instructions was not preserved,in which case our review is for plain error only.gray,at see reynolds green,cir.
there is a threshold issue of whether defendants waived their objection to the jury form.defense counsel represented to us at oral argument that he saw the verdict form for the first time when it was read and explained to the jurors at the end of the charge.plaintiffs do not dispute that defendants immediately objected to the form on the ground that it did not include a question about the healthy whether defendants would have taken the challenged personnel actions anyway because the appointments violated puerto rico law.the district court rejected defendants objection and stated that the instructions on the affirmative defense had been repeated at least three times in the charge and that those instructions were very clear.the court also stated that the second question on the jury form addressed defendants concern because it required a finding that plaintiffs political activity was a substantial or motivating factor.for reasons described earlier,this explanation was insufficient.
where a healthy defense has been presented we suggest that,to the extent it may not be a common practice,district courts use a verdict form that has at least one question explicitly addressed to that defense.we also suggest that proposed verdict forms always be shared with counsel and discussed together with the proposed jury instructions before the jury charge and explanation of the verdict form in open court.here,the deficiency in the form could have been avoided altogether had the district court followed these suggested procedures.
defendants had an opportunity to provide a draft jury form to the district court,which they did not take.they also had the opportunity to request that the district court provide them with a copy of the form in advance of its explanation to the jury again,they did not request it.by the same token and taking defendants representation as accurate,it would have been better practice for the district court to review the form with counsel before explaining it to the jurors 
when the district court told defense counsel that it was disinclined to substitute a new form or question,defendants could and should have requested supplemental jury instructions addressed to any possible jury confusion.for example,defendants could have requested that the jury be instructed that even if it found that political discrimination was a motivating factor,it could not on that basis alone award damages without first addressing the healthy defense.the jury could have been instructed that if it found that the corrective actions would have been taken against plaintiffs in any event,then under healthy,it could not go on to damages.defendants did not request any such instructions.it is reasonable to infer,however,from the colloquy between court and counsel in the record,that the district court would have rejected such a request.
in light of the peculiar circumstances giving rise to the deficiency in the form,this case does not fit neatly into the usual doctrine of waiver.so we proceed to ask,on this record,whether there was a realistic prospect of jury confusion on the healthy issue.
analysis of potential confusion caused by the form 
in response to defense counsel protestation about the jury form,the court stated,erroneously in our view,that to answer the second verdict form question yes,the jury would need to have rejected the healthy defense.we repeat the court instructions on the second verdict form question 
second,do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that such protected political activity by the plaintiff was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendants decision to politically discriminate against the plaintiff 
for the reasons that follow,we agree with defendants that the form was not adequate and that it had the potential to mislead the jury.
we start with this observation defendants argument was far from frivolous.defendants were able to point to specific alleged violations of bank regulations for the personnel actions taken during the review period as to each of the employee plaintiffs.but it is also true that some of the alleged violations could have been seen by the jury as involving technical niceties that might normally have been overlooked.yet other alleged violations were clearly more example,the conversions of the two positions from status to career status when,allegedly,there was neither a change in the nature of the positions nor in the bank structure that would have justified the conversions.
the theme of plaintiffs opening statement was that the real motivation for the personnel actions that were taken against the employee plaintiffs was that they were npp members and that defendants stated reasons for the actions were untrue and trivial.
the theme of the opening statement for the bank and the two individuals in their official capacities was that they had followed the rules and regulations of puerto rico law without exception and that the personnel actions that the former npp regime had taken as to each of the plaintiffs were unlawful.the theme of the opening statement for fuentes and diaz in their individual capacities was that plaintiffs were dismissed or changed from their positions because they were illegally appointed to those positions,and they did not comply with the law.indeed,the argument was that it was plaintiffs party,the npp,that had no one from the pdp party had been assigned to any positions by the prior administration during the moratorium period.but if a pdp party member had been unlawfully appointed during the review period,the defense argued,then the new administration would have taken corrective action against that person due to the violation of puerto rico law.
in his closing argument,plaintiffs counsel told the jury that they would be instructed by the court that even if plaintiffs 
had been wrongly appointed and wrongly transferred,if it was motivated by politics,you have to find for plaintiffs.in other words,it would even matter if,as they claimed,these plaintiffs had been fired because the prior appointment had been wrong.even if that was so,if you decide that politics was a motivating factor,you must find for plaintiffs.
as that portion of the closing demonstrates,plaintiffs case was tried on a theory of causation directly in conflict with healthy.their theory was that even if defendants would have taken the disputed actions anyway because the plaintiffs appointments violated puerto rico law,that fact was irrelevant if political discrimination was a motivating factor in the decision.this argument fundamentally misunderstands healthy 
the court correctly instructed the jury that plaintiffs first had to show that their protected political activity was a substantial or motivating factor for the disputed personnel actions.the court also instructed the jury that the burden then shifted to defendants to show that they would have made the same decisions based on some other reason standing alone and in the absence of political discrimination.this second instruction was at odds with the jury form,which did not provide any question addressed to whether defendants had carried their burden.and although not technically incorrect by itself,that second instruction became susceptible to an incorrect interpretation by the jury when considered in conjunction with the jury form.
because there was no question on the jury form about whether defendants had carried their two part burden under healthy,the jurors might have thought that if they answered the first two question on the form yes,that there was protected political activity and that it was a substantial or motivating factor in defendants those findings alone could or even must lead to an affirmative finding on question defendants acts were the proximate or legal cause of damages sustained by plaintiff and thus that the affirmative defense was irrelevant.that understanding of the form was consistent with a plausible,though incorrect,interpretation of the court instruction that defendants had to show that they would have taken the same actions in the absence of political discrimination.considered in conjunction with the absence of guidance about the healthy defense on the jury form,it becomes apparent that the jurors could have understood that language as suggesting that defendants had to prove that there was an absence of political discrimination before they could take advantage of the affirmative defense and show that they would have acted the same way for a different reason.
the possibility that the jurors might have misinterpreted the instructions in this way is bolstered by the fact that plaintiffs counsel himself misunderstood the law in precisely that way and characterized it as such in his closing argument.plaintiffs counsel erroneously told the jury that it would even matter if,as defendants claimed,these plaintiffs had been fired,because the prior appointment had been wrong.even if this was so,if you find that politics was a motivating factor,you must find for plaintiffs.
had the court instruction been accompanied by a separate healthy question on the jury form,the potential confusion most likely would have been avoided.but the court reje
