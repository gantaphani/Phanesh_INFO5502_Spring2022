we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see young county of fulton,cir.in so doing,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the state as the party,and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
green mountain is a rail carrier as defined by the termination act,with miles of track between rutland,vermont and cold river,new hampshire.the line serves transhipping industries,industries that rely on trucks to transport goods from the rail site for processing elsewhere.along its rail line in rockingham,vermont,green mountain owns a tract known as riverside,bounded by the connecticut river on the east.portions of riverside are wetlands unusable for development.
green mountain proposed to build facilities at riverside to serve the following operations unloading bulk salt arriving by rail for local distribution by truck or for temporary storage in a shed pending distribution temporary storage and transport of goods,such as steel pipe s and unloading bulk cement arriving by rail for storage in silos and eventual transport by truck.some of these operations are conducted within a strip alongside the green mountain tracks and the connecticut river.
vermont argues that construction of the transloading facilities is subject to act,an environmental land use statute that mandates preconstruction permits for land development.permit applications are filed with one of nine district commissions that evaluate environmental impact using ten criteria,including undue water or air pollution.stat.ann.tit,a,and undue adverse effect on the scenic or natural beauty of the area,aesthetics,historic sites or rare and irreplaceable natural areas.stat.ann.tit,a.the district commission decisions are appealable to vermont environmental board decisions of the environmental board are appealable directly to the vermont supreme court.stat.ann.tit,a b.most permit decisions under act are issued within days from the filing of an application 
in,pmi lumber leased part of riverside and applied for an act construction permit.pmi lumber proposed to satisfy environmental criteria by a buffer zone along the river.the vermont agency of natural resources recommended that the buffer be increased to feet.
a local permitting agency subsequently issued land use permit the permit in the names of pmi lumber and green mountain.condition required maintenance of a buffer zone.when pmi lumber ceased operations at the site,green mountain used it for its transloading activities.green mountain encroached on the buffer zone with a settling pond,storage of materials,and vehicles.
in spring,green mountain sought to amend the permit to allow construction of a by salt storage shed.in january,the state granted land use permit the permit,which stipulated conditions,including that the shed be rectangular,and either brown or dark green.several months later,in october,green mountain applied for another permit amendment the permit application to modify the size,color and location of the salt shed.although no such permit issued,green mountain started construction of its modified salt shed in november.
in january,the state issued a notice of violation of the permit,citing among other things storage of materials within the buffer zone.the state issued a second notice of violation in february,alleging construction of the salt shed without the permit.
in spring,the state conducted hearings on green mountain salt shed permit application.green mountain objected orally and in writing that the state environmental commission lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the pending permit application because the termination act,which expressly preempts remedies provided under federal or state law and vests with the transportation board,a federal agency,exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers,preempts act.
faced with the threatened enforcement of act,green mountain filed this suit in june,seeking a declaration that the termination act preempts act.simultaneously,green mountain requested a declaratory order to the same effect from the transportation board.
the transportation board denied the declaratory relief in may,deferring to the district court.in the meantime,the state moved to dismiss the district court action.while that motion was pending,the state issued the permit in august.a month later,the district court granted the state motion to dismiss green mountain facial challenge to the applicability of act,but ordered further development of the record to determine whether the state effort to enforce one or more conditions of the permit violates the termination act in this particular case.green mountain,dist.lexis,at quoting an earlier ruling internal quotation marks omitted.
following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.on december,the court granted green mountain motion and denied the state motion on the ground that the state efforts to enforce act in this case are preempted under the termination act.id.
the question presented is whether the termination act preempts vermont act with respect to the underlying permit controversy.state law is preempted by federal law when the preemptive intent is explicitly stated in a federal statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose state law actually conflicts with federal law or federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.cipollone liggett group,d quoting jones rath packing,d,and fidelity fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.the ultimate of preemption analysis is congressional intent congress intent,of course,primarily is discerned from the language of the statute and the statutory framework surrounding it.medtronic,lohr,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the termination act contains an express preemption clause 
except as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.
b.the termination act section vests the transportation board with exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers and the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks,or facilities,even if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state.b.transportation is expansively defined to include a locomotive,car,vehicle,vessel,warehouse yard,property,facility,instrumentality,or equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property,or both,by rail.certainly,the plain language grants the transportation board wide authority over the transloading and storage facilities undertaken by green mountain.see city of auburn united states,cir see also ventures,stb,cir i f a railroad line falls within its jurisdiction,the transportation board authority over abandonment is both exclusive and plenary.
other federal courts recognize that the termination act preempts mo
