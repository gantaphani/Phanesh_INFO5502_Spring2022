plaintiff meena chandok,appeals from so much of a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,joseph hood,judge,as dismissed her amended complaint amended complaint or complaint against defendant daniel klessig,seeking damages for allegedly defamatory statements by klessig impugning the accuracy veracity of chandok reports of the results of her biochemical research.in chandok klessig,d chandok,the district court granted klessig motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that chandok was a public figure and that she failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that klessig had acted with malice,defined as knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.klessig from so much of the judgment as dismissed his counterclaim alleging that chandok bringing of this suit violated new york statute against strategic lawsuits against public participation slapp,see civ.rights law,mckinney.the district court granted chandok motion for summary judgment dismissing the counterclaim on the ground that the statute did not apply to the facts of this case.
on appeal,chandok contends principally that the district court erred in ruling that she was a public figure and had not adduced clear and convincing evidence of malice.klessig,in support of his,contends that the district court erred in interpreting the statute.we affirm the dismissal of the counterclaim substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.we also affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint,but we choose to do so on grounds that are different from those adopted by the district court.we conclude that under new york law,which governs the issues in this diversity action,klessig statements were within the scope of the conditional privileges for statements on matters as to which the speaker has a legal or moral obligation to speak or for statements among communicants who share a common interest,and that chandok did not adduce evidence of fault sufficient to overcome those privileges by a preponderance of the evidence.
background 
the following description,of events as to which there is no genuine dispute,is taken largely from chandok assertions in her court papers,including her response to defendant statement of material facts on klessig motion for summary judgment dismissing her complaint.as to klessig motion,we view the record in the light most favorable to chandok and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.
a.the nos project and the allegedly defamatory statements 
klessig was a senior scientist at,and until may the president of,the boyce thompson institute for plant research bti,an affiliate of cornell university in ithaca,new york.beginning in the late,a research team directed by klessig was focusing on immune response mechanisms in plants and,in particular,on plants production of nitric oxide or no to offset attacks by pathogens.no plays a key role in fighting plant disease.
in the latter part of,bti hired chandok,a citizen of india,to be a postdoctoral research associate in klessig laboratory.she worked on a project whose goal was to find and purify a nitric oxide synthase nos,an enzyme that catalyzes the production of nitric oxide.chandok contends that from late august on,klessig made statements that falsely impugned the accuracy or veracity of her research on the nos project.
chandok reported results and the efforts to replicate them 
on october,chandok sent klessig data indicating that she had identified and isolated the protein responsible for catalyzing activity,dubbed variant p or varp,by biochemical means that she had introduced the cloned nos gene into coli and baculovirus and that she had performed in vitro experiments that confirmed her findings.she reported that the recombinant protein,the protein resulting from her genetic engineering and recombination had nos activity,a result that would have constituted a significant breakthrough in the field of plant research amended complaint.
chandok reported results were widely publicized within the community.they were described in an article coauthored by chandok,klessig,and jimmy ytterberg and klaas van wijk of the cornell department of plant biology,published in may in the academic journal cell.a article based on the same research,coauthored by chandok,klessig,bti scientist sophia ekengren,and gregory martin of bti and the cornell department of plant pathology,appeared in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas in may.
prior to chandok report of her discoveries,klessig had twice applied to the national institutes of health nih for grants to fund nos research.neither application was granted.after chandok october report of her findings to klessig,a revised application,cowritten by klessig and chandok,was submitted to nih on october.the materials presented in the new application consisted almost entirely of chandok reported data.in,klessig laboratory received a grant of more than million from nih to fund further nos research.
in late march,asserts that her working relationship with klessig by then had deteriorated because of his demeaning behavior toward her see chandok brief on appeal at amended complaint submitted her resignation from bti and shortly moved to maryland.thereafter,none of the other scientists in klessig laboratory were able to replicate the results that chandok had reported and that were described in the cell and pnas articles.in the following months,klessig called chandok several times to ask her to return to ithaca to help replicate her nos experiments.chandok declined.
klessig also tried many times during that period,without success,to reach chandok by telephone and to discuss the research.in june,bti human resources director lucy pola sent an to chandok that stated,in part,as follows 
i know that dan has been trying to reach you about replicating some of the work you have done i apologize for not being able to tell you exactly what part.i do know that he is asking if you could come help the postdocs in the lab with the procedure as they are unable to replicate.he understands how tricky this procedure was and feels that with your assistance they would be able to do it.he has indicated that he would pay your travel,lodging if you would be willing to come out and help.
meena,i know your relationship with dan is strained and that this may seem like a request that you are uncomfortable with.i also know that you are an excellent scientist and that you understand the importance of being able to replicate results.please let me know your thoughts on this.
chandok responded that she agree d that it is important to reproduce results,but stated that 
u nfortunately,my current commitments are keeping me extremely busy.however,if the situation changes at a future point in time,i shall contact you.
after days with no further word from chandok,klessig sent her a letter dated june,by,fax,and registered mail.the letter stated that,although klessig continued to believe chandok did purify an no synthase protein and that protein is varp p or at least that varp is part of the inos,inducible nos activity,it was,as he had told her repeatedly,critical that other scientists within,as well as outside of,our group be able to reproduce your results on the plant inos independently,but that none of bti scientists had been able to do so.
klessig june letter asked chandok to return to ithaca,at bti expense,to assist in the reproduction of her results by,estimat ing that it should take no longer than a week or two to do these experiments and resolve the matter.klessig stated that in return for chandok cooperation in assisting in verification of her reported results,he would provide her with strong recommendations for future job applications.he added,inter alia,that 
i f you fail to respond to this letter in a timely manner,you will leave me with little choice but to assume your results are unverifiable and therefore will force me to take the following actions 
i will retract both the cell and pnas papers.
i will have to contact the ins and retract my april,letter of support for your permanent residency application.
i will also have to inform the president of bti and the government agencies which supported your work nsf and nih.a formal inquiry,overseen by nsf and nih,will ensue.
chandok response came in the form of a june,letter from her attorney,addressed to the chairman of bti board of directors.the letter stated that chandok would not,under any circumstances,again work with or for klessig and characterized klessig efforts to contact chandok as a campaign of harassment that chandok stood by her research and findings and would welcome any legitimate inquiry and that if klessig made the disclosures threatened in his letter,chandok would consider those statements defamatory and would sue.
chandok did not return to ithaca.throughout the spring and summer of,the scientists working in klessig laboratory tried in vain to replicate the results that had been reported by chandok.on july,klessig received an from one of his researchers who,after describing various problems encountered in attempts to use chandok methods and verify her results,concluded as follows all of our findings are contradictory to what meena recorded in the lab notebook,the patent document,and her cell and pnas papers.i do not think that her experiment data are reliable.
allegedly defamatory statements by klessig 
in early august,klessig discussed chandok possible scientific misconduct with bti president,david stern,who began an inquiry.on august,klessig,stern,pola,and martin,one of the coauthors of the pnas article,met to discuss the chandok matter.stern decided to appoint an investigative committee,in accordance with bti policy on scientific misconduct,and to consider whether and when to retract the cell and pnas papers.it was decided that klessig would notify nih and the national science foundation nsf of the investigation and that stern would notify the department of health and human services office of research integrity ori.because some of chandok research had been funded by a federal grant,and her findings were the basis of a subsequent federal grant application,stern sent ori a letter dated august,that began as follows 
as required by d,i report the result of an inquiry into possible scientific misconduct on the part of a postdoctoral fellow formerly employed by bti.the research in question was funded in part by the and some of the data in question were furnished as part of a grant proposal which resulted in the award.my determination is that there is sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation 
the letter proceeded to summarize that evidence,which included stern interviews with bti scientists who had tried and failed to replicate chandok results and the fact that chandok did not readily provide them with key experimental materials.
klessig sent letters dated august,to nih and nsf officials stating that for several months his postdoctoral researchers had been attempting to reproduce the nos results reported by chandok and had been unsuccessful.each letter stated that the recent evidence strongly suggests that she falsified some of her data.
from late august through,klessig prepared and sent to stern,pola,chandok coauthors of the cell and pnas articles drafts of statements to retract those articles.the drafts stated,with slight variations in wording,that members of the klessig laboratory conducting further experiments had been unable to replicate the results reported in the cell paper and that that inability suggested that the data on recombinant variant p may have been fabricated by the lead author.the retraction that was eventually s ent to pnas on by klessig,martin,and ekengren read,in part,as follows 
since publication of th e cell paper,other members of the klessig laboratory have been unable to repeat the results with recombinant variant p.in addition,other discrepancies have come to light that suggest data on the recombinant variant p presented in the cell paper may have been fabricated by the cell paper is being retracted.
for this reason and the fact that we are no longer confident in much of the data in this paper,we hereby retract chandok et.chandok does not concur with this retraction the experiments that produced these data were performed by chandok and are now suspect we deeply regret this incident and sincerely apologize to our colleagues.
a september,from one pnas editor to another,stating that klessig had contacted pnas about the retractions of the cell and pnas articles,said that i t appears the first author,a former post doc in klessig lab,fabricated the data and spiked the samples to indicate inos activity.as this appears to reflect a communication by klessig,chandok imputes the charge of fabricat ion to klessig the imputed statement.
on october,at a conference in madrid,spain,on plant disease,attended by many of the leaders in the study of plant pathology,klessig announced the impending publication of the retractions.his notes in preparation for the conference indicate that he discussed chandok work,in part,as follows 
since publication of this work in cell in several new postdocs have joined our group to study varp or the nos.to date they have not been able to repeat the results with the recombinant variant p that were reported.in addition,other discrepancies have very recently come to light that strongly suggest that the data on the recombinant variant p is sic unreliable.
shortly after the madrid conference,klessig sent to fellow scientists who were interested in nos research and had made contributions to klessig research,informing them that at the conference he had announced the retractions of the cell and pnas articles in light of his researchers inability to replicate or confirm chandok reported nos results.
a november,article in science magazine reported that the cell and pnas articles had been retracted.it quoted klessig as saying that the data reported in those articles were shaky and that it was important that the rest of the scientific community not base their research on this sic unreliable data that we are no longer confident in.
the bti scientific misconduct investigation committee or committee,appointed by stern in september,proceeded to consider,inter alia,a the futile past efforts of klessig researchers to replicate chandok results,b a march,report of a successful effort by abgent,a laboratory that chandok hired to perform experiments using reagents that she furnished,and c unsuccessful new efforts by klessig laboratory to replicate the results reported by abgent.in its final report,issued in june,the committee stated that i t should be noted that the verification by abgent was not completely independent since chandok had supplied the reagents used to perform nos activity assays,and it found the evidence as a whole inconclusive based on the available evidence,the investigating committee found no conclusive evidence of data alteration or fabrication,but also no conclusive evidence that chandok achieved the results reported.the committee was critical of chandok procedures,finding several egregious breaches of commonly accepted scientific practice by chandok,including her failures to maintain records and to archive research results.it stated that t he inability to recover the most important constructs reported in a high profile publication and the inability to reproduce published results,combined with the absence of corroborating detailed research records was judged to be grounds for good faith suspicion of scientific misconduct.
b.the claim,the counterclaim,and the district court rulings 
chandok commenced the present action against klessig in august seeking damages in excess of for defamation,alleging,in a single cause of action,that klessig made numerous false statements as to the accuracy or veracity of her nos research,thereby causing significant damage to her reputation in the scientific community.the complaint alleged that those statements were made out of ill will and spite towards chandok amended complaint and with actual and common law malice id.that they were made i n retaliation for chandok not assisting klessig in continuing his research id.and that a t the time of making these allegations,klessig knew that these statements were untrue recklessly disregarded whether such statements were true id.although the statements of which chandok complained were not set out in the complaint,during discovery she specified statements from august,through january,that she claimed were false and defamatory the statements.these included the statements quoted in part.above,as well as various drafts and preliminary statements sent by klessig to stern and pola,and from klessig to other fellow scientists.see chandok,d at nn.summarizing each of the statements.
klessig,in answer to chandok complaint,denied,inter alia,that he had uttered any false statements or any statements out of spite,ill will,or malice,or with reckless disregard for the truth.see amended answer.he also 
denie d that he uttered any statements that injured plaintiff reputation except a such statements as may have described truthfully and accurately i her research,ii his and bti inability to replicate her test results and to verify the existence of the critical varp expression vectors that plaintiff claimed she had used and iii other aspects of her conduct and performance,and b such other statements as were and are true privileged otherwise.
in addition,klessig asserted a counterclaim seeking damages,including costs and attorneys fees,from chandok for bringing the present action.the counterclaim alleged that within the meaning of the statute,civ.rights law et,chandok participation in obtaining federal funds for the nos project made her a public applicant see id.that klessig had a continuing obligation to ensure that those funds were expended in compliance with federal law and to report suspected misconduct to bti and ori see id.that chandok defamation claim against klessig was materially related to klessig reports and comments on chandok use of federal funds in the nos project see id.that her claim was without a substantial basis see id,given that she had actual knowledge that she had falsified data in connection with the nos project and the results she had claimed to have achieved regarding the claimed nos activity id.and that her defamation claim therefore constitute d a slapp suit in violation of new york civil rights law et.id.
following a period of discovery,klessig moved for summary judgment dismissing chandok defamation claim,arguing,inter alia,that several of the statements of which chandok complained were neither false nor defamatory because they merely expressed opinions,which were incapable of being proven false and were thus protected by the first amendment and unactionable under new york law.he also argued that the statements were part of a public controversy and that chandok could not prevail because she could not establish that klessig made any of the statements with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth that many of the statements were published only to individuals who helped klessig write the documents in which the statements appeared,and publication among coauthors is not actionable under new york law and that any other statements he made were absolutely or qualifiedly privileged.
chandok moved for summary judgment dismissing klessig counterclaim.noting that federal funding was not a prerequisite to nos research,she contended principally that she was not a public applicant within the meaning of the statute.
in chandok,d,the district court granted both sides motions for summary judgment.with respect to chandok complaint,the court stated that 
t o establish a claim of defamation under new york law,a plaintiff must establish that the statement averred was defamatory that the statement was published by the defendant that the statement was communicated to a party who was not the plaintiff and the resultant injury to the plaintiff.
id.at.the court noted,however,that a person individual interest in protecting her reputation must be weighed against society interest in fostering free speech,as reflected in the first amendment,especially in cases involving public figures and public issues.see id.at.thus,it noted that a public figure can not prevail on a defamation claim unless,in addition to the above elements,she establishes with convincing clarity that the statements were false and that the defendant published the statements with actual malice,knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth,id.at.
the district court ruled that chandok is a limited issue public figure in the area of plant biology.id.it noted that there is an international community of plant biologists,see id.at,and that chandok admitted that she was well known within the plant biology community,id.at.the court stated that s cientific articles are inherently subject to robust criticism,and for good reason,id.at,as the free exchange of ideas is indispensable to the progress of scientific research.the court reasoned that chandok,as the lead author of the articles publishing her reports of her findings,had willfully interjected herself into a public controversy by way of creating the very subject of the controversy,id.at,and that klessig constitutional privilege to speak on the matter thus could not be overcome unless chandok proved with convincing clarity that his statements were false and had been made with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.
although the court found that each of the statements that chandok alleged defamed her was reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning,id.at,it concluded after reviewing the record that i t is not a reasonable inference that the reported inability of numerous scientists to duplicate chandok result either was substantially false or that klessig knew that it was false,or certainly that the references to such data were made with reckless disregard for the truth,id.at see also id.at in fact,plaintiff never contends that defendant comments that numerous other scientists were unable to duplicate plaintiff results are false.plaintiff does not appear to take issue with the factual portions of the statements,only with the veracity of defendant conclusions as to the implications of those if numerous other scientists could not replicate the results,the original results must have been fabricated or falsified.the court concluded as a matter of law that chandok could not prove falsity or malice by clear and convincing evidence and that klessig was thus entitled to summary judgment dismissing the complaint.
turning to klessig counterclaim,the district court identified three elements of a claim under the statute 
there must be a public application or petition,the public applicant or permittee of that application must file a lawsuit against a person who is materially related to any efforts of the defendant to report on,comment on,rule on,challenge or oppose such application or permission,and that the lawsuit must be,at a minimum,substantially without merit.
id.at quoting civ.rights law.the court concluded that klessig counterclaim should be dismissed because the first element was not satisfied 
the defining aspect of a public application or petition,is that it is a required government process that must be satisfied to perform some other task.see harfenes sea gate,misc d.receipt of a grant may certainly assist in conducting research,but research can proceed without this specific grant r equests for money,without other restrictions,are not public applications.id.as there is no public application,there can neither be a public applicant nor a commentator to the same.accordingly,there is no cause of action under the slapp statute.
chandok,d at.
this appeal and followed.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.where the undisputed facts reveal that there is an absence of sufficient proof as to one essential element of a claim,any factual disputes with respect to other elements become immaterial and can not defeat a motion for summary judgment.see,celotex catrett,burke jacoby,cir,cert.denied.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the party against which judgment was granted.see,law debenture trust of new york maverick tube,cir konikoff prudential insurance of america,cir konikoff.when both sides have moved for summary judgment,each party motion is examined on its own merits,and all reasonable inferences are drawn against the party whose motion is under consideration.see,law debenture trust of new york maverick tube,at schwabenbauer board of education,cir.
chandok appeal 
chandok contends principally that the district court erred in ruling that she was a public figure and that her report of her research results was a matter of public concern,the premises that led the court to impose on her an unduly demanding standard of proof,the burden of proving actual malice and of doing so by clear and convincing evidence.she also contends that even if those premises were correct,she presented sufficient evidence to create genuine issues to be tried as to klessig knowledge of the truth reckless disregard for the falsity of his statements.for the reasons that follow,we need not reach the questions of whether chandok was a public figure or whether klessig statements concerned a matter of public interest,for we may affirm on any ground for which there is support in the record,see,konikoff,at,and we do so here on a simpler ground.summary judgment dismissing chandok defamation claim was appropriate because whether or not klessig statements constituted speech on an issue of public concern,and whether or not chandok was a public figure with respect to that issue,the statements were within the scope of qualified privileges for communications on a matter as to which klessig had a duty to speak for communications to persons with whom he had a common interest in the subject matter those privileges can not be overcome without a a preponderance of the either actual malice or malice,spite or ill will and chandok did not adduce evidence sufficient to defeat those privileges even under a preponderance standard.
historically,a defendant was held strictly liable for defamation.see generally gertz robert welch,chapadeau utica.under state laws,malice was presumed,implied by the law from an intentional defamatory publication even when the defendant harbored no ill will toward the plaintiff,and honestly believed what he said to be true.prosser,the law of torts,at ed.
beginning with new york times sullivan,the supreme court ruled that the first amendment of the united states constitution limits the reach of state defamation laws insofar as they are applied to speech on matters of public concern.in new york times,the court held that t he constitutional guarantees require that a public official not be allowed to recover damages for a false defamatory statement relating to his official conduct without establishing by clearly convincing proof that the defamatory statement was published with actual malice,which the court defined to mean with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.id.at.see also amant thompson,constitutional privilege not overcome unless statement was published while the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication garrison.louisiana,not overcome unless published with a high degree of awareness of the publication probable falsity.
in curtis publishing butts,the court applied this principle to plaintiffs who were involved in issues in which the public has a justified and important interest id.at,and who,though not public officials,were public figures,persons who commanded a substantial amount of independent public interest at the time of the publications because of the positions they held because of their purposeful activity amounting to a thrusting of their personalit ies into the vortex of important public controversy,id.at.see,gertz,at,persons who,by reason of the notoriety of their achievements or the vigor and success with which they seek the public attention,are properly classed as public figures and are subject to the new york times standard requiring clear and convincing proof of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.
in gertz,the court held that the states may not,consistent with the first amendment,permit recovery of presumed or punitive damages without a showing that the defendant was at fault,at,by a private individual who is involved in an issue of significant public interest,id.at see dun bradstreet,greenmoss builders,plurality opinion dun bradstreet gertz held that the first amendment restricted the damages that a private individual could obtain from a publisher for a libel that involved a matter of public concern.
in dun bradstreet,the court noted that speech on matters that are of purely private concern is of less first amendment importance.it ruled that state laws may,without violating the first amendment,permit recovery for presumed and punitive damages in a defamation action without a showing of actual malice when the defamatory statements do not involve matters of public concern.id.at plurality opinion.
for purposes of this opinion,we assume,without deciding,that klessig statements did not deal with a matter of public concern,that chandok was not a public figure,and that,therefore,the onerous burden of proving actual,constitutional,malice by clear and convincing evidence was not applicable.we nonetheless conclude that summary judgment was properly granted dismissing her claims because the evidence she adduced was insufficient to meet the less demanding standards imposed in these circumstances by new york law.
new york law allows a plaintiff to recover for defamation by proving that the defendant published to a third party a defamatory statement of fact that was false,was made with the applicable level of fault,and either was defamatory per se or caused the plaintiff special harm,so long as the statement was not protected by privilege.see,albert loksen,cir,and authorities cited therein.but new york p ublic policy mandates that certain communications,although defamatory,can not serve as the basis for the imposition of liability in a defamation action.toker pollak.new york law accords qualified privileges to at least two categories of statements that are pertinent to the present case.
a statement is generally subject to a qualified privilege when it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty,legal or moral.rosenberg metlife,n,rosenberg internal quotation marks omitted see,stukuls state,stukuls this privilege applies though the duty be not a legal one,but only a moral or social duty of imperfect obligation internal quotation marks omitted.for example,a letter from a physician who believed his assistant had stolen patient files,to an official body charged with responsibility for consideration and processing of complaints of professional misconduct on the part of physician assistants,was subject at a minimum to this qualified privilege.buckley litman,buckley.
in addition,a qualified privilege extends to a communication made by one person to another upon a subject in which both have an interest.liberman gelstein,liberman internal quotation marks omitted see,buckley,at,at.this privilege encompasses a defamatory communication on any subject matter in which the party communicating has an interest made to a person having a corresponding interest.stukuls,at.at emphases and internal quotation marks omitted.in some instances the privilege may overlap the privilege,for one may have a moral duty to communicate knowledge and information about a person in whom the speaker ha s an interest to another who also has an interest in such person,id.at,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,in buckley,litman,the physician who believed his assistant had stolen patient files,had a qualified privilege for communicating that information to a fellow physician who had handled the practice of litman while the latter was away and with whom the assistant was seeking employment.see at,at.
a qualified privilege may be overcome by a showing either of actual malice,knowledge of the statement falsity or reckless disregard as to whether it was false or of malice.see,liberman,at,at rosenberg,at,at.malice mean s spi
