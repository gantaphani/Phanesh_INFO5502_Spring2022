background 
doro is a sheet metal worker who since has been a member in good standing of the international and its affiliate,local union local.doro occasionally worked overtime for a local contractor,p p sheet metal,performing pipe sketching and estimating jobs related to piping and electrical work.on october,fellow local member nicholas columbo,nicholas columbo,filed charges against doro with the local union.the charging document alleged the following misconduct 
member working for p p sheet metal a local contractor accepting substandard wages and benefits for work performed after hours with full knowledge that benefits were not being paid into local and the international pension.
member failing to obtain an overtime permit.
member receiving two benefits vacation and dues in their sic pay.
on the same day,nicholas columbo filed charges against another local member,anthony pelella pelella.the documents charging pelella and doro are identical,except for the name and address of the charged party.
doro,in his april,deposition,testified that he was one of about members whom local charged for work performed for p p sheet metal,allegedly in violation of the union constitution,and that he understood the substance of the charges against him.according to doro,roy seacor,p p sheet metal owner,called a meeting of all the charged members and said not to worry about the charges,and that the issue of any fines imposed would be dealt with after the union trial.
on november,less than two weeks after mailing the charges,local executive board trial committee tried both doro and pelella separately.the record before us contains no transcript of the proceedings against doro and pelella.nicholas columbo brother gino columbo served as chairman of the trial committee.doro did not object to the composition of the trial committee.nicholas columbo read the charges,and doro responded that he was sorry if he did anything wrong.doro was not represented by counsel at the hearing or,apparently,at any other time during the union proceedings against him.the record provides no details of pelella trial,or any indication whether pelella admitted the factual basis for the charges against him.
the trial committee concluded that doro and pelella each violated three sections of the union constitution and fined doro and pelella.on november,gino columbo read the trial minutes of both trials to local membership.the membership ratified the findings of guilt and the fines 
doro appealed to arthur moore,the general president of the international,who affirmed local decision on january.doro further appealed to the international executive council,which on july,upheld the decision below,although it modified the penalty to remove any possibility of expulsion.doro appealed that decision to the international grievances and appeals committee on september.
doro appeal was pending before the grievances and appeals committee for almost five years,during which time local filed suit in federal court under the lmrda against pelella to collect pelella unpaid fine.see local union pelella,cir.pelella asserted a counterclaim for violation of his due process rights and breach of contract.id.on november,after a trial,a jury found local liable for violating pelella due process rights.id.at.in affirming the order of the district court granting pelella fees and costs,we noted that local conceded that the charges and procedures to which local subjected pelella reflect,at the very least,negligent compliance with the due process rights guaranteed by the lmrda.id.at.
doro finally appeared before the grievances and appeals committee on august.in a statement that doro claims he read before the convention grievance and appeals committee the committee,he argued that the written charges prepared by nicholas columbo did not allege when or where the infractions were committed,the number of hours in question,nor even the work that was covered by the union contract.doro cited the pelella decision as case law that compelled the committee to reverse local decision against him.
the committee recommended that the general executive decision be upheld.in recounting the prior proceedings,the committee stated that local had observed doro due process rights,including serving him with charges stating with sufficient details the conduct of which he was accused and giving him a full opportunity to defend against those charges.in giving its reasons for recommending that the convention uphold the decision of the executive council,the committee stated that doro,both in his statements to the committee and in his prior statements during the appeal process,had acknowledged violating the smwia constitution and had also acknowledged in his statements before the committee that he understood the nature of the charges against him.the committee recommendation made no reference to the pelella decision.in a letter dated august,the general of the international informed doro that the general convention had approved the committee recommendation and voted to reject his appeal.
on october,doro filed suit in federal court against local,the international,and gino columbo for willfully violating his due process rights under the lmrda.on july,doro settled with local and gino columbo.the remaining defendant,the international,moved for summary judgment on the ground that doro,because he sits on the board of directors of and owns a percent stake in caqs,which employs local members,is an interested employer who is barred from bringing this suit pursuant to a.doro moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability,asserting that as a matter of law the international knowingly had ratified a facially illegal decision by local.the district court denied both motions,but entered summary judgment sua sponte for the international on the ground that doro made no showing that the international acted in bad faith in performing its appellate functions.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in favor of the nonmoving party.see aon fin.prods.société générale,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the merits 
doro contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and in granting summary judgment for the international sua sponte.doro lmrda claim relies on a number of facts that,even if not formally disputed in the parties local civil rule statements,are nonetheless unsettled,particularly the specific factual background of doro and pelella union trials.however,doro has not identified for either the district court or this court any genuine issue of material fact that would raise a jury question on the issue we deem dispositive.see.c.
doro contends that the international knowingly ratified local alleged violation of the due process rights afforded him by the lmrda he argues that the insufficiency of the charges local brought against him are evident from the face of the document,and that he informed the international grievance and appeals committee of the pelella decision.the international contends that it did not act in bad faith in affirming the decision of local,and that doro may not bring suit under the lmrda because he is an interested employer we need not decid
