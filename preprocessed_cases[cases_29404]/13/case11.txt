respondent jevic transportation filed for chapter bankruptcy after being purchased in a leveraged buyout.the bankruptcy prompted two lawsuits.in the first,a group of former jevic truckdrivers,petitioners here,was awarded a judgment against jevic for jevic failure to provide proper notice of termination in violation of state and federal worker adjustment and retraining notification warn acts.part of that judgment counted as a priority wage claim under a,entitling the workers to payment ahead of general unsecured claims against the jevic estate.in the second suit,a committee representing jevic unsecured creditors sued sun capital and cit group,respondents here,for fraudulent conveyance in connection with the leveraged buyout of jevic.these parties negotiated a settlement agreement that called for a structured dismissal of jevic chapter bankruptcy.under the proposed structured dismissal,petitioners would receive nothing on their warn claims,but general unsecured creditors would be paid.petitioners argued that the distribution scheme accordingly violated the code priority rules by paying general unsecured claims ahead of their own.the bankruptcy court nevertheless approved the settlement agreement and dismissed the case,reasoning that because the proposed payouts would occur pursuant to a structured dismissal rather than an approved plan,the failure to follow ordinary priority rules did not bar approval.the district court and the third circuit affirmed.
petitioners have article iii standing.respondents argue that petitioners have not suffered an injury in fact,or at least one likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision,spokeo,robins,because petitioners would have gotten nothing even if the bankruptcy court had never approved the structured dismissal and will still get nothing if the structured dismissal is undone now.that argument rests upon the assumptions that without a violation of ordinary priority rules,there will be no settlement,and without a settlement,the lawsuit has no value.the record,however,indicates both that a settlement that respects ordinary priorities remains a reasonable possibility and that the claim could have litigation value.therefore,as a consequence of the bankruptcy court approval of the structured dismissal,petitioners lost a chance to obtain a settlement that respected their priorities or,if not that,the power to assert the claim themselves.a decision in their favor is likely to redress that loss.
bankruptcy courts may not approve structured dismissals that provide for distributions that do not follow ordinary priority rules without the consent of affected creditors.
a given the importance of the priority system,this court looks for an affirmative indication of intent before concluding that congress means to make a major departure.see whitman american trucking.nothing in the statute evinces such intent.insofar as the dismissal sections of chapter foresee any transfer of assets,they seek a restoration of the prepetition financial status quo.read in context,b,which permits a bankruptcy judge,for cause,to orde r otherwise,seems designed to give courts the flexibility to protect reliance interests acquired in the bankruptcy,not to make general distributions that would be flatly impermissible in a chapter plan or chapter liquidation.precedent does not support a contrary position,in re iridium operating llc,distinguished.cases in which courts have approved deviations from ordinary priority rules generally involve interim distributions serving significant objectives.that is not the case here,where,the distribution is attached to a final disposition,does not preserve the debtor as a going concern,does not make the disfavored creditors better off,does not promote the possibility of a confirmable plan,does not help to restore the status quo ante,and does not protect reliance interests.
b congress did not authorize a rare case exception that permits courts to disregard priority in structured dismissals for sufficient reasons.the fact that it is difficult to give precise content to the concept of sufficient reasons threatens to turn the court below exception into a more general rule,resulting in uncertainty that has potentially serious consequences,departure from the protections granted particular classes of creditors,changes in the bargaining power of different classes of creditors even in bankruptcies that do not end in structured dismissals,risks of collusion,and increased difficulty in achieving settlements.courts can not deviate from the strictures of the code,even in rare cases.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
bankruptcy code chapter allows debtors and their creditors to negotiate a plan for dividing an estate value.see.but sometimes the parties can not agree on a plan.if so,the bankruptcy court may decide to dismiss the case.b.the code then ordinarily provides for what is,in effect,a restoration of the prepetition financial status quo.b.
in the case before us,a bankruptcy court dismissed a chapter bankruptcy.but the court did not simply restore the prepetition status quo.instead,the court ordered a distribution of estate assets that gave money to secured creditors and to general unsecured creditors but which skipped certain dissenting creditors.the skipped creditors would have been entitled to payment ahead of the general unsecured creditors in a chapter plan or in a chapter liquidation.see.the question before us is whether a bankruptcy court has the legal power to order this kind of distribution scheme in connection with a chapter dismissal.
in our view,a bankruptcy court does not have such a power.a distribution scheme ordered in connection with the dismissal of a chapter case can not,without the consent of the affected parties,deviate from the basic priority rules that apply under the primary mechanisms the code establishes for final distributions of estate value in business bankruptcies.
we begin with a few fundamentals a business may file for bankruptcy under either chapter or chapter.in chapter,a trustee liquidates the debtor assets and distributes them to creditors.see et.in chapter,debtor and creditors try to negotiate a plan that will govern the distribution of valuable assets from the debtor estate and often keep the business operating as a going concern.see,setting out the framework in which the parties negotiate.
filing for chapter bankruptcy has several relevant legal consequences.first,an estate is created comprising all property of the debtor.a.second,a fiduciary is installed to manage the estate in the interest of the creditors,a.this fiduciary,often the debtor existing management team,acts as debtor in possession.it may operate the business,c,and perform certain functions,such as seeking to recover for the estate preferential or fraudulent transfers made to other persons,transfers made before bankruptcy that unfairly preferred particular creditors fraudulent transfers,including transfers made before bankruptcy for which the debtor did not receive fair value.third,an automatic stay of all collection proceedings against the debtor takes effect.a.
it is important to keep in mind that chapter foresees three possible outcomes.the first is a plan.such a plan may keep the business operating but,at the same time,help creditors by providing for payments,perhaps over time.see.the second possible outcome is conversion of the case to a chapter proceeding for liquidation of the business and a distribution of its remaining assets.a,b.that conversion in effect confesses an inability to find a plan.the third possible outcome is dismissal of the chapter case.b.a dismissal typically revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case in other words,it aims to return to the prepetition financial status quo.b.
nonetheless,recognizing that conditions may have changed in ways that make a perfect restoration of the status quo difficult or impossible,the code permits the bankruptcy court,for cause,to alter a chapter dismissal ordinary restorative consequences.b.a dismissal that does so or which has other special conditions attached is often referred to as a structured dismissal,defined by the american bankruptcy institute as a 
hybrid dismissal and confirmation order that typically dismisses the case while,among other things,approving certain distributions to creditors,granting certain releases,enjoining certain conduct by creditors,and not necessarily vacating orders or unwinding transactions undertaken during the case.american bankruptcy institute commission to study the reform of chapter,final report and recommendations.
although the code does not expressly mention structured dismissals,they appear to be increasingly common.
the code also sets forth a basic system of priority,which ordinarily determines the order in which the bankruptcy court will distribute assets of the estate.secured creditors are highest on the priority list,for they must receive the proceeds of the collateral that secures their debts.special classes of creditors,such as those who hold certain claims for taxes or wages,come next in a listed order,a.then come creditors,including general unsecured creditors.a.the code places equity holders at the bottom of the priority list.they receive nothing until all previously listed creditors have been paid in full.a.
the code makes clear that distributions of assets in a chapter liquidation must follow this prescribed order.it provides somewhat more flexibility for distributions pursuant to chapter plans,which may impose a different ordering with the consent of the affected parties.but a bankruptcy court can not confirm a plan that contains distributions over the objection of an impaired creditor class.a,b.
the question here concerns the interplay between the code priority rules and a chapter dismissal.here,the bankruptcy court neither liquidated the debtor under chapter nor confirmed a chapter plan.but the court,instead of reverting to the prebankruptcy status quo,ordered a distribution of the estate assets to creditors by attaching conditions to the dismissal,it ordered a structured dismissal.the code does not explicitly state what priority rules if any apply to a distribution in these circumstances.may a court consequently provide for distributions that deviate from the ordinary priority rules that would apply to a chapter liquidation or a chapter plan can it approve conditions that give estate assets to members of a lower priority class while skipping objecting members of a higher priority class 
in,sun capital partners,a private equity firm,acquired jevic transportation corporation with money borrowed from cit group in a leveraged buyout.in a leveraged buyout,the buyer b typically borrows from a third party t a large share of the funds needed to purchase a company c.b then pays the money to c shareholders.having bought the stock,b owns b then pledges c assets to t so that t will have security for its loan.thus,if the selling price for c is million,b might use million of its own money,borrow million from t,pay million to c shareholders,and then pledge c assets worth million or more to t as security for t million loan.if b manages c well,it might make enough money to pay t back the million and earn a handsome profit on its own million investment.but,if the deal sours and c descends into bankruptcy,beware of what might happen instead of c million in assets being distributed to its existing creditors,the money will go to t to pay back t loan the loan that allowed b to buy t will receive what remains of c assets because t is now a secured creditor,putting it at the top of the priority list.since c shareholders receive money while c creditors lose their claim to c remaining assets,unsuccessful leveraged buyouts often lead to fraudulent conveyance suits alleging that the purchaser b transferred the company assets without receiving fair value in return.see lipson vandermeuse,stern,seriously the article i judicial power,fraudulent transfers,and leveraged buyouts.
this is precisely what happened here.just two years after sun buyout,jevic c in our leveraged buyout example filed for chapter bankruptcy.at the time of filing,it owed million to senior secured creditors sun and cit b and t in our example,and over million to tax and general unsecured creditors.
the circumstances surrounding jevic bankruptcy led to two lawsuits.first,petitioners,a group of former jevic truckdrivers,filed suit in bankruptcy court against jevic and sun.petitioners pointed out that,just before entering bankruptcy,jevic had halted almost all its operations and had told petitioners that they would be fired.petitioners claimed that jevic and sun had thereby violated state and federal worker adjustment and retraining notification warn acts laws that require a company to give workers at least days notice before their termination.see stat.ann.west.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for petitioners against jevic,leaving them and this is the point to remember with a judgment that petitioners say is worth million.see in re jevic holding,bkrtcy.some million of that judgment counts as a priority wage claim under a,and is therefore entitled to payment ahead of general unsecured claims against the jevic estate.
petitioners warn suit against sun continued throughout most of the litigation now before us.but eventually sun prevailed on the ground that sun was not the workers employer at the relevant times.see in re jevic holding,fed.appx.
second,the bankruptcy court authorized a committee representing jevic unsecured creditors to sue sun and cit.the bankruptcy court and the parties were aware that any proceeds from such a suit would belong not to the unsecured creditors,but to the bankruptcy estate.see a,official comm.of unsecured creditors of cybergenics chinery,en banc holding that a creditor committee can bring a derivative action on behalf of the estate.the committee alleged that sun and cit,in the course of their leveraged buyout,had hastened jevic bankruptcy by saddling it with debts that it could service.in re jevic holding.in,the bankruptcy court held that the committee had adequately pleaded claims of preferential transfer under and of fraudulent transfer under.in re jevic holding,wl bkrtcy.
sun,cit,jevic,and the committee then tried to negotiate a settlement of this lawsuit.by that point,the depleted jevic estate only remaining assets were the claim itself and million in cash,which was subject to a lien held by sun.
the parties reached a settlement agreement.it provided that the bankruptcy court would dismiss the action with prejudice that cit would deposit million into an account earmarked to pay the committee legal fees and administrative expenses that sun would assign its lien on jevic remaining million to a trust,which would pay taxes and administrative expenses and distribute the remainder on a pro rata basis to the general unsecured creditors,but which would not distribute anything to petitioners who,by virtue of their warn judgment,held an million wage claim against the estate and that jevic chapter bankruptcy would be dismissed.
apparently sun insisted on a distribution that would skip petitioners because petitioners warn suit against sun was still pending and sun did not want to help finance that litigation.see,at,sun counsel acknowledging before the bankruptcy court that sun probably does care where the money goes because you can take judicial notice that there a pending warn action against sun by the warn plaintiffs.and if the money goes to the warn plaintiffs,then you funding someone who is suing you who otherwise does have funds and is doing it on a contingent fee basis the essential point is that,regardless of the reason,the proposed settlement called for a structured dismissal that provided for distributions that did not follow ordinary priority rules.
sun,cit,jevic,and the committee asked the bankruptcy court to approve the settlement and dismiss the case.petitioners and the trustee objected,arguing that the settlement distribution plan violated the code priority scheme because it skipped petitioners who,by virtue of their warn judgment,had priority claims against estate assets and distributed estate money to general unsecured creditors.
the bankruptcy court agreed with petitioners that the settlement distribution scheme failed to follow ordinary priority rules.app.to pet.for cert.but it held that this did not bar approval.ibid.that,in the bankruptcy court view,was because the proposed payouts would occur pursuant to a structured dismissal of a chapter petition rather than an approval of a chapter plan.ibid.the court accordingly decided to grant the motion in light of the dire circumstances facing the estate and its creditors,at.specifically,the court predicted that without the settlement and dismissal,there was no realistic prospect of a meaningful distribution for anyone other than the secured creditors,at.a confirmable chapter plan was unattainable.and there would be no funds to operate,investigate,or litigate were the case converted to a proceeding in chapter.ibid.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.it recognized that the settlement distribution violated ordinary priority rules.but those rules,it wrote,were not a bar to the approval of the settlement as the settlement is not a reorganization plan.in re jevic holding,wl,d.
the third circuit affirmed the district court by a vote of to,at,at scirica,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the majority held that structured dismissals need not always respect priority.congress,the court explained,had only codified the absolute priority rule in the specific context of plan confirmation.at.as a result,courts could,in rare instances like this one,approve structured dismissals that do not strictly adhere to the bankruptcy code priority scheme.at.
petitioners the workers with the warn judgment sought certiorari.we granted their petition.
respondents initially argue that petitioners lack standing because they have suffered no injury,or at least no injury that will be remedied by a decision in their favor.see spokeo,robins,slip,at explaining that,for article iii standing,a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant,and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision respondents concede that the structured dismissal approved by the bankruptcy court contained distribution conditions that skipped over petitioners,ensuring that petitioners received nothing on their warn claim against the jevic estate.but respondents still assert that petitioners suffered no loss.
the reason,respondents say,is that petitioners would have gotten nothing even if the bankruptcy court had never approved the structured dismissal in the first place,and will still get nothing if the structured dismissal is undone now.reversal will eliminate the settlement of the committee lawsuit,which was conditioned on the bankruptcy court approval of the structured dismissal.if the bankruptcy court can not approve that dismissal,respondents contend,sun and cit will no longer agree to settle.nor will petitioners ever be able to obtain a litigation recovery.hence there will be no lawsuit money to distribute.and in the absence of lawsuit money,jevic assets amount to about million,all pledged to sun,leaving nothing for anyone else,let alone petitioners.thus,even if petitioners are right that the structured dismissal was impermissible,it cost them nothing.and a judicial decision in their favor will gain them nothing.no loss.no redress.
this argument,however,rests upon respondents claims that,without a violation of ordinary priority rules,there will be no settlement,and that,without a settlement,the lawsuit has no value.in our view,the record does not support either of these propositions.
as to the first,the record indicates that a settlement that respects ordinary priorities remains a reasonable possibility.it makes clear as counsel made clear before our court,see tr.of oral arg.that sun insisted upon a settlement that gave petitioners nothing only because it did not want to help fund petitioners warn lawsuit against it.see,at.but,sun has now won that lawsuit.see fed.appx.if sun given reason for opposing distributions to petitioners has disappeared,why would sun not settle while permitting some of the settlement money to go to petitioners 
as to the second,the record indicates that the claim could have litigation value.cit and sun,after all,settled the lawsuit for million,which would make little sense if the action truly had no chance of success.the bankruptcy court could convert the case to chapter,allowing a chapter trustee to pursue the suit against sun and cit.or the court could simply dismiss the chapter bankruptcy,thereby allowing petitioners to assert the claim themselves.given these possibilities,there is no reason to believe that the claim could not be pursued with counsel obtained on a contingency basis.of course,the lawsuit like any lawsuit might prove fruitless,but the mere possibility of failure does not eliminate the value of the claim or petitioners injury in being unable to bring it.
consequently,the bankruptcy court approval of the structured dismissal cost petitioners something.they lost a chance to obtain a settlement that respected their priority.or,if not that,they lost the power to bring their own lawsuit on a claim that had a settlement value of million.for standing purposes,a loss of even a small amount of money is ordinarily an injury.see,mcgowan maryland,finding that appellants fined plus costs had standing to assert an establishment clause challenge.and the ruling before us could well have cost petitioners considerably more.see clinton city of new york,imposition of a substantial contingent liability qualifies as an injury.a decision in petitioners favor is likely to redress that loss.we accordingly conclude that petitioners have standing.
we turn to the basic question presented can a bankruptcy court approve a structured dismissal that provides for distributions that do not follow ordinary priority rules without the affected creditors consent our simple answer to this complicated question is no.
the code priority system constitutes a basic underpinning of business bankruptcy law.distributions of estate assets at the termination of a business bankruptcy normally take place through a chapter liquidation or a chapter plan,and both are governed by priority.in chapter liquidations,priority is an absolute command lower priority creditors can not receive anything u
