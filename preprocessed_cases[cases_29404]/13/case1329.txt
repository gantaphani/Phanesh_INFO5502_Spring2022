background 
appellee automobile club of new york aaa is a corporation which provides roadside assistance and towing in the new york metropolitan area through a network of affiliated contractors.auto.club of,dykstra auto.club i,d.it brought this action challenging the city scheme as applied to tow trucks from outside new york city.
the scheme 
originally enacted in and amended in and,the scheme comprehensively regulates the city towing industry.the scheme was enacted in large part to prevent tow truck drivers from monitoring police radios and chasing each other to reach the scene of a car accident first.see memorandum in support from the office of the mayor,martha hirst,legislative representative to the city council,memorandum from jeremy travis,special counsel and assistant director,office of the mayor,office of operations.
the scheme makes it unlawful to engage in towing without having first obtained a license and authorizes the seizure of any tow truck being operated without a license.admin.code.the scheme defines towing to include not only the towing of a vehicle,but any driving or other operation of a tow truck,or the offering to transport a vehicle by means of a tow truck.id.d.thus,as a whole,the scheme requires that all tow trucks within the city limits must be licensed by the city or risk seizure.this is true regardless of whether the truck has a vehicle in tow and regardless of whether the truck is actively soliciting business in the city or simply passing through,such as towing a car from new jersey to long island.
to obtain a license,a towing business must pay fees of per truck and per driver,as well as an additional fee for a fingerprint report and criminal record check.id.rules of the city of.further,applicants must furnish proof of adequate liability insurance and either a bond or a cash contribution to the tow truck industry trust fund.admin.code rules of the city of.each tow truck is obligated to comply with new york state registration and inspection requirements.to reduce some of the economic incentives to chase,the scheme also established the directed accident response program darp,which requires that all vehicles disabled within the city be removed by licensed towers assigned on a rotating basis and bans the solicitation of disabled vehicles by unassigned towers.see admin.code.
enforcement of the scheme 
although the text of the scheme authorized the seizure of all unlicensed tow trucks anywhere within new york city,an informal reciprocity agreement between the city and surrounding municipalities and counties minimized enforcement of the scheme against tow operators from until.this agreement is evidenced by several writings.first,an april,memorandum authored by commissioner of the department of consumer affairs dca peter lempin served to 
r einforce the towing reciprocity agreement the department has with both the tow advisory board and the different representative associations,regarding who requires a towing license.
the intent of the agreement was not to penalize those companies,who for the most part,just pass through the city or occasionally tow vehicles from the city to bordering counties or states.
auto.club i,d at.
on january,lempin,now dca first assistant commissioner,wrote to the supervisor of licensing for the town of hempstead that 
since,when the department of consumer affairs assumed the licensing and regulatory authority over towing businesses,we have honored an informal licensing reciprocity policy with surrounding counties.this policy allows towing firms from nassau,suffolk and westchester counties to pass through new york city without having to obtain a city license.
id.at.the following year,lempin,by then dca deputy commissioner,wrote a nearly identical letter to the deputy mayor for operations of the city of yonkers.id.
by,the informal reciprocity agreement had become documented in the patrol guide issued by the new york police department titled seizure of unlicensed tow trucks.according to the nypd,tow trucks from outside new york city that are passing through or merely picking up or dropping off a vehicle within new york city are not subject to this seizure procedure.id.the same or similar language was also included in the patrol guide dated november,and a may,nypd operations order.id.
regardless of the scope of the reciprocity,enforcement increased dramatically in,when only of tow operators met their license renewal deadlines.consequently,as of january,dca began conducting sweeps and seized approximately tow trucks,of which belonged to towers outside of the city.in,aaa performed approximately interstate tows,while in,towing clubs in the new york area performed approximately tows to,from,or across the city limits.auto.club of,dykstra auto.club ii,d.to avoid seizure of these trucks,aaa created a handoff system whereby vehicles were towed to the city limits and then swapped onto licensed tow trucks.see auto.club i,d at.according to aaa,these measures were necessary because its members did not have a sufficient number of licensed trucks to perform all tows into,out of,or through new york city.
aaa filed this action on april,seeking a judgment enjoining the city from enforcing the scheme.in july,the district court ordered the continuation of the reciprocity policy,and preliminarily enjoined the city from enforcing the scheme against tow trucks authorized by their own municipalities and in accordance with new york state law.id.at.following a full trial,the district court invalidated portions of the scheme and specifically declared its definition of towing void.auto.club ii,d at.the court found three independent bases for this decision.first,under c,the scheme was preempted as a law,regulation,or other provision related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier not saved by the provision safety exception to preemption.see c auto.club ii,d at.second,the scheme unduly burdened interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause by essentially imposing a high toll on towers.id.at.because it requires a license simply to drive a tow truck within the city limits,the scheme would force,for example,a new jersey tower,wanting to tow from newark to long island to go north of yonkers on the west opposite side of the hudson river to the tappan zee bridge,work across westchester to bridgeport,connecticut to the long island sound ferry and then on long island go back west to mineola.id.emphasis and footnote omitted.third,the broad definition of towing authorized seizures of trucks without the probable cause required by the fourth and fourteenth amendments.id.at.lastly,in a separate decision,the district court awarded aaa in attorneys fees plus in expenses.auto.club of,dykstra,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
discussion 
in,congress passed the federal aviation administration authorization act of the faaa act,which became codified as part of the interstate commerce act.in relevant part,the faaa act amended the interstate commerce act to preempt state regulation of certain aspects of motor carriers,including tow trucks.specifically,the act preempts the laws of a state or political subdivision of a state related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.as an exception to this general preemption rule,congress prov
