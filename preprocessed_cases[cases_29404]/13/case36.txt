after petitioner marvin green complained to his employer,the united states postal service,that he was denied a promotion because he was black,his supervisors accused him of the crime of intentionally delaying the mail.in an agreement signed december,the postal service agreed not to pursue criminal charges,and green agreed either to retire or to accept another position in a remote location for much less money.green chose to retire and submitted his resignation paperwork on february,effective march.
on march days after resigning and days after signing the agreement green reported an unlawful constructive discharge to an equal employment opportunity counselor,an administrative prerequisite to filing a complaint alleging discrimination or retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.see cfr a.green eventually filed suit in federal district court,which dismissed his complaint as untimely because he had not contacted the counselor within days of the matter alleged to be discriminatory,ibid.the tenth circuit affirmed,holding that the limitations period began to run on december,the date green signed the agreement.
because part of the matter alleged to be discriminatory in a claim is an employee resignation,the limitations period for such action begins running only after an employee resigns.
a where,as here,the regulatory text itself is not unambiguously clear,the court relies on the standard rule for limitations periods,which provides that a limitations period ordinarily begins to run when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson.applied here,that rule offers three persuasive reasons to include the employee resignation in the limitations period.
i first,resignation is part of the complete and present cause of action in a claim,which comprises two basic elements discriminatory conduct such that a reasonable employee would have felt compelled to resign and actual resignation,pennsylvania state police suders.until he resigns,an employee does not have a complete and present cause of action for constructive discharge.under the standard rule,only after the employee has a complete and present cause of action does that trigger the limitations period.in this respect,a claim is no different from an ordinary claim,which accrues only after the employee is fired.
ii second,although the standard rule may be subject to exception where clearly indicated by the text creating the limitations period,nothing in title vii or the regulation suggests such displacement.to the contrary,it is natural to read matter alleged to be discriminatory as including the allegation forming the basis of the claim,which confirms the standard rule applicability.
iii third,practical considerations also confirm the merit of applying the standard rule.starting the clock ticking before a plaintiff can actually file suit does little to further the limitations period goals and actively negates title vii remedial structure.a limitations perio d should not commence to run so soon that it becomes difficult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil rights statutes.delaware state college ricks.nothing in the regulation suggests a process in which an employee would have to file a complaint after an employer discriminatory conduct,only to be forced to amend that complaint to allege constructive discharge after resigning.requiring that a complaint be filed before resignation occurs would also,ignore that an employee may not be in a position to leave his job immediately.
b arguments against applying the standard rule here are rejected.suders stands not for the proposition that a constructive discharge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial purposes only,but for the rule that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act,at.nor was green resignation the mere inevitable consequence of the postal service discriminatory conduct.ricks,distinguished.finally,the important goal of promoting conciliation through early,informal contact with a counselor does not warrant treating a constructive discharge different from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period.
a claim accrues and the limitations period begins to run when the employee gives notice of his resignation,not on the effective date thereof.the tenth circuit is left to determine,in the first instance,the date that green in fact gave notice.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
title vii of the civil rights act of,stat,as amended,et,prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin,or retaliating against their employees for opposing or seeking relief from such discrimination.before a federal civil servant can sue his employer for violating title vii,he must,among other things,initiate contact with an equal employment opportunity counselor at his agency within days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.cfr a.
if an employee claims he has been fired for discriminatory reasons,the matter alleged to be discriminatory includes the discharge itself and the limitations period begins running only after the employee is fired.
we address here when the limitations period begins to run for an employee who was not fired,but resigns in the face of intolerable discrimination a constructive discharge.we hold that,in such circumstances,the matter alleged to be discriminatory includes the employee resignation,and that the clock for a constructive discharge begins running only after the employee resigns.
we recite the following facts in the light most favorable to petitioner marvin green,against whom the district court entered summary judgment.green is a black man who worked for the postal service for years.in,he was serving as the postmaster for englewood,colorado when he applied for a promotion to the vacant postmaster position in nearby boulder.he was passed over.shortly thereafter,green complained he was denied the promotion because of his race.
green relations with his supervisors crumbled following his complaint.tensions peaked on december,when two of green supervisors accused him of intentionally delaying the mail a criminal offense.see.they informed green that the postal service office of the inspector general oig was investigating the charge and that oig agents had arrived to interview him as part of their investigation.after green met with the oig agents,his supervisors gave him a letter reassigning him to status until the matter was resolved.even though the oig agents reported to green supervisors that no further investigation was warranted,the supervisors continued to represent to green that the oig is all over this and that the criminal charge could be a life changer.app.
on december,green and the postal service signed an agreement whose meaning remains disputed.relevant here,the postal service promised not to pursue criminal charges in exchange for green promise to leave his post in englewood.the agreement also apparently gave green a choice effective march,he could either retire or report for duty in wamsutter,wyoming population at a salary considerably lower than what he earned in his denver suburb.green chose to retire and submitted his resignation to the postal service on february,effective march.
on march days after submitting his resignation paperwork to the postal service on february,but days after signing the settlement agreement on december green contacted an equal employment opportunity eeo counselor to report an unlawful constructive discharge.he contended that his supervisors had threatened criminal charges and negotiated the resulting agreement in retaliation for his original complaint he alleged that the choice he had been given effectively forced his resignation in violation of title vii.
green eventually filed suit in the federal district court for the district of colorado,alleging,inter alia,that the postal service constructively discharged him.the postal service moved for summary judgment,arguing that green had failed to make timely contact with an eeo counselor within days of the matter alleged to be discriminatory,as required by cfr a.the district court granted the postal service motion for summary judgment.
the tenth circuit affirmed,holding that the matter alleged to be discriminatory encompassed only the postal service discriminatory actions and not green independent decision to resign on february.green donahue.therefore,the limitations period started running when both parties signed the settlement agreement on december.accordingly,because days passed between the agreement and when green contacted an eeo counselor on march,his claim was time barred.
two other courts of appeals agree with the tenth circuit view that the limitations period begins to run for a claim after the employer last discriminatory act as the tenth circuit recognized,however,other courts of appeals have held that the limitations period for a claim does not begin to run until the employee resigns 
we granted certiorari to resolve this split.because no party here supports the tenth circuit holding that an employee resignation is not part of the matter alleged to be discriminatory,we appointed catherine carroll to defend that aspect of the judgment below.she has ably discharged her duties and the court thanks her for her service.
before a federal civil servant can sue his employer in court for discriminating against him in violation of title vii,he must first exhaust his administrative remedies.c.to exhaust those remedies,the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc has promulgated regulations that require,among other things,that a federal employee consult with an eeo counselor prior to filing a discrimination lawsuit.specifically,he must initiate contact with a counselor within days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or,in the case of personnel action,within days of the effective date of the action.cfr a the timeliness of green claim therefore turns on our interpretation of this eeoc regulation implementing title vii 
although we begin our interpretation of the regulation with its text,the text in this case is not particularly helpful.nowhere does indicate whether a matter alleged to be discriminatory in a claim includes the employee resignation,as green contends,or only the employer discriminatory conduct,as amica contends.the word matter simply means an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,black law dictionary ed.a term that could readily apply to a resignation.so the matter alleged to be discriminatory could refer to all of the allegations underlying a claim of discrimination,including the employee resignation,or only to those allegations concerning the employer discriminatory conduct.we therefore must turn to other canons of interpretation.
the most helpful canon in this context is the standard rule for limitations periods.graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson.ordinarily,a limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.ibid.a cause of action does not become complete and present for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.bay area laundry and dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of.although the standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit,we will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication in the text of the limitations period.reiter cooper.
applying this default rule,we are persuaded that the matter alleged to be discriminatory in a claim necessarily includes the employee resignation for three reasons.first,in the context of a claim,a resignation is part of the complete and present cause of action necessary before a limitations period ordinarily begins to run.second,nothing in the regulation creating the limitations period here,clearly indicates an intent to displace this standard rule.third,practical considerations confirm the merit of applying the standard rule here.we therefore interpret the term matter alleged to be discriminatory for a claim to include the date green resigned.
the standard rule for limitations periods requires us first to determine what is a complete and present cause of action for a claim.we hold that such a claim accrues only after an employee resigns.
the doctrine contemplates a situation in which an employer discriminates against an employee to the point such that his working conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee position would have felt compelled to resign.pennsylvania state police suders.when the employee resigns in the face of such circumstances,title vii treats that resignation as tantamount to an actual discharge,at.
a claim of constructive discharge therefore has two basic elements.a plaintiff must prove first that he was discriminated against by his employer to the point where a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign,at.but he must also show that he actually resigned.ibid.a constructive discharge involves both an employee decision to leave and precipitating conduct emphasis added.in other words,an employee can not bring a claim until he is constructively discharged.only after both elements are satisfied can he file suit to obtain relief.
under the standard rule for limitations periods,the limitations period should begin to run for a claim only after a plaintiff resigns.at that point and not before he can file a suit for constructive discharge.so only at that point and not before does he have a complete and present cause of action.and only after he has a complete and present cause of action does a limitations period ordinarily begin to run.mac shell service,shell oil products,the limitations period for a constructive termination of a franchise agreement starts running when the agreement is constructively terminated.
in this respect,a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee.an ordinary wrongful discharge claim also has two basic elements discrimination and discharge.see mary honor center hicks,lindemann,grossman,weirich,employment discrimination law ed.lindemann the sine qua non of a discharge case is,of course,a discharge the claim accrues when the employee is fired.at that point and not before he has a complete and present cause of action.so at that point and not before the limitations period begins to run.
with claims of either constructive discharge or actual discharge,the standard rule thus yields the same result a limitations period should not begin to run until after the discharge itself.in light of this rule,we interpret the term matter alleged to be discriminatory in to refer to all of the elements that make up a claim including an employee resignation.
although the standard rule dictates that a limitations period should commence only after a claim accrues,there is an exception to that rule when the text creating the limitations period clearly indicates otherwise.see,dodd united states.nothing in the text of title vii or the regulation,however,suggests that the standard rule should be displaced here.to the contrary,the language of the regulation confirms our application of the default rule.
as noted previously,the word matter generally refers to an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.black law dictionary.the natural reading of matter alleged to be discriminatory thus refers to the allegation forming the basis of the discrimination claim here,a claim of constructive discharge.and as discussed above,a constructive discharge claim requires two basic allegations discriminatory conduct by the employer that leads to resignation of the employee.so long as those acts are part of the same,single claim under consideration,they are part of the matter alleged to be discriminatory,whatever the role of discrimination in each individual element of the claim.national railroad passenger corporation morgan,holding that a claim is a single unlawful employment practice that includes every act composing that claim,whether those acts are independently actionable or not.
finally,we are also persuaded that applying the standard rule for limitations periods to constructive discharge makes a good deal of practical sense.starting the limitations clock ticking before a plaintiff can actually sue for constructive discharge serves little purpose in furthering the goals of a limitations period and it actively negates title vii remedial structure.zipes trans world airlines,holding that the title vii limitations period should be construed to honor the remedial purpose of the legislation as a whole without negating the particular purpose of the filing requirement 
this court has recognized that the limitations perio d should not commence to run so soon that it becomes difficult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil rights statutes.delaware state college ricks.if the limitations period begins to run following the employer precipitating discriminatory conduct,but before the employee resignation,the employee will be forced to file a discrimination complaint after the employer conduct and later amend the complaint to allege constructive discharge after he resigns.nothing in the regulation suggests it intended to require a layperson,while making this difficult decision,to follow such a process in order to preserve any remedy if he is constructively discharged.
moreover,forcing an employee to lodge a complaint before he can bring a claim for constructive discharge places that employee in a difficult situation.an employee who suffered discrimination severe enough that a reasonable person in his shoes would resign might nevertheless force himself to tolerate that discrimination for a period of time.he might delay his resignation until he can afford to leave.or he might delay in light of other circumstances,as in the case of a teacher waiting until the end of the school year to resign.tr.and,if he feels he must stay for a period of time,he may be reluctant to complain about discrimination while still employed.a complaint could risk termination an additional adverse consequence that he may have to disclose in future job applications.
amica and the dissent read matter alleged to be discriminatory as having a clear enough meaning to displace our reliance on the standard rule for limitations periods.they argue that matter is not equivalent to claim or cause of action,and that the use of the phrase matter alleged to be discriminatory is a sufficiently clear statement that the standard claim accrual rule should not apply.according to amica and the dissent,matter refers only to the discriminatory acts of the postal service,not green resignation.
we disagree.there is nothing inherent in the phrase matter alleged to be discriminatory that clearly limits it to employer conduct.rather,as discussed above,the term can reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis for a claim.green is not alleging just that the postal service discriminated against him.he claims that the discrimination left him no choice but to resign.
amica and the dissent dispute that a constructive discharge is a separate claim.according to amica and the dissent,the doctrine merely allows a plaintiff to expand any underlying discrimination claim to include the damages from leaving his job,thereby increasing his available remedies.see lindemann constructive discharge allows plaintiff to seek backpay,front pay,or reinstatement.in support of this argument,amica and the dissent emphasize this court statement in suders that u nder the constructive discharge doctrine,an employee reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes.at emphasis added see also,at a constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in respects 
but the court did not hold in suders that a constructive discharge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial purposes exclusively.to the contrary,it expressly held that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act,at holding that a claim is a lesser included component of the graver claim of constructive discharge this holding was no mere dictum.see,at a claim for constructive discharge lies under title vii we see no reason to excise an employee resignation from his claim for purposes of the limitations period.
the concurrence sets out a theory that there are two kinds of constructive discharge for purposes of the limitations period constructive discharge claims where the employer makes conditions intolerable with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to resign,and constructive discharge damages where the employer does not intend to force the employee to quit,but the discriminatory conditions of employment are so intolerable that the employee quits anyway.post,at alito,concurring in judgment.according to the concurrence,the limitations period does not begin to run until an employee resigns under the claim theory of constructive discharge,but begins at the last discriminatory act before resignation under the damages theory.
this theory of constructive discharge is novel and contrary to the constructive discharge doctrine.the whole point of allowing an employee to claim constructive discharge is that in circumstances of discrimination so intolerable that a reasonable person would resign,we treat the employee resignation as though the employer actually fired him.suders,at we do not also require an employee to come forward with proof proof that would often be difficult to allege plausibly that not only was the discrimination so bad that he had to quit,but also that his quitting was his employer plan all along.
amica and the dissent also argue that their interpretation is more consistent with this court prior precedent on when the limitations period begins to run for discrimination claims.under their interpretation,green resignation was not part of the discriminatory matter,but was instead the mere inevitable consequence of the postal service discriminatory conduct,and therefore can not be used to extend the limitations period.see brief for amica curiae in support of judgment below brief for amica curiae citing ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,overruled by statute,lilly ledbetter fair pay act of,stat.delaware state college ricks,united air lines,evans,post,at thomas,dissenting citing ricks,and chardon fernandez,per curiam.similarly,the concurrence argues these cases require that an act done with discriminatory intent must occur within the limitations period.post,at opinion of alito.
but these cases are consistent with the standard rule that a limitations period begins to run after a claim accrues,not after an inevitable consequence of that claim.in ricks,for example,the court considered the discrimination claim of a college faculty member who was denied tenure and given a terminal contract for his last year teaching,at.the plaintiff claim accrued and he could have sued when the college informed him he would be denied tenure and gave him explicit notice that his employment would end when his contract expired.ibid.the court held that the limitations period began to run on that date,and not after his contract expired.that final year of teaching was merely an inevitable consequence of the tenure denial the plaintiff claimed was discriminatory.
green resignation,by contrast,is not merely an inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered it is an essential part of his claim.that is,green could not sue for constructive discharge until he actually resigned.of course,green could not resign and then wait until the consequences of that resignation became most painful to complain.for example,he could not use the date of the expiration of his health insurance after his resignation to extend the limitations period.but the inevitable consequence principle of ricks,ledbetter,and evans does not change the focus of the limitations period,which remains on the claim of discrimination itself.see lewis chicago,holding evans and its progeny establish only that a title vii plaintiff must show a present violation within the limitations period internal quotation marks omitted national railroad passenger corporation morgan,at holding limitations period for claim runs from the last act composing the claim for a constructive discharge,the claim does not exist until the employee resigns.
finally,amica contends that her interpretation of the regulation better advances the eeoc goal of promoting conciliation for federal employees through early,informal contact with an eeo counselor.see exec.order,fed.reg.counseling for federal employees shall encourage the resolution of employee problems on an informal basis the dissent suggests that our holding will make a discrimination victim the master of his complaint,permitting him to exten d the limitation s period indefinitely by waiting to resign.post,at opinion of thomas.the concurrence claims that an employee who relies on the limitations period in waiting to resign is doubly out of luck if his discrimination claim is time barred and he can not show the discrimination was so intolerable that it amounted to a constructive discharge.post,at opinion of alito.
these concerns are overblown.amica may be right that it is more difficult to achieve conciliation after an employee resigns.but the same is true for a federal civil servant who is fired by his agency for what the employee believes to be a discriminatory purpose.and neither decision is necessarily permanent a resignation or a termination may be undone after an employee contacts a counselor.conciliation,while important,does not warrant treating a constructive discharge different from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period.
as for the dissent fear,we doubt that a victim of employment discrimination will continue to work in an intolerable environment merely because he can thereby extend the limitations period for a claim of constructive discharge.if anything,a plaintiff who wishes to prevail on the merits of his constructive discharge claim has the opposite incentive.a claim of constructive discharge requires proof of a causal link between the allegedly intolerable conditions and the resignation.see lindemann,and.
and as for the concurrence concern,no plaintiff would be well advised to delay pursuing what he believes to be a meritorious claim on the ground that a timely filed constructive discharge claim could resuscitate other claims.the limitations period begins running on any separate underlying claim of discrimination when that claim accrues,regardless of whether the plaintiff eventually claims constructive discharge.the analysis is always conducted claim by claim.
our decision that a resignation triggers the limitations period for a claim raises the question of when precisely an employee resigns.here,green and the government agree that an employee resigns when he gives his employer definite notice of his intent to resign.if an employee gives two weeks notice telling his employer he intends to leave after two more weeks of employment the limitations period begins to run on the day he tells his employer,not his last day at work.this issue was not addressed by the tenth circuit and,accordingly,amica takes no position on it.see brief for amica curiae.
we agree.a notice rule flows directly from this court precedent.in ricks,at,and chardon fernandez,the court explained that an ordinary claim accrues and the limitations period begins to run when the employer notifies the employee he is fired,not on the last day of his employment.ricks,at chardon,at.likewise,here,we hold that a claim accrues and the limitations period begins to run when the employee gives notice of his resignation,not on the effective date of that resignation.
one factual issue remains when exactly green gave the postal service notice of his resignation.the government argues that green resigned on december,when he signed the settlement agreement and that his claim is therefore still time barred.green argues that he did not resign until february,when he submitted his retirement paperwork and that his claim is therefore timely.we need not resolve this issue.having concluded that the limitations period for green claim runs from the date he gave notice of his resignation,we leave it to the tenth circuit to determine when this in fact occurred.
for these reasons,we vacate the judgment of the tenth circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice alito,concurring in the judgment.
in its pursuit of a limitations rule for constructive discharge claims,the court loses sight of a bedrock principle of our title vii cases an act done with discriminatory intent must have occurred within the limitations period.we have repeatedly held that the time to pursue an employment discrimination claim starts running when a discriminatory act occurs,and that a fresh limitations period does not start upon the occurrence of a later nondiscriminatory act even if that later act carries forward the effects of the earlier discrimination.see,united air lines,evans,delaware state college ricks,chardon fernandez,per curiam lorance technologies,national railroad passenger corporation morgan,ledbetter goodyear tire rubber.without mentioning this consistent line of precedent,the court categorically declares that the limitations period for constructive discharge cases starts upon the employee resignation,no matter when the last discriminatory act occurred.this effectively disposes of the requirement.
rather than jettison our precedent,i would hold that the limitations period for constructive discharge claims like all other employment discrimination claims starts running upon a discriminatory act of the employer.but i would also hold that an employee resignation can,in many cases,be considered a discriminatory act of the employer.this is so where an employer subjects an employee to intolerable working conditions with the discriminatory intent to force the employee to resign.in these circumstances,the employee consequent resignation is tantamount to an intentional termination by the,and so gives rise to a fresh limitations period just as a conventional termination would.absent such intent,however,the resignation is not an independent discriminatory act but merely a delayed consequence of earlier discrimination.the resignation may be a basis for enhancing damages in a claim brought on the underlying discrimination,but it can not restart the limitations clock.
in this case,green presented sufficient evidence that the postal service intended to force him to resign when it presented him with a settlement agreement requiring that he either retire or transfer to a distant post office for much less pay.accordingly,the window for him to initiate counseling opened when he gave the postal service notice of his resignation.
the regulation at issue here requires a federal employee who complains of unlawful discrimination to initiate contact with an equal employment opportunity eeo counselor within days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.cfr a.the court observes that this language is not particularly helpful in resolving the question presented,and so it quickly moves on to other considerations.ante,at.i think that more can be discerned from the regulation text.the court observes that a matter in this context is an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.black law dictionary ed.ante,at.but the court fails to plug in the regulation critical qualifier the matter must be alleged to be.the phrase matter alleged to be discriminatory is thus most fairly read to refer to the allegation of discrimination that underlies an employee claim,not just any fact that supports the claim.
even if the regulation text were unclear on this point,the next place i would look is not to a standard rule governing limitations periods,as the majority does,but to the specific limitations rules we apply in other title vii cases.title vii plaintiffs are required to file a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc within or days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.e see morgan,supra construing this statutory provision although this language is not identical to the regulation at issue here,nothing in either text requires that they be read as setting different rules.indeed,the eeoc compliance manual treats them the same it describes the regulation as requiring federal employees to contact a counselor within days of the alleged discriminatory employment practice,and it cites morgan as providing the governing standard we also granted review in this case on the premise that the same rule would apply to both and title vii cases green petition and merits brief ask us to decide when the filing period for constructive discharge claims begins as a matter of federal employment discrimination law generally,pet.for cert.i brief for petitioner i,and the circuit split he alleges consists primarily of cases in which the limitations period ran from the date of an unlawful employment practice,see pet.for cert.the majority,for its part,seems to agree that the same rules should apply in the federal and private sectors,and it too relies on cases in describing the circuit split that today decision is meant to resolve.ante,at,and nn.the majority relegation of our title vii timeliness cases to its rebuttal argument,see ante,at,is thus surprising.
our title vii precedents set somewhat different limitations rules for claims based on a discrete act of discrimination such as termination,failure to hire,or demotion and claims based on a hostile work environment.i will focus on the former set of rules because green resignation was a discrete act that was precipitated by another discrete act namely,the settlement agreement that required him to retire or transfer to a,lower paying position.for claims based on discrete acts,the limitations period starts to run on the day the discriminatory act occurred and expires or days later.morgan,at.this means that an act done with discriminatory intent not merely some act bearing on the claim must have occurred within the limitations period.we therefore held in morgan that discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred,even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges,and that a act can not justify filing a charge concerning a termination that was not independently discriminatory.at emphasis added.
we spoke even more directly to the point in ledbetter.there we described discriminatory intent as the defining element of a title vii claim,at,and held that the plaintiff claim of pay discrimination was untimely because she did not allege that any intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the limitations period,at.although the plaintiff had suffered lower pay within the limitations period because of earlier alleged discrimination,we explained that under our precedents a new limitations does not commenc e upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.ibid.discussing evans,ricks,lorance,and morgan,supra.relying on nondiscriminatory acts to establish a timely claim,we reasoned,would impermissibly shift intent from one act the act that consummates the discriminatory employment practice to a later act that was not performed with bias or discriminatory motive.the effect of this shift would be to impose liability in the absence of the requisite intent.at.at the same time,we recognized that when multiple acts that are each intentionally discriminatory occur,a fresh violation takes place and thus a new limitations period starts running when each act is committed.at 
these principles lead to the following rule for constructive discharge cases an employee resignation triggers a fresh limitations period if the resignation itself constitutes an intentionally discriminatory act of the employer.in my view,an employee resignation in the face of working conditions can be considered a discriminatory act of the employer when the employer makes conditions intolerable with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to resign.if the employer lacks that intent,however,the limitations period runs from the discriminatory act that precipitated the resignation.
this approach reflects the fact that there are two kinds of constructive discharge.much of the disagreement between the majority and dissent stems from their differing views of the nature of constructive discharge.to the majority,constructive discharge is always a standalone claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.ante,at.to justice thomas and the friend of the court we appointed to defend the judgment below,constructive discharge is never a separate claim,but merely a counterdefense to an employer contention that a resignation was voluntary that allows the resigning employee to recover backpay and other relief unavailable to employees who quit voluntarily.post,at.as i see it,each side is partly right.the label constructive discharge is best understood to refer to two different though related concepts,one a distinct claim and one not.this case requires us to distinguish between the two and to identify with care the specific employment practice that is at issue.ledbetter,supra,at citing morgan,supra,at.
the first kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer subjects an employee to intolerable conditions with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to quit.in this situation,the employer has deliberately terminated the employee a discrete employment action.the discharge is termed constructive,however,because it is formally effected by the employee resignation rather than the employer pink slip.the termination can nevertheless be considered a discriminatory act of the employer because the employer intends to terminate the employee and through the imposition of intolerable conditions forces the employee to rubberstamp that decision by resigning.staub proctor hospital,alito,concurring in judgment,at majority opinion animus and responsibility for an adverse action can both be attributed to an agent if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent discriminatory conduct because the resignation is the act that consummates the discriminatory employment practice of terminating the employee,ledbetter,supra,at,it triggers a fresh limitations period.in such cases,the constructive discharge should,like a formal discharge,be treated as a distinct cause of action what we might call a proper constructive discharge claim.
the employer discriminatory intent sometimes will manifest itself only outside the limitations period.consider,for example,an employer that demotes an employee say,from executive to office assistant for discriminatory reasons and with the intent that the loss of prestige will force the employee to quit.by the time the employee finally cracks and resigns,the discriminatory demotion may be outside the limitations window and not independently actionable.but the employer discriminatory intent to terminate the employee can carry forward to the eventual resignation.we recognized this possibility in ledbetter.we explained that a plaintiff generally can not create a timely title vii claim by attach ing the discriminatory intent accompanying an act outside the limitations period to another act that occurred within the limitations period,at.at the same time,we acknowledged that there may be instances where the elements forming a cause of action discriminatory intent and an employment action span more than days that is,the applicable limitations period,at.in such a case,we said,the limitations period would start to run when the employment practice was executed,because that is when t he act and intent had been joined.ibid.under my example,then,the employer forms an illegal discriminatory intent to terminate the employee at the time of the demotion,but the termination is not executed or consummated until the employee resigns some time later,at.only at that point have the discriminatory intent to terminate and the act of termination been joined,and therefore only at that point does the limitations period for the wrongful discharge start to run.
the second kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer imposes intolerable conditions for discriminatory reasons but does not intend to force an employee to resign.this is quite different from an ordinary discharge because the critical element of intent is missing.the resignation can not be considered an intentionally discriminatory act of the employer because it is not something the employer deliberately brought about it is simply a consequence of the earlier discrimination.the resignation thus does not trigger a fresh limitations period or give rise to a separate cause of action.see evans,at a nondiscriminatory act that gives present effect to a past act of discrimination is not actionable ricks,at t he proper focus is upon the time of the discriminatory acts,not upon the time at which the consequences of the acts became most painful internal quotation marks and brackets omitted ledbetter,supra,at a new violation does not occur,and a new limitations period does not commence,upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination 
this does not let the employer off the hook.it is still liable for the acts of discrimination that precipitated the resignation,provided that the employee properly and timely challenges them.and in a suit brought on those underlying acts,the resignation if reasonable is assimilated to a formal discharge for remedial purposes.pennsylvania state police suders,emphasis added.the resigning employee can recover,as damages for the underlying discrimination,all damages that would be available for formal discharge but which are normally unavailable to employees who voluntarily quit,at,see post,at thomas,dissenting.a resignation that is the reasonable but unintended result of the employer discriminatory acts thus does not lead to a standalone constructive discharge claim.instead,it is a basis for increasing damages on the underlying discrimination claim what we might call a constructive discharge damages enhancement.see suders,supra,at analogizing constructive discharge to an actual termination in respects 
the majority asserts that in suders the court expressly held that constructive discharge is always its own distinct claim.ante,at.i do not think that the suders court would have taken such pains to qualify its statements that a constructive discharge is akin to an actual termination for remedial purposes and in respects,at,had that been its intention.nor was it necessary for the court to resolve whether constructive discharge is a separate cause of action or merely a basis for enhancing damages.the majority observes that suders referred to a claim for constructive discharge.see ante,at.but the use of that term does not indicate that constructive discharge is always an independent cause of action any more than stray references to a claim for punitive damages,bmw of north america,gore,mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,mean that punitive damages are actionable independent of an underlying tort claim.
the majority also asserts that intent to cause a resignation is unnecessary for a constructive discharge cause of action because the whole point of constructive discharge is to treat the resignation like a firing.ante,at.i had thought that the whole point of a title vii claim was to combat intentional discrimination.see,watson fort worth bank trust,blackmun,joined by brennan and marshall,concurring in part and concurring in judgment a challenge focuses exclusively on the intent of the employer a resignation can not be deemed the equivalent of an actionable intentional termination if the employer lacks intent to terminate.see staub,at holding that a person who did not intend to cause a dismissal can not be deemed responsible for the dismissal,even if the dismissal was the result or foreseeable consequence of the person actions see also,at intentional torts such as this generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act,not simply the act itself internal quotation marks omitted.but as i have explained,a resignation in those circumstances may still be treated like a firing for damages purposes.our cases demand nothing more.
the framework i propose respects the fundamental rule that an act done with discriminatory intent must have occurred within the limitations period.it also comports with the default rule that limitations periods start to run when a cause of action accrues.when an employer intends to force an employee to resign,the resignation gives rise to a new cause of action for constructive discharge,with a limitations period that runs from the date of the resignation.but when an employer does not intend to force the employee to resign,the employee only cause of action is based on the underlying discriminatory acts,and the limitations period runs from the time that claim accrued it is thus entirely unnecessary for the majority to abandon the requirement in service of the standard limitations rule.these two rules fit together perfectly once one appreciates the dual nature of constructive discharge.
it is abundantly clear that the majority has abandoned the requirement and would deem a constructive discharge claim timely even if no discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period.the majority admits as much.it declares that the employer discriminatory conduct and the employee resignation are both part of the matter alleged to be discriminatory,and therefore in its view the resignation may trigger the limitations period whatever the role of discrimination in the resignation element.ante,at emphasis added.to support this dubious proposition,the majority cites morgan holding that an individual act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable for the act to start a fresh limitations period.ante,at.this analogy is particularly inapt because green constructive discharge claim is based on a discrete act,not a hostile work environment.see supra,at.even setting that aside,morgan held only that an act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable by dint of its severity.that is because a hostile work environment claim is based on the cumulative effect of individual acts that may not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate title vii unless considered in the aggregate,at emphasis added.nothing in morgan suggests that the limitations period for a hostile work environment claim can run from an act that is not discriminatory.to the contrary,the court referred to individual act s of harassment such as racial jokes,racially derogatory acts,negative comments regarding the capacity of blacks to be supervisors,and various racial epithets as triggering the limitations period,at,emphasis added.
the majority opines that its rule is better for employees because it prevents the limitations period from expiring before an employee resigns.ante,at.things are not that simple.the majority rule benefits only those employees who can meet the demanding standard for constructive discharge,while setting a springe for those who can not.constructive discharge is an aggravated form of discrimination involving truly intolerable working conditions that leave an employee no choice but to resign.suders,at.this is an objective standard,at,and what is subjectively intolerable to a particular employee may strike a court or jury as merely unpleasant.
so imagine an employee who is subjected to sexual harassment at her federal workplace but relying on the majority rule does not pursue eeo counseling until days after the harassment leads her to resign.suppose too that the last act of harassment occurred the day before she resigned.if a court ultimately concludes that the harassment was objectively intolerable and the employee was justified in resigning,she can recover for the constructive discharge.but if it turns out that she has proved only ordinary discrimination without the something more needed to establish constructive discharge,at internal quotation marks omitted,the employee is doubly out of luck not only does her constructive discharge fail on the merits,but any lesser included hostile work environment claim that she might have brought and prevailed on,at,is time barred.encouraging employees to wait until after resigning to pursue discrimination claims thus may needlessly deprive unwary discrimination victims of relief.
the better approach is to encourage employees to seek eeo counseling or,in the private sector,file an eeoc charge at the earliest opportunity,based on the underlying discriminatory acts every allegation of constructive discharge must be based on an actionable discriminatory practice,see lindemann,grossman,weirich,employment discrimination law ed,for which the employee can immediately seek counseling and pursue a discrimination claim.if the employee later resigns,he or she can seek damages from the resignation as part of that timely claim.see supra,at,and.under the framework i have set forth,an employee who fails to pursue the underlying discrimination claim can still pursue a standalone constructive discharge claim so long as there is sufficient evidence that the employer acted with intent to force the employee to resign.this will often be the case when working conditions are so that a reasonable employee would be compelled to quit.the employer will usually be aware that conditions are terrible,and p roof that a defendant acted knowingly very often gives rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant also acted purposely.loughrin united states,alito,concurring in part and concurring in judgment slip,at but the possibility of recovering damages for only the constructive discharge,and not for discrimination suffered before the resignation,will be an unsatisfactory alternative for many employees who have suffered through unendurable working conditions.
it remains to apply the foregoing principles to this case.the tenth circuit held that the postal service was entitled to summary judgment on its limitations defense.the question therefore is whether green adduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the postal service intended to force his resignation when it presented him with the settlement agreement.if so,then the limitations period ran from the date of green resignation.
i have little trouble concluding that green has carried his burden.indeed,the postal service virtually concedes the point.it observes that the agreement expressly stated that green would retire,and provided for his reporting to duty in wamsutter,wyoming,only in the event that the retirement fell through.app.brief for respondent.a jury could reasonably conclude that the postal service,by offering green a choice between retiring and taking a lower paying job hundreds of miles away,to make him choose retirement.accordingly,for judgment purposes,the window for contacting an eeo counselor ran from the date on which green resigned or,more precisely,the date on which he gave the postal service notice of his retirement,see ante,at.
i am inclined to agree with green that viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to him he did not give notice of his retirement until he submitted his retirement papers,making his claim timely.although the settlement agreement provided that he would retire,it alternatively allowed him to transfer to wyoming.unless green would have been turned away from the wamsutter post office despite that language had he chosen to go there,it was not until green submitted his retirement papers that one could say with certainty that his position would be terminated rather than transferred.that said,like the majority i am content to leave this question for the tenth circuit to tackle on remand.i accordingly concur in the judgment.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice thomas,dissenting.
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits employers from engaging in discriminatory acts against their employees.under a equal employment opportunity commission eeoc regulation implementing title vii,federal employees who believe they have been discriminated against must consult a n eeoc counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally resolve the matter.cfr a.in particular,the aggrieved employee must initiate contact with a counselor within days of date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.a.
today,the majority holds that a matter alleged to be discriminatory includes a matter that is not discriminatory at all a federal employee decision to quit his job.ante,at.the majority reaches this conclusion by adopting an atextual reading of the regulation that expands the doctrine.consistent with the text of the regulation and history of the doctrine,i would hold that only an employer actions may constitute a matter alleged to be discriminatory.because the only employer action alleged to be discriminatory here took place more than days before petitioner marvin green contacted eeoc,his claims are untimely.i therefore respectfully dissent.
the meaning of a matter alleged to be discriminatory refers to actions taken by the employer,not the employee.this follows from the ordinary meaning of matter and discriminatory,as well as this court precedents.
i begin with the language of the regulation itself and the specific context in which that language is used.mcneill united states,brackets omitted.when a word or phrase is left undefined as matter alleged to be discriminatory is we consider its ordinary meaning.asgrow seed winterboer.a matter is a subject under consideration,esp.involving a dispute or litigation or s omething that is to be tried or proved an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.black law dictionary ed.the oxford english dictionary ed.matter means a n event,circumstance,fact,question,state or course of things,which is or may be an object of consideration or practical concern a subject,an affair,a business see ante,at embracing this view.the term discriminatory means characterized by differential treatment that lacks a sound justification.see the random house dictionary of the english language ed.discriminatory means characterized by or showing prejudicial treatment esp.as an indication of racial,religious,or sexual bias garner,a dictionary of modern legal usage discriminatory means applying discrimination in treatment,esp.on ethnic grounds black law dictionary discrimination means characterized by d ifferential treatment,a failure to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction can be found between those favored and those not favored thus,a matter alleged to be discriminatory means an employee allegation that he was treated in an unjustifiably differential manner.
in the context of employment discrimination,only an employer can discriminate against or apply unjustifiable differential treatment to an employee an employee can not plausibly be said to discriminate against himself.it therefore makes no sense to say that an employee act of quitting constitutes an action in which he was treated in a differential manner that lacked a sound justification.
and,it does not make any more sense to say that an employee decision to quit is itself discriminatory simply because it may result from antecedent discriminatory conduct.as two of our precedents national railroad passenger corporation morgan,and delaware state college ricks,illustrate,the matter alleged to be discriminatory is the reason the employee quit,and not the quitting itself.
in morgan,we rejected the argument that a phrase similar to matter alleged to be discriminatory namely,an alleged unlawful employment practice connotes an ongoing violation that can endure or recur over a period of time.at.we held that discrete discriminatory acts of the employer occurring outside a filing period were not actionable,even if connected to other acts within the period,at.the word practice,we explained,did not conver t related discrete acts into a single unlawful practice for the purposes of timely filing.at.the same is true of the word matter.see,eeoc compliance manual threshold issues c,equating matter alleged to be discriminatory with the alleged discriminatory employment 
practice online at as last visited,equating matter alleged to be discriminatory with the alleged discriminatory employment practice 
ricks complements morgan by holding that discrimination occurs when an employer takes some adverse action against the employee,and not when the employee feels the consequences of that action,at.in ricks,we considered the timeliness of an eeoc complaint that a professor filed after he was allegedly denied tenure on account of his national origin,at.the employer offered him a contract to teach one more year after it denied tenure,at.the professor contended that his claim did not accrue until his contract expired,because the offer of the contract constituted a continuing violation.at.we rejected that argument and explained that m ere continuity of employment,without more,is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment discrimination.see also chardon fernandez,per curiam holding that claims of administrators of the puerto rican department of education were untimely because their claims accrued when they received notice that they would be fired and not on the effective date of their terminations.
the alleged employer conduct that most immediately prompted green decision to quit was the postal service request on or about december,that he sign a settlement agreement.see app,app.it is irrelevant whether green decision to quit g a v e present effect to the past illegal act s and therefore perpetuate d the consequences of forbidden discrimination.ricks,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.because the postal service december request is the 
matter alleged to be discriminatory,green had days from december to initiate contact with eeoc because he was days late in doing so,his claim was untimely.
the majority reaches the opposite conclusion for three reasons.none withstands scrutiny.
first,the majority observes that the text of the regulation is not particularly helpful because the word matter simply means an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,which could readily apply to a resignation.ante,at.thus,the majority contends,matter could reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis for a claim,which,in its view,includes green decision to resign.ante,at.but,as explained,that interpretation does not grapple with the entire phrase,matter alleged to be discriminatory,which does not encompass the subsequent nondiscriminatory actions that the employee takes.
second,the majority contends that the standard rule for limitations periods informs its understanding of cfr.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.under this rule,the majority contends,a limitations period does not begin to run until there is a complete and present cause of action.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.the majority concludes that 
there is no complete and present cause of action for constructive discharge until an employee resigns.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
even assuming that an employee resignation was an essential part of a constructive discharge claim but see part ii,infra the standard rule is merely a default rule.graham county soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson.that default rule does not apply,however,where as here the text confirms that the limitations period begins to run before the cause of action accrues.
pillsbury united engineering,confirms this point.in that case,the court considered a statute that provided that t he right to compensation for disability shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the injury.at quoting a.the court held that the period began at the time of injury,not when the employee later became disabled as a result of the injury and concluded that congress meant what it said when it limited recovery to one year from date of injury,and injury does not mean disability.at.although that reading meant that an employee could be barred from filing his claim before his right to file it arises,the court refused to rewrite the statute of limitations to avoid that result.see also,dodd united states,giving effect to the clear text of a limitations provision even though that reading ma de it difficult for certain movants to obtain relief and could lead to harsh results 
like the limitations provision in pillsbury,cfr makes clear that the limitations period could begin before any claim accrues,lest what was intended to be a limitation be no limitation at all.at.the regulation instructs that the limitations period begins to run when the matter alleged to be discriminatory occurs,the discriminatory conduct of the employer.to say that this includes green resignation could have the effect of extending the limitation indefinitely.see part,supra.
finally,the majority downplays morgan and ricks by claiming that green resignation was not merely an inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered it is an essential part of his claim.ante,at.a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee,the majority contends,is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee.ante,at.this reasoning can not be reconciled with the regulatory text and fails to grapple with our precedents.by isolating green late response to the settlement agreement rather than his employer alleged coercion of green to sign that agreement,the majority ignores the discriminatory act and bestows on green an advantage that other employees subject to wrongful discrimination do not have.had green signed termination papers rather than settlement papers,there would be no question about the untimeliness of his claims.as in ricks,the time for green claim would have begun to run when his employer discriminated against him,even if the termination was not effective until months later,at see also chardon,at same.but today,the majority decides that green claim is different.in doing so,the majority elevates constructive discharge to the status of a super termination capable of extending a limitations period far beyond the time the employer acted discriminatorily.
the majority error is not merely one of regulatory misinterpretation.by misreading the regulation,the majority expands the doctrine beyond its original bounds.in particular,the majority cements the mistaken notion that constructive discharge is an independent cause of action and not a mere counterdefense by unjustifiably focusing on an employee response to an employer conduct.see,ante,at.in doing so,the majority exacerbates the problems that pennsylvania state police suders,first created in adopting a capacious definition of constructive discharge.
in holding that a discrimination claim based on constructive discharge accrues when an employee resigns,the majority wrongly assumes that constructive discharge is a separate claim equivalent to an actual discharge under title vii.ante,at.but the doctrine is best understood as a to the employer s defense that the worker voluntarily quit,and not a separate claim.eeoc gallagher,supp,sd,vacated in part on other grounds.
the national labor relations board nlrb developed the doctrine in the to address situations in which employers coerced employees to resign,often by creating intolerable working conditions,in retaliation for employees engagement in collective activities.suders,supra,at see also shuck,comment,that it,i quit returning to first principles in constructive discharge doctrine,berkeley empl.lab.an employee who voluntarily quit usually lost the right to backpay and other remedi
