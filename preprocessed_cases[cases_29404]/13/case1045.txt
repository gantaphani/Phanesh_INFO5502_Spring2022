discussion 
plaintiffs sue seeking tuition reimbursement for the school year under the idea.their claim is governed by the test,which looks to whether the school district proposed plan will provide the child with a free appropriate public education whether the parents private placement is appropriate to the child needs and a consideration of the equities.frank,at.under new york law,at the due process hearing,the department bears the burden of establishing the validity of the iep,while the parents bear the burden of establishing the appropriateness of the private placement.educ.law c

on appeal,plaintiffs allege that the department denied a free appropriate public education because it failed to include parents in school site selection failed to make express provisions for parent counseling and training failed to develop a functional behavioral assessment or adequate behavioral intervention plan and failed to offer an individualized placement that addressed demonstrated need for a classroom.they also argue that mccarton was an appropriate private placement and that the equities favor them.
upon review,we hold that,under,parents are entitled to tuition reimbursement,and we therefore vacate the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i.the department iep 
plaintiffs due process complaint 
the first element of the test looks to whether the school district proposed plan will provide the child with a free appropriate public education.before reaching the merits of plaintiffs allegations in that regard,we must consider whether any issues are foreclosed from review,as both the sro and district court held that some of the allegations were foreclosed because they were not pled in the due process complaint.
as explained above,parents must file a due process complaint in order to allege deficiencies in an iep.b a.after the filing of such a complaint,the department has a day resolution period in which to remedy any deficiencies.id.f.the department can not be expected to resolve problems of which it is unaware.accordingly,t he parents must state all of the alleged deficiencies in the iep in their initial due process complaint in order for the resolution period to function,at.the idea further provides that t he party requesting the due process hearing shall not be allowed to raise issues at the due process hearing that were not raised in the complaint,unless the other party agrees otherwise.f b.district courts in this circuit have held that issues not raised in due process complaints are foreclosed from review in federal court,absent agreement from the opposing party.see,dep t of,cv mkb,wl,at,dirocco bd.of,civ.er,wl,at.
we hold that the waiver rule is not to be mechanically applied.the key to the due process procedures is fair notice and preventing parents from sandbag ging the school district by raising claims after the expiration of the resolution period.see,at.we note that the idea itself contemplates some flexibility.the statute does not require that alleged deficiencies be detailed in any formulaic manner,see b a ii,and the waiver rule limits only what may be raised at the due process hearing,id.f b see also d.
here,in their due process complaint,plaintiffs provided fair notice to the department of their claim concerning the lack of availability of the proposed site prior to september.they alleged in their due process complaint that a specific and identifiable placement was not timely and properly developed and determined at the time of the iep meeting.the allegation that the department had failed to provide a specific and identifiable placement in a timely manner surely encompasses the claim that the placement was not timely because the designated school site was unavailable until some two months after the placement was to begin.moreover,the issue of the unavailability of the proposed site until september was raised at the one of the department witnesses.it was only then that plaintiffs learned of the delayed availability of the placement.that claim,therefore,was properly raised before both the sro and the district court.
the district court also held that plaintiffs allegation that the department failed to consider a staffing ratio,instead considering only a ratio,was foreclosed.this too was error.with respect to this claim,both the iho and sro reached the issue on the merits,giving us a record for review.additionally,the dispute over the staffing ratio directly relates to maladaptive behaviors,which are at the heart of this dispute.the due process complaint plainly alleged that the department failed to appropriately develop plans for behavior.in addition,the proposed solution was a recommendation that continue at mccarton,where he would remain in a placement.the department,which relied on mccarton records in making its iep determinations,was aware of this.accordingly,the staffing ratio issue is properly considered by the federal courts.
b.the merits of plaintiffs claims 
the first element of the test has two components.at the first step,courts examine whether there were procedural violations of the idea,namely,whether the state has complied with the procedures set forth in the idea,at internal quotation marks omitted.procedural violations only entitle parents to reimbursement if they impeded the child right to a free appropriate public education,significantly impeded the parents opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking process,or caused a deprivation of educational benefits.f e ii.second,courts examine whether the iep was substantively adequate,namely,whether it was reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,at.substantive inadequacy automatically entitles the parents to reimbursement.id.
here,plaintiffs allege three procedural violations that the department denied a free appropriate public education because it failed to include parents in school site selection that it failed to develop a functional behavioral assessment or adequate behavioral intervention plan and that the department failed to make express provisions for parent counseling and training.substantively,they allege that the department ignored uniform evidence that required a placement and instead assigned to a placement.our review is guided by our recent case,r,decided after the district court issued its decision in this litigation.in the consolidated appeals in,we considered the appropriateness in idea litigation of allowing school districts to supplement an iep with retrospective testimony of services that were not listed in the iep.at.we held that an iep must be evaluated prospectively as of the time it was created.id.at.retrospective evidence that materially alters the iep is not permissible.id.on appellate review,we disregard the retrospective testimony improperly relied upon by the sro and the district court.considering the remaining evidence,we hold that the department failed to provide with a free appropriate public education.
plaintiffs first allege that the department erred in failing to include parents in site selection.the record shows that the specific school site was not discussed by the committee or included in the iep.additionally,the recommended placement site,ps at ps,was not available until september,despite the fact that.placement began in july.the idea requires school districts to ensure that the parents of each child with a disability are members of any group that makes decisions on the educational placement of their child.e emphasis added see also c.however,we have interpreted the term educational placement to refer to the general educational program such as the classes,individualized attention and additional services a child will receive rather than the bricks and mortar of the specific school.dep t of,cir.thus,while the failure to specify a school site may render an iep substantively inadequate,it does not constitute a per se procedural violation of the idea.id.here,the department complied with the idea by including parents in the determination of the type of placement,the placement at a department school.while we acknowledge the difficulties that plaintiffs had in communicating with the school site,these difficulties did not change the type of placement and therefore did not violate the procedures of the idea.
next,plaintiffs contend that the department erred in failing to include parent counseling or training in the iep.new york law requires school districts to include provisions for parent counseling and training.nycrr kk d.here,the department failed to do so.because the iep must be evaluated prospectively,without recourse to retrospective testimony,the department can not cure such violations by offering testimony that counseling and training would have been offered,at.we also note that the sro previously held that parent training and counseling must be identified on the iep as a related service.ex rel.dep t of,cv kam,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted,report and recommendation adopted by cv kam rlm,wl,aff sub nom,at.accordingly,we hold that the department failure to include such provisions in the iep was a procedural violation.
finally,plaintiffs allege that the department failed to develop an appropriate functional behavioral assessment or behavioral intervention plan,as required by state law.see nycrr r mmm b v a b.to the extent that plaintiffs claim rests on the department failure to produ
