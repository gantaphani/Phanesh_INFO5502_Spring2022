this case involves two ordinances enacted by the city of providence,rhode island,the city to reduce the incidence of tobacco use by young people.the ordinances restrict the city tobacco and cigarette retailers from reducing prices on tobacco products by means of coupons and certain discounts the price ordinance and restrict sales of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes the flavor ordinance.the national association of tobacco outlets,et collectively national association,contends that the price ordinance violates the first amendment and that both ordinances are preempted by federal and state law.the district court held that the ordinances were neither preempted nor otherwise invalid.we affirm.
on january,the city of providence adopted two ordinances concerning the sale of tobacco products.the price ordinance prohibits licensed retailers from accept ing or redeem ing,or offer ing to accept or redeem any coupon that provides any tobacco products without charge or for less than the listed or price,and from sell ing tobacco products to consumers through any discounts,offers.providence,code of ordinances the flavor ordinance prohibits most retailers from selling flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes,such as flavored cigars,pipe tobacco,snuff,chewing tobacco,dipping tobacco,and other flavored tobacco products.id.it provides that i t shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale any flavored tobacco product to a consumer,except in a smoking bar.id 
the history of the providence city council the council consideration of these ordinances demonstrates that they were designed to reduce youth tobacco use.the councilperson who sponsored the ordinances urged that they would reduce the unacceptably high rate of youth smoking in the city.the council president stated that the ordinances reflected a approach to try to protect our youth from the dangers of nicotine.
the council heard testimony that,despite prior efforts to curb teen smoking,of high school students and of middle school students in providence had tried tobacco.during compliance checks conducted immediately before the ordinances were passed,roughly one in five providence retailers sold cigarettes to minors in violation of state and local laws,and of providence retailers were selling flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes.over of new smokers begin prior to the age of eighteen.the testimony and data submitted to the city council showed that youth are particularly sensitive to tobacco price increases and such youth are vulnerable to flavored tobacco products the council concluded that the ordinances would be effective measures to combat youth tobacco use.
on february,shortly after the council passed the ordinances,national association filed suit in district court alleging that the ordinances violated both federal and state law.its complaint alleged,inter alia,that both ordinances violated the first amendment because they were impermissible regulations of commercial speech that the price ordinance was preempted by the federal cigarette advertising and labeling act the labeling act,b that the flavor ordinance was preempted by the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca,a a and that,under state law,the ordinances were also preempted and violated the licensing provisions of the rhode island constitution.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
along with its motion,the city submitted various affidavits,including a declaration from an economics expert concluding that e xtensive economic research demonstrates that increases in cigarette and other tobacco product prices are highly effective in reducing cigarette smoking and the use of other tobacco products,particularly among young people,and another from a public health expert concluding that the prohibition on the redemption of coupons and discounts as contained in the providence price ordinance would most likely have a real and measurable effect on smoking behavior,particularly in decreasing smoking among young people.the city also submitted a report of the surgeon general confirming that extensive use of promotions has led to higher rates of tobacco use among young people than would have occurred in the absence of these promotions.as to the flavor ordinance,another declaration from a different public health expert concluded that the flavor ordinance would substantially reduce the sale of flavored tobacco products to underage consumers and would reduce the attractiveness of these products to underage consumers.
on december,in a thorough and opinion,the district court denied national association motion and granted the city motion,upholding the ordinances in all relevant respects see ass of tobacco outlets,city of providence,ml,wl.national association appealed.
we first consider national association challenge to the validity of the price ordinance under the first amendment.national association argues that the ordinance violates the first amendment because it bans protected commercial speech or,at minimum,expressive conduct and does not survive scrutiny under either central hudson gas electric public service commission,d,or united states,d.the city argues that the price ordinance merely regulates pricing and not speech and that such price regulation falls outside the ambit of the first amendment.
the district court agreed with the city,concluding that national association fail ed to establish that the practice of reducing the price of cigarettes and tobacco products through coupons and discounts is subject to constitutional protection.ass n,wl,at citing wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir.it concluded that central hudson is inapplicable because section is a means to control the price of cigarettes and tobacco products in providence without implicating commercial speech,and that is inapplicable because the regulated conduct is not inherently expressive.id.we agree that the price ordinance does not violate the first amendment.
pricing information concerning lawful transactions has been held to be protected speech by the supreme court.see.state pharmacy bd.citizens consumer council,d.but the ordinance here does not restrict the dissemination of pricing information generally.nothing in the price ordinance restricts retailers or anyone else from communicating pricing information concerning the lawful sale price of cigarettes.rather,the ordinance has more limited objectives.it restricts the ability of retailers to engage in certain pricing practices,namely accepting or redeeming coupons for tobacco purchases,and selling tobacco products by way of discounting,and bars retailers from offering to engage in these prohibited pricing practices.see providence,code of ordinances.neither type of regulation is barred by the first amendment.
in liquormart,rhode island,d,a majority of the justices,in striking down the categorical ban on liquor price advertising there,made clear that price regulations and other forms of direct economic regulation do not implicate first amendment concerns.in determining the views of the court as a whole,we may aggregate the views expressed in the various separate opinions.see,league of united latin am.citizens perry,d moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d.the principal opinion representing the views of four justices explained that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech could have advanced the state purported interest in that case.liquormart,at stevens.it noted that higher prices can be maintained by direct regulation,and that p er capita purchases could be limited.id.
justice,joined by three justices,in this respect agreed with the principal opinion,explaining that the state had other methods at its disposal to discourage liquor consumption that included establishing minimum prices.id.at,concurring in the judgment.following the principal opinion,she explained that these alternative measures would have accomplished the state goals without intruding on sellers ability to provide truthful,nonmisleading information to customers.id.justice thomas,moreover,noted in his concurring opinion that regulations that would directly ban a product or control its price are the types of regulation s involving no restriction on speech regarding lawful activity at all.id.at thomas,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.these views,expressed by a majority of the court,make clear that price regulations designed to discourage consumption do not violate the first amendment.
nonetheless,national association argues that certain sales practices have an inherently expressive component that implicates the first amendment,and that this triggers scrutiny.national association relies on lorillard tobacco reilly,d.there,the supreme court concluded that the test might apply to massachusetts regulations of certain tobacco sales practices,but ultimately held that these practices withstood first amendment scrutiny.see id.at the regulations were directed toward cigarette,smokeless tobacco,and cigar retailers and bar red the use of displays and require d that tobacco products be placed out of the reach of all consumers in a location accessible only to salespersons.id.at.the supreme court recognized that these provisions regulated conduct that may have had a communicative component,id.at,because the regulated activity pertained to the display and dissemination of information to consumers.but lorillard did not decide that the displays did in fact have a communicative component or reject the views expressed in liquormart.we therefore agree with the district court that the regulation of prices,without more,does not rise to the level of regulation of inherently expressive conduct subject to scrutiny.see ass n,wl,at 
finally,national association argues that even if the restrictions on pricing do not violate the first amendment,the ordinance restriction on offers to accept these coupons or to engage in discounting is barred by the first amendment.we disagree.in central hudson,the supreme court made clear that t he government may ban commercial speech related to illegal activity.at see also pittsburgh press pittsburgh comm on human relations,d.more recently,in united states williams,the supreme court further established that o ffers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically excluded from first amendment protection,d emphasis added.this is based on the principle that offers to give or receive what it is unlawful to possess have no social value,and,accordingly,m any long established criminal as laws against conspiracy,incitement,and speech commercial or not that is intended to induce or commence illegal activities.id.at.
here,the offers and other forms of allegedly commercial speech restricted by the price ordinance are offers to engage in unlawful activity that is,sales of tobacco products by way of coupons and discounts,which are banned by the price ordinance itself.we agree with the district court that the provision only precludes licensed tobacco retailers from offering what the ordinance explicitly forbids them to do,and that offers to engage in banned activity may be freely regulated by the government.ass n,wl,at.the price ordinance does not violate the first amendment.
national association alternatively argues that both the flavor ordinance and the price ordinance are preempted by federal law.f ederal preemption is a question of statutory construction that we review de novo.difiore am.airlines,cir.t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in determining whether a particular state or local law is preempted.altria,good,d internal quotation marks omitted.when addressing questions of express or implied,the court begin s its analysis with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.these historic powers include the protection of the health and welfare of the state citizens.napier atl.coast line.
we first consider the preemptive effect of the labeling act on the price ordinance.the purpose of the labeling act was to establish a comprehensive federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising.the preemption provision of the labeling act provides that n o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes,the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.b it is undisputed that the price ordinance is a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health.
even though the price ordinance itself refers to the regulation of coupons that are used for promotional purposes,see providence,code of ordinances definition of coupon,the city argues that the price ordinance does not relate to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes under b,because it relates to the regulation of conduct,rather than the communication of information relating to smoking and health.national association argues that the price ordinance regulates promotional activity.cases from other circuits interpreting b have held that discounting and distribution of coupons are promotional activities under the statute.grocery bd.of health,cir jones vilsack,cir.we can assume,without deciding,that this is correct.
building on the conclusion that such activities are promotional,in,jones vilsack determined that b of the labeling act preempted an iowa statute that banned retailers from,inter alia,provid ing free articles,products,commodities,gifts,or concessions in any exchange for the purchase of tobacco products.iowa code b see jones,at.national association urges that under jones vilsack coupon and discount regulation is preempted by the labeling act.but jones vilsack was decided under the pre statute.
in,congress enacted an exception to the b preemption provision that permits some restrictions on promotional activity.see family smoking prevention and tobacco control act,stat,codified at c.this exception states that 
notwithstanding b,a state or locality may enact statutes and promulgate regulations,based on smoking and health,that take effect after the effective date of the fsptca,imposing specific bans or restrictions on the time,place,and manner,but not content,of the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes.
notably,c was enacted in response to a portion of the lorillard supreme court decision separate from the first amendment portion discussed above,which held that various massachusetts regulations restricting outdoor and sale cigarette advertising were preempted by the labeling act.see lorillard,at.this portion of lorillard concluded that any tobacco advertising regulation motivated by concerns relating to smoking and health was preempted by the labeling act,even though the regulations merely govern ed the location,place,and not the content,of the advertising.id.at.national association admitted at oral argument,and commentators have agreed,that this provision was designed to essentially reverse the lorillard preemption ruling 
the amendment imposed two requirements for the exception the regulation must be and it must be a regulation of the time,place,or manner of the advertising or promotion.national association argues that the ordinance incorporates first amendment standards for determining what is and what is a time,place,and manner regulation.the preemption provision can not be read in this limited fashion because under that interpretation the exception would have virtually no application.national association,for example,argues that the price ordinance is not because it singles out coupons and discounts that reference tobacco.but on its face,the preemption exception to the labeling act extends to regulations that single out tobacco.the exception refers specifically to bans or restrictions on the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.c.the c exception would make no sense if it were read not to exempt regulations from preemption simply because they were directed toward tobacco use.so too all regulations that fall under b necessarily pertain to smoking and health,so congress must have assumed that provisions validated by the c exception would pertain to smoking and health,and in this respect did not need
