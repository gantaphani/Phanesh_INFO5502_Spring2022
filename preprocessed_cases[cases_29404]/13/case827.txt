elvin tomás jesús morales was convicted by a jury of violating a for using materials mailed,shipped,and transported in interstate or foreign commerce to produce a video recording of his sexually explicit encounters with a minor.on appeal,he argues that a,facially and as applied,is an unconstitutional exercise of congress commerce clause power,and that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction.finding appellant arguments unavailing,we affirm.
for purposes of our analysis,we can avoid recounting most of the lurid details of this case.in short,morales induced a girl,who was his and a member of his church,to have sex with him in a motel on at least five separate occasions.during the final two encounters,morales used materials and equipment that had moved in interstate commerce to videotape the pair sex acts.after his wife discovered the tape in the backseat of his car and played it,she informed the girl parents,who then contacted police.morales was duly arrested,charged,and indicted for two counts of violating a,which provides in pertinent part that 
a ny person who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct shall be punished as provided under subsection d,if that visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means 
morales jury trial produced a guilty verdict on both counts.after the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a judgment of acquittal,he was sentenced to months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release on each count,to be served concurrently,and fined with a special monetary assessment of.the district court ordered the federal sentence to be served concurrently with a state sentence based on charges filed for the same conduct at issue here.this appeal followed.
constitutional claim 
morales appears to bring both facial and challenges to the constitutionality of a.relying on united states lopez,d and united states morrison,d,morales urges that a is unconstitutional because it attempts to regulate intrastate child pornography created exclusively for personal use which,morales argues,does not affect interstate commerce.morales further argues that even if the statute is facially constitutional,it is unconstitutional as applied to him because his activities were not commercial in nature and did not implicate interstate commerce.we review constitutional challenges de novo.united states robinson,cir.
section a is part of a broad regulatory scheme that prohibits the production,receipt,transmission,and possession of child pornography.see.when this statute was originally enacted as part of the protection of children against sexual exploitation act of,a,stat,codified at et the act,it targeted production of child pornography only if the pornographic depiction itself was transported in interstate commerce,or if the defendant knew,or should have known,that the depiction would be transported in interstate commerce.in,congress amended the act by adding the jurisdictional element we have before us today only the materials used to produce the pornographic depictions must have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means to subject a potential defendant to liability.a.
lopez and morrison 
morales argues that the morales argues that the jurisdictional element in a is an unconstitutional exercise of congress commerce clause power in light of united states lopez,d and united states morrison,d.in lopez,the supreme court struck down the school zones act of gfsza,q a,which prohibited knowingly possessing a firearm within feet of a school.the supreme court enumerated three categories of activities that congress may properly regulate pursuant to the commerce clause 
first,congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.second,congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.finally,congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
lopez,at.citations omitted.since the gfsza regulated neither channels nor instrumentalities of interstate commerce,the lopez court analyzed the statute under the third category activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.id.at.
in finding the gfsza constitutionally infirm,the supreme court held that because the statute by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,it could not be upheld under precedents that approved regulations of activities that are connected with a commercial transaction that,when viewed in the aggregate,substantially affects interstate commerce.id.at.second,the court observed that the gfsza lacked a jurisdictional element that would ensure,through inquiry,that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce.id.finally,the court stated that although congressional findings about the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce were not required,such findings would have helped the court evaluate the impact of the activity on interstate commerce even though no such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye.id.at.based on these considerations,the court found the gfsza to be unconstitutional.id.at.
the supreme court amplified lopez holding five years later in morrison,when the court evaluated a federal civil remedy for victims of violence,as set forth in the violence against women act of vawa,a person who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender shall be liable to the party injured,in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages.there,as in lopez,the court was faced with another category three regulation,pertaining to activities that allegedly have a substantial relation to interstate commerce.morrison,at.drawing on its reasoning in lopez,the morrison court identified four factors to consider in determining whether a statute regulates an activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce whether the statute regulates economic or commercial activity whether the statute contains an express jurisdictional element that limits the reach of its provisions whether congress made findings regarding the regulated activity impact on interstate commerce and whether the link between the regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated.id.at.
in striking down the vawa,the court found that crimes of violence are not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity,and that the statute lacked a jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of congress power to regulate interstate commerce.id.at.further,the court held that while congress had made explicit findings regarding the serious impact that violence has on victims and their families,the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient,by itself,to sustain the constitutionality of commerce clause legislation.id.at.finally,the court found that a causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce would allow congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide,aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment,production,transit,or consumption.id.at.
the constitutionality of a on its face 
because a regulates neither channels nor instrumentalities of interstate commerce,we analyze the constitutionality of the statute as a category three regulation under lopez.accordingly,we must apply the four morrison factors to determine whether the statute regulates an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.to aid the clarity of our analysis,we take the four factors in a different order than the one presented in morrison.
congressional findings 
when congress originally passed the protection of children against sexual exploitation act of,which criminalized the sale and distribution for sale of child pornography,it supported the legislation with findings that child pornography has become a highly organized,multimillion dollar industr y that operate s on a nationwide scale and that the sale and distribution of such pornographic materials are carried on to a substantial extent through the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce,at,reprinted in,available at wl 
in,congress amended the act to,inter alia,eliminate the requirement that the production,receipt,transportation,or distribution of child pornography be for a pecuniary profit.congress did so because it found that this commercial purpose requirement created an enforcement gap many of the individuals who distribute materials covered by the statute do so by gift or exchange without any commercial motive and thus remain outside the coverage of this provision.see child protection act of,stat,at,reprinted in,available at wl.noting that g enerally,the domestic material is of the homemade variety,while the imported material is produced by commercial dealers,id.at,congress determined that the statutory regime must be updated to ensure effective prosecution of producers and distributors.
congress amended the act again two years later when it passed the child abuse victims rights act of,supporting the new civil remedies for victims by finding that child exploitation has become a dollar industry,infiltrated and operated by elements of organized crime,and by a nationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children,stat.
in,congress amended the act to redefine child pornography as any visual depiction,including any photograph,film,video,picture,or computer or image or picture,whether made or produced by electronic,mechanical,or other means,of sexually explicit conduct,where such visual depiction has been created,adapted,or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.c.in passing those amendments,congress found that the existence of a traffic in child pornographic images inflames the desires of child molesters,pedophiles,and child pornographers who prey on children,thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography child pornography protection act of,stat,available at wl.the senate report also explained that prohibiting the possession and viewing of child pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to rid themselves of or destroy the material,thereby helping to eliminate the market for the sexual exploitative use of children.id.at.
finally,congress amended the act again in,establishing jurisdiction for the production of child pornography if the visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,a,which is the provision now before us.congress offered two reasons for this amendment.first,it wanted the new jurisdictional element of the production statute to mirror the existing jurisdictional element of the possession statutes see,at,reprinted in,available at wl.second,congress was concerned about federal law enforcement current inability to prosecute a number of cases where the defendant produced the child pornography but did not intend to transport the images in interstate commerce.id.at.
given this comprehensive backdrop,there is no question that congress has made explicit findings about the extensive national market in child pornography and the need to diminish that national market by prohibiting the production of child pornography at the local level.
b.the commercial or economic nature of the regulated activity 
the congressional finding over years ago that child pornography is a multimillion dollar industry that operates on a nationwide scale emphasizes that the underlying activity regulated by the child pornography production,distribution,and possession of child commercial activity,unlike the activity addressed by the federal legislation struck down in lopez and morrison.as the lopez court stated,the gfsza by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly one might define those terms.lopez,at.the morrison court made a similar observation crimes of violence are not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity.morrison,at.possessing firearms in a school zone and committing violence do not involve goods or services that can be bought and sold.there are no markets for these activities.in contrast,there are large markets for child pornography.w hen a person produces for his own consumption a product that is traded in an interstate market,his conduct is economic in character.united states kallestad,cir upholding the constitutionality of a b.in contrast,then,to lopez and morrison,the regulated activity child an economic activity.see also united states buculei,cir there can be no doubt that the production of visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,child pornography,is economic in nature.
c.the express jurisdictional element 
as previously discussed,the statute only reaches child pornography if that visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means a.importantly,the jurisdictional element discussed here,and the requirement of a substantial impact on interstate commerce,discussed in the next section,are distinct inquiries.at a minimum,the presence of a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of congress regulation of interstate commerce.morrison,at.in addition to this express invocation of commerce clause power,the jurisdictional element may also serve to ensure that the defendant conduct has at least some explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce and limit the statute reach to such cases.id.at.
morales complains that because puerto rico is an island heavily dependent on imports,the jurisdictional element of a,which requires only that the materials of production have moved in interstate commerce,does not limit the statute reach at all.he makes a fair point about this jurisdictional element that applies to any locale in the united states.as the third circuit observed in ruling on the same statute as a practical matter,the limiting jurisdictional factor is almost useless here,since all but the most child pornographers will rely on film,cameras,or chemicals that traveled in interstate commerce united states rodia,cir.
there are instances,however,where the jurisdictional element of a statute will more effectively limit the number of cases that fall under the purview of the statute,as envisioned by the supreme court.for example,in passing a federal arson statute,congress criminalized damaging or destroying,by means of fire or an explosive,any property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.i supp.iv emphasis added.in jones united states,d,the supreme court reversed a conviction under this statute for the arson of a purely private residence.the court found that by criminalizing the arson of property only if it was used in commerce or commerce affecting activities,id.at,congress did not intend to exercise its full power under the commerce clause,leaving residential arson cases to the law enforcement authorities of the states.id.at.as the supreme court noted the key word is used.congress did not define the crime described in i as the explosion of a building whose damage or destruction might affect interstate commerce id.at.quoting united states mennuti,cir.the supreme court read the jurisdictional element of i as evidence of congress recognition of the distinction between legislation limited to activities in commerce and legislation invoking congress full power over activity substantially affecting commerce.jones,at.quoting russell united states,d alteration in original.the jurisdictional element of the federal arson statute,then,required a somewhat heightened nexus between the defendant conduct and an effect on interstate commerce.see united states fenton,wl,at cir.may,explaining that the jones court concluded that an private dwelling did not have a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to satisfy the jurisdictional element because the owner was not actively using the property in a way that affected interstate commerce.as fenton and jones itself make clear,congress limited the reach of the arson statute to property that was used directly in interstate commerce or that was used in activities that affected interstate commerce.
in passing a,however,congress formulated a broader jurisdictional element that both invokes its commerce clause power and purports to exercise that power by reaching any child pornography that was produced using materials that moved in interstate commerce.although this jurisdictional element ensures that any prosecuted conduct has a minimal nexus with interstate commerce,that minimal nexus may not meet the substantial effect requirement of morrison.in rodia,the third circuit found it at least doubtful that the jurisdictional element adequately performs the function of guaranteeing that the final product regulated substantially affects interstate commerce.rodia,at.we agree with this observation.
if the jurisdictional element bore sole responsibility for establishing that the impact of the regulated activity on interstate commerce is substantial or direct,the language of a likely would not be up to the task.the jurisdictional element focuses on things such as film,cameras,videotapes,and recorders moving in interstate commerce,which are then used to produce child pornography.as a matter of logic,this commerce clause premise has the kind of flaw so worrisome to the supreme court in lopez and could justify federalizing a vast array of crimes now prosecuted by the states,solely because the criminal used materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate of foreign commerce by any means.see lopez,at.explaining that if congress could regulate criminal acts simply because they have external costs or affect national productivity,it would be difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power,even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where states have historically been sovereign.moreover,the congressional findings about the link between the regulated activity production of child pornography and interstate commerce did not claim that the market for child pornography was increasing the demand for film and cameras.the focus,instead,was on a different relationship between local production of child pornography and the national market for the child pornography itself.this is the link that is the focus of the separate inquiry in the following section about the substantial effect of the regulated activity on interstate commerce.
however,the disconnect between the interstate commerce activity described in the jurisdictional element of a and the interstate commerce activity the national market for child pornography that prompted congress to criminalize the production of child pornography is not fatal to the constitutionality of the statute.indeed,even a complete absence of a jurisdictional element in the text of a statute is not fatal to a statute challenged on commerce clause grounds.i n lopez,the court simply did not state or imply that all criminal statutes must have such an element,or that any statute without such an element is per se unconstitutional.united states wilson,cir.see also rancho viejo,llc norton,t he absence of such a jurisdictional element simply means that courts must determine independently whether the statute regulates activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction,which viewed in the aggregate,substantially affect interstate commerce.quoting united states moghadam,cir.on the other hand,any statute enacted pursuant to the congress commerce clause power that does not regulate channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,must regulate activity that has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.otherwise,courts will strike it down as unconstitutional.we now turn to that substantial effect inquiry.
d.the link between the regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate commerce 
the final morrison factor asks whether the link between the regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated.morrison,at.given the manifest nature of the national child pornography market,and congress related findings,there is no question that congress can regulate the national child pornography market.the issue,then,is whether congress may reach local,intrastate conduct in order to effectively regulate a national,interstate market.kallestad,at.
the seminal case in this area remains wickard filburn.there,the supreme court upheld the agricultural adjustment act,which levied penalties on crops that exceeded the act quota.filburn,a farmer who grew wheat exclusively for consumption on his own farm,challenged the constitutionality of the act,arguing that the breadth of the regulation exceeded congress commerce clause authority because it reached purely local production and consumption.in upholding the statute,the supreme court ruled that congress could regulate intrastate activity when such activity,taken in the aggregate,might ultimately have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.wickard,at.even if appellee activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce,it may still,whatever its nature,be reached by congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.
defendant argues that lopez and morrison prohibit applying the aggregation principle to the child pornography laws.we have encountered this argument before in relation to a b,which uses language analogous to a to criminalize possession of child pornography see united states robinson,cir.because of the similarities in the statutory language,we find the analysis of a b persuasive in assessing the constitutionality of a.see united states holston,cir finding a b precedent applicable when considering a challenge to a because the relevant jurisdictional language is equivalent united states galo,cir same.
in robinson,we upheld the constitutionality of a b because the local possession of child pornography through repetition elsewhere helps to create and sustain a market for sexually explicit materials depicting minors.robinson,at quoting lopez,at.echoing the congressional findings that child pornography inflames the desires of child molesters,pedophiles,and child pornographers who prey on children,thereby increasing the creation and distribution of child pornography,robinson held that b y outlawing purely intrastate possession of child pornography,congress can curb the nationwide demand for these materials.id 
as the third circuit observed,t here is a subtle transformation at work in applying the wickard aggregation rationale to situations where the production and consumption of a commodity does not necessarily substitute for a commercially produced version that the defendant would otherwise have purchased in the marketplace.rodia,at.the rodia court noted that wickard has not been limited strictly to scenarios of commodity substitution,however,and wickard generic intrastate activity,if repeated,may substantially affect interstate commerce,is still sound.in both lopez and morrison,the supreme court reaffirmed the vitality of wickard while emphasizing that its aggregation principle should be applied only to statutes that regulate economic or commercial activities.lopez,at.morrison,at.
in addition to our own precedent applying wickard principles to a child pornography statute in robinson,the supreme court long ago recognized that child pornography is a commodity influenced by and subject to economic market forces.see osborne ohio,d finding that it is surely reasonable for the state to conclude that it will decrease the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the product,thereby decreasing demand while upholding an ohio pornography statute against a first amendment challenge.as the seventh circuit succinctly said a market has two sides,supply and demand without both,the market collapses.united states richardson,cir discussing a and a b in a sentencing context.see also kallestad,at a true market is inevitably commercial,and is pushed by supply and demand,whether manifested in swaps or purchase and sale.in robinson,we addressed possession,the demand side of the child pornography market.here,we address production,the supply side of that market.while possessing child pornography fuels the demand side of the market,producing child pornography fuels the supply side of the market.the same logic we used in robinson applies here by outlawing the purely local production of child pornography,congress can curb the nationwide supply for these materials.see robinson,at.the prohibition on intrastate production curb s the supply of child pornography at its source,before it is released into the interstate market.rodia,at.
defendant reading of lopez and morrison ignores our analysis in robinson.producing child pornography is an economic activity because it creates a product for which there is an extensive national market,and in every case where we have sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in wickard,the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial character.morrison,at.citation omitted.
here,congress wishes to regulate the availability of child pornography in the national market.because a significant portion of the child pornography about which congress was concerned is homegrown,untraceable,and enters the national market surreptitiously,the second circuit conclude d that congress,in an attempt to halt interstate trafficking,can prohibit local production that feeds the national market and stimulates demand,as this production substantially affects interstate commerce.holston,at.we agree.often,as is the case here,it is necessary to control local behavior to ensure the effectiveness of interstate regulation.see nlrb jones laughlin steel.see also kallestad,at w e have little hesitation in concluding that where the product is fungible,such that it is difficult if not impossible to trace,congress can prohibit local possession in an effort to regulate product supply and demand and thereby halt interstate trade.we conclude,therefore,that a reaches intrastate activity that substantially affects the interstate child pornography market.it is a facially valid exercise of congress commerce clause power 
the constitutionality of a as applied to morales 
we turn now to morales claim that a is unconstitutional as applied to him.in support of that position,the defendant argues that his individual conduct falls outside the class of activity properly regulated by congress because although he may have engaged in sexually explicit conduct with a minor for the purpose of producing visual depictions for his own gratification,the evidence has shown that defendant did not purchase,trade,sell or barter the pornography,nor did he have any intention to do so.this argument is unpersuasive.when congress regulates a class of activities that substantially affects interstate commerce,a defendant claim that his personal activities did not affect interstate commerce fails if his activity is within that class.when a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce,the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.lopez,at.quoting maryland wirtz,d.here,congress authorized punishment for any person who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,including intrastate production of child pornography for personal use.a.contrary to morales arguments,the government is not required to prove that the defendant actions,standing alone,had an effect on interstate commerce,and the fact that morales did not sell or distribute the pornographic tapes of himself and the minor is irrelevant 
in reaching this conclusion,we do not reject all possible commerce clause challenges to a and the related child pornography statutes to amplify this point,we distinguish between different types of challenges.there is the kind of challenge we have in this claim that conduct clearly within the language of the statute inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction is nevertheless beyond the power of congress to criminalize because the perpetrator does not intend to sell or distribute the visual depiction.this claim fails because congress power to criminalize this conduct pursuant to the commerce clause turns on the economic nature of the class of conduct defined in the statute rather than the economic facts such as sale or distribution of a single case.as we have already indicated,lopez and morrison proscribe this kind of challenge.
however,there are challenges that might focus on facts other than the economic facts of the particular case.these facts could include the age of the minor,the relationship between the defendant and the minor,the nature of the allegedly sexually explicit conduct,and the nature of the visual depiction of that conduct.in a given prosecution,some of these facts could raise constitutional privacy concerns or concerns that the conduct at issue,although covered by the language of the statute,was not within the sphere of activity identified by congress as the basis for its exercise of power under the commerce clause.in lopez and morrison,the supreme court consulted legislative history for congress judgment about the conduct it wished to regulate and the relationship between that conduct and interstate commerce.see lopez,at.morrison,at.here,the legislative history of the child pornography statutes reveals that congress exercised its commerce clause power because of its concern about the extensive child exploitation industry child exploitation has become a dollar industry,infiltrated and operated by elements of organized crime,and by a nationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children,stat.see also,stat,available at wl.accordingly,the absence of such exploitation in a given case might be relevant to the inquiry.
two of our sister courts have upheld challenges to the analogous possession statute,a b,and morales relies heavily on their reasoning.see united states corp,cir united states mccoy,cir.in corp,the defendant plead guilty to a single count of possession based on a picture of a girl,taken shortly before her eighteenth birthday,engaging in consensual sexual activity with corp wife.noting that corp was not involved,nor intended to be involved,in the distribution or sharing with others of the pictures in question,and that the minor was not an exploited child nor a victim in any real and practical sense in this case,the sixth circuit stated that we do not determine the aggregate effect on interstate commerce of the purely intrastate dealing in child pornography.instead,we conclude that corp activity was not of a type demonstrated substantially to be connected or related to interstate commerce on the facts of this case.corp,at.
the ninth circuit,relying on corp,reached a similar conclusion in mccoy.there,a mother was prosecuted under the possession statute for a single picture of her and her daughter with their genital areas exposed.faced with a defendant who was intoxicated when her husband took the picture,and who clearly was not a pedophile or sexual predator,the ninth circuit stated that no one claims that the mother is or is likely to become a child pornographer.mccoy,at.furthermore,mccoy photograph never entered in and was never intended for interstate or foreign commerce.id.emphasis in original.stating that mccoy possession was and,the mccoy court concluded that nothing in the circumstances of mccoy case establishes any substantial connection between her conduct and any interstate commercial activity.id.emphasis in original.
we must acknowledge some reservations about certain aspects of the analysis in the corp and mccoy decisions.both courts noted that the sexually explicit visual depictions in those cases were not intended for distribution.corp,at mccoy,at.based in part on this observation,the courts in mccoy,and impliedly in the conduct at issue was and in nature.having thus labeled the conduct at issue as and,the courts could then avoid applying the wickard aggregation principle to the challenge.
as we have already noted in our discussion of the facial challenge to a,in every case where the supreme court has sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in wickard,the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial character.morrison,at.citation omitted.however,that apparent commercial character does not depend on any intent by an individual defendant involved in the illegal conduct to introduce the proscribed visual depictions into commerce.in lopez and morrison,the supreme court discussed the type of activity defined in the determining whether the regulated conduct was commercial or economic,and when discussing the attenuation of the link between the regulated activity and a substantial effect on interstate commerce.for example,lopez focused on the fact that the gfsza is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise,however broadly those terms are defined.lopez,at.emphasis added.also,the lopez court discussed firearm possession in a local school zone,not a student bringing a concealed handgun to school.id.at.likewise,in morrison,the court spoke of violence generally,not the defendants alleged rape of their college classmate.morrison,at.lopez and morrison demand that the general subject of the statute,not the defendant individual activity,be economic in nature to justify aggregation under wickard.
we think that judge trott dissent in mccoy is persuasive on this important point.
my compassionate friends are not incorrect in describing the underlying microcosmic facts of this case as wholly personal,not commercial,strictly intrastate,and the product of an isolated suggesting that rhonda mccoy and her family need help,not federal prison.however,i conclude,based on supreme court precedent,that the majority legal approach is not correctly grounded.the real determinative question is whether the activity generically described in the statute has a substantial effect on interstate commerce such that it is subject to criminalization by congress.
mccoy,at trott,dissenting emphasis in original the second circuit engaged in similar reasoning to reach the same conclusion in upholding a against an commerce clause challenge in united states holston,cir.quoting its own precedent involving a commerce clause challenge to a federal statute that prohibited growing marijuana even when the defendant did not intend to distribute the drug,the holston court held that 
when congress regulates a class of activities that substantially affect interstate commerce,t he fact that certain intrastate activities within this class,such as growing marijuana solely for personal consumption,may not actually have significant effect on interstate commerce is irrelevant.moreover,t he nexus to interstate commerce is determined by the class of activities regulated by the statute as a whole,not by the simple act for which an individual defendant is convicted.
holston,at quoting proyect united states,cir per curiam alterations in original.in both corp and mccoy,a minor was induced to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction that could find its way into the national market for pornography.it does not matter that the defendant had no intention of placing that visual depiction in the national market.
however,to the extent that the sixth and ninth circuits considered the defendants,conduct in deciding that their conduct fell outside the purview of the statute and the congressional concerns that prompted its passage pursuant to the commerce clause,we agree with the relevance of this consideration.the corp court emphasized that the minor was almost eighteen years old and willingly participated in the sexual conduct.similarly,the mccoy court emphasized that the single pornographic picture represented questionable judgment by an intoxicated parent,not the predatory act of a pedophile.unlike the inappropriate reliance in corp and mccoy on the absence of an intent to distribute the depictions in commerce,their reliance on the age of the minor,the relationship between the defendants and the minor,and the absence of predatory exploitation all seem important and appropriate questions to ask in considering whether the conduct at issue in an challenge falls within the class of activity which bears the substantial relationship to interstate activity that justifies action by congress under the commerce clause.
on the facts of the case before us,we are comfortable that the acts charged against morales were well within the limits of legitimate congressional concern,sabri united states,d,wl,may.specifically,morales sexually exploited a girl,coercing her into performing sex acts with him on multiple occasions,for the purpose of videotaping their encounters.as this conduct seems well within the bounds of what congress had the proscribe under its commerce clause power,we reject morales challenge 
sufficiency of the evidence 
in addition to his constitutional challenges,morales also raises a sufficiency of the evidence claim.appellate courts review claims regarding the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states hernández,cir.the evidence presented at trial must be evaluated in the light most favorable to the government,and all reasonable inferences will be drawn in its favor.united states baltas,cir.when a plausible read of the record supports the verdict,we will not overturn the jury determination on appeal.united states ortíz,cir.
morales argues that the government failed to prove one of the elements of an a,that the defendant induced the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct.the defendant argues that the video was the result of,not the motive behind,his sex acts with the minor.at trial,morales testified that he and the girl had romantic feelings for each other and that the video came about by chance.noting that he had created videos of himself and his wife having sex,and that they used the tape solely for their own use,he says that this history bolsters his claim that he did not engage in sex with the minor for the purpose of recording the encounters.
as succinctly explained by the district court,the testimony of the minor,the testimony of the defendant,and the videotape itself constitute an evidentiary basis sufficient to allow a jury to find that the defendant induced the minor to have sexual relations with him for the purpose of recording that conduct.the evidence shows that the defendant actively concealed from the minor the fact that he was videotaping her.he told her that the video camera was connected to the television so that she could see herself while the two had sexual relations.additionally,while taping his sex acts with the minor,the defendant gave her specific instructions regarding certain positions he wanted her to assume relative to the camera,instructed her on what to say while the camera recorded their activities,and used a remote control to zoom the camera in and out while they were having sex.
furthermore,the defendant claim that the videotaping was not planned is implausible.after the defendant had taken the minor to a motel room to have sex for the fourth time,he returned to his car and retrieved the recording equipment that he kept there.the defendant kept sexual aids in the same bag with the camera,a fact which standing alone could lead the jury to infer that the defendant had planned to videotape the encounters.similarly,the defendant taping of his sexual activity with his wife could lead a reasonable jury to believe that he also engaged in sex acts with the minor for the purpose of videotaping them.finally,a reasonable jury also could infer that since morales taped sexual encounters with the minor more than once,he induced the girl to enga
