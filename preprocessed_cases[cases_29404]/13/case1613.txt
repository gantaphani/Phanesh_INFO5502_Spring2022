background 
mta is a public benefit corporation created by new york state law,charged with operating public transportation in the new york city metropolitan area.defendants staten island rapid transit operating authority sirtoa and new york city transit authority nycta are operating units of mta collectively the corporate defendants.
munafo was employed by mta from until march and was assigned to sirtoa,where he held various positions in the maintenance of way department track department.during that period,munafo lodged a series of complaints about what he perceived to be safety problems in track department operations.he was also subject to a number of disciplinary actions,culminating in the termination of his employment in.
during the pertinent period,most of the individual hereinafter the individual defendants were managerial employees at sirtoa.defendant alfonse sorrentino was a supervisor in the track department and was munafo supervisor.defendants peter argenziano,john mccabe,samuel holmes,and david filimon were sirtoa officials who presided over various phases of the disciplinary proceedings against munafo.defendant owen swords was sirtoa superintendent or general superintendent of operations and approved several of the disciplinary findings and actions taken against munafo.defendant rosemary healy was a sirtoa secretary who transcribed the disciplinary hearing that culminated in munafo termination.
in the present case,munafo seeks redress for the disciplinary actions taken against him.he contends that those actions were taken because of his persistent criticisms of unsafe practices and conditions at sirtoa and because of his union activities.defendants contend that the disciplinary actions were taken because munafo was repeatedly disobedient and insubordinate.the record,taken in the light most favorable to munafo as the party against whom summary judgment was requested,may be summarized as follows.
safety complaints by munafo in 
prior to june,sirtoa used forms known as vehicle condition reports to document the condition of sirtoa equipment.in an affidavit submitted in opposition to defendants motions for summary judgment,munafo stated that at a training session conducted by nycta,
i,and other sirtoa employees,were directed to complete,for the purpose of ensuring the health and safety of employees,vehicle condition reports for anything that has an engine.
given the important implications of these forms,i adhered to the nycta instructor directions as strictly as possible,regularly completing vehicle condition reports for vehicles which i operated.
the vehicle condition reports revealed numerous safety problems with sirtoa vehicles.for example,employees were required to operate some vehicles with hydraulic leaks and without brakes,endangering their own,and the general public safety.
affidavit of charles munafo dated october,munafo aff.
on or about june,sirtoa issued a directive instructing employees to make their reports with respect to certain equipment in maintenance log books,and prohibiting the completion of vehicle condition reports id.munafo,however,believed the vehicle condition reports were superior,allowing employees to record more accurately the condition of the vehicles.although he began making reports in the maintenance log books as instructed by management,he also continued to file vehicle condition reports 
concerned with documenting the unsafe conditions of the vehicles,i continued to complete the vehicle condition reports.as instructed by management,i also completed another form,called the maintenance log book,in addition to,not in lieu of,the vehicle condition report.
unlike the vehicle condition reports,the maintenance log books did not include space to report crucial and safety problems 
because maintenance log books did not include carbon copies,and would frequently go missing,the reporting employee would have no way to prove that he had reported unsafe conditions.vehicle condition reports included carbon copies,enabling the reporting employee to document the fact that safety issues had been reported.
given sirtoa management refusal to acknowledge receipt of vehicle condition reports,the carbon copies retained by reporting employees served as the only evidence of the unsafe conditions of sirtoa vehicles.
i continued to complete and submit both the maintenance log books and the vehicle condition reports to sirtoa management.
id.munafo insisted on filing both types of reports because he refused to hide or disguise the unsafe conditions of the vehicles.id.
disciplinary actions against munafo 
one week after sirtoa ordered that there be no further vehicle condition reports,the first of the disciplinary actions of which munafo principally complains occurred.
the tire incident 
on june,while munafo was operating a piece of equipment,he heard a pop and believed that a tire on his machine had gone flat.the tire was repaired by sirtoa mechanics munafo filled out a vehicle condition report.that afternoon,sorrentino instructed munafo to prepare an incident report,a document that becomes a potentially adverse part of the employee personnel file.
sorrentino returned later in the day to collect the incident report but discovered munafo had not prepared it.the next morning,sorrentino again instructed munafo to fill out such a report.believing that no other employees had been required to file incident reports for flat tires,munafo accused sorrentino of trying to punish him for continuing to document and protest against unsafe conditions.munafo refused to fill out an incident report unless sorrentino provided a written statement of his reasons for requesting it.on the same day,june,munafo filed a complaint with the mta office of inspector general,protesting that sorrentino actions were harassment in retaliation for munafo protests.
on june,sorrentino sent munafo a written notice,charging him with insubordination for the refusal to comply with sorrentino direct orders of june and june to prepare an incident report on the tire,and stating that a hearing would be held on july.the hearing,postponed at munafo request in order to allow him to obtain counsel,was held on july.argenziano presided munafo and sorrentino,along with several witnesses called by munafo,testified.munafo complains that argenziano refused to call six of the persons on munafo proposed witness list.
following the hearing,argenziano issued a written decision upholding the insubordination charge.in deciding on an appropriate sanction,argenziano reviewed munafo record,which included a suspension in for insubordination,a suspension in for threatening a,and a suspension in for leaving his work site without permission and falsely stating that permission had been given.argenziano ruled that,with respect to the tire incident,munafo should be suspended for days,demoted,and permanently barred from operating any vehicle requiring a commercial driver license.
for nearly four years thereafter,munafo union,the united transportation union utu,appealed,without success,argenziano decision through administrative channels.the ruling by argenziano was upheld by sirtoa general superintendent mccabe mccabe decision was upheld by sirtoa acting general manager holmes.the utu unsuccessfully sought review by the national railroad adjustment board.the disciplinary decisions were eventually upheld by the standing board on arbitration sba,a joint body,in march.
in july,munafo commenced the present action,see part below,complaining principally that the discipline imposed on him in connection with the tire incident was retaliation for his union activities and his complaints about issues.
additional safety complaints by munafo 
in the meantime,in december,munafo was elected of the utu,a position he had held previously.in that capacity,he represented employees at meetings with management and apprised them,among other things,of their right to a safe work environment.munafo aff.
munafo also continued to lodge complaints about various employment matters,including sirtoa safety practices.for example,in january,he complained that employees assigned to perform welding were being required to work without the appropriate respiratory equipment.in june,he protested the fact that sirtoa employees were being required to work in unsafe proximity to the live third rail,in violation of state and federal law requiring them to be at least three feet away from volt electricity unless the power lines are shut off or the workers are protected by rubber matting.id.he also continuously protested other health and matters such as smoking in the workplace.
the caputo incident 
on october,munafo learned that sorrentino had summoned trackworker michael caputo to a meeting to discuss an accident report pertaining to a injury caputo had sustained.upon hearing that munafo intended to accompany caputo to the meeting,sorrentino informed the foreman of munafo crew that the meeting was to be merely a safety interview and not a disciplinary proceeding and that munafo should not attend.accordingly,munafo was advised that if he left his work assignment to attend the meeting he would not be paid.
munafo nonetheless attempted to accompany caputo to the meeting,planning to serve as caputo union representative and to be a witness.when he and caputo arrived at the offices where the meeting was to be held,sorrentino informed munafo that he was not invited and instructed him to return to his work site.munafo refused and was insistent on attending the meeting,or at least on making telephone calls to explore the nature of the meeting.sorrentino repeatedly ordered munafo to return to work,would not allow him to use the office telephones,and insisted that caputo accompany sorrentino to meet with the safety officer.
the exchange between munafo and sorrentino lasted some minutes.sorrentino finally left for the meeting caputo remained behind with munafo.munafo then made a series of telephone calls to various members of sirtoa management he had another conversation with sorrentino,who again directed him to return to work and he finally was assured by the safety officer that the purpose of the meeting was simply to discuss details of the accident.the safety officer directed munafo to return to his work site.munafo then instructed caputo to go to the meeting munafo returned to work,having been absent from his work site for more than two hours.
that evening sorrentino telephoned munafo and informed him that he was being suspended for insubordination on the following day sorrentino served him with notice that the hearing would be held on october.the notice 
charged that on the morning and afternoon of october,between am and pm,you provided false information to your foreman,absented yourself from your job site without permission,refused to comply with a repeated direct order to return to your job site and acted in a rebellious,insubordinate and threatening manner when directed repeatedly to return to your work site.
letter from sorrentino to munafo dated october.
after an adjournment requested by munafo,the hearing was begun on november,the hearing officer was filimon,who was then sirtoa deputy superintendent of transportation.munafo attended,represented by counsel,but did not testify.the witnesses included sorrentino and caputo the latter testified that he had told munafo of the scheduled meeting with sorrentino and the safety officer about his accident report,but that he had not asked munafo to accompany him.munafo counsel made a closing statement in which he argued that munafo was entitled to conduct himself as he had.
in march,filimon upheld the charges against munafo.his decision stated,inter alia,that on october,you refused to comply with a directive to return to your duties,absenting yourself from your job site without permission and acted in a rebellious and insubordinate manner to your supervisor letter from filimon to munafo dated march,at.filimon stated that in deciding what discipline to assess the serious nature of the substantiated charges,your service record,and the fact that even when given an opportunity at the hearing to present a reasonable explanation for your actions,you elected not to provide any testimony,were all taken into consideration.id.at.filimon concluded that the only appropriate action is dismissal from the employ of the staten island railway,effective immediately.id.at emphasis in original.
munafo appealed filimon decision to argenziano but sought to argue the appeal only by telephone rather than in a conference.argenziano responded that this would be contrary to sirtoa policy.he rescheduled the conference once,stating that if munafo did not appear,argenziano would regard the matter closed.munafo did not appear,and argenziano left filimon decision undisturbed.munafo next appealed argenziano decision to mccabe but again he did not appear at the meeting scheduled to discuss his appeal.mccabe therefore left argenziano decision undisturbed.in addition,the utu pursued appeals on munafo behalf,but again munafo refused to attend the scheduled hearings.eventually,the sba upheld the sirtoa decisions,concluding that the dismissal was an appropriate disciplinary action.
munafo did not seek further review by way of a judicial proceeding pursuant to article of the new york civil practice law and rules,see et.mckinney article.
c.the present action 
munafo commenced the present action in,shortly after the conclusion of the administrative appeals of his suspension in connection with the tire incident.he alleged principally that the suspension constituted retaliation in violation of his rights under the first amendment and that he had been denied due process.after the termination of his employment in,munafo amended his complaint to add claims that the termination was in retaliation for his continuing criticisms of sirtoa safety practices and his actions as a union officer.in addition,in january,munafo commenced a new and overlapping action,which was consolidated with his original action.
all defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing principally that munafo could not prevail on his first amendment claims because a he was disciplined for insubordinate conduct,and b his speech was not protected by the first amendment because it did not deal with matters of public concern.they argued that his due process claims should be dismissed because munafo had been accorded all the process he was due under the collective bargaining agreement that governed union disciplinary proceedings.the individual defendants also asserted that they were entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.
munafo responded by submitting affidavits and documents,including his own affidavit recounting his safety complaints and union activities and reiterating his view that he had been singled out for special treatment and discipline in retaliation for those complaints and activities.munafo charged that sirtoa management had sought to silence his complaints in order to enhance sirtoa safety record and to avoid the expense of providing safe equipment and a safe working environment.
following oral argument on the motions,the district court,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,denied summary judgment to.although the court itself found munafo factual contentions unpersuasive,it concluded that summary judgment should be denied because there was a triable issue as to the reason for the disciplinary actions,and that munafo might persuade a jury.addressing munafo counsel at the hearing,the court stated 
i going to allow your suit to go forward,because there are issues of fact.i telling you now,based on the papers i have seen,the case seems to me to be wholly frivolous and an abuse of the federal process.
as far as i can see from these papers,we have a disaffected and sullen employee who is ordered on a variety of occasions to do things and he refuses to do them,insisting that he will decide what he going to do.
there is an element of free speech.the jury may decide you are right,in which case we go forward with a judgment 
i have hardly ever in my work as a judge in this court,seen a case that appears on its face to have less merit and is so abusive of the system and the defendants.i do understand,really,how counsel can bring it.
but it open,and you get a trial,if you want it.
hearing transcript,december,tr,at see also id.at i think there enough allegations to support a denial of a motion.
the court also denied the motions to dismiss munafo due process claims,stating only that,given the extensive protections of the union employer procedures involved,those claims appeared to be even more tenuous than the first amendment claims.id.at.
ii.discussion 
the individual defendants have appealed the denial of their motions for summary judgment based on the defense of qualified immunity.the corporate defendants ask us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction and reverse the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment on the ground that munafo claims lack merit.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal by the individual defendants insofar as they assert qualified immunity with respect to munafo first amendment claims we conclude that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law with respect to the due process claims and we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the appeal by the corporate defendants.
a government official sued in his individual capacity is entitled to qualified immunity if the conduct attributed to him was not prohibited by federal law,see,county of sacramento lewis,d siegert gilley,d or where that conduct was so prohibited,if the plaintiff right not to be subjected to such conduct by the defendant was not clearly established at the time it occurred,see,harlow fitzgerald,d or if the defendant action was objective ly legal ly reasonable in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.anderson creighton,d internal quotation marks omitted see harlow fitzgerald,at.because the immunity not only protects against a judgment for damages but also is in part an entitlement not to be forced to litigate,mitchell forsyth,d,early resolution of the qualified immunity defense is encouraged,see,harlow fitzgerald,at,and a defendant may properly move for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff claim on that basis where there are no genuinely disputed factual issues material to the defense,see,mitchell forsyth,at.
a denial of summary judgment is ordinarily not an appealable final decision within the meaning of.see,johnson jones,d.under the collateral order doctrine,however,a district court denial of a summary judgment motion that is based on a substantial claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable where the district court has rejected the defense as a matter of law.see,mitchell forsyth,at.locurto safir,cir security,pataki,cir magnotti kuntz,cir.to be appealable immediately,the denial must present a legal issue that can be decided with reference only to undisputed facts and in isolation from the remaining issues of the case.johnson jones,at.quoting mitchell forsyth,at.if the district court has ruled that adjudication of the immunity defense requires resolution of genuinely disputed questions of material fact,the denial of summary judgment on that basis is not immediately appealable.where the district court summary judgment order,though entered on a motion,has determine d only a question of evidence sufficiency,which facts a party may,or may not,be able to prove at trial,it is a kind of order that is not appealable.johnson jones,at.see,locurto safir,at tolbert queens college,cir.
the issue of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all is a purely legal question.siegert gilley,at.if the complaint does not allege a cognizable federal claim,the defendant is entitled to have his motion granted promptly as a matter of law.see,mitchell forsyth,at.security,pataki,at.a defendant may also obtain a purely legal ruling from the district court by stipulating to the plaintiff version of the facts for purposes of the summary judgment motion.see,salim proulx,cir.but in the absence of a dispositive question that is purely one of law,the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of summary judgment if the district court has found that there is a genuine issue of fact to be tried as to the immunity defense,and there is no hypothetical assumption by appellant that he engaged in the conduct that the appellee alleges.tolbert queens college,at.
under these principles,we conclude that,on the present record,we have jurisdiction over the individual defendants appeal of the denial of their motions for summary judgment with respect to munafo due process claims,but not over their appeal with respect to the first amendment retaliation claims.we address the two sets of claims in reverse order.
qualified immunity with respect to the first amendment claims 
munafo complaint alleges that defendants suspended him and terminated his employment in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights.it is clearly established that,although a governmental entity enjoys significantly greater latitude when it acts in its capacity as employer than when it acts as sovereign,the first amendment nonetheless prohibits it from punishing its employees in retaliation for the content of their speech on matters of public importance.see,waters churchill,d rankin mcpherson,d connick myers,d pickering board of education,d.the employee right to be free from such retaliation has been clearly established since at least.
defendants contend that this prohibition is inapplicable here as a matter of law because munafo complaints were no more than internal personnel grievances relating to matters of his own personal interest.given the requirements that we accept the allegations of the complaint as true and take the record in the light most favorable to munafo as the party against whom summary judgment is sought,defendants premise borders on the frivolous.the complaint and munafo affidavit assert that munafo was speaking in filing complaints and in dealing with members of his matters of safety.he complained of,inter alia,trackworkers being forced to operate in unlawful proximity to live rails without protective gear,welders being forced to work without respirators,and drivers being assigned vehicles with faulty brakes.if one needed to consult more than common sense,one would need look no farther than the existence of laws such as the occupational safety and health act of,et,and similar state laws,see,lab.law et.mckinney supp,to recognize that safety in the workplace is a matter of public concern.
the principal issue in this case is whether defendants treatment of munafo was in fact motivated by his safety complaints and union activities,as munafo contends,or was instead punishment for disobedience and insubordination.the question of defendants motivation plainly remains in dispute.defendants have not stipulated to munafo contention that he was singled out and punished because of his union activities and his repeated complaints that sirtoa was engaging in practices that endangered its employees
