background 
vermont requires residents to register operative motor vehicles with the state department of motor vehicles dmv and directs the dmv commissioner to assign to each registered vehicle a distinctive number along with a number plate or plates showing the assigned number.stat.ann.tit,a.for an additional fee,vermont allows registrants to select that assigned number themselves by requesting a special number or vanity license plate.vermont law provides that registrants requesting such a plate may select virtually any combination of up to seven letters or numbers provided that the selected combination has not previously been assigned to another vehicle and that it complies with certain other technical requirements.id.d.
pursuant to this vermont law,the state dmv has issued tens of thousands of vanity plates to state of,vermont had more than active vanity plates,and was processing about applications per containing a personal message selected by the motorist.popular subjects on which motorists have chosen to express themselves include personal interests or professional,butcher,bkeeper,goyanks personal philosophies and,harmony,love,amfree meaningful exhortations or inspirational,lovlife,thnkpos,carp dm,bejoyfl,rejoice and statements of love,respect,and gratitude for important individuals in the motorist,thxdad,iluvlyn,sons,misudad.
while state motorists thus can and do use vanity plates to comment on a wide variety of topics,state law prohibits the commissioner from issuing special plates if the proposed combination of letters and numbers falls into one of seven categories of these various prohibitions,which include bans on combinations that are vulgar,derogatory,profane or obscene or those that connote any illicit drug.stat.ann.tit,d,a,only one is challenged in this action.at issue here is the state ban on any combination that refer s,in any language,to a religion or deity.id.d.the asserted purpose of the ban is to avoid the distraction and disruption that would result from controversial speech and to disassociat e the state from speech it does not endorse.respondents br.at.
defendants have interpreted the statute as requiring a ban on any combination with religious meaning and contend that they are thus authorized to ban not only those plates that overtly and obviously reference,those the state refers to as objectively religious but also those plates that are meant by the registrant to embody a religious meaning no matter how cryptic the combination of letters and numbers might seem to a casual observer.the state refers to vanity license plates of the latter sort as subjectively religious.respondents br.at.to effectuate this broad ban,the vermont dmv requires motorists seeking vanity plates to complete sworn applications in which they state what a proposed combination represent s to them.applications for vanity plates are then reviewed by various dmv clerks who determine whether the proposed combination refers to a religion or deity or violates any of the other statutory exclusions.according to the state,clerks rely on their own personal knowledge,the registrant supplied meaning,and,at times,the advice of the department general counsel.all plates approved by dmv clerks are then forwarded to the department director of operations and general counsel for final review and approval before the plates are issued.applicants whose combinations are rejected have the right to appeal those denials through the state agency of transportation.
while the stated goal of this administrative process is to effectuate the statutory ban on any refer ence to religions or deities,the record indicates that,in practice,the specifically,vermont policy of looking to supplied meaning has led to somewhat confounding results.respondents br.at.pursuant to this process,vermont has denied,as objectively religious,applications for the combinations seekgod,the rev,and krishna,but it has repeatedly permitted combinations that might appear to a third party to refer to a religion or deity on the ground that the motorist supplied a secular meaning for the combination for example,the state has issued plates bearing the combinations gemini and libra because they were explained as references to a motorist astrological or zodiac sign genesis and creed as references to a motorist favorite musical group stjohn as a reference to the virgin island psalm as a reference to a song sinner as a reference to my life and,and angelsc as references to a motorist nickname or a child name.similarly,the state has permitted the combinations buddha explained as a reference to a nickname goddess a nickname and blessed because i blessed and kali our horse s name even though a third party with no prior knowledge of the applicant intended meaning might well interpret those plates as referring to religion and thus as the very sort of controversial speech the statute ostensibly seeks to prevent.
vermont practice of looking to a registrant supplied meaning has also led the state to reject combinations that are objectively meaningless and that would be unlikely to strike casual observers as a reference to anything,let alone religion.for example,the state rejected the plate because it was explained by the registrant as a reference to blessed virgin mary perfection and the plate because the registrant intended it as a reference to jesus,mary,joseph.vermont has struggled to explain how these denials are consistent with or in furtherance of the statute averred purpose,arguing before this court simply that such denials are necessary to avoid the unfairness that might result from allowing some motorists to make religious references simply because their chosen references are obscure 
byrne applied for the plate that gives rise to this litigation on april,requesting the combination and explaining that it represent ed a bible passage.the parties agree that byrne subjectively intended to refer to john,which states,for god so loved the world,that he gave his only begotten son,that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,but have everlasting life.john king james.byrne contends,and the record supports the conclusion that,the combination might have been permissible if his supplied meaning had been example,if he had put on his application that m y name is john,i am,and i was born in tennessee.
on may,the dmv rejected byrne application because it requested a combination that refers to a deity.byrne appealed that denial to the state agency of transportation,which held a hearing on byrne application on july,at which byrne appeared and was represented by counsel.the hearing officer concluded that the denial was appropriate and proper,noting that the dmv does not issue its plates with a combination of letters and numbers that refer to any religion.
byrne then commenced this action,alleging that the denial violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights.the district court rejected those claims,adopting the recommended findings of a magistrate judge that vanity license plates constitute a nonpublic forum and that the statutory restrictions at issue are,reasonable restrictions on speech within such a forum.accordingly,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation that summary judgment be granted in favor of defendants.this appeal followed.

it is well established that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee,perry,at.instead,under the prevailing constitutional framework,speech restrictions imposed on property are analyzed under a approach that divides government property into three traditional public forum,the designated public forum,and the nonpublic forum perez hoblock,cir collecting authorities.because,a s a general matter the degree of control the government may exercise over speech depends upon the nature of the property,hotel employees,at,the initial task for a court evaluating restrictions placed on speech or expressive conduct on government property is to define the nature of the property at issue.zalaski city of bridgeport police dep t,cir.

applying our decision in perry mcdonald,the district court concluded that vermont license plates constitute a nonpublic forum.no party seriously challenges that finding on appeal perry involved a challenge to the predecessor to the vermont statute at issue here.this court concluded in perry that vanity plates are a highly limited and extremely constrained means of expression,that vermont had not created a public forum by permitting the discourse possible on vanity plates,and that,accordingly,a vermont vanity plate is a nonpublic forum.perry,at.while there have been changes to the vermont vanity plate program since perry was decided,none of these changes are material to the forum analysis,and no party identifies a basis for concluding that perry is not controlling.consequently,we follow perry,see united states brutus,cir,and analyze the vermont vanity plates as a nonpublic forum.
as noted above,the government enjoys greater latitude in restricting speech in a nonpublic forum and may limit access or content based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.cornelius,at perry at w e will uphold a governmental restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum as long as the restriction is reasonable and.here,the district court concluded that vermont prohibition on any reference to a religion or deity on vanity license plates is both viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.we disagree.
in evaluating viewpoint neutrality within the context of a nonpublic forum,two guiding principles emerge.first,the government may permissibly restrict content by prohibiting any speech on a given topic or subject matter.see,good news club milford central school,the state may be justified in reserving its forum for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.quoting rosenberger rector visitors of of,alteration in original perry,at ban on scatalogical subjects permissible choose life,white,cir state may properly exclude the entire subject of abortion from its program emphasis in original.second,however,once the government has permitted some comment on a particular subject matter or topic,it may not then regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others.lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,quoting city council of taxpayers for vincent.accordingly,while a speaker may be excluded from a nonpublic forum if he wishes to address a topic not encompassed within the purpose of the forum the government violates the first amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject.cornelius,at.
vermont contends,and the district court found,that the statute in question can be understood as a permissible ban on a topic or subject.byrne,in contrast,argues that the law amounts to unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination because it bars expression on otherwise permissible topics such as personal philosophy or beliefs solely on the basis of its religious perspective.while distinguishing between a subject matter and a viewpoint can be difficult,see giebel sylvester,f d,cir,our task here is greatly simplified by a trilogy of supreme court decisions each addressing blanket bans on religious messages and each concluding that such bans constitute impermissible viewpoint discrimination.
first,in lamb chapel,the supreme court confronted a new york law that permitted private citizens to use public school premises for social,civic,and recreational meetings but,as construed by state courts,prohibited such use for religious purposes.lamb chapel,at.consistent with that law as interpreted,the school district had refused to permit an evangelical church to use school facilities to show a film series on family and parenting,a refusal upheld by both the district and appellate courts.id.at.the supreme court reversed.treating the school premises as a nonpublic forum,the court noted that c ontrol over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.id.at alteration in original.however,the court concluded that the ban was not viewpoint neutral because it impermissibly prohibited comment on otherwise permissible subject matters child rearing and family values on the ground that the film sought to discuss those subject matters from a religious perspective.id.at.d enial on that basis,the court held,was plainly invalid.id.at.
next,in rosenberger,the court considered a university program that dispensed funds to a variety of student groups,including student news,information,opinion,entertainment,or academic communications media groups,at internal quotation marks omitted,but excluded from eligibility any student group engaged in religious activities,defined as activities that primarily promote or manifest a particular belie f in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,id.at internal quotation marks omitted third alteration in original.applying that rule,the university had denied funding to a student group that published a magazine focused on the christian perspective at the university.id.at.the court found the denial unconstitutional.focusing again on whether the restriction constituted a legitimate content restriction or unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination,the court found the rule to fall into the latter category.as the court explained,
by the very terms of the prohibition,the university does not exclude religion as a subject matter but selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints.religion may be a vast area of inquiry,but it also provides,as it did here,a specific premise,a perspective,a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered.the prohibited perspective,not the general subject matter,resulted in the denial of funds for the subjects discussed were otherwise within the approved category of publications.
id.at emphasis added.
finally,in good news club,the supreme court confronted a school district policy that allowed for private use of school facilities for instruction in any branch of education,learning or the arts and social,civic and recreational meetings and entertainment events but excluded use by any individual or organization for religious purposes.id.at internal quotations omitted.consistent with that policy,the school district had refused to allow a private christian organization to hold weekly afterschool meetings which would include a bible lesson and memorizing scripture.id.at internal quotations omitted.the court again invalidated the ban,finding it quite clear that milford engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it excluded the club from the afterschool forum because the club seeks to address a subject otherwise permitted under the rule,the teaching of morals and character,from a religious standpoint.id.at.the court thus held that speech discussing otherwise permissible subjects can not be excluded on the ground that the subject is discussed from a religious viewpoint.id.at.
that holding,announced in lamb chapel and rosenberger,and unequivocally reaffirm ed in good news club,id.at,guides our inquiry here.we begin with the unchallenged proposition,amply supported by the record,that vermont freely permits motorists to use vanity plates for expression on a wide variety of subjects,including one personal philosophy,beliefs,and values,and similarly allows statements of,affiliation,and inspiration.having opened the forum to these permissible subjects,the question before us is whether vermont ban on any refer ence to a religion or deity serves to exclude speakers who wish to comment upon those otherwise permissible subjects simply because they seek to do so from a religious viewpoint.we answer in the affirmative.
whatever its stated intent,vermont ban on religious messages in practice operates not to restrict speech to certain subjects but instead to distinguish between those who seek to express secular and religious views on the same subjects.under the current law,a motorist personal philosophy,beliefs,and values are all permissible and frequent topics of has issued plates such as carp dm,livfree,and bpostiv,among the philosophies,beliefs,and values express a secular perspective.those who wish to express a personal philosophy,belief,or value that reflects,even only subjectively,a religious,pray,onegod,been prohibited from doing so.similarly,vermont freely permits statements of identity and,butcher,rebel,armymom,goyanks statements of love and,thxdad,iluvlyn,misudad and statements of,bewild,thnkpos,the statements express secular messages and perspectives.those who would express themselves on matters of or make statements of love,respect,or inspiration from a religious viewpoint,however,through plates such as rev,the rev,um rev,and,are excluded from the forum.it is,in other words,the t he prohibited perspective,not the general subject matter that leads to the exclusion.rosenberger,at.
appellant proposed the biblical verse,john,which reads in full for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,but have everlasting life.the district court made no factual findings as to byrne intentions in referencing this,whether byrne intended the message as a statement of personal belief or philosophy or simply as a statement of as a christian or affiliation with the christian we need not dwell on them here.the critical fact is that vermont permits use of state vanity plates for comment on all of these subjects,so long as the comment is from a secular perspective.the state rejected byrne message only because it addressed these areas of otherwise permissible expression from a religious perspective.this the state can not do.having opened its forum to a wide variety of permissible subjects,it can not target for exclusion those who wish to comment on these same subjects on the grounds that they wish to do so from a religious viewpoint.d enial on that basis is plainly invalid.lamb chapel,at.
vermont attempts to defend its statute by distinguishing its ban from those invalidated in lamb chapel,rosenberger,and good news club are unconvincing.principally,the state argues that each of those cases involved settings in which extensive discussion,debate,and consideration of opinions was possible,settings unlike vanity plates which,according to the state,are not a forum that allows for consideration,debate or an exchange of ideas on any subject.respondents br.at.as a preliminary matter,the state cites no authority for the proposition that the first amendment protects only forums in which extensive discussion,debate,and consideration of opinions i s possible,nor are we aware of any.cohen california,inscription on back of jacket constitutes a protected exercise of the freedom of speech tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,armband containing no text considered expressi ve and protected by the first amendment.moreover,irrespective of their size,license plates and their content have long been recognized as giving rise to first amendment concerns,see wooley maynard,as have vanity license plates in particular,see,perry,at see also roach stouffer,cir w e conclude that the messages communicated on specialty plates are private speech choose life,at finding that rights are implicated in restrictions on vanity license plates.life,stanton,cir messages conveyed through special plates represent primarily private speech.sons of confederate veterans,comm r of.dep t of motor vehicles,cir concluding that special plates constitute private speech.vermont provides no credible reason for us to alone authority 
alternatively,vermont contends that because the law bans all speech on religion whether positive,negative,or neutral it is,by definition.respondents br.in the context of restrictions on all religious speech,this argument has been expressly the supreme court.in rosenberger,the dissenters argued that the ban on funding for student journalistic efforts promoting or manifesting a belief about a deity involved no viewpoint discrimination because the law discriminate d against an entire class of viewpoints including both religious and views.rosenberger,at.the court rejected this reasoning,concluding that such an argument 
reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate is bipolar and that antireligious speech is the only response to religious speech.our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description of the marketplace of ideas.if the topic of debate is,for example,racism,then exclusion of several views on that problem is just as offensive to the first amendment as exclusion of only one.it is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic perspective on the debate as it is to exclude on
