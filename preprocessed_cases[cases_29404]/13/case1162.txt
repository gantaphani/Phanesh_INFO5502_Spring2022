the central intelligence agency cia,the department of justice doj,and its component office of legal counsel olc collectively the government appeal from a portion of an october,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,requiring the government to disclose,pursuant to the freedom of information act foia,information redacted from two memoranda prepared by the olc.the government contends that the redactions are justified under foia because the information pertains to a highly classified,active intelligence method.we conclude that the government may withhold this information under foia exemption.we thus reverse the district court judgment insofar as it required disclosure.
the american civil liberties union aclu,center for constitutional rights,incorporated,physicians for human rights,veterans for common sense,and veterans for peace collectively plaintiffs appeal from the same judgment insofar as it upheld the government withholding of records relating to the cia use of the enhanced interrogation technique eit of waterboarding and a photograph of detainee abu zubaydah,taken while he was in cia custody abroad.plaintiffs contend that the records and photograph may not be withheld under either foia exemption or because the president has declared the practice of waterboarding illegal and the government has failed to justify adequately its withholding of the photograph.we disagree and hold that the president declaration and prohibition of the future use of waterboarding do not affect the government otherwise valid authority to withhold the records under exemption.we agree with the district court that both the records and photograph are exempt from disclosure under foia exemption and thus affirm that part of the judgment.
background 
on october,plaintiffs submitted a foia request to the cia,doj,and other federal agencies,seeking the disclosure of records concerning the treatment of detainees the deaths of detainees while in united states custody and the rendition,since september,of detainees and other individuals to countries known to employ torture or illegal interrogation methods.on january,plaintiffs served a foia request on the olc,incorporating by reference their october,request and enumerating a list of documents falling within the scope of plaintiffs request.
within a year of each request,plaintiffs filed separate complaints seeking to compel the government to release any responsive documents it had withheld from disclosure.with respect to the first action,the district court ordered the government to produce or identify all records responsive to plaintiffs request.aclu dep t of,d.since that time,the government has disclosed thousands of documents in response to plaintiffs foia requests.
facts and procedural history relevant to the government appeal 
among the documents disclosed by the government are four memoranda authored by the olc between august,and may,analyzing legal questions with respect to the application of eits to detainees held in cia custody abroad.the government initially withheld these memoranda in full,but subsequently,on april,released unclassified versions of the memoranda with limited redactions.the classified information at issue in the government appeal is discussed in two of these memoranda,dated may,and may,respectively.the government redacted references to the classified information along with other information not relevant to this appeal pursuant to foia exemptions and on the basis that records related to intelligence methods,intelligence activities,and cia functions are exempt from disclosure the parties filed for summary judgment with regard to these redactions from the olc memoranda.
the district court reviewed the unredacted olc memoranda in a series of ex parte,in camera sessions.it also reviewed several declarations from executive branch officials supporting the government withholding of the redacted information.at the first session,the district court issued a preliminary ruling that all but one of the references to the classified information must be disclosed,without explaining why it treated that sole reference differently.with respect to the other references,the district court held that publicly disclosing that information would reveal not an intelligence method but only a source of the cia authority.the district court also found that the references are so general in nature that their disclosure would not compromise national security.the district court nevertheless permitted the government to submit additional declarations justifying its position that the information was exempt from disclosure.
during a subsequent in camera session,the district court reaffirmed its preliminary ruling and explained that it viewed the classified information as a source of authority for interrogation rather than a method of interrogation.as a compromise,however,the district court offered to allow the government to replace references to the classified information with alternative language meant to preserve the meaning of the text.the district court acknowledged the national security concerns potentially raised by the disclosure of some of the classified information,but nevertheless ordered that the government either disclose the information or comply with the court proposed compromise.the district court also ordered that references to the classified information in the transcript of the first ex parte,in camera proceeding be disclosed or otherwise released in accordance with the compromise.the district court memorialized its oral ruling in a december,order.the government now appeals from that order.
ii.facts and procedural history relevant to plaintiffs cross appeal 
many of the documents released by the government in response to plaintiffs foia requests relate to the use of eits.during the course of this litigation,the president prohibited the future use of certain eits,including waterboarding,formerly authorized for use on detainees on may,the district court ordered the government to compile a list of documents related to the contents of destroyed videotapes of detainee interrogations that occurred between april and december and which would otherwise have been responsive to plaintiffs foia requests.pursuant to that order,the cia identified documents and selected a sample of documents for the district court to review for potential release.specifically,the sample records comprise 
cables operational communications between cia headquarters and an interrogation facility 
emails postdating the videotapes destruction 
logbooks detailing observations of interrogation sessions 
set of handwritten notes from a meeting between a cia employee and a cia attorney 
memoranda containing descriptions of the contents of the videotapes 
set of handwritten notes taken during a review of the videotapes 
records summarizing details of waterboard exposures from the destroyed videotapes and 
photograph of abu zubaydah dated october.
the government withheld these records pursuant to foia exemptions and,and the parties filed for summary judgment with regard to whether the records were exempt from disclosure 
the government defended its withholding of the records with three declarations of director leon panetta.the declarations explained that the records consist primarily of communications to cia headquarters from a covert cia facility where interrogations were being conducted,and include sensitive intelligence and operational information concerning interrogations of abu zubaydah.panetta decl,june.with respect to exemption,the declarations explained that,if disclosed,the records would reveal intelligence sources and methods employed by the cia,as well as the organization and functions of the cia,including the conduct of clandestine intelligence activities to collect intelligence from human sources using interrogation methods.id.with respect to exemption,the declarations asserted that the records were properly classified pursuant to executive order and that their disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in harm to national security.
in response,plaintiffs argued that the eits were not intelligence methods within the meaning of the cia withholding authorities because they had been repudiated,and,in the case of waterboarding,declared unlawful by the president.plaintiffs also argued that the cia had failed to provide any explanation for withholding the photograph of abu zubaydah under either exemption or.
on september,the district court reviewed the photograph and a portion of the sample records in an ex parte,in camera session.the district court made preliminary rulings upholding the government nondisclosure of all but one document.that document is not at issue in plaintiffs.with respect to the photograph of abu zubaydah,the government asserted that it was actually a cia photo of a person in custody,and the court accepted the government position that a photograph of a detainee reveals a lot more information than the detainee identity.during the public hearing,the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that the president declaration was a sufficient basis for rejecting the government position.the district court explained that it would decline to rule on the question of legality or illegality in the context of a foia request.rebuffing plaintiffs argument that the photo should be produced because the government offered no justification for its withholding,the district court sustained the withholding and explained that the image of a person in a photograph is another aspect of information that is important in intelligence gathering.
the district court memorialized its rulings in an october,order.in sustaining the withholding of the records under foia exemption,the district court concluded that the cia had satisfied its burden of showing that the release of the records could reasonably be expected to lead to unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods.the district court also rejected plaintiffs argument that records relating to illegal activities are beyond the scope of exemption.
in a july,order,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of its october order.in doing so,the district court reaffirmed its view that neither statutory language nor case law supports plaintiffs contention that the legality of the underlying intelligence source or method bears upon the validity of an exemption withholding.
on october,the district court entered partial final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,granting plaintiffs summary judgment with regard to the government withholding of the classified information in the two olc memoranda,and granting the government summary judgment with regard to the nondisclosure of records related to the contents of the destroyed videotapes and the photograph.plaintiffs limit their to those records reflecting the cia use of waterboarding and to the photograph of abu zubaydah.
discussion 
the freedom of information act calls for broad disclosure of government records.cia sims,d.but public disclosure of certain government records may not always be in the public interest.thus,congress provided that some records may be withheld from disclosure under any of nine exemptions defined in b.id.at.
an agency withholding documents responsive to a foia request bears the burden of proving the applicability of claimed exemptions.wilner nsa,cir.affidavits or declarations giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption are sufficient to sustain the agency burden.carney dep t of justice,cir.we review the adequacy of the agency justifications de novo.wilner,at.in the national security context,however,we must accord substantial weight to an agency affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record.wolf cia,internal quotation marks omitted see also sims,at.summary judgment is appropriate where the agency affidavits describe the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably specific detail,demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption,and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith.wilner,at.ultimately,an agency may invoke a foia exemption if its justification appears logical or plausible.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
i.the government appeal the olc memoranda 
the government contends that the information redacted from the olc memoranda may be withheld from disclosure under either foia exemption or.in our view,exemption resolves the matter easily exemption permits the government to withhold information specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy if that information has been properly classified pursuant to such executive order.b.the government contends that the redacted information was properly classified under executive order,as amended,which authorized the classification of information concerning intelligence activities including special activities,intelligence sources or methods,or cryptology.exec.order c,as amended by exec.order,hereinafter exec.order executive order also required as a condition to classification that an original classification authority determine that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security and is able to identify or describe the damage.id.a.at 
the district court held that the exemption was inapplicable because,in its view,the information pertains to a source of authority rather than a method of interrogation.on appeal,as it did in the district court,the government contends that the information pertains to an intelligence method and an intelligence activity,and that each category provides a basis for classification under executive order.in support of this contention,the government has submitted declarations from general james jones,to the president for national security and national security advisor general michael hayden,of the cia leon panetta,of the cia and wendy hilton,information review officer for detainee related matters for the cia.
based on our ex parte and in camera review of the unredacted olc memoranda and the government classified declarations,we agree with the government that the redacted information was properly classified because it pertains to an intelligence activity.plaintiffs concede that,even if we were to characterize the information as a source of authority,withholding a source of authority itself is proper if disclosing it would reveal intelligence sources,methods,or activities.pls.br.we give substantial weight to the government declarations,which establish that disclosing the redacted portions of the olc memoranda would reveal the existence and scope of a highly classified,active intelligence activity.see doherty dep t of justice,cir.
we reject any notion that to sustain the government assertion that the withheld information concerns a protected intelligence activity under executive order is effectively to exempt the cia from foia mandate.in response to plaintiffs foia requests and related court orders,the government has already produced substantial information about its use of eits,including almost all of the contents of the olc memoranda.with regard to the limited material it has withheld from disclosure,the government has sustained its burden by giving reasonably detailed explanations of how the information pertains to a classified intelligence activity.carney,at.
on appeal,plaintiffs do not dispute that the government has established that public disclosure of the redacted information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.exec.order a.at.nor do we.w e have consistently deferred to executive affidavits predicting harm to the national security,and have found it unwise to undertake searching judicial review.ctr.for sec.studies dep t of justice.recognizing the relative competencies of the executive and judiciary,we believe that it is bad law and bad policy to the predictive judgments made by the government intelligence agencies regarding whether disclosure of the information redacted from the olc memoranda would pose a threat to national security.wilner,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the government declarations describe in persuasive detail how revealing the redacted information would cause exceptionally grave harm to national security by damaging activities and relationships with foreign intelligence liaison partners,which are of utmost importance to the cia overseas intelligence operations,hilton decl.a,may,alerting our adversaries of the existence of the intelligence method,which would give them the opportunity to alter their conduct to adapt to this new information and make future intelligence operations more dangerous and less effective,id.b and increasing the risks for all individuals involved in those operations,including cia officers and assets,id.c.according substantial weight and deference to the cia declarations,see doherty,at,we conclude that it is both logical and plausible that the disclosure of the information pertaining to a cia intelligence activity would harm national security.
furthermore,we reject the district court suggestion that certain portions of the redacted information are so general in relation to previously disclosed activities of the cia that their disclosure would not compromise national security.it is true that the government has disclosed significant aspects of the cia discontinued detention and interrogation program,but its declarations explain in great detail how the withheld information pertains to intelligence activities unrelated to the discontinued program.hilton decl.and even if the redacted information seems innocuous in the context of what is already known by the public,m inor details of intelligence information may reveal more information than their apparent insignificance suggests because,much like a piece of jigsaw puzzle,each detail may aid in piecing together other bits of information even when the individual piece is not of obvious importance in itself.wilner,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted see also sims,at.aclu dep t of defense.again,it is both logical and plausible that disclosure of the redacted information would jeopardize the cia ability to conduct its intelligence operations and work with foreign intelligence liaison partners.
both parties contend that the district court compromise,whereby the government could avoid public disclosure of the redacted information by substituting a purportedly neutral phrase composed by the court,exceeded the court authority under foia.we agree.foia does not permit courts to compel an agency to produce anything other than responsive,records.see a b.if the government altered or modified the olc memoranda in accordance with the compromise,the government would effectively be creating documents something foia does not obligate agencies to do.see,kissinger reporters comm.for freedom of the press,d pierce stevens chem.consumer prod.safety comm n,cir.moreover,given the relative competencies of the executive and judiciary,the district court erred in ing the executive judgment of the harm to national security that would likely result from disclosure,by crafting substitute text that in its own view would avoid the harms that could result from disclosure of the information in full.see wilner,at.
the district court apparent reliance on the classified information procedures act cipa,app,as a basis for the compromise was erroneous contrary to the district court assertion,cipa applies exclusively to criminal cases.see app.indeed,cipa is codified as the third appendix to title of the,which concerns crimes and criminal procedure,and we have found no case law supporting the district court adoption of cipa in a foia context such as this 
the government sufficiently explained that the withheld information pertains to an intelligence activity and that disclosure of the information would likely result in harm to national security.the government declarations are not contradicted by the record,and there is no evidence of bad faith by the government in this regard.accordingly,the government has sustained its burden of proving that the information redacted from the olc memoranda is exempt from disclosure under foia exemption.see wilner,at.we therefore reverse the district court judgment insofar as it required disclosure of the information either in full or in accordance with the district court compromise in the olc memoranda and the transcript of the district court ex parte,in camera proceeding.
ii.materials at issue in plaintiffs cross appeal 
the district court agreed with the government that the records related to the contents of destroyed videotapes of detainee interrogations and a photograph of detainee abu zubaydah in cia custody may be withheld from disclosure under foia exemption.plaintiffs challenge the withholding of only those records relating to the cia use of waterboarding and the photograph.
exemption permits the government to withhold information from public disclosure provided that the information is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute and the exemption statute requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.b see sims,at.here,the government contends that the records and photograph pertain to an intelligence method under section i of the national security act of nsa and cia functions under section of the central intelligence act of,which include the collection of intelligence through human sources,see d plaintiffs do not dispute that these statutes qualify as exemption statutes under exemption.see larson,at baker cia.thus,our only remaining inquiry is whether the withheld material relates to an intelligence method or functions of the cia.larson,at phillippi cia,
a.the interrogation records 
plaintiffs contend that the records regarding the use of waterboarding in particular instances do not relate to an intelligence method because the president has declared the practice of waterboarding illegal.relying on the supreme court decision in cia sims,plaintiffs argue that the cia may decline to disclose only records relating to those intelligence methods that fall within the cia charter.plaintiffs argue that because an illegal activity can not be said to fall within the agency mandate to conduct foreign intelligence,sims,at,waterboarding can not be an intelligence method within the meaning of the cia withholding authorities 
we do not agree.sims offers no support for plaintiffs proposed limitation upon the cia ability to protect information relating to intelligence methods.on the contrary,the sims court emphasized that the nsa vested in the director of central intelligence very broad authority to protect all sources of intelligence information from disclosure,and that judicial narrowing of this authority not only contravenes the express intention of congress,but also overlooks the practical necessities of modern intelligence gathering the very reason congress entrusted this agency with sweeping power to protect its intelligence sources and methods.sims,at.according to the court,the plain meaning of intelligence sources and methods in this context,may not be squared with any limiting definition that goes beyond the requirement that the information fall within the agency mandate to conduct foreign intelligence.id.at.
here,plaintiffs argue that the provision of the nsa requiring the director of national intelligence to ensure compliance with the constitution and laws of the united states,see f,delimits the director obligation under section i to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure,see i,and the concomitant rights under foia to decline to disclose.the statutory language does not,however,draw any such limitation,and to do so by judicial device would flout sims clear directive against constricting the cia broad authority in this domain.again,sims expressly rejected any limitation on the cia duty to protect information beyond the requirement that the information fall within the agency mandate to conduct foreign intelligence.sims,at.plaintiffs argument lacks support in either th
