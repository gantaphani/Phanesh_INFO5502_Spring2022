illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property used to facilitate a drug crime,permits police to seize the property without a warrant,and allows the state to keep the property nearly five months before beginning judicial forfeiture proceedings.respondents,six individuals who had cars and cash seized under that law,brought this federal civil rights action,claiming that the failure of the state to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal due process clause.the district court dismissed the case based on circuit precedent,but,on appeal,the seventh circuit departed from that precedent and ruled for respondents.this court granted certiorari to review the seventh circuit due process determination,but at oral argument the court learned that all of the actual property disputes between the parties had been resolved.
the case is moot.the constitution permits this court to decide legal questions only in the context of actual cases or controversies,art.iii,and an actual controversy must exist at all stages of review,not just when the complaint is filed,preiser newkirk.here there is no longer any actual controversy regarding ownership or possession of the underlying property.there is no claim for damages before this court there is no properly certified class or dispute over class certification and this case does not fit within the category of cases that are capable of repetition while evading review.only an abstract dispute about the law remains.
the judgment below is vacated.in moot cases,this court normally vacates the lower court judgment,which clears the path for relitigation of the issues and preserves the rights of the parties,while prejudicing none by a preliminary decision.united states munsingwear.where mootness is the result of settlement rather than happenstance,however,the losing party forfeits the equitable remedy of vacatur.bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership.this case more closely resembles mootness through happenstance than through settlement.in bancorp,the party seeking review caused the mootness by voluntarily settling the issue contested throughout the litigation.here,the court believes that the presence of the federal case played no significant role in the termination of plaintiffs forfeiture proceedings.plaintiffs forfeiture cases took place with no procedural link to the case before this court apparently terminated on substantive grounds in their ordinary course and,to the court knowledge,no one raised the procedural question at issue here in those cases.this court therefore concludes that it should follow its ordinary practice and order vacatur.
vacated and remanded.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
we granted certiorari in this case to determine whether illinois law provides a sufficiently speedy opportunity for an individual,whose car or cash police have seized without a warrant,to contest the lawfulness of the seizure.see,amdt,united states von neumann,united states.at the time of oral argument,however,we learned that the underlying property disputes have all ended.the state has returned all the cars that it seized,and the individual property owners have either forfeited any relevant cash or have accepted as final the state return of some of it.we consequently find the case moot,and we therefore vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss.united states munsingwear,see also gressman,geller,shapiro,bishop,hartnett,supreme court practice ed.
illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property including cars and cash used to facilitate a drug crime.comp,ch,a west.it permits a police officer to seize that property without a warrant where the officer has probable cause to believe the property was so used and a warrantless seizure would be reasonable in the circumstances.b.when an officer has seized property without a warrant,the relevant law enforcement agency must notify the state attorney within days of the seizure the state attorney must notify the property owner of any impending forfeiture within a further days and,if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture,the state attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings within yet a further days.see ch.thus,the statute gives the state up to days,nearly five months,to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings during which time the statute permits the state to keep the car or cash within its possession.

the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that seventh circuit precedent made clear that the constitution does not require any procedure prior to the actual forfeiture proceeding.jones takaki,citing von neumann,supra,at.on february,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.it also denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification.the plaintiffs appealed.
on may,the seventh circuit decided the appeal in the plaintiffs favor.smith chicago.it reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent,at.it held that the procedures set out in the illinois statute show insufficient concern for the due process right of the plaintiffs.at.and it added that,given the length of time which can result between the seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner to contest the seizure under illinois law,some sort of mechanism to test the validity of the retention of the property is required.ibid.the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded the case for further proceedings,at.its mandate issued about seven weeks thereafter.
