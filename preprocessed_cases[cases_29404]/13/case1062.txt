this appeal requires us to consider the power of the general counsel of the national labor relations board the board or the nlrb to authorize petitions for temporary injunctive relief under section of the national labor relations act nlra,j,and the propriety of the district court decision to grant an injunction in this case.
healthbridge management healthbridge and the six nursing facilities that it manages the centers,and collectively,healthbridge appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut chatigny,granting a petition brought by the nlrb pursuant to section j of the nlra.the j petition sought to enjoin temporarily,pending a final adjudication by the board,alleged unfair labor practices related to a labor dispute between healthbridge and district,seiu the union,which represents the centers approximately employees.healthbridge argues that the board lacked a quorum at the time that it purported to authorize the j petition at issue,that the board prior contingent delegation to its general counsel of the power to authorize such petitions did not survive the loss of a quorum,and that the district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the petition was not validly authorized.healthbridge also argues that the supreme court decision in winter natural resources defense counsel,d,overruled this circuit established legal standard for evaluating j petitions,which the district court applied,and that the district court abused its discretion in granting the petition.
we conclude that the board may contingently delegate the power to authorize j petitions to the nlrb general counsel.such delegations,made in and,were in effect here,and the petition at issue was properly authorized by the general counsel pursuant to those delegations.winter,which involved preliminary injunctions generally and not the specific right to injunctive relief created by the nlra,does not impact the standard for j petitions,and the district court did not otherwise abuse its discretion in granting the petition in this case.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
we presume the parties familiarity with the relevant facts in this case,
which were described in detail by the district court.kreisberg healthbridge,llc,cv wl.we provide only a summary here.
a.the labor dispute 
healthbridge began managing the centers in,assuming prior management employment agreements with the union.in the parties entered into a collective bargaining agreement the cba that was set to last through march.
the disputes relevant to this litigation began in,when healthbridge unilaterally instituted a number of changes to the terms and conditions of some union members employment.these changes included altering certain employees hours,overtime pay,vacation policies,and benefits,subcontracting out certain employees work and then rehiring them at reduced wages and benefits,and conducting layoffs without notice.
in january,as their dispute continued,healthbridge and the union began to negotiate a new cba.the parties characterize the negotiations quite differently,but there is no dispute that they went poorly.at first,the union asked healthbridge to rescind the unilateral changes it had implemented in.healthbridge refused and sought to codify the unilateral changes underlying the nlrb complaint in the new cba.healthbridge also proposed replacing the employees pension plan with a k plan,a proposal that emerged as a major sticking point in the negotiations.
the union filed charges with the board alleging various violations of the nlra,and the board issued a complaint in march.
notwithstanding the complaint,in december,after the union refused a purported final offer that included many of healthbridge initial proposals,including the k plan,healthbridge locked out union employees from one of the centers.one week after the lockout began,the union proposed submitting all issues to arbitration.healthbridge countered with a proposal for a three percent wage increase,replacement of the pension with a k plan,and arbitration of all other issues.the union refused.further counterproposals followed,but the parties made little progress.the employee lockout ended only in april,after the board issued a second complaint against healthbridge the lockout complaint alleging that the lockout violated the nlra.
thereafter,the parties made last,best,and final proposals lbfs.both parties offered concessions in the lbfs,but the pension issue remained unresolved.healthbridge insisted it could not sign a cba that did not phase out the pension,while the union stated that it was not willing to talk about the pension in a vacuum,indicating that it could move on the pension issue only in exchange for other substantial concessions.while healthbridge stated it would consider modifications to its lbf in exchange for agreement on the pension issue,it never made a concrete offer.meanwhile,the union proposed to offer four percent savings from healthbridge gross payroll and to adopt a system in which new employees would enroll in a k plan rather than a pension.these offers were rejected.in may healthbridge asserted that if the union did not make any further proposals,the parties will have reached an impasse in their negotiations.the union rejected this assertion,pointing to its various counterproposals.at the next bargaining session,the union representative was asked whether the union had moved on the pension issue.the union representative replied,w e told you before depending on the overall proposal we would consider anything.
in june healthbridge declared an impasse and unilaterally imposed its lbfs,which included substantial modifications to employees benefits,benefits eligibility,overtime,and sick leave,as well as a change from the pension to the k plan.this prompted the union to notify healthbridge of its intent to strike and the board to amend the lockout complaint,adding allegations that healthbridge had engaged in new unfair labor practices by unilaterally imposing its lbfs in the absence of a good faith impasse.after further failed negotiations to avert the strike,the union declared an unfair labor practices on july.according to healthbridge,striking employees committed acts of vandalism and sabotage against the centers,but no proof of any sabotage exists in the record beyond the fact of the allegations.meanwhile,the union offered to end the strike and resume negotiations while working under conditions as they existed before healthbridge imposed its lbfs,but that offer was rejected.by august healthbridge had replaced all of the striking employees.
the nlrb complaint that had been filed in march ultimately was resolved in the union favor in august,when an administrative law judge held that healthbridge had committed the alleged labor law violations.see healthbridge,llc,ca wl nlrb div.of judges.
on august,the board authorized its regional director,jonathan kreisberg,to bring an action on behalf of the board pursuant to j to enjoin healthbridge from imposing its lbfs.the board believed that such an injunction was necessary to preserve its ability to enforce any nlra violations.separately,the board acting general counsel authorized the filing of the j petition in district court on september.without objection,the district court then tried the matter on the papers.thereafter,healthbridge moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the j petition was not validly authorized as required by the nlra because the board lacked a quorum when it purported to authorize the petition and the general counsel lacked the power independently to authorize it.
b.the board and the general counsel 
the board typically has five members,and a quorum of the board is three members.see a,b.here,whether the board had a quorum when the petition was filed depends on the constitutional validity of several recess appointments made by the president of the united states.on january,the term of nlrb commissioner craig becker,himself a march recess appointee,expired,and without becker,the board had only two members.on january,president obama made three recess appointments to the board sharon block,richard griffin,and terence flynn at the time that the president made the january,recess appointments,the united states senate was holding periodic pro forma sessions.see cong.rec.and so by the time the j petition was authorized in august,two of the board four members were serving based on the january,recess appointments.
the general counsel is a presidentially appointed and executive officer who has final authority,on behalf of the board,in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under section of title of the united states code,and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the board,and shall have such other duties as the board may prescribe or as may be provided by law.d.whether the general counsel could authorize the j petition depends on the effectiveness of the board delegation.the board has,at various times,contingently delegated its power to authorize j petitions to the general counsel in the event that it loses a quorum.see,order contingently delegating authority to the general counsel the delegation,nlrb,order delegating authority to the general counsel the delegation,nlrb,
procedural history 
in december the district court denied healthbridge motion to dismiss and granted the board petition for injunctive relief.with respect to the jurisdictional issue,the district court held that the board had validly delegated to the general counsel its power to authorize j petitions.applying the test for j injunctions previously articulated by this court,the district court determined that reasonable cause existed for the injunction,because the union had remained open to further compromise when healthbridge implemented its lbfs,and so there had been no impasse as a matter of fact,and there had been no impasse as a matter of law because of the unremedied unfair labor practices occurring throughout the relevant period.the district court also rejected healthbridge argument that an injunction was not just and proper due to the strikers alleged sabotage or the financial peril faced by the centers.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
authorization of the j petition 
we first address the question of whether the board validly delegated its duty to authorize the j petition.we review de novo the district court jurisdictional determination as well as its interpretation of the constitution and federal statutes and regulations.see ehrenfeld mahfouz,cir united states king,cir mccarthy navistar fin,cir.
the nlra vests the board with the power to petition any united states district court,within any district wherein a unfair labor practice is alleged to have occurred for appropriate temporary relief,and confers upon district courts the power to grant to the board such temporary relief or restraining order only u pon the filing of any such petition.j.healthbridge argues that we must consider and resolve the validity of the president january,recess appointments under the recess appointments clause,const.art.ii,cl.although other circuits have reached this question,it is unnecessary to do so in this appeal.see nlrb enter.leasing,llc,cir finding the pro forma recess appointments invalid nlrb new vista nursing,cir same noel canning nlrb,same,cert.granted,d june,mem.when,as here,a case may be resolved on other grounds,courts may decline to reach a constitutional question to avoid deciding constitutional issues needlessly.christopher harbury,d.accordingly,we consider only whether the district court erred when it concluded that the general counsel properly authorized the petition pursuant to the board delegation of its j authority.
three delegations by the board of its j power are relevant to resolve this issue the delegation,the order delegating authority to the general counsel delegation.nlrb,and the delegation.the delegation promulgated on december,provides,in relevant part 
to assure that the nlrb will be able to meet its obligations to the public,the board has decided to temporarily delegate to the general counsel full authority on all court litigation matters that would otherwise require board authorization.this delegation shall be effective during any time at which the board has fewer than three members and is made under the authority granted to the board under sections,and of the national labor relations act.
accordingly,the board delegates to the general counsel full and final authority and responsibility on behalf of the board to initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings under section j or section e and f of the act this delegation shall be revoked whenever the board has at least three members.
delegation.at.
in the delegation,the board confirmed that a ll existing delegations of authority to the general counsel and to staff in effect prior to the date of this order remain in full force and effect,including the december,delegation regarding court litigation authority.at.in particular,the delegation delegated additional authority to the general counsel authority not granted in the delegation to certify to the attorney general the results of any secret ballot elections held among employees on the question of whether they wish to accept the final offer of settlement made by their employer pursuant to b.id.
finally,the delegation provides,in relevant part 
to assure that the nlrb will be able to meet its obligations to the public to the greatest extent possible,the board has decided to temporarily delegate to the general counsel full authority on all court litigation matters that would otherwise require board authorization this delegation shall be effective during any time at which the board has fewer than three members and is made under the authority granted to the board under sections,and of the national labor relations act.
accordingly,the board delegates to the general counsel full and final authority and responsibility on behalf of the board to initiate and prosecute injunction proceedings under section j or section e and f of the act,these delegations shall become and remain effective during any time at which the board has fewer than three members,unless and until revoked by the board 
all existing delegations of authority to the general counsel and to staff in effect prior to the date of this order remain in full force and effect.
delegation.at.the delegation explicitly states that o n december,and on november,the board previously delegated to the general counsel,on the same basis,full authority on all court litigation matters that would otherwise require board authorization this order consolidates,restates and affirms those prior delegations.id.at 
pointing to member becker allegedly invalid march recess appointment,healthbridge challenges the validity of the delegation,arguing that the board lacked a quorum when it issued the order establishing that delegation but healthbridge does not challenge the validity of the or delegations which contain no expiration date and remain effective.whether or not the delegation was validly issued,it reconfirmed that the and delegations were still in effect.see delegation.at 
because the earlier and delegations were effective in august without regard to the delegation,we consider whether the board may delegate its power to authorize j actions to the general counsel,a question of first impression in this circuit the nlra provides that the general counsel shall have final authority,on behalf of the board,in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under section of this title,and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the board,and shall have such other duties as the board may prescribe or as may be provided by law.d.the statute specifies the general counsel enforcement function and provides that the general counsel shall have such other duties as the board may prescribe or as may be provided by law.id.the plain,broad language of d permits a properly constituted board to delegate its j power and enable the general counsel to prosecute nlra violations before a federal district court.
delegation and the loss of a quorum 
we next consider whether the subsequent loss of a quorum in the board negates a proper delegation of j authority to the gene
