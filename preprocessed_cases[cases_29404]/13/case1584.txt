on this appeal we are asked to consider whether a municipal transit authority dress code which mandates that all employees wear pants as part of a driver uniform is an unconstitutional infringement when applied to a female employee who seeks to wear a skirt.the female employee alleges that her fourteenth amendment rights to due process and equal protection of the law,and her first amendment right to free expression were all violated by the governmental directive.the scots poet robert burns wrote that rank and clothes are but the guinea stamp,and that a man a man for a that robert burns,for a that and a that,in iii the poetical works of robert burns boston,little,brown.but the aggrieved female driver insists that a woman forced by her employer to wear pants on the job is not a woman for a that.we have no doubt she strongly feels this as she makes plain in her papers,but our inquiry must be focused on whether the constitution grants her the right to ignore her employer dress code.we conclude that it does not.
background 
the facts in this case are not in dispute.appellant grazyna zalewska was employed by the sullivan county transportation department in sullivan county,new york,as a van driver for a meals on wheels program from january until april.zalewska duties included transporting senior citizens from their homes to various nutrition sites and transporting food from the county main kitchen to those sites where the senior citizens were fed.
on december,the county instituted a policy mandating that all department of transportation employees wear a uniform while working.its stated purpose was to encourage customers to be more respectful of the drivers,to foster a positive among drivers and to project an overall positive appearance for the county of sullivan in its ongoing efforts to promote itself.the required uniform consisted of a shirt,a jacket,and a pair of pants.pants were mandated because the county believes pants are safer than skirts for the operators of vans,particularly vans with chair lifts,as the operator must assist customers on and off the vehicle.the policy was adopted in consultation with zalewska union,and a written agreement between the county and the union acknowledged that all drivers would have to wear the new uniforms or face disciplinary action.
upon learning of the new policy,zalewska,who as a matter of familial and cultural custom had never worn pants in her entire life asked her supervisor,transportation coordinator terence,why she could not wear a skirt.she was told the policy would not be altered and that no exception would be made for her.nonetheless,when zalewska went to the private vendor to be fitted for her uniform,she requested and obtained a skirt instead of pants.she explained her action by stating that for her the wearing of a skirt constitutes an expression of a deeply held cultural value.appellant worked in her customized uniform for three weeks without incident.on april,her supervisor demanded that she return the skirt,and informed her that she had to wear pants if she wanted to return to work.subsequently,the county filed charges of misconduct and insubordination against zalewska,accusing her of refusing to return items that were charged to and paid for by the transportation department,and of refusing to wear the required uniform to work.zalewska was suspended from her position as a van driver,and transferred to another county department where she still works at the time of this appeal.at her new post,she is allowed to wear a skirt and receives the same pay as she had as a van driver.
prior proceedings 
in response to the county action,zalewska filed the instant suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,seeking damages under and.in her complaint,she alleged that defendants deprived her of her rights to due process and equal protection of the law under the fourteenth amendment,and of her right to free expression under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.upon submission of a set of stipulated facts and upon both parties motions for summary judgment,the district court dismissed zalewska claims and granted summary judgment to defendants,sullivan county,judith maier and terence.zalewska appeals that judgment.we affirm.
discussion 
i waiver of jury trial 
before turning to the merits,a procedural issue raised on this appeal must first be resolved.appellant declares that since she never gave her express and unequivocal consent that the trial court proceed with a summary bench trial,her right to a jury was not waived.see music,jostens,cir.further,she asserts that the county policy is based on unsupported conclusory contentions,so that the key finding of whether such a policy was rational presents a fact issue to be decided by a jury.we disagree.
although in its opinion the district court discussed the permissibility of a summary bench trial,its ultimate disposition of appellant claims did not rest on judicial factfinding.as it expressly stated in denying appellant reconsideration motion,the record presented no factual disputes.the question of rationality of the county policy,which we discuss later,is one of law,not fact.see heller doe,d.the county was found entitled to judgment as a matter of law under the traditional summary judgment principles.accordingly,whether appellant waived her right to a jury trial is irrelevant.we turn now to the merits.
ii standard of review 
we review a trial court decision to grant summary judgment de novo.see mount vernon fire ins.belize ny,cir.because there are no disputed questions of fact,but only questions of law,we must decide if the district court erred in granting summary judgment for defendant sullivan county and denying summary judgment for appellant.
iii appellant constitutional claims 
first amendment symbolic speech 
zalewska alleges that sullivan county regulation prohibiting van drivers from wearing skirts is a violation of her right to free expression under the first and fourteenth amendments.the first amendment inquiry contains two parts whether zalewska actions constitute expressive conduct entitled to protection under the first amendment,as incorporated by the fourteenth and if so,whether the county regulation impermissibly denies her such protection.see texas johnson,d.
appellant first amendment argument rests on her claim that wearing a skirt is for her an expression of a deeply held cultural value.so strongly held is her desire to express her cultural values that she declares she has never worn pants.we realize that for for most and personal appearance are important forms of.for many,clothing communicates an array of ideas and information about the wearer.it can indicate cultural background and values,religious or moral disposition,creativity or its lack,awareness of current style or adherence to earlier styles,flamboyancy,gender identity,and social status.from the nun habit to the judge robes,clothing may often tell something about the person so garbed.
yet,the fact that something is in some way communicative does not automatically afford it constitutional protection.for purposes of the first amendment,the supreme court has repeatedly rejected the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled speech whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.united states,d.we echoed this view in east hartford educ.ass bd.of educ.of the town of east hartford,cir,where we recognized that acknowledging the symbolic qualities of a course of conduct is only the beginning,and not the end,of constitutional inquiry.at.
to determine whether conduct is expressive and entitled to constitutional protection requires an inquiry into whether the activity is sufficiently imbued with the elements of communication to fall within the scope of the first and fourteenth amendments,johnson,at,for not all conduct may be viewed as speech simply because by her conduct the actor intends to express an idea.see spence washington,d.to be sufficiently imbued with communicative elements,an activity need not necessarily embody a narrow,succinctly articulable message,hurl
