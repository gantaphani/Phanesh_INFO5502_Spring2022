this case asks us to chart a course between two constitutional provisions that delineate the boundaries of a state power to regulate commerce,one an express grant,the other an implied limitation.section of the amendment provides the transportation or importation into any state,territory,or possession of the united states for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors,in violation of the laws thereof,is hereby prohibited.const.amend.xxi.the commerce clause reserves for congress the power t o regulate commerce among the several states,thus implicitly limiting the states power to do so.const,cl.here,we must determine whether new york alcohol regulatory regime is properly within the scope of section of the amendment,such that it does not run afoul of the dormant commerce clause.we conclude that the challenged regime is permissible under the amendment insofar as it requires that all liquor sold within the state of new york pass through new york regulatory system.
background 
appellant arnold wines,doing business as kahn fine wines spirits,a wine retailer operating two stores in the indianapolis,indiana area,would like to sell its products directly to new york consumers.appellants joshua block and sharon silber,new york residents,would like to be able to buy and receive wine directly from retailers.appellants thus brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the new york state liquor authority and individual officials of the new york state liquor authority,pursuant to,seeking a declaratory judgment finding sections,a,and b of new york alcoholic beverage control law abc law unconstitutional to the extent that they prohibit wine retailers from selling and delivering wine directly to new york consumers.two licensed new york wholesalers and an association of licensed new york retailers were granted leave to appear as.
the district court holwell,in a decision,granted defendants motion to dismiss,holding that the challenged sections are an integral part of the alcohol regulatory system consistent with the authority granted to new york by the amendment.arnold wines,boyle,d.appellants timely filed this appeal.
new york regulatory scheme 
sections,a,and b of new york abc law require that all liquor sold,delivered,shipped,or transported to a new york consumer first pass through an entity licensed by the state of new york.section states,no person shall manufacture for sale or sell at wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverage within the state without obtaining the appropriate license therefor required by this chapter.alco.bev.cont.law mckinney supp the other two provisions make it illegal to ship alcoholic beverages to an unlicensed entity within the state,a consumer.id.a b.
these provisions are part of the licensing structure for the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages established in new york shortly after the passage of the amendment.the main purpose of the system was to preclude the existence of a tied system between producers and retailers,a system generally believed to enable organized crime to dominate the industry.the three tiers are the producer,the distributor or wholesaler,and the retailer.under this system,the producer sells to a licensed wholesaler,who pays excise taxes and delivers the alcohol to a licensed retailer.the retailer,in turn,sells the alcohol to consumers,collecting sales taxes where applicable.in new york,only and wineries may bypass the system to ship directly to consumers.id.all other producers and sellers must ship to wholesalers within the system.id.a b see also arnold wines,d at.
this licensing scheme allows the state to oversee the financial relationships among manufacturers,wholesalers,and retailers,see alco.bev.cont.law,as well as the ways these entities price goods and make sales,see id.the state liquor authority may inspect any premises where alcoholic beverages are manufactured,stored,or sold,as well as the books and records kept on such premises.id.new york asserts that the regulatory system allows the state to collect taxes more efficiently and prevent the sale of alcohol to minors.
relevant in this particular case,new retailers,the final tier in the state system,may obtain licenses permitting them to deliver alcohol directly to consumers homes in vehicles owned and operated by such licensee s,or hired and operated by such licensee s from a trucking or transportation company registered with the liquor authority.id.new york retail licensees must comply with a set of highly detailed regulations governing the location,physical characteristics,and operating hours of their premises,as well as their financial relationships with producers and wholesalers,and the manner in which they keep books and records for all their transactions.id.retailers without an operation can not obtain a new york retail license.it is this new retailers,but not retailers,may deliver liquor directly to new york appellants challenge in this case.
discussion 
appellants argue that new york ban on direct sales to consumers by liquor retailers discriminates against interstate commerce and thus violates the commerce clause.the commerce clause provides that congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.it is well established that the affirmative implies the negative,and that the commerce clause establishes a dormant constraint on the power of the states to enact legislation that interferes with or burdens interstate commerce.see,dennis higgins,d.thus,states may not pass laws that discriminate against economic interests unless those laws advance a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.new energy of limbach,d.
however,the supreme court has made clear that the amendment alters dormant commerce clause analysis of state laws governing the importation of alcoholic beverages,granholm heald,d.ratified in,the amendment repealed the eighteenth amendment and ended prohibition.section of the amendment provides the transportation or importation into any state,territory,or possession of the united states for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors,in violation of the laws thereof,is hereby prohibited.the purpose of section was to protect certain core interests of the states in promoting temperance,ensuring orderly market conditions,and raising revenue through regulation of the production and distribution of alcoholic beverages.north dakota united states,d plurality opinion.
the amendment is thus in tension with the commerce clause,as section grants the states virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.granholm,at.quoting cal.retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d internal quotation marks omitted.but state powers under the amendment are not without limitation the amendment does not immunize all regulation of alcoholic beverages from commerce clause scrutiny.id.state policies are only protected under the amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.id.at.
most recently,in granholm heald,the supreme court addressed the difficulties inherent in the intersection of these two constitutional provisions.analyzing the wilson act and the statutes that influenced the drafting of section of the court concluded that section purpose was to return to the states only the commerce clause immunity provided by those two acts.id.at.the amendment was intended to allow states to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation,importation,and use.the amendment did not give states the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against goods.id.at.
the granholm court set forth the test for determining the constitutionality of state liquor regulations.if the state measure discriminates in favor of producers or products,the regulatory regime is not automatically saved by the amendment simply by virtue of the special nature of the product regulated.see id.at.rather,if the court finds the law discriminatory,it will only be upheld if it reasonably advances legitimate state interests that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.id.at.quoting limbach,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
applying this framework,the granholm court struck down laws in new york and michigan that created exceptions to the states distribution systems,allowing wineries to bypass the three tiers and ship directly to consumers,while preventing wineries from doing so.id.at.the court found that the differential treatment requir ing all wine,but not all wine,to pass through an wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers impermissibly discriminated against interstate commerce.id.at.see also id.at.thus,the court found that the new york and michigan laws were not immunized by the amendment.
having concluded that the challenged laws were not authorized by the amendment,the granholm court next undertook the standard dormant commerce clause analysis,determining whether the discriminatory statutes served a legitimate local purpose that could not be accomplished through nondiscriminatory means.see id.at.the court noted that there were a number of nondiscriminatory practices by which the states could achieve their stated goals of facilitating tax collection and preventing minors from consuming alcohol.see id.at.accordingly,it struck down the new york and michigan laws as violative of the commerce clause.id.at.
in reaching its conclusion,the court repeatedly emphasized that the systems in place in both states did not themselves violate the constitution.specifically,the court stated that it is unquestionably legitimate for a state to bar the importation of alcoholic beverages if it bans the sale and consumption of alcohol altogether,or to funnel sales through the system.id.at.granholm is best seen as an attempt to harmonize prior court holdings regarding the power of the states to regulate alcohol within their power specifically granted to the states by the the broad policy concerns of the commerce clause.see,north dakota,at.capital cities cable,crisp,d midcal,at.granholm validates evenhanded state policies regulating the importation and distribution of alcoholic beverages under the amendment.it is only where states create discriminatory exceptions to the system,allowing,but not,liquor to bypass the three regulatory tiers,that their laws are subject to invalidation based on the commerce clause.granholm,at.see also brooks vassar,cir.
application of the granholm analysis to new york abc law 
appellants challenge provisions that make no distinction between liquor produced in new york and liquor produced out of the state both may be shipped directly to new york consumers by licensed retailers.see granholm at.healy beer,d distillers state liquor,d bacchus imports,dias,d.appellants seek to mimic the concerns addressed in granholm by contending that the new york law is invalid because it grants retailers benefits not afforded to retailers.this argument comes up short under granholm for several reasons.
first,because retailers make up the third tier in new york regulatory system,appellants challenge to the abc law provisions requiring all wholesalers and retailers be present in and licensed by the state,alco.bev.cont.law,is a frontal attack on the constitutionality of the system itself.however,the granholm court specifically acknowledged the vital role of the system in the exercise of states section powers.the court reaffirmed that the system is an unquestionably legitimate exercise of the states powers under the amendment to regulate the importation and use of alcohol.granholm,at.appellants argument is therefore directly foreclosed by the granholm court express affirmation of the legality of the system.
appellants reply that the language in granholm endorsing the system is merely dicta.in granholm,the states explicitly argued that the challenged regulations were essential elements of the system.they attempted to justify their regulations by citing prior supreme court cases that acknowledged the system as a legitimate exercise of state power under the amendment.in reaching its holding,the granholm court noted that the challenged regulations were discriminatory exceptions to,rather than integral parts of,the underlying systems.see id.had the system itself been unsustainable under the amendment,the granholm court would have had no need to distinguish it from the impermissible regulations at issue.as judge holwell stated in his opinion below,if dicta this be,it is of the most persuasive kind.arnold wines,d at.
second,new york abc law treats and liquor evenhandedly under the state system,and thus complies with granholm nondiscrimination principle.see granholm,at.new york requires that all originating in state or out of through the system.alco.bev.cont.law et.alcohol sold by retailers directly to consumers in new york has already passed through the first two and been taxed and regulated accordingly.requiring liquor to pass through a licensed wholesaler and retailer adds no cost to delivering the liquor to the consumer not equally applied to liquor.rather,the new york regulatory scheme mandates that both and liquor pass through the same system before ultimate delivery to the consumer.
this is in stark contrast to the challenged regulations in granholm.the new york and michigan laws struck down by the court in granholm created specific exceptions to the states systems favoring producers.at.this was exactly the type of economic protectionist policy the commerce clause sought to forestall,and where the granholm court drew the line.see id.at.while the amendment grants the states broad powers to regulate the transportation,sale,and use of alcohol within their borders,it simply does not immunize attempts to discriminate in favor of local products and producers.see also bacchus,at.the challenged regulations here are evenhanded and permissibly aimed at combat ing the perceived evils of an unrestricted traffic in liquor,rather than accomplishing mere economic protectionism.bacchus,at.thus,new york alcohol regulatory scheme properly falls within the state powers granted by section of the amendment.
because new york system treats and liquor the same,and does not discriminate against products or producers,we need not analyze the regulation further under commerce clause principles.sections,a,and b of new york abc law are an integral part of new york system because new york laws evenhandedly regulate the importation and distribution of liquor within the state,we hold that they do not run afoul of the commerce clause.
conclusion 
sections,a,and b of new york alcoholic beverage control law,instituting a system for the regulation of alcoholic beverages,do not discriminate against producers in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution,article i,section,clause,and are thus a valid exercise of the state rights under the amendment.for the foregoing reasons,the district court order of october,granting defendants motions to dismiss is hereby affirmed.
i join fully in judge wesley opinion.i write separately to emphasize the unusual nature of judicial interpretation of the amendment,a constitutional provision that,over years,has been defined and redefined to accommodate changing social needs and norms.there is good evidence that when the amendment was first adopted,section two of that amendment was intended to give states control over alcohol regulation.that complete control was a stark exception to the otherwise limited scope of state commerce regulation.in the ensuing decades however,as attitudes toward alcohol have changed and its commerce has become more nationalized,the supreme court has increasingly read the amendment more narrowly,and excluded from its protection any number of state regulatory schemes that,to be sure,discriminated against interstate commerce.this updating of the amendment raises important theoretical questions about the role of courts in interpreting constitutional provisions that may well have become anachronistic.but apart from these legal process issues,the jurisprudence that the supreme court has created through this updating presents other problems.regrettably,it often leaves lower courts at a loss in seeking to figure out what the amendment means and what if any governing principles may be derived from the high court amendment decisions.
the history of state regulation of alcoholic beverages dates from long before adoption of the eighteenth amendment.craig boren,d.as early as the license cases,how,the supreme court recognized a broad authority in state governments to regulate the trade of alcoholic beverages within their borders free from implied restrictions under the commerce clause.craig,at.soon enough,however,the supreme court started to trim away at the edges of that regulatory power.thus,by the late nineteenth century,the supreme court began to undercut the theoretical underpinnings of the license cases.id.and,while the supreme court continued to permit states to ban alcohol altogether,see granholm heald,d mugler kansas,the court,in a series of cases during the,struck down on dormant commerce clause grounds state laws banning or burdening the sale of imported liquor.see granholm,at.collecting cases see also,leisy hardin.bowman chicago nw.ry.
in,congress tried to resolve the doctrinal bind the court had created states could ban the production of domestic liquor but these laws were ineffective because liquor was immune from any state regulation as long as it remained in its original package.granholm,at.at the same time,the legislators tried to address schemes of state protectionism.they did this by passing the wilson act,which stated that all intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any state or territory shall upon arrival in such state or territory be subject to the operation and effect of the laws of such state or territory enacted in the exercise of its police powers,to the same extent and in the same manner as though such liquids or liquors had been produced in such state or territory.this described recently in states to regulate imported liquor on the same terms as domestic liquor but did not allow states to discriminate against liquor.granholm,at.
the wilson act posed many interpretive challenges for the courts.the text of the to permit obvious around its aims.the supreme court,however,readily interpreted the act in light of that purpose.thus,in scott donald,the court struck down,as a violation of the wilson act,a south carolina liquor regulatory scheme that required all liquor sales to be channeled through a state liquor commissioner.the south carolina act instructed the commissioner to purchase his supplies from the brewers and distillers in this state when their product reaches the standard required by this act provided,such supplies can be purchased as cheaply from such brewers and distillers in this state as elsewhere.acts.and south carolina law limited the state markup on locally produced wines to a profit but imposed no such cap in the case of imported wines.at.the result of all this was invalid discrimination against liquor.
the court explained that the wilson act was not intended to confer upon any state the power to discriminate injuriously against the products of other states in articles whose manufacture and use are not forbidden,and which are,therefore,the subjects of legitimate commerce.id.at.the court further held that the wilson act mandated equality or uniformity of treatment under state laws,and did not allow south carolina to provide an unjust preference to its products as against similar products of the other states.id.at.
in the late nineteenth century,states also attempted to regulate liquor by banning its direct shipment,for personal use,from sources to citizens within the state.but the supreme court soon interpreted the wilson act as prohibiting such state laws.see vance vandercook.rhodes iowa.in,congress responded by passing the act which prohibits t he shipment or transportation of any intoxicating liquor of any kind from one state,territory,or district into any other state,territory,or district for the purpose of being received,possessed,sold,or in any manner used in violation of any law of such state,territory,or district.stat,codified at.it is not precisely clear what kind of regulation the act meant to allow.but,as it was granholm,the act forb ade shipment or transportation only where it runs afoul of the state generally applicable laws governing receipt,possession,sale,or use.granholm,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the result was that states could prohibit direct shipments of alcohol to consumers for personal use,provided that the states treated and liquor on the same terms.id.at.
in,the eighteenth amendment was ratified and prohibition began.in,however,prohibition was repealed by the passage of the amendment.while section one of the amendment merely repealed prohibition,section two did more.that section stated that t he transportation or importation into any state for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors,in violation of the laws thereof,is hereby prohibited.const.amend.xxi.
the language of section two is rather opaque.in its terms,it does not authorize any state regulation but rather just forbids people from transporting alcohol into a state in ways that violate that state laws courts,nevertheless,have consistently and understandably read the section to authorize broad state regulation.
there is evidence that the intent of section two was to give complete regulatory authority to the states over alcohol during the congressional debate about section two,for example,one senator stated that the purpose of section is to restore to the states by constitutional amendment absolute control in effect over interstate commerce affecting intoxicating liquors which enter the confines of the states.cong.rec.statement of senator blaine.and justice black,who while a senator participated in the passage of the amendment in the senate,clearly believed that section two was intended to return absolute control of liquor traffic to the states,free of all restrictions which the commerce clause might before that time have imposed.hostetter idlewild bon voyage liquor,d black,dissenting 
not surprisingly,therefore,the supreme court made clear in the early years following adoption of the amendment that by virtue of its provisions a state is totally unconfined by traditional commerce clause limitations when it restricts the importation of intoxicants destined for use,distribution,or consumption within its borders.hostetter,at.accord craig,at.and,in this period,the court upheld control over domestic alcohol commerce by states,even to the point of opening the door to political trade wars among the states.lawrence tribe,american constitutional law,at ed see,indianapolis brewing liquor control comm n.upholding michigan prohibition of beer dealers selling beer made in indiana mahoney joseph triner.state board young market.justice brandeis,for example,observed in young market that to construe the amendment as saying,in effect the state may prohibit the importation of intoxicating liquors provided it prohibits the manufacture and sale within its borders but if it permits such manufacture and sale,it must let imported liquors compete with the domestic on equal terms would involve not a construction of the amendment,but a rewriting of it.id.at.
to the extent that the supreme court early interpretation was correct,however,rewriting is exactly what happened.in,in hostetter idlewild bon voyage liquor,d,the supreme court held that a state can not regulate passage of liquor through that state when the point of final delivery was a concession within the state,for example,delivery on board an airplane regulated by the customs service.the court interpreted section two not as repeal ing the commerce clause wherever regulation of intoxicating liquors is concerned,an interpretation that the court called an absurd simplification,but rather stated that each of the two provisions must be considered in the light of the other,and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in any concrete case.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.relying heavily on legislative history and perhaps his own knowledge of what he had intended,justice black strongly disagreed.see id.at.black,dissenting.and,in,in a case notable for its equal protection holding,the supreme court reaffirmed the point made in hostetter.see craig,at.reasoning that section two created an exception to the normal operation of the commerce clause but does not pro tanto repeal the commerce clause.
in a series of cases in the,the court applied this principle seemingly to narrow further the powers conferred upon states by the amendment.first,in bacchus imports,dias,d,the court struck down a hawaii tax exemption that favored certain alcohol and that was,by the state own admission,intended to be protectionist.the court reasoned that protectionism was not the central purpose of section two and that s tate laws that constitute mere economic protectionism are not entitled to the same deference as laws enacted to combat the perceived evils of an unrestricted traffic in liquor.id.at.justice stevens vigorously objected,and described an inquiry into the purpose of a liquor law as a totally novel approach to the amendment.id.at.stevens,dissenting.
next,in distillers state liquor,d,and healy beer,d,the court struck down on dormant commerce grounds two state laws that required liquor producers to affirm that they were not charging any higher prices in those states than in other states.the court reasoned that the amendment does not permit states to regulate sales in other states.at.
the supreme court most recent foray into the question of the applicability of the amendment to the dormant commerce clause came in granholm heald,d.in light of the rather extensive deference to state regulation of alcohol,there developed,even in recent times,complex state statutes that made it difficult to purchase alcohol from out of state.these statutes gave rise to the constitutional question of whether states could set up regulatory regimes where the object and effect was to allow wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that state but to prohibit wineries from doing so,or,at the least,to make direct sales impractical from an economic standpoint.granholm,at.
at issue in granholm were portions of new york and michigan alcoholic regulatory laws.the court described these regimes as creating a system that is,in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed,mandated only for sales from wineries.at.under michigan regime,wine producers were required to distribute their wine through wholesalers whereas producers could obtain a license to sell directly to consumers.id.at.under new york regime at the time,wineries could ship to consumers in new york only if they could establish a physical presence in new york primarily used grapes grown in new york.id.at.
after observing without explaining the significance of the fact that states had formed reciprocal trade agreements for direct shipping,as part of an ongoing,trade war,id.at,the court found that michigan regime expressly prevented direct sales from wineries to consumers and that new york regime created a sometimes prohibitive burden on wineries that wished to sell directly to consumers.this burden included a physical presence requirement,something about which dormant commerce clause cases had long expressed suspicion,id.at.
in determining whether the amendment protected the michigan and new york regulatory schemes,the court analyzed the wilson and acts,which it asserted the amendment had constitutionaliz ed.id.at.quoting craig,at.the court concluded that t he aim of the amendment was to allow states to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation,importation,and use,but that t he amendment did not give states the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against goods,a privilege they had not enjoyed at any earlier time.id.at.the court cited several relatively recent cases,including healy,and bacchus imports,as standing for the proposition that state regulation of alcohol is limited by the nondiscrimination principle of the commerce clause,at.
interestingly,however,the court also wrote that its holding would not call into question the constitutionality of the system insofar as t he amendment grants the states virtually complete control over whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to structure the liquor distribution system.id.at.quoting california retail liquor dealers ass midcal aluminum,d.and the court stated,clear as day,that the system itself is unquestionably legitimate.id.quoting north dakota united states,d.indeed,the court cited justice scalia concurrence in the judgment in north dakota and,in an explanatory parenthetical,quoted justice scalia statement that the amendment empowers north dakota to require that all liquor sold for use in the state be purchased from a licensed wholesaler.granholm,at.quoting north dakota,at.scalia,concurring in judgment.the court,however,concluded this affirmation of the system by stating that s tate policies are protected under the amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent but that t he instant cases,in contrast,involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers.id.
the evolving interpretation of the amendment raises important questions about the role of courts.it is possible that the amendment was originally intended and understood to have the complex shape that it has assumed in the past few decades.but,as many distinguished justices have in opinions for the court and more recently in seems more likely that the amendment,when enacted,meant to carve out from dormant commerce clause scrutiny the area of alcohol regulation.nevertheless,it appears that the supreme court has increasingly updated the amendment,and it is this judicial process that i wish,briefly,to address.
when the amendment was first adopted and courts interpreted section two to authorize virtually limitless state regulation,the united states was a different place than it is today.laws frequently regulated morals,and alcohol was often viewed as immoral.and even setting morals aside,the prevailing view of alcohol was that it was a unique product that posed unusual dangers,both directly as an intoxicant,and indirectly,as a stream of commerce that generated corruption and crime it was therefore left to individual states to decide,in light of their own local values,needs,and experiences,how to contend with that product.
justice jackson described this understanding when he wrote in that t he people of the united states knew that liquor is a lawlessness unto itself.duckworth arkansas.jackson,concurring in result.jackson reasoned that those who created the amendment 
determined that alcohol should be governed by a specific and particular constitutional provision.they did not leave it to the courts to devise special distortions of the general rules as to interstate commerce to curb liquor tendency to get out of legal bounds.it was their unsatisfactory experience with that method that resulted in giving liquor an exclusive place in constitutional law as a commodity whose transportation is governed by a special constitutional provision.
id.at.put differently,even those who might think that certain kinds of liquor regulation pose no benefit to temperance or public safety still wanted a broad,overinclusive authorization for state regulation,so as to prevent courts or congress from chipping away at the states power to regulate.
in the ensuing decades however,attitudes towards alcohol have changed,and its commerce has become more nationalized.as justice stevens observed in his granholm dissent,t oday many americans,particularly those members of the younger generations who make policy decisions,regard alcohol as an ordinary article of commerce,subject to substantially the same market and legal controls as other consumer products.granholm,at.stevens,dissenting.but,t hat was definitely not the view of the generations that made policy in when the eighteenth amendment was ratified or in when it was repealed by the amendment.id.
nowadays,alcohol is not prohibited by any state and the beer industry is one that runs t
