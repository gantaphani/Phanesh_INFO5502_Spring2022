the copyright act of gives a copyright owner the exclusive righ t to perform the copyrighted work publicly.the act transmit clause defines that exclusive right to include the right to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance of the copyrighted work to the public,by means of any device or process,whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.
respondent aereo,sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air.when a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing,he selects the show from a menu on aereo website.aereo system,which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse,responds roughly as follows a server tunes an antenna,which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone,to the broadcast carrying the selected show.a transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the internet.a server saves the data in a folder on aereo hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber screen once several seconds of programming have been saved.the streaming continues,a few seconds behind the broadcast,until the subscriber has received the entire show.
petitioners,who are television producers,marketers,distributors,and broadcasters that own the copyrights in many of the programs that aereo streams,sued aereo for copyright infringement.they sought a preliminary injunction,arguing that aereo was infringing their right to perform their copyrighted works publicly.the district court denied the preliminary injunction,and the second circuit affirmed.
held aereo performs petitioners works publicly within the meaning of the transmit clause.
a aereo perform s.it does not merely supply equipment that allows others to do so.
one of congress primary purposes in amending the copyright act in was to overturn this court holdings that the activities of community antenna television catv providers fell outside the act scope.in fortnightly united artists television,the court determined that a catv provider was more like a viewer than a broadcaster,because its system no more than enhances the viewer capacity to receive the broadcaster signals by provid ing a antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer television set.at.therefore,the court concluded,a catv provider did not perform publicly.the court reached the same determination in respect to a catv provider that retransmitted signals from hundreds of miles away in teleprompter columbia broadcasting system.the reception and rechanneling of broadcast television signals for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function,irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer,the court said,at.
in,congress amended the copyright act in large part to reject the fortnightly and teleprompter holdings.the act now clarifies that to perform an audiovisual work means to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.thus,both the broadcaster and the viewer perform,because they both show a television program images and make audible the program sounds.congress also enacted the transmit clause,which specifies that an entity performs when it transmit s a performance to the public.ibid.the clause makes clear that an entity that acts like a catv system itself performs,even when it simply enhances viewers ability to receive broadcast television signals.congress further created a complex licensing scheme that sets out the conditions,including the payment of compulsory fees,under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts to the public.congress made all three of these changes to bring cable system activities within the copyright act scope.
because aereo activities are substantially similar to those of the catv companies that congress amended the act to reach,aereo is not simply an equipment provider.aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs,many of which are copyrighted,virtually as they are being broadcast.aereo uses its own equipment,housed in a centralized warehouse,outside of its users homes.by means of its technology,aereo system receive s programs that have been released to the public and carr ies them by private channels to additional viewers.fortnightly,supra,at.
this court recognizes one particular difference between aereo system and the cable systems at issue in fortnightly and teleprompter the systems in those cases transmitted constantly,whereas aereo system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.in other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers,a user involvement in the operation of the provider equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the act.but given aereo overwhelming likeness to the cable companies targeted by the amendments,this sole technological difference between aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here.
b aereo also performs petitioners works publicly.under the clause,an entity performs a work publicly when it transmit s a of the work to the public.what performance,if any,does aereo transmit petitioners say aereo transmits a prior performance of their works,whereas aereo says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of transmitting.this court assumes arguendo that aereo is correct and thus assumes,for present purposes,that to transmit a performance of an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.under the court assumed definition,aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.
what about the clause further requirement that aereo transmit a performance to the public aereo claims that because it transmits from copies,using antennas,and because each transmission is available to only one subscriber,it does not transmit a performance to the public.viewed in terms of congress regulatory objectives,these technological differences do not distinguish aereo system from cable systems,which do perform publicly.congress would as much have intended to protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of aereo as from those of cable companies.
the text of the clause effectuates congress intent.under the clause,an entity may transmit a performance through multiple transmissions,where the performance is of the same work.thus when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people,it transmit s a performance to them,irrespective of the number of discrete communications it makes and irrespective of whether it transmits using a single copy of the work or,as aereo does,using an individual personal copy for each viewer.
moreover,the subscribers to whom aereo transmits constitute the public under the act.this is because aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other.in addition,neither the record nor aereo suggests that aereo subscribers receive performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works.this is relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people,whether they constitute the public often depends upon their relationship to the underlying work.finally,the statute makes clear that the fact that aereo subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations is of no consequence.aereo transmits a performance of petitioners works to the public.
c given the limited nature of this holding,the court does not believe its decision will discourage the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the copyright act of gives a copyright owner the exclusive righ t to perform the copyrighted work publicly.the act transmit clause defines that exclusive right as including the right to 
transmit or otherwise communicate a performance of the copyrighted work to the public,by means of any device or process,whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.
we must decide whether respondent aereo,infringes this exclusive right by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air.we conclude that it does.
for a monthly fee,aereo offers subscribers broadcast television programming over the internet,virtually as the programming is being broadcast.much of this programming is made up of copyrighted works.aereo neither owns the copyright in those works nor holds a license from the copyright owners to perform those works publicly.
aereo system is made up of servers,transcoders,and thousands of antennas housed in a central warehouse.it works roughly as follows first,when a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently being broadcast,he visits aereo website and selects,from a list of the local programming,the show he wishes to see.
second,one of aereo servers selects an antenna,which it dedicates to the use of that subscriber and that subscriber alone for the duration of the selected show.a server then tunes the antenna to the broadcast carrying the show.the antenna begins to receive the broadcast,and an aereo transcoder translates the signals received into data that can be transmitted over the internet.
third,rather than directly send the data to the subscriber,a server saves the data in a folder on aereo hard drive.in other words,aereo system creates a copy that is,a personal copy of the subscriber program of choice.
fourth,once several seconds of programming have been saved,aereo server begins to stream the saved copy of the show to the subscriber over the internet.the subscriber may instead direct aereo to stream the program at a later time,but that aspect of aereo service is not before us.the subscriber can watch the streamed program on the screen of his personal computer,tablet,smart phone,television,or other device.the streaming continues,a mere few seconds behind the broadcast,until the subscriber has received the entire show.see a dictionary of computing ed.defining streaming as t he process of providing a steady flow of audio or video data so that an internet user is able to access it as it is transmitted 
aereo emphasizes that the data that its system streams to each subscriber are the data from his own personal copy,made from the broadcast signals received by the particular antenna allotted to him.its system does not transmit data saved in one subscriber folder to any other subscriber.when two subscribers wish to watch the same program,aereo system activates two separate antennas and saves two separate copies of the program in two separate folders.it then streams the show to the subscribers through two separate transmissions each from the subscriber personal copy.
petitioners are television producers,marketers,distributors,and broadcasters who own the copyrights in many of the programs that aereo system streams to its subscribers.they brought suit against aereo for copyright infringement in federal district court.they sought a preliminary injunction,arguing that aereo was infringing their right to perform their works publicly,as the transmit clause defines those terms.
the district court denied the preliminary injunction.supp.sdny.relying on prior circuit precedent,a divided panel of the second circuit affirmed.wnet,thirteen aereo,citing cartoon network lp,lllp csc holdings.in the second circuit view,aereo does not perform publicly within the meaning of the transmit clause because it does not transmit to the public.rather,each time aereo streams a program to a subscriber,it sends a private transmission that is only to that subscriber.the second circuit denied rehearing en banc,over the dissent of two judges.wnet,thirteen aereo.we granted certiorari.
this case requires us to answer two questions first,in operating in the manner described above,does aereo perform at all and second,if so,does aereo do so publicly we address these distinct questions in turn.
does aereo perform see t he owner of a copyright has the exclusive righ t to perform the copyrighted work publicly emphasis added to perform a work publicly means among other things to transmit a performance of the work to the public emphasis added.phrased another way,does aereo transmit a performance when a subscriber watches a show using aereo system,or is it only the subscriber who transmits in aereo view,it does not perform.it does no more than supply equipment that emulate s the operation of a home antenna and digital video recorder dvr.brief for respondent.like a home antenna and dvr,aereo equipment simply responds to its subscribers directives.so it is only the subscribers who perform when they use aereo equipment to stream television programs to themselves.
considered alone,the language of the act does not clearly indicate when an entity perform s or transmit s and when it merely supplies equipment that allows others to do so.but when read in light of its purpose,the act is unmistakable an entity that engages in activities like aereo performs.
history makes plain that one of congress primary purposes in amending the copyright act in was to overturn this court determination that community antenna television catv systems the precursors of modern cable systems fell outside the act scope.in fortnightly united artists television,the court considered a catv system that carried local television broadcasting,much of which was copyrighted,to its subscribers in two cities.the catv provider placed antennas on hills above the cities and used coaxial cables to carry the signals received by the antennas to the home television sets of its subscribers.the system amplified and modulated the signals in order to improve their strength and efficiently transmit them to subscribers.a subscriber could choose any of the programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on his own television set.at.the catv provider neither edited the programs received nor originated any programs of its own.ibid.
asked to decide whether the catv provider infringed copyright holders exclusive right to perform their works publicly,the court held that the provider did not perform at all.see c ed.granting copyright holder the exclusive right to perform in public for profit a nondramatic literary work,d granting copyright holder the exclusive right to perform publicly a dramatic work.the court drew a line broadcasters perform.viewers do not perform.at footnote omitted.and a catv provider falls on the viewer side of the line.at.
the court reasoned that catv providers were unlike broadcasters 
broadcasters select the programs to be viewed catv systems simply carry,without editing,whatever programs they receive.broadcasters procure programs and propagate them to the public catv systems receive programs that have been released to the public and carry them by private channels to additional viewers.at.
instead,catv providers were more like viewers,for the basic function their equipment serves is little different from that served by the equipment generally furnished by viewers,at.essentially,the court said,a catv system no more than enhances the viewer capacity to receive the broadcaster signals by provid ing a antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer television set.ibid.viewers do not become performers by using amplifying equipment,and a catv provider should not be treated differently for providing viewers the same equipment,at.
in teleprompter columbia broadcasting system,the court considered the copyright liability of a catv provider that carried broadcast television programming into subscribers homes from hundreds of miles away.although the court recognized that a viewer might not be able to afford amplifying equipment that would provide access to those distant signals,it nonetheless found that the catv provider was more like a viewer than a broadcaster,at.it explained the reception and rechanneling of broadcast television signals for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function,irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.at.
the court also recognized that the catv system exercised some measure of choice over what to transmit.but that fact did not transform the catv system into a broadcaster.a broadcaster exercises significant creativity in choosing what to air,the court reasoned,at.in contrast,the catv provider makes an initial choice about which broadcast stations to retransmit,but then simply carr ies,without editing,whatever programs it receive s.ibid.quoting fortnightly,supra,at in original.
in congress amended the copyright act in large part to reject the court holdings in fortnightly and teleprompter.see,hereinafter the amendments completely overturned this court narrow construction of the act in fortnightly and teleprompter.congress enacted new language that erased the court line between broadcaster and viewer,in respect to perform ing a work.the amended statute clarifies that to perform an audiovisual work means to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.see ibid.defining a udiovisual works as works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines,together with accompanying sounds under this new language,both the broadcaster and the viewer of a television program perform,because they both show the program images and make audible the program sounds.see,at a broadcasting network is performing when it transmits a singer performance of a song and any individual is performing whenever he or she communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set 
congress also enacted the transmit clause,which specifies that an entity performs publicly when it transmit s a performance to the public.see ibid.defining t o transmit a performance as to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent cable system activities,like those of the catv systems in fortnightly and teleprompter,lie at the heart of the activities that congress intended this language to cover.see,at a cable television system is when it retransmits a network broadcast to its subscribers see also ibid.t he concep t of public performance cover s not only the initial rendition or showing,but also any further act by which that rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public the clause thus makes clear that an entity that acts like a catv system itself performs,even if when doing so,it simply enhances viewers ability to receive broadcast television signals.
congress further created a new section of the act to regulate cable companies public performances of copyrighted works.see.section creates a complex,highly detailed compulsory licensing scheme that sets out the conditions,including the payment of compulsory fees,under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts,at section is primarily directed at the operation of cable television systems and the terms and conditions of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works 
congress made these three changes to achieve a similar end to bring the activities of cable systems within the scope of the copyright act.
this history makes clear that aereo is not simply an equipment provider.rather,aereo,and not just its subscribers,perform s or transmit s aereo activities are substantially similar to those of the catv companies that congress amended the act to reach.see,at c able systems are commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are based on the carriage of copyrighted program material aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs,many of which are copyrighted,almost as they are being broadcast.in providing this service,aereo uses its own equipment,housed in a centralized warehouse,outside of its users homes.by means of its technology antennas,transcoders,and servers,aereo system receive s programs that have been released to the public and carr ies them by private channels to additional viewers.fortnightly,at.it carr ies whatever programs it receive s,and it offers all the programming of each station it carries,at.
aereo equipment may serve a viewer function it may enhance the viewer ability to receive a broadcaster programs.it may even emulate equipment a viewer could use at home.but the same was true of the equipment that was before the court,and ultimately before congress,in fortnightly and teleprompter.
we recognize,and aereo and the dissent emphasize,one particular difference between aereo system and the cable systems at issue in fortnightly and teleprompter.the systems in those cases transmitted constantly they sent continuous programming to each subscriber television set.in contrast,aereo system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program.only at that moment,in automatic response to the subscriber request,does aereo system activate an antenna and begin to transmit the requested program.
this is a critical difference,says the dissent.it means that aereo subscribers,not aereo,selec t the copyrighted content that is perform ed,post,at opinion of scalia,and for that reason they,not aereo,transmit the performance.aereo is thus like a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.post,at.a copy shop is not directly liable whenever a patron uses the shop machines to reproduce copyrighted materials found in that library.see exclusive righ t to reproduce the copyrighted work and by the same token,aereo should not be directly liable whenever its patrons use its equipment to transmit copyrighted television programs to their screens.
in our view,however,the dissent copy shop argument,in whatever form,makes too much out of too little.given aereo overwhelming likeness to the cable companies targeted by the amendments,this sole technological difference between aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here.the subscribers of the fortnightly and teleprompter cable systems also selected what programs to display on their receiving sets.indeed,as we explained in fortnightly,such a subscriber could choose any of the programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on his own television set.at.the same is true of an aereo subscriber.of course,in fortnightly the television signals,in a sense,lurked behind the screen,ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.here the signals pursue their ordinary course of travel through the universe until today turn of the knob a click on a website activates machinery that intercepts and reroutes them to aereo subscribers over the internet.but this difference means nothing to the subscriber.it means nothing to the broadcaster.we do not see how this single difference,invisible to subscriber and broadcaster alike,could transform a system that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable system into a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.
in other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers,a user involvement in the operation of the provider equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the act.but the many similarities between aereo and cable companies,considered in light of congress basic purposes in amending the copyright act,convince us that this difference is not critical here.we conclude that aereo is not just an equipment supplier and that aereo perform s.
next,we must consider whether aereo performs petitioners works publicly,within the meaning of the transmit clause.under the clause,an entity performs a work publicly when it transmit s a performance of the work to the public.aereo denies that it satisfies this definition.it reasons as follows first,the performance it transmit s is the performance created by its act of transmitting.and second,because each of these performances is capable of being received by one and only one subscriber,aereo transmits privately,not publicly.even assuming aereo first argument is correct,its second does not follow.
we begin with aereo first argument.what performance does aereo transmit under the act,t o transmit a performance is to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.ibid.and t o perform an audiovisual work means to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.ibid.
petitioners say aereo transmits a prior performance of their works.thus when aereo retransmits a network prior broadcast,the underlying broadcast itself a performance is the performance that aereo transmits.aereo,as discussed above,says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of transmitting.that performance comes into existence when aereo streams the sounds and images of a broadcast program to a subscriber screen.
we assume arguendo that aereo first argument is correct.thus,for present purposes,to transmit a performance of at least an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work.united states american soc.of composers,authors and publishers,holding that a download of a work is not a performance because the data transmitted are not contemporaneously perceptible when an aereo subscriber selects a program to watch,aereo streams the program over the internet to that subscriber.aereo thereby communicate s to the subscriber,by means of a device or process,the work images and sounds.and those images and sounds are contemporaneously visible and audible on the subscriber computer or other device.so under our assumed definition,aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.
but what about the clause further requirement that aereo transmit a performance to the public as we have said,an aereo subscriber receives broadcast television signals with an antenna dedicated to him alone.aereo system makes from those signals a personal copy of the selected program.it streams the content of the copy to the same subscriber and to no one else.one and only one subscriber has the ability to see and hear each aereo transmission.the fact that each transmission is to only one subscriber,in aereo view,means that it does not transmit a performance to the public.
in terms of the act purposes,these differences do not distinguish aereo system from cable systems,which do perform publicly.viewed in terms of congress regulatory objectives,why should any of these technological differences matter they concern the way in which aereo delivers television programming to its viewers screens.they do not render aereo commercial objective any different from that of cable companies.nor do they significantly alter the viewing experience of aereo subscribers.why would a subscriber who wishes to watch a television show care much whether images and sounds are delivered to his screen via a large multisubscriber antenna or one small dedicated antenna,whether they arrive instantaneously or after a few seconds delay,or whether they are transmitted directly or after a personal copy is made and why,if aereo is right,could not modern catv systems simply continue the same commercial and activities,free of copyright restrictions,provided they substitute such new technologies for old congress would as much have intended to protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of aereo as from those of cable companies.
the text of the clause effectuates congress intent.aereo argument to the contrary relies on the premise that to transmit a performance means to make a single transmission.but the clause suggests that an entity may transmit a performance through multiple,discrete transmissions.that is because one can transmit or communicate something through a set of actions.thus one can transmit a message to one friends,irrespective of whether one sends separate identical to each friend or a single to all at once.so can an elected official communicate an idea,slogan,or speech to her constituents,regardless of whether she communicates that idea,slogan,or speech during individual phone calls to each constituent or in a public square.
the fact that a singular noun a performance follows the words to transmit does not suggest the contrary.one can sing a song to his family,whether he sings the same song or in front of all together.similarly,one colleagues may watch a performance of a particular play say,this season version of measure for measure whether they do so at separate or at the same showings.by the same principle,an entity may transmit a performance through one or several transmissions,where the performance is of the same work.
the transmit clause must permit this interpretation,for it provides that one may transmit a performance to the public whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance receive it at the same time or at different times.were the words to transmit a performance limited to a single act of communication,members of the public could not receive the performance communicated at different times.therefore,in light of the purpose and text of the clause,we conclude that when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people,it transmits a performance to them regardless of the number of discrete communications it makes.
we do not see how the fact that aereo transmits via personal copies of programs could make a difference.the act applies to transmissions by means of any device or process.ibid.and retransmitting a television program using copies is a process of transmitting a performance.a cop y of a work is simply a material objec t in which a work is fixed and from which the work can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated.ibid.so whether aereo transmits from the same or separate copies,it performs the same work it shows the same images and makes audible the same sounds.therefore,when aereo streams the same television program to multiple subscribers,it transmit s a performance to all of them.
moreover,the subscribers to whom aereo transmits television programs constitute the public.aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other.this matters because,although the act does not define the public,it specifies that an entity performs publicly when it performs at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.ibid.the act thereby suggests that the public consists of a large group of people outside of a family and friends.
neither the record nor aereo suggests that aereo subscribers receive performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works.this is relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people,whether they constitute the public often depends upon their relationship to the underlying work.when,for example,a valet parking attendant returns cars to their drivers,we would not say that the parking service provides cars to the public.we would say that it provides the cars to their owners.we would say that a car dealership,on the other hand,does provide cars to the public,for it sells cars to individuals who lack a relationship to the cars.similarly,an entity that transmits a performance to individuals in their capacities as owners or possessors does not perform to the public,whereas an entity like aereo that transmits to large numbers of paying subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the works does so perform.
finally,we note that aereo subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations.this fact does not help aereo,however,for the transmit clause expressly provides that an entity may perform publicly whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.ibid.in other words,the public need not be situated together,spatially or temporally.for these reasons,we conclude that aereo transmits a performance of petitioners copyrighted works to the public,within the meaning of the transmit clause.
aereo and many of its supporting amici argue that to apply the transmit clause to aereo conduct will impose copyright liability on other technologies,including new technologies,that congress could not possibly have wanted to reach.we agree that congress,while intending the transmit clause to apply broadly to cable companies and their equivalents,did not intend to discourage or to control the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies.but we do not believe that our limited holding today will have that effect.
for one thing,the history of cable broadcast transmissions that led to the enactment of the transmit clause informs our conclusion that aereo perform s,but it does not determine whether different kinds of providers in different contexts also perform.for another,an entity only transmits a performance when it communicates contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds of a work.see brief for respondent i f a distributor sells multiple copies of a digital video disc by mail to consumers,its distribution of the dvds merely makes it possible for the recipients to perform the work themselves it is not a device or process by which the distributor publicly performs the work emphasis in original.
further,we have interpreted the term the public to apply to a group of individuals acting as ordinary members of the public who pay primarily to watch broadcast television programs,many of which are copyrighted.we have said that it does not extend to those who act as owners or possessors of the relevant product.and we have not considered whether the public performance right is infringed when the user of a service pays primarily for something other than the transmission of copyrighted works,such as the remote storage of content.see brief for united states as amicus curiae distinguishing storage services because they offer consumers more numerous and convenient means of playing back copies that the consumers have already lawfully acquired emphasis in original.in addition,an entity does not to the public if it does not transmit to a substantial number of people outside of a family and its social circle.
we also note that courts often apply a statute highly general language in light of the statute basic purposes.finally,the doctrine of fair use can help to prevent inappropriate or inequitable applications of the clause.see sony of america universal city studios.
we can not now answer more precisely how the transmit clause or other provisions of the copyright act will apply to technologies not before us.we agree with the solicitor general that q uestions involving cloud computing,remote storage dvrs,and other novel issues not before the court,as to which congress has not plainly marked the course,should await a case in which they are squarely presented.brief for united states as amicus curiae quoting sony,supra,at alteration in original.and we note that,to the extent commercial actors or other interested entities may be concerned with the relationship between the development and use of such technologies and the copyright act,they are of course free to seek action from congress.digital millennium copyright act.
in sum,having considered the details of aereo practices,we find them highly similar to those of the catv systems in fortnightly and teleprompter.and those are activities that the amendments sought to bring within the scope of the copyright act.insofar as there are differences,those differences concern not the nature of the service that aereo provides so much as the technological manner in which it provides the service.we conclude that those differences are not adequate to place aereo activities outside the scope of the act.
for these reasons,we conclude that aereo perform s petitioners copyrighted works publicly,as those terms are defined by the transmit clause.we therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the court of appeals,and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice scalia,with whom justice thomas and justice alito join,dissenting.
this case is the latest skirmish in the copyright battle over the delivery of television programming.petitioners,a collection of television networks and affiliates networks,broadcast copyrighted programs on the public airwaves for all to see.aereo,respondent,operates an automated system that allows subscribers to receive,on devices,programs that they select,including the networks copyrighted programs.the networks sued aereo for several forms of copyright infringement,but we are here concerned with a single claim that aereo violates the networks exclusive righ t to perform their programs publicly.that claim fails at the very outset because aereo does not perform at all.the court manages to reach the opposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted rules for liability and adopting in their place an improvised standard that will sow confusion for years to come.
legal standard 
there are two types of liability for copyright infringement direct and secondary.as its name suggests,the former applies when an actor personally engages in infringing conduct.see sony of america universal city studios.secondary liability,by contrast,is a means of holding defendants responsible for infringement by third parties,even when the defendants have not themselves engaged in the infringing activity.at.it applies when a defendant intentionally induc es or encourag es infringing acts by others or profits from such acts while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit them.studios grokster.
most suits against equipment manufacturers and service providers involve claims.for example,when movie studios sued to block the sale of sony betamax videocassette recorder vcr,they argued that sony was liable because its customers were making unauthorized copies.see sony,supra,at.record labels and movie studios relied on a similar theory when they sued grokster and streamcast,two providers of software.see grokster,supra,at.
this suit,or rather the portion of it before us here,is fundamentally different.the networks claim that aereo directly infringes their right.accordingly,the networks must prove that aereo perform s copyrighted works,when its subscribers log in,select a channel,and push the watch button.that process undoubtedly results in a performance the question is who does the performing.see cartoon network lp,lllp csc holdings.if aereo subscribers perform but aereo does not,the claim necessarily fails.
the networks claim is governed by a simple but profoundly important rule a defendant may be held directly liable only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that violates the act.see patry,copyright.this requirement is firmly grounded in the act text,which defines perform in active,affirmative terms one perform s a copyrighted audiovisual work,such as a movie or news broadcast,by show ing its images in any sequence or mak ing the sounds accompanying it audible.and since the act makes it unlawful to copy or perform copyrighted works,not to copy or perform in general,see a,the requirement demands conduct directed to the plaintiff copyrighted material,see sony,supra,at.every court of appeals to have considered an provider direct liability for copyright infringement has adopted that rule.see fox broadcasting dish network llc,cartoon network,supra,at costar group,loopnet,although we have not opined on the issue,our cases are fully consistent with a requirement.for example,we gave several examples of direct infringement in sony,each of which involved a volitional act directed to the plaintiff copyrighted material.see,at.
the requirement is not at issue in most cases the usual point of dispute is whether the defendant conduct is infringing,does the defendant design copy the plaintiff,rather than whether the defendant has acted at all,did this defendant create the infringing design.but it comes right to the fore when a claim is lodged against a defendant who does nothing more than operate an automated,system.see,fox broadcasting,supra,at cartoon network,supra,at.providers are a prime example.when one user sends data to another,the provider equipment facilitates the transfer automatically.does that mean that the provider is directly liable when the transmission happens to result in the reproduc tion,of a copyrighted work it does not.the provider system is totally indifferent to the material content,whereas courts require some aspect of volition directed at the copyrighted material before direct liability may be imposed.costar,at the defendant may be held directly liable only if the defendant itself trespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright owner.at.most of the time that issue will come down to who selects the copyrighted content the defendant or its customers.see cartoon network,supra,at.
a comparison between copy shops and services illustrates the point.a copy shop rents out photocopiers on a basis.one customer might copy his drawings a perfectly lawful thing to do while another might duplicate a famous artist copyrighted photographs a use clearly prohibited by.either way,the customer chooses the content and activates the copying function the photocopier does nothing except in response to the customer commands.because the shop plays no role in selecting the content,it can not be held directly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy.see costar,supra,at.
services,like photocopiers,respond automatically to user input,but they differ in one crucial respect they choose the content.when a user signs in to netflix,for example,thousands of movies and tv episodes carefully curated by netflix are available to watch instantly.see how d oes netflix w ork,online at as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file.that selection and arrangement by the service provider constitutes a volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works and thus serves as a basis for direct liability.
the distinction between direct and secondary liability would collapse if there were not a clear rule for determining whether the defendant committed the infringing act.see cartoon network,at.the requirement supplies that rule its purpose is not to excuse defendants from accountability,but to channel the claims against them into the correct analytical track.see brief for intellectual property and copyright law professors as amici curiae.thus,in the example given above,the fact that the copy shop does not choose the content simply means that its culpability will be assessed using rules rather than rules.see sony,supra,at cartoon network,supra,at.
ii.application to aereo 
so which is aereo the copy shop or the service in truth,it is neither.rather,it is akin to a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.aereo offers access to an automated system consisting of routers,servers,transcoders,and antennae.like a photocopier or vcr,that system lies dormant until a subscriber activates it.when a subscriber selects a program,aereo system picks up the relevant broadcast signal,translates its audio and video components into digital data,stores the data in a file,and transmits that file contents to the subscriber via the internet at which point the subscriber laptop,tablet,or other device displays the broadcast just as an ordinary television would.the result of that process fits the statutory definition of a performance to a tee the subscriber device show s the broadcast images and make s the sounds accompanying the broadcast audible.the only question is whether those performances are the product of aereo volitional conduct.
they are not.unlike services,aereo does not provide a prearranged assortment of movies and television shows.rather,it assigns each subscriber an antenna that like a library card can be used to obtain whatever broadcasts are freely available.some of those broadcasts are copyrighted others are in the public domain.the key point is that subscribers call all the shots aereo automated system does not relay any program,copyrighted or not,until a subscriber selects the program and tells aereo to relay it.aereo operation of that system is a volitional act and a cause of the resulting performances,but,as in the case of the copy shop,that degree of involvement is not enough for direct liability.see grokster,at breyer,concurring t he producer of a technology which permits unlawful copying does not himself engage in unlawful copying 
in sum,aereo does not perform for the sole and simple reason that it does not make the choice of content.and because aereo does not perform,it can not be held directly liable for infringing the networks right that conclusion does not necessarily mean that aereo service complies with the copyright act.quite the contrary.the networks complaint alleges that aereo is directly and secondarily liable for infringing their rights and also their reproduction rights.their request for a preliminary injunction the only issue before this court is based exclusively on the portion of the claim and further limited to aereo watch function,as opposed to its record function.see app.to pet.for cert.affirming the judgment below would merely return this case to the lower courts for consideration of the networks remaining claims.
iii.guilt by resemblance 
the court conclusion that aereo performs boils down to the following syllogism congress amended the act to overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not perform when they retransmit broadcasts aereo looks a lot like a cable system therefore aereo performs.ante,at.that reasoning suffers from a trio of defects.
first,it is built on the shakiest of foundations.perceiving the text to be ambiguous,ante,at,the court reaches out to decide the case based on a few isolated snippets of legislative history,ante,at citing.the court treats those snippets as authoritative evidence of congressional intent even though they come from a single report issued by a committee whose members make up a small fraction of one of the two houses of congress.little else need be said here about the severe shortcomings of that interpretative methodology.see lawson fmr llc,scalia,concurring in principal part and concurring in judgment slip,at.
second,the court reasoning fails on its own terms because there are material differences between the cable systems at issue in teleprompter columbia broadcasting system,and fortnightly united artists television,on the one hand and aereo on the other.the former which were then known as television systems captured the full range of broadcast signals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all times,whereas aereo transmits only specific programs selected by the user,at specific times selected by the user.the court acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes that it does not make a critical difference.ante,at.even if that were true,the court fails to account for other salient differences between the two technologies though cable systems started out essentially as dumb pipes that routed signals from point a to point b,see ante,at,by the,that kind of service no longer exist ed,brief for petitioners in columbia broadcasting system,teleprompter.at the time of our teleprompter decision,cable companies perform ed the same functions as broadcasters by deliberatel
