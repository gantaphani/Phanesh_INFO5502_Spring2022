plaintiffs appellants lynn gorman bakos gorman bakos and rodney bakos bakos together,the bakoses or plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,chief judge,awarding summary judgment to defendants because plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient evidence of a causal connection between their speech and defendants alleged retaliatory employment actions.the bakoses argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because they offered sufficient facts to prove that a causal connection existed between their dismissal and their constitutionally protected speech.defendants cross appellants appeal the denial of their request for attorney fees.
for the reasons stated below,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.we dismiss the as moot.
background 
i.the cooperative 
defendant the cornell cooperative extension association of schenectady county the cooperative is a subordinate government agency composed of an unincorporated organization of citizens of schenectady county.see county b.in association with cornell university,the cooperative runs extension programs,including a program see county.the cooperative is supported by federal,state and county funds.see et county a,b.the cooperative is governed by a board of directors.see county b.at the time of the events alleged in the complaint,defendants dorothy foster,bob lindsay,tim manning,marion pierce,jo ann rafilik,steve ras,linda rohmer,sharon sutton and grace underwood were members of the cooperative board of directors defendant mike pierotti pierotti served as the president of the board of directors and of the cooperative defendant ellen elliott elliott served as the executive director of the cooperative and defendant angela warner warner served as the youth development leader for the cooperative program.
ii.plaintiffs initial concerns 
in january,plaintiffs,who are residents of schenectady county and horse enthusiasts,applied to volunteer with the cooperative program.in february,they enrolled as volunteer leaders and organized a club known as the horses hounds club.based on their participation in the program,the bakoses became concerned about the cooperative,believing that the cooperative managed and allocated government funds in a manner inconsistent with its policies,had insufficient safety rules governing sponsored horse competitions and activities,held inadequate insurance coverage for activities,and had inadequate guidelines for judging horse competitions.
according to defendants,in may,the bakoses contacted a new york state horse program faculty member at cornell university,jeanne griffith griffith,to discuss the horse program.warner learned of this discussion and spoke with griffith,who told her that the bakoses were concerned about the cooperative lack of cooperation with them.warner had several conversations with the bakoses,and in june,the schenectady horse club held a meeting to discuss its horse programs.the club,including the bakoses,formed a horse rally committee to improve and promote its horse programs.during the summer,the committee met several times and worked closely with warner.warner allegedly received numerous complaints about the bakoses attitude and conduct during the horse rally committee meetings.in september,the bakoses resigned from the committee.
in october,the bakoses wrote to warner regarding their worries about the cooperative program.while planning a meeting with the bakoses,warner,elliott and the bakoses exchanged heated correspondence.on october,elliott,warner and a cooperative educator met with the bakoses in person,and during the meeting,developed a plan to address the bakoses concerns.nonetheless,the bakoses were unsatisfied with the cooperative response.during november and december,the bakoses,warner,elliott and another staff member engaged in further heated conversations and correspondence.warner scheduled a meeting with horse club members for late december,but this meeting was postponed when gorman bakos could not attend.
in november and december,the bakoses requested various membership lists and other documents from the cooperative.at the end of january,bakos requested a list of all volunteers.on the advice of cooperative foil officer and after checking the cooperative policy manual,elliott informed the bakoses that she could not release the list.
iii.contacts with local political leaders 
in december,the bakoses wrote to frank potter potter,chairman of the schenectady county legislature,and robert mcevoy mcevoy,the schenectady county manager,to criticize the cooperative resource allocation and to express concerns about its program.in early january,bakos met with potter and mcevoy.after this meeting,bakos called warner and told her that he was concerned with animal science funding,horse programming and the lack of safety guidelines.on january,wrote to warner and elliott to reiterate the issues raised by bakos in his recent conversation with warner.on january,elliott,pierotti and potter met with the bakoses,who explained their dissatisfaction with the cooperative,including its response to safety issues and its initial rejection of an youth membership in the horse hounds.the cooperative agreed that the youth could join the horse hounds and that the cooperative staff would draft and circulate safety guidelines within thirty days.
on january,bakos called elliott to ask that he be scheduled to address the cooperative board of directors at its next meeting.the request was granted,and bakos made a presentation to the board,discussing issues and the cooperative lack of interest in large animal issues.on february,called warner to advise her that plaintiffs wanted to transfer the horses hounds to the program of a neighboring county.elliott and warner informed plaintiffs that the cooperative did not object to such a move.on february,bakos wrote to elliott to alert her that they planned to meet with three schenectady county legislators to discuss the club,including its lack of safety rules,and alleged financial mismanagement of the cooperative.on february,elliott met with two legislators who had conferred with bakos,and provided the legislators with information they requested.
iv.safety guidelines 
on january,the board of directors voted to suspend large animal programs until safety guidelines were put in place.warner led the safety guidelines project,and by,she circulated draft regulations.in early march,warner sent a letter to volunteer leaders advising them that the board of directors had suspended large animal programs for youths.on march,the board of directors adopted the animal safety guidelines for adults working with youth,and lifted the ban on large animal activities for those leaders who agreed to read and follow the guidelines.on april,warner wrote to tell the volunteer leaders about the board adoption of the guidelines.according to the bakoses,pierotti suspended horse activities at their farm even before they were suspended for other sites.the bakoses believed that the early suspension had a discriminatory motive.
termination of plaintiffs membership 
on march,warner had a telephone conversation with bakos.warner claims that bakos told her that he and gorman bakos were resigning as members the bakoses claim that they never resigned.on march,elliott and warner sent plaintiffs a letter confirming their resignation,and wrote to inform the parents of members of the horse hounds club of the resignation.the next day,plaintiffs mailed warner a letter denying their alleged resignation.on march,the bakoses attorney also sent elliott a letter denying that his clients had resigned and demanding an immediate retraction.on april,an executive session of the board of directors voted to reaffirm with the bakos their decision to resign and if they refuse to accept it,to terminate them as volunteers.
in describing plaintiffs participation in,defendants allege that plaintiffs conduct disrupted the cooperative operation.for example,the cooperative states that t he content,form and context of plaintiffs complaints herein clearly show that plaintiffs sic comments were motivated by their own personal agenda rather than any regard for the greater public good.plaintiffs complaints were made in the context of their efforts to have things done their way.defendants claim that t he manner in which plaintiffs communicated their concerns was disruptive and undermined the functioning of the organization.plaintiffs were clearly not seeking to engage in serious debate on matters of public concern but rather were engaging in repeated outbursts of petulance and boorishness when they did not get their way.plaintiffs dispute these characterizations of their conduct.
on august,plaintiffs filed suit under,alleging violations of their first,fifth and fourteenth amendment rights,and under the new york state constitution,alleging violations of their free speech,due process and equal protection rights.the factual basis for these claims was plaintiffs allegation that the cooperative retaliated against them by,among other things,terminating their volunteer status and enrollment in because,in discussions with cooperative members and staff as well as with local elected officials,plaintiffs advocated policies contrary to those of defendants.after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,which was granted on july,because the district court held that plaintiffs had failed to provide sufficient evidence of a causal connection between their exercises of free speech and the allegedly retaliatory actions taken by defendants.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see byrnie town of cromwell,cir.at summary judgment,a court is tasked with determining whether genuine disputes over material fact exist between the parties which should properly be submitted to a jury or whether,where no issues of material fact are found,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.w hen examining the evidence,the court should resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the party.id.
state actor 
in the present case,the district court assumed that the cooperative was a state actor.because the district court provided little or no discussion with regard to this issue,and the parties do not argue it on appeal,we do not reach it.our own sense of the law suggests that the cooperative can be treated as a state actor for purposes of the first amendment merits in loce time warner entertainment partnership,cir,this court explained 
the first amendment applies only to state actors.in order to establish a first amendment claim against a private entity based on the entity relationship to the state,a plaintiff must demonstrate,inter alia,a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.such a nexus may be found,for example,where a private actor has operated as a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents.in the absence of such a nexus,a finding of state action may not be premised on the private entity creation,funding,licensing,or regulation by the government.nor is a private entity a state actor merely because its conduct is authorized by a state law,where its conduct is not compelled by the state.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.recently,the supreme court identified a host of facts that can bear on whether an activity may be attributable to the state when the state exercises its coercive power or significant encouragement,when a private actor is a willful participant in joint activity with the state,when an entity is controlled by the state or an agency thereof,when an entity has been delegated a public function by the state,when an actor is entwined with governmental policies,or when the government is entwined in the entity management or control.see brentwood acad.tennessee secondary sch.athletic ass n,d.in an earlier case specifically addressing the status of a corporation as a state actor,the supreme court held that where the government creates a corporation by special law,for the furtherance of governmental objectives,and retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation,the corporation is part of the government for purposes of the first amendment.lebron national passenger,d holding that amtrak was a state actor.
the corporate defendant in the present case is the cooperative.it was originally created and is funded under a federal program providing for cooperative extension programs to operate in conjunction with the united states department of agriculture and state land grant universities to disseminate useful information for individuals living in rural areas.see see also knight alabama,cir describing cooperative extension programs.in new york,the state county law allows counties to create subordinate governmental agencies to provide extension services in conjunction with two cornell university colleges.see county.under new york law,a subordinate governmental agency is an organization which either through legislative act or contract with the state or subdivision of the state performs governmental functions.see people brooklyn cooperage,see also stahl soap city of new york,new york city is a subordinate government agency holding noto,dep t in new york,subordinate governmental agencies include the city of new york,villages and towns.the new york county law allows a county board of supervisors to pay for the support of an extension service,including staff salaries,and to levy taxes to support the cooperative.see county a.the county law defines the scope of the extension service programs,which may extend to agriculture,home economics,and community betterment,as well as its organizational structure.id.b.under the cooperative,its form and organization are subject to approval by cornell university as an agent of the state.the policies and programs of the cooperative are set by its board of directors in conjunction with the director of extension programs of cornell university.its board of directors must include a representative of the director of extension programs and a member of the schenectady county legislature.the cooperative entered into a memorandum of understanding with cornell university,as an agent of the state and as a designated agent of the united states,for cornell to provide extensive support and oversight for the cooperative.
in sum,the cooperative was created pursuant to state law to carry out county,state and federal educational functions is funded by federal,state and county governments is subject to significant oversight by cornell university as an agent of the state and is defined in state law as a subordinate governmental agency.we suggest that these factors,demonstrating that the cooperative is a creature of the state which voluntarily carries out state functions with state encouragement,indicate that the cooperative is a state actor for purposes of the first amendment 
ii.causation 
the district court evaluated plaintiffs claims under the morris lindau,cir,standard for first amendment retaliation claims brought by public employees.under morris,
a plaintiff making a first amendment retaliation claim under must initially demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that his speech was constitutionally protected,he suffered an adverse employment decision,and a causal connection exists between his speech and the adverse employment determination against him,so that it can be said that his speech was a motivating factor in the determination.if a plaintiff establishes these three factors,the defendant has the opportunity to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same adverse employment action even in the absence of the protected conduct.
morris,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the district court dismissed plaintiffs free speech claim because it found that they had failed to establish the third morris factor,a causal connection the district court described the events set forth in the record,and then stated 
the foregoing sequence of events does not support plaintiffs theory that they were terminated at a time soon after county officials began an inquiry into the operations of the coop extension.defendants first learned that plaintiffs were seeking county involvement more than five months before plaintiffs were terminated as volunteers.this lapse of time is too great to support an inference of retaliation.
the district court rejected plaintiffs claim that defendants had retaliated because of plaintiffs ongoing complaints and contacts with county officials.it reasoned that because defendants had produced evidence that they reacted favorably,rather than negatively,to plaintiffs conduct,the bakoses had not established the causal link necessary to support a retaliation claim.
in this circuit,a plaintiff can indirectly establish a causal connection to support a discrimination or retaliation claim by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse employment action.reed lawrence,cir citation and quotation marks omitted twelve days between alleged sexual harassment and discharge could suggest a causal relationship.this court has not drawn a bright line to define the outer limits beyond which a temporal relationship is too attenuated to establish a causal relationship between the exercise of a federal constitutional right and an allegedly retaliatory action compare richardson new york state dep t of corr,cir abusive acts within one month of receipt of deposition notices may be retaliation for initiation of lawsuit more than one year earlier quinn green tree credit,cir discharge less than two months after plaintiff filed a sexual harassment complaint with management and ten days after filing complaint with state human rights office provided prima facie evidence of a causal connection between protected activity and retaliation and grant bethlehem steel,cir gap between eeoc complaint and retaliatory action suggested a causal relationship,with hollander american cyanamid,cir passage of three months too long to suggest a causal relationship between complaint and failure to provide good recommendation.other circuits have come to different conclusions compare keller orix credit alliance,cir en banc suggesting that four or five months between discriminatory acts and firing may suggest relationship,while holding that plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent,with filipovic express,cir four months was too long to suggest causal relationship between filing charges and termination.
in the case at hand,we need not nail down the elusive outer limit.the bakoses claim that the cooperative took three retaliatory actions in january,suspending horse programs at their farm under the proposed safety guidelines when such activities were not suspended at other sites in march,determining that the bakoses had communicated their resignation,and advising some members and their parents of the resignation and in april,voting to accept the bakoses resignation,and,in the alternative,to terminate their membership if they rescinded their resignation 
the bakoses initially publicly complained about the program in may,with their discussion with griffith at cornell.their protests continued through the summer,and escalated in october,when they wrote to the cooperative leadership with their concerns.they complained to county leaders in december,and continued these contacts through february.taking these facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,only a few days passed between their contact with county leaders and the suspension of horse activities on their farm.only two months passed between the january meeting with county leaders and the dispute over the alleged resignation,and only three months went by between the january meeting and the board of directors vote to terminate the bakoses.in each case,the passage of time was brief enough to support an inference of a causal connection between the free speech and the alleged retaliatory actions.even if we were to follow the district court lead and consider the time between the bakoses december contact with mcevoy and potter,and the termination vote,only about four months elapsed between these events.this temporal proximity is sufficient to support an allegation of a causal connection strong enough to survive a summary judgment motion.we are particularly confident that five months is not too long to support such an allegation where plaintiffs have provided evidence of exercises of free speech and subsequent retaliatory actions occurring between december and april.
the district court held that i n light of defendants relatively quick positive responses,combined with the passage of two months where plaintiffs made no further mention of meeting with county officials,the court finds no basis upon which to conclude that any causal connection exists between plaintiffs expression of their concerns to both coop extension and county officials,and their ultimate termination as volunteer leaders.contrary to the district court conclusion,defendants allegedly positive response to plaintiffs call for changes in the program does not defeat plaintiffs opposition to the motion for summary judgment.it is possible,in light of the evidence offered,that defendants recognized that plaintiffs had identified areas in which the program might improve,yet at the same time sought to expel plaintiffs from participation in the program because of the challenges with which they presented defendants.
iii.defendants explanations 
defendants advance two explanations for why they were entitled to dismiss plaintiffs.first,they argue that they would have terminated plaintiffs membership even if the plaintiffs had not engaged in protected speech because plaintiffs other nonprotected conduct interfered with the cooperative operation.see mount healthy sch.dist.bd.of ed.doyle,d morris lindau,cir citation omitted heil santoro,cir affirming summary judgment for defendants on plaintiff first amendment retaliation claim where plaintiff police officer would have been disciplined for insubordination without regard to his protected speech.the bakoses contend that defendants mischaracterize their actions,and they emphasize the lack of objective evidence to support defendants claim that their conduct,in contrast to their speech,negatively affected the cooperative operation.
second,defendants argue that even assuming that they dismissed plaintiffs,and did so because of their protected speech,they were entitled to do so because the manner in which the speech was expressed was so disruptive of the cooperative operation that the cooperative interest in continuing to provide its services without excessive interference outweighed plaintiffs interest in free speech.plaintiffs counter that their speech did not disrupt the cooperative functioning and that defendants responded to the content of their speech,not the allegedly disruptive manner in which the speech was delivered.plaintiffs further contend that the cooperative dismissed them,at least in part,because of their communications with county that,we note,defendants do not claim were disruptive to the cooperative in any way.
in greenwich citizens committee,counties of warren washington industrial development agency,cir,relied upon by both defendants and the district court,we emphasized that a key inquiry with respect to any claim of first amendment retaliation is whether the allegedly retaliatory act was taken because of an impermissible reason.id.at.this determination of impermissibility is generally applicable to all claims.in greenwich,the determination of the constitutionality of the government filing of counterclaims in response to plaintiffs complaint turned solely on whether the government would have filed the counterclaims in the absence of an impermissible punitive or retaliatory reason.id.at.where the routine conduct of litigation could justify the response,we held the government would be entitled to take action precisely in response to the protected conduct without any need to demonstrate that its interests outweighed plaintiffs first amendment interests,unless the government acted in order t
