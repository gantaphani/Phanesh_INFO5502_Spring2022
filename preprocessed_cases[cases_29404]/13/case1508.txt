ronald pretrial detainee in the chenango county,new york jail at the time relevant to this that officials of the chenango county jail defendants violated his constitutional right of access to the courts by denying his request for reference materials from the jail law library,failing to maintain a law library with adequate and materials,and failing to provide timely services of a public notary,all of which allegedly harmed bourdon in his efforts to prepare and file pro se a timely pretrial motion to dismiss the state criminal indictment pursuant to which he was being detained.at the time bourdon requested the materials and notary services and ultimately moved to dismiss the indictment,indigent represented by counsel.
raising only an claim,bourdon filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,chief judge pursuant to on for summary judgment,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the complaint.
on appeal,bourdon contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants.he argues that his appointed counsel was ineffective and therefore,notwithstanding his representation by that attorney,defendants hindered bourdon access to the state trial court,in violation of his constitutional right of access to the courts,when they denied bourdon request for reference materials.bourdon,however,has not asserted a cause of action of ineffective assistance of counsel,and,in any event,an ineffectiveness cause of action would be inappropriate in a proceeding brought under.see polk county dodson,d holding that public defenders do not act under color of state law and therefore are not subject to suit under rodriguez weprin,cir i t is that attorneys performing a lawyer traditional functions as counsel to defendant do not act under color of state law and therefore are not subject to suit under.rather,in service of his claim,bourdon invokes the effectiveness inquiry relevant to the sixth amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel it is true that the rights to assistance of counsel and of access to the courts are interrelated however,the two rights are not the same.benjamin fraser,cir.for the reasons discussed below,we reject bourdon argument that the effectiveness inquiry pertinent to the sixth amendment right to counsel informs the inquiry relevant to an alleged violation of access to the courts.instead,we conclude that the appointment of bourdon counsel satisfied the state obligation to provide access to the courts,and we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
in the fall of,bourdon was incarcerated in the chenango county jail pursuant to new york state charges of possession of a stolen vehicle,driving while intoxicated,and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree.while incarcerated,bourdon requested reference materials from the jail law library in order to prepare,pro se,pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment and to be relieved of his current counsel and receive replacement counsel.defendants denied bourdon request for materials,on the grounds that bourdon was represented at the time by,the public defender of chenango whom bourdon could request the materials he desired.defendants,who do not have supervisory authority over counsel,adhered to their position when bourdon,who never requested the materials from his attorney,stated only that he had not heard from his attorney and indicated that he was disappointed with his attorney services.
without reference materials from the library,bourdon filed his pro se motions.the state trial court denied the motion to dismiss,finding that the motion was untimely and that bourdon,rather than defendants,was responsible for the late filing.the court,however,granted bourdon motion for new counsel that motion was not contested by the public defender 
shortly thereafter,on january,bourdon filed the instant lawsuit,claiming in an amended complaint that he had been deprived of his constitutional right of access to the courts when defendants denied his request for reference materials and delayed provision of notary services necessary for bourdon to file properly his pro se motion to dismiss the state indictment against him.on march,on for summary judgment,the district court adopted the report and recommendation of judge david hurd that recommended entry of judgment for defendants and dismissal of the complaint.
on bourdon appeal from the district court order granting summary judgment to defendants and dismissing the complaint,this court held that the district court,before ruling in favor of defendants,should have apprised bourdon,a pro se litigant,of the consequences of failing to file a response to defendants summary judgment motion.accordingly,in a summary order,bourdon loughren,wl,at cir,the order was vacated and the cause remanded to the district court.
on remand,the parties for summary judgment.judge gary sharpe concluded that bourdon right of access to the courts had not been denied,finding that bourdon could have asked for an extension of time to move to dismiss the indictment and that the denial of bourdon motion to dismiss resulted from bourdon inaction,not because bourdon was delayed access to notary services.the magistrate judge also determined that bourdon was represented by counsel during all times that he claimed he was denied access to the courts.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court again grant defendants motion for summary judgment.on july,the district court agreed,adopting in full the magistrate judge report and recommendation and granting summary judgment to defendants.bourdon timely appealed.
on appeal,bourdon maintains that defendants denial of his request for reference materials regarding his motions to dismiss the indictment and to obtain replacement counsel,the alleged deficiencies in the jail law library,and the delay in the provision of notary services hindered his efforts to file a timely motion to dismiss and otherwise present his claims and grievances to the state trial court he asserts had the defendants provided plaintiff with legal assistance and research materials his pro se motion to dismiss the indictment would not have been dismissed as untimely,plaintiff would have argued effectively that his motion was not untimely,that certain days should not have been included in the day time limit.appellant br.at.he further asserts that when he requested the library materials,he was without effective assistance of counsel.id.for these reasons,bourdon claims that defendants deprived him of his constitutional right of access to the courts.

iii.analysis 
the circumstances of the case before us present the following questions whether the appointment of counsel can be a valid means of satisfying fully a state constitutional obligation to provide prisoners with meaningful access to the courts if so,whether the provision of counsel to satisfy a prisoner right of access to the courts should be measured in terms of whether that counsel was effective under the sixth amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel and whether,in the circumstances of this case,the fact of bourdon appointed counsel established constitutionally acceptable access to the courts.
appointment of counsel as meaningful access to the courts 
as an initial matter,we confirm that the appointment of counsel can be a valid means of satisfying a prisoner right of access to the courts.although,before now,we have not addressed directly this precise question,we have indicated in dicta that the provision of counsel can be a means of accessing the courts that satisfies a state constitutional obligation to provide pretrial detainees with access to the courts.benjamin fraser,cir considering whether prison restrictions on detainees contact with their attorneys violated the detainees constitutional rights to counsel and of access to the courts.moreover,several of our sister circuits already have interpreted appointment of counsel as a valid means of providing pretrial detainees and other prisoners with constitutionally mandated access to the courts.see,united states smith,cir holding that the state does not have to provide access to a law library to defendants in criminal trials who wish to represent themselves and waive their right to counsel peterkin jeffes,cir reading bounds to hold that the provision of lawyers is one means by which a state may provide prisoners with meaningful access to courts howland kilquist,cir finding that the trial court offer of appointment of counsel in the criminal proceedings,and the appointment of standby counsel,satisfied any obligation which the state had to provide the inmate with legal assistance love summit county,cir concluding that,where detainee had access to his counsel at all times during his incarceration,he did not show that he was denied access to adequate legal assistance to help him prepare and pursue his claims before the courts or that defendants in any significant way restricted that access storseth spellman,cir appointed counsel,whether state or court provided,offers a meaningful,and certainly the best,avenue of access to an indigent inmate.united states chatman,cir in a case in which prisoner who elected to proceed without counsel complained of lack of materials in the prison library,concluding that the government had no obligation to provide legal materials and declining to read bounds to give an option to the prisoner as to the form in which he elects to obtain legal assistance.they have done so with good reason.as the supreme court has explained,one form by which authorities can satisfy the right of access to the courts is by providing prisoners with adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.bounds,at.emphasis added.indeed,the supreme court has observed that the use of staff attorneys,working as part of public defender or legal services offices,is an imaginative form by which a state can provide prisoners with access to the courts.id.at.accordingly,today we explicitly hold that the appointment of counsel can be a valid means of fully satisfying a state constitutional obligation to provide prisoners,including pretrial detainees,with access to the courts in conformity with the requirements of the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment 
interpreting adequate assistance from persons trained in the law 
bourdon devotes a significant portion of his brief to allegations that the attorney representing him at the time he sought materials from the jail library was ineffective.for example,bourdon claims that his calls and chain of letters to the chenango county public defender find out which attorney had been designated to represent either refused or not acknowledged.appellant br.at.he also claims that,once he learned the name of the designated attorney,that attorney never visited bourdon in the jail,id.at,despite the attorney assurances to members of bourdon family that he would meet with bourdon,id.at.thus,in the context of bourdon only claim presented in his complaint we read the complaint to allege that,as a result of the attorney alleged ineffectiveness,the provision of that attorney did not satisfy the state obligation to provide bourdon with meaningful access to the courts,and that,when defendants denied bourdon request for reference materials,they hindered his access to the state trial court and thereby violated his constitutional right of access to the courts.this argument requires us to consider whether any claim of constitutionally acceptable access to the courts through appointed counsel should be measured by reference to the constitutional standard of effective assistance of counsel.in other words,we must consider the meaning of the phrase adequate assistance from persons trained in the law,as used in bounds to identify one method of providing prisoners access to the courts,see at.emphasis added.
for several reasons,we are not persuaded that the effectiveness inquiry under the sixth amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel informs the inquiry relevant to an alleged violation of access to the courts.
we first observe that the two of counsel and access to the not share a common constitutional source.the right to assistance of as the right to effective assistance of counsel,see powell alabama.is explicitly guaranteed by the sixth amendment,which provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi see also gideon wainwright,d holding that the sixth amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel is made obligatory upon the states by the fourteenth amendment.by contrast,the right of access to the courts is grounded not in the sixth amendment but in various other constitutional provisions,including the right of all citizens to sue and defend in the courts.chambers baltimore ohio.relying on the privileges and immunities clause of article iv christopher harbury,d observing that,in various civil and criminal cases,the supreme court has grounded the right of access to the courts in the privileges and immunities clause of article iv,the petition clause of the first amendment,the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.and the right of access of prisoners,as described by the supreme court,is rooted in the constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws and due process of law.see murray giarratano,d the prisoner right of access has been described as a consequence of the right to due process of law,and as an aspect of equal protection.internal citations omitted 
in light of their different sources,it is not surprising that the two rights have different jurisprudential histories.the two rights usually have been discussed separately.compare,bounds,d access to the courts,and lewis,d same,with gideon,d effective assistance of counsel,and strickland washington,d same see also murray,at.relying on pennsylvania finley,d,to hold that the constitution does not require appointment of counsel in proceedings,and declining to permit the extension of the holding in bounds to partially overrule finley.
in addition,the two rights,although both concerned generally with assuring that criminal defendants receive a fair trial,protect that fundamental right in different ways and apply to different categories of persons.the right to effective assistance of counsel,as the supreme court explained more than seventy years ago,is the right of a defendant to be heard on the criminal charges against t he right to be heard would be,in many cases,of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.powell,at.r eason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice,any person haled into court,who is too poor to hire a lawyer,can not be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.gideon,at.for these reasons,a n accused is entitled to be assisted by an attorney,whether retained or appointed,who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair,strickland,at,and indigent persons accused of a crime must be provided appointed counsel,gideon,at.but the sixth amendment only applies to a defendant trial and first appeal as of right,not to appeals afforded on a discretionary basis,collateral proceedings,or civil proceedings such as civil rights claims challenging prison conditions.see pennsylvania finley,d.
the prisoner right of access to the courts,while also concerned with assuring that trials are fair,offers a different means of achieving that fundamental objective,and it attaches to a different category of prisoners,as well as to different types of proceedings.the right of access to the courts requires that prisoners defending against criminal charges or convictions either directly or collaterally or challenging the conditions of their,not only defendants on trial and at their first appeal as of right,as with the sixth amendment right to be impeded from presenting those defenses and claims for formal adjudication by a court.see bounds,at.accord lewis,at.so,for example,in order to prevent effectively foreclosed access,indigent prisoners must be allowed to file appeals and habeas corpus petitions without payment of docket fees,and s tates must provide trial records to inmates unable to buy them.bounds,at.to provide the access constitutionally mandated,a state may be required to offer affirmative assistance to prisoners,but that assistance is not prescribed in narrow or specific terms or limited in form.for example,the assistance of an attorney,as we have concluded above,is a permissible and sufficient means of satisfying the right of access to the courts,but it is not a necessary or exclusive means of doing contrast to the sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel,where the assistance of an attorney is necessary although not sufficient for satisfaction of the right.
we recognize that both rights impose a certain minimum standard of assistance.the sixth amendment right to counsel guarantees effective assistance,see,strickland,at,and the right of access to the courts guarantees that access provided by persons trained in the law be adequate assistance,see,bounds,at.but these standards,when read in context and in light of the differences noted above,are not synonymous.the phrase effective assistance of counsel,see,strickland,at,means,quite plainly,that the defendant is entitled to assistance by a competent attorney who,through his or her representation of the defendant,plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair,id.at.by contrast,the phrase adequate assistance from persons trained in the law,bounds,at,must be read in the context of the right to which it pertains the right of access to the courts.
for guidance in interpreting adequate assistance from persons trained in the law,we turn to bounds,where the supreme court,in describing one means by which a state can give prisoners access to the courts,first employed that phrase.see id.in bounds,the supreme court considered whether the district court had erred in approving a library plan for the state prisons of north carolina as a means of satisfying the inmates constitutional right of access to the courts.id.at.the state argued that it should not be required to expend funds to implement the plan or otherwise affirmatively provide access so long as the state was not restricting inmates communication with jailhouse lawyers who could assist with an inmate filings id.at.
bounds rejected the state position and agreed with the district court approval of the library plan.more importantly for our purposes,bounds acknowledged that,while library service is one valid means of assuring access to the courts,constitutionally acceptable access can be provided alternatively by adequate assistance from persons trained in the law,id.at.the court also described as some degree of professional or legal assistance,id.at.see also id.at.again using professional or legal assistance as implicitly synonymous with adequate assistance from persons trained in the law id.at.using trained legal advisors to describe adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.and to demonstrate the many imaginative forms of constitutionally acceptable legal assistance from persons trained in the law,the court set forth several examples 
among the alternatives are the training of inmates as paralegal assistants to work under lawyers supervision,the use of paraprofessionals and law students,either as volunteers or in formal clinical programs,the organization of volunteer attorneys through bar associations or other groups,the hiring of lawyers on a consultant basis,and the use of staff attorneys,working either in new prison legal assistance organizations or as part of public defender or legal services offices.
id.at.each of these various forms of assistance other than formal provision of legal services by an be provided or supervised by persons qualified and trained in legal matters,in contrast to assistance from legal amateurs and laypersons,such as jailhouse lawyers,who have no formal legal training or qualifications.and yet,despite the focus on trained and qualified assistance relevant also to the sixth amendment guarantee of the assistance of counsel,notably absent from the court discussion is any mention of the effectiveness of the assistance.
finally,the supreme court has emphasized that bounds guarantee d no particular methodology but rather the conferral of a capability of bringing contemplated challenges to sentences or conditions of confinement before courts.lewis,at.emphasis added.in lewis,the court further stated when any inmate shows that an actionable claim of this nature which he desired to bring has been lost or rejected,because this capability of filing suit has not been provided,he demonstrates that the state has failed to furnish adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.id.quoting bounds,at.
based on all of these factors,we conclude that the term adequate modifying assistance from persons trained in the law does not incorporate the effectiveness inquiry pertinent to the sixth amendment but instead refers to the capability of qualified and trained than legal amateurs and provide,in dispensing legal assistance,access to the courts.see storseth spellman,cir appointed counsel,whether state or court provided,offers a meaningful,and certainly the best,avenue of access to an indigent inmate.because attorneys,by definition,are trained and qualified in legal matters,when a prisoner with appointed counsel claims that he was hindered by prison officials in his efforts to defend himself or pursue other relevant legal claims,he must show that,on the facts of his case,the provision of counsel did not furnish him with the capability of bringing his challenges before the courts,not that he was denied effective representation in the court.see schrier halford,cir t he term adequate as used in bounds to modify assistance from persons trained in the law,refers not to the effectiveness of the representation,but to the adequacy of the prisoner access to his or her counsel or other assistant.love
