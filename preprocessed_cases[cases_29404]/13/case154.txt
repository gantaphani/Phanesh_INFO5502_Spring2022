b petitioner lacks the minimal contacts with nevada that are a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him.no part of petitioner course of conduct occurred in nevada,and he formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts with that forum.the ninth circuit reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical focus from petitioner contacts with the forum to his contacts with respondents,obscuring the reality that none of petitioner challenged conduct had anything to do with nevada itself.respondents emphasize that they suffered the injury caused by the delayed return of their funds while residing in nevada,but calder made clear that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.the proper question is whether the defendant conduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way here,respondents claimed injury does not evince such a connection.the injury occurred in nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to be when they desired to use the seized funds.other possible contacts noted by the ninth circuit that respondents nevada attorney contacted petitioner in georgia,that cash seized in georgia originated in nevada,and that funds were returned to respondents in nevada are ultimately unavailing.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
this case asks us to decide whether a court in nevada may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant on the basis that he knew his allegedly tortious conduct in georgia would delay the return of funds to plaintiffs with connections to nevada.because the defendant had no other contacts with nevada,and because a plaintiff with the forum state can not be decisive in determining whether the defendant due process rights are violated,rush savchuk,we hold that the court in nevada may not exercise personal jurisdiction under these circumstances.
petitioner anthony walden serves as a police officer for the city of covington,georgia.in august,petitioner was working at the atlanta airport as a deputized agent of the drug enforcement administration dea.as part of a task force,petitioner conducted investigative stops and other law enforcement functions in support of the dea airport drug interdiction program.
on august,transportation security administration agents searched respondents gina fiore and keith gipson and their bags at the san juan airport in puerto rico.they found almost in cash.fiore explained to dea agents in san juan that she and gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the el san juan,and that they had residences in both california and nevada though they provided only california identification.after respondents were cleared for departure,a law enforcement official at the san juan airport notified petitioner task force in atlanta that respondents had boarded a plane for atlanta,where they planned to catch a connecting flight to las vegas,nevada.
when respondents arrived in atlanta,petitioner and another dea agent approached them at the departure gate for their flight to las vegas.in response to petitioner questioning,fiore explained that she and gipson were professional gamblers.respondents maintained that the cash they were carrying was their gambling bank and winnings.app.after using a dog to perform a sniff test,petitioner seized the cash petitioner advised respondents that their funds would be returned if they later proved a legitimate source for the cash.respondents then boarded their plane.
after respondents departed,petitioner moved the cash to a secure location and the matter was forwarded to dea headquarters.the next day,petitioner received a phone call from respondents attorney in nevada seeking return of the funds.on two occasions over the next month,petitioner also received documentation from the attorney regarding the legitimacy of the funds.
at some point after petitioner seized the cash,he helped draft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of the funds and forwarded that affidavit to a united states attorney office in georgia according to respondents,the affidavit was false and misleading because petitioner misrepresented the encounter at the airport and omitted exculpatory information regarding the lack of drug evidence and the legitimate source of the funds.in the end,no forfeiture complaint was filed,and the dea returned the funds to respondents in march.
respondents filed suit against petitioner in the united states district court for the district of nevada,seeking money damages under bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents.respondents alleged that petitioner violated their fourth amendment rights by seizing the cash without probable cause keeping the money after concluding it did not come from activity drafting and forwarding a probable cause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while knowing the affidavit contained false statements willfully seeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory and withholding that exculpatory information from the united states attorney office.
the district court granted petitioner motion to dismiss.relying on this court decision in calder jones,the court determined that petitioner search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in georgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in nevada.the court concluded that even if petitioner caused harm to respondents in nevada while knowing they lived in nevada,that fact alone did not confer jurisdiction.because the court dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction,it did not determine whether venue was proper.
on appeal,a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed.the court of appeals assumed the district court had correctly determined that petitioner search and seizure in georgia could not support exercise of jurisdiction in nevada.the court held,however,that the district court could properly exercise jurisdiction over the false probable cause affidavit aspect of the case.according to the court of appeals,petitioner expressly aimed his submission of the allegedly false affidavit at nevada by submitting the affidavit with knowledge that it would affect persons with a significant connection to nevada,at.after determining that the delay in returning the funds to respondents caused them foreseeable harm in nevada and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over petitioner was otherwise reasonable,the court found the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction to be proper,at.the ninth circuit denied rehearing en banc,with eight judges,in two separate opinions,dissenting,at.
we granted certiorari to decide whether due process permits a nevada court to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner.we hold that it does not and therefore reverse 
federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons.daimler ag bauman,slip,at.this is because a federal district court authority to assert personal jurisdiction in most cases is linked to service of process on a defendant who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.fed.rule of civ.proc.k a.here,nevada has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction over persons on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of the united states.stat.thus,in order to determine whether the federal district court in this case was authorized to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner,we ask whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with the limits imposed by federal due process on the state of nevada.daimler,supra,at slip,at.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment constrains a state authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its courts.volkswagen woodson.although a nonresident physical presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is not required,the nonresident generally must have certain minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington,quoting milliken meyer.
this case addresses the minimum contacts necessary to create specific jurisdiction the inquiry whether a forum state may assert specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant focuses on the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.keeton hustler magazine,quoting shaffer heitner.for a state to exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process,the defendant conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum state.two related aspects of this necessary relationship are relevant in this case.
first,the relationship must arise out of contacts that the defendant himself creates with the forum state.burger king rudzewicz.due process limits on the state adjudicative authority principally protect the liberty of the nonresident defendant not the convenience of plaintiffs or third parties.see volkswagen,supra,at.we have consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the minimum contacts inquiry by demonstrating contacts between the plaintiff or third parties and the forum state.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,the unilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate consideration when determining whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with a forum state to justify an assertion of jurisdiction we have thus rejected a plaintiff argument that a florida court could exercise jurisdiction over a trustee in delaware based solely on the contacts of the trust settlor,who was domiciled in florida and had executed powers of appointment there.hanson denckla.we have likewise held that oklahoma courts could not exercise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor that supplies new york,new jersey,and connecticut dealers based only on an automobile purchaser act of driving it on oklahoma highways,supra,at.put simply,however the plaintiff contacts with the forum may be,those contacts can not be decisive in determining whether the defendant due process rights are violated.rush,at.
second,our minimum contacts analysis looks to the defendant contacts with the forum state itself,not the defendant contacts with persons who reside there.see,international shoe,supra,at due process does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual with which the state has no contacts,ties,or relations hanson,supra,at however minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal,a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the minimal contacts with that state that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him accordingly,we have upheld the assertion of jurisdiction over defendants who have purposefully reach ed out beyond their state and into another by,for example,entering a contractual relationship that envisioned continuing and contacts in the forum state,burger king,supra,at,or by circulating magazines to deliberately exploi t a market in the forum state,keeton,supra,at.and although physical presence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,burger king,supra,at,physical entry into the state either by the defendant in person or through an agent,goods,mail,or some other means is certainly a relevant contact.see,keeton,supra,at.
but the plaintiff can not be the only link between the defendant and the forum.rather,it is the defendant conduct that must form the necessary connection with the forum state that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.see burger king,supra,at if the question is whether an individual contract with an party alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party home forum,we believe the answer clearly is that it can not kulko superior court of,city and county of san francisco,declining to find personal jurisdiction in a state merely because the plaintiff in a child support action was residing there to be sure,a defendant contacts with the forum state may be intertwined with his transactions or interactions with the plaintiff or other parties.but a defendant relationship with a plaintiff or third party,standing alone,is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.see rush,supra,at naturally,the parties relationships with each other may be significant in evaluating their ties to the forum.the requirements of international shoe,however,must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction due process requires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum state based on his own affiliation with the state,not based on the random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts he makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with the state.burger king,at internal quotation marks omitted.
these same principles apply when intentional torts are involved.in that context,it is likewise insufficient to rely on a defendant random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts or on the unilateral activity of a plaintiff.ibid.same.a forum state exercise of jurisdiction over an intentional tortfeasor must be based on intentional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary contacts with the forum.
calder jones,illustrates the application of these principles.in calder,a california actress brought a libel suit in california state court against a reporter and an editor,both of whom worked for the national enquirer at its headquarters in florida.the plaintiff libel claims were based on an article written and edited by the defendants in florida for publication in the national enquirer,a national weekly newspaper with a california circulation of roughly.
we held that california assertion of jurisdiction over the defendants was consistent with due process.although we recognized that the defendants activities focus ed on the plaintiff,our jurisdictional inquiry focuse d on the relationship among the defe
