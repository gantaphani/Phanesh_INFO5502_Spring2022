for the reasons that follow,we respectfully certify a controlling question of state law to the new york court of appeals.
background 
plaintiff appellee ekaterina schoenefeld schoenefeld is a solo practitioner licensed to practice law in the states of new york,new jersey,and california.she is also admitted to practice in a number of federal courts including the northern district of new york.schoenefeld graduated from rutgers university school of law in.she maintains her residence and law office in princeton,new jersey.
section,entitled attorneys having offices in this state may reside in adjoining state,provides that a person,regularly admitted to practice as an attorney and counsellor,in the courts of record of this state,whose office for the transaction of law business is within the state,may practice as such attorney or counsellor,although he resides in an adjoining state.judiciary law mckinney.schoenefeld asserts that she has never advertised herself as practicing law in the state courts of new york and has never represented any clients in new york state courts.at.in fact,she states that she has refused occasional requests to represent clients in new york state courts because accepting these matters would have violated of the judiciary law.id.
schoenefeld initially brought this action in the southern district of new york,challenging the constitutionality of section,both facially and as applied,under the privileges and immunities clause of article iv,section of the constitution p i clause or the clause,the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution equal protection clause,and the commerce clause of article,section of the constitution commerce clause.on defendants motion,the action was subsequently transferred to the northern district of new york.the district court then dismissed schoenefeld equal protection clause and commerce clause claims as well as her claims against the state of new york,the new york supreme court,appellate division,third judicial department third department,and the committee on professional standards of the third department committee on professional standards it permitted schoenefeld,however,to proceed against the remaining defendants all individuals serving in their official capacity on her claim that section violates the privileges and immunities clause.following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.
the district court determined that section infringes on one of the fundamental rights protected by the privileges and immunities clause the right to practice law.the court further concluded that the state failed to demonstrate a substantial state interest justifying section as well as a substantial relationship between section and the interests that defendants claim it advances.schoenefeld,d at.the district court therefore held the statute unconstitutional and granted schoenefeld motion for summary judgment.because the question of the constitutionality of new york judiciary law turns on the interpretation of a provision of the statute that implicates significant new york state interests and is determinative of this appeal,we reserve decision and certify a controlling question of state law to the new york court of appeals.
discussion 
the privileges and immunities clause provides that c itizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.const.art.iv.the clause purpose is to fuse into one nation a collection of independent,sovereign states.toomer witsell.i t is o nly with respect to those privileges and immunities bearing on the vitality of the nation as a single entity that a state must accord residents and nonresidents equal treatment.supreme court of piper,quoting baldwin montana fish game comm n.while t he privileges and immunities clause does not promise nonresidents that it will be as easy for nonresidents as for residents to comply with a state law it protects nonresidents from legal classifications that treat them more harshly without justification.kleinsmith shurtleff,cir.to prevail on a p i clause claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the state has,in fact,discriminated against with regard to the privileges and immunities it accords its own citizens.bach pataki,cir,overruled on other grounds by mcdonald chicago.quoting ex rel blumenthal crotty,cir.where a protected privilege or immunity is implicated,the state may defeat the challenge by demonstrating a a substantial reason for the discrimination,and b a reasonable relationship between the degree of discrimination exacted and the danger sought to be averted by enactment of the discriminatory statute.id.citations omitted.
the right to practice law has long been held to be one of the privileges and immunities within the clause.piper,at t he practice of law falls within the ambit of the privileges and immunities clause.appellants do not argue to the contrary on appeal but instead contend that the office requirement imposed by section can be read in a manner that does not implicate the p i clause,that is,an office for the transaction of law business requires only an address for accepting personal service,which might be satisfied by designating an agent for the service of legal papers.see appellants br.at.alternatively,appellants contend,if this court does determine that the statute discriminates against nonresident attorneys,the office requirement still does not violate the clause as it imposes an incidental burden on the ability of nonresident attorneys to practice in new york courts substantially related to sufficient state interests service of legal papers and enabling the new york courts to adjudicate service related disputes.appellants br.at.
preliminarily,we note that with respect to new york residents the judiciary law does not impose a specific obligation on an attorney to maintain an office for the transaction of law business in new york.see lichtenstein emerson,affirmed,dep t upholding constitutionality of section but noting that a resident attorney may utilize her home as an office.the new york civil practice law and rules of professional conduct require,of course,that an attorney be adequately equipped to maintain a certain level of accessibility and communication with clients,but a review of those laws yields no authority specifically requiring new york residents to maintain any office at all a new york attorney,therefore,may set up her office on the kitchen table in her studio apartment and not run afoul of new york law.
as to nonresident attorneys,however,section mandates that they shoulder the additional obligation to maintain some sort of separate office premises within the state.in particular,the new york supreme court and its appellate division courts the new york court of appeals having yet to address this issue have never interpreted section office requirement to be satisfied by something less that the maintenance of physical office space in new york state.see,kinder morgan energy partners,lp ace am.ins,dep t affirming lower court order dismissing without prejudice action commenced by nonresident attorney who did not maintain a local office elm mgmt.sprung,dep t noting that failure to maintain a bona fide office is noncompliance by the plaintiff counsel keenan mitsubishi estate,dep t reversing a dismissal under section wh
