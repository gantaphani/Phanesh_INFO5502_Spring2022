alleging that the roman catholic diocese of norwich,through its bishop,misapplied canon law in denying him a requested promotion and,ultimately,in terminating him,father justinian rweyemamu,an catholic priest,claims racial discrimination in a title vii suit against the bishop and the diocese.after the district court dismissed the suit pursuant to the ministerial exception,father justinian appealed.the question we must decide is whether,under the first amendment,title vii is unconstitutional as applied in this case.in reaching this constitutional question,we distinguish this case from our decision in hankins lyght,cir,which held that a federal statute,the religious freedom restoration act rfra of,governed the merits of an age discrimination action against a church.
background 
as this case comes to us after the denial of a motion to dismiss,we accept the facts as they are alleged in the complaint.almonte city of long beach,cir.father justinian is an ordained priest of the roman catholic church and the founder of bugurka orphans and community economic development,boced,a nonprofit organization.prior to his dismissal,father justinian served for five years as parochial vicar at bernard church in rockville,connecticut.
in april,father justinian applied to be parish administrator of bernard,but he was not selected the diocese selected a white man instead.thereafter,father justinian sought other promotions but was equally unsuccessful.
concerned that the diocese,through its bishop,michael cote,had discriminated against him on the basis of his race,father justinian complained to church officials,arguing that bishop cote had failed to follow canon law in staffing the vacancies.he also filed claims with the equal employment opportunities commission eeoc and the connecticut commission on human rights and opportunities chro,the state analogue to the eeoc.
in december,the chro dismissed father justinian complaint for lack of jurisdiction based on a constitutionally grounded ministerial exception,a decision ultimately affirmed by the connecticut court of appeals.see rweyemamu comm on human rights opportunities,appeal denied,cert.denied,d.one month after the chro dismissed father justinian complaint,bishop cote terminated father justinian employment.father justinian again appealed to higher church authorities,but again without success.the congregatio pro clericis in rome found that there was just cause for father justinian removal for several reasons,including complaints regarding his homilies,complaints regarding his interaction with parish staff,and the necessity of giving a unified and positive witness to the people of the parish.prot,see also id.stating that t estimony in this case indicates that father justinian rweyemamu was not sufficiently devoted to ministry because his work with boced interfere d with his parochial duties.
after the adverse ruling in rome,father justinian filed suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,claiming that the diocese and bishop cote had violated title vii,to,and alleging a variety of causes of action,including intentional infliction of emotional distress,tortious interference with business relations,and defamation,the latter causes of action arising from bishop cote public statements concerning father justinian involvement with boced.upon defendants motion,the district court warren eginton,judge dismissed father justinian complaint for lack of jurisdiction.the district court concluded that t he free exercise clause of the first amendment,through the ministerial exception,preserves a religious institution right to be free from governmental entanglement with the management of its internal affairs.rweyemamu cote,wl,at.father justinian now appeals that decision.
we review a district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss de novo.marsh rosenbloom,cir.on appeal,father justinian argues principally that a recent decision of this court,hankins lyght,cir,eliminated the ministerial exception in employment cases governed by federal law,such as title vii.hankins,father justinian maintains,requires us to vacate the district court judgment.we disagree.
hankins lyght and the application of rfra 
we reach the question of the ministerial exception and decide this case on constitutional grounds notwithstanding our decision in hankins,in which a panel of this court decided a similar case on statutory grounds,by holding that rfra applied as a defense to the plaintiff discrimination claim.lyng nw.indian cemetery protective ass n,d a fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.the statutory argument is not available in this case because defendants knowingly and expressly waived a rfra defense.
in hankins,a clergy member who was forced to retire at the age of seventy brought suit against his church and bishop under the age discrimination in employment act adea of.the district court dismissed the claim under federal rule of civil procedure b based on a ministerial exception to the rule adopted by several circuits that civil rights laws can not govern church employment relationships with ministers without violating the free exercise clause because they substantially burden religious freedom.hankins,at.on appeal,however,the hankins court resolution of the dispute rested not on ministerial exception grounds but on its determination that rfra govern ed the merits of the principal issue raised by the parties.id.at.the court vacated the dismissal of the complaint and remanded for the district court to decide whether applying the adea to the church action would violate rfra.see id.
rfra was enacted as a response to the supreme court watershed decision in employment division smith,d.in passing rfra,congress sought to effect a substantive change in constitutional protections.city of boerne flores,d.congress intended to restore the legal standard that was applied before smith,see,at see also,at,reprinted in,specifically the compelling interest test as set forth in sherbert verner,d,and wisconsin yoder,d,b.
in smith,the court noted that its decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in doing so,the court distinguished sherbert and yoder,confining the former to its facts,see id.at,while holding that the latter involved more than just the right to free exercise of religion,see id.at.discussing the free exercise clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,such as the right of parents to direct the education of their children.
in response to smith,rfra provides,in pertinent part that 
government may substantially burden a person exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person 
is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 
is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
b see also id.a providing that rfra applies even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,except as provided in subsection b of this section.a person whose religious practices are burdened in violation of rfra may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief.id.c see gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,d.
rfra is unusual in that it amends the entire united states code.see a this chapter applies to all federal law,and the implementation of that law,whether statutory or otherwise see also eugene gressman,rfra a comedy of necessary and proper errors,cardozo,calling rfra an amendment to every federal law and regulation in the land.at bottom,the import of rfra is that,whatever other statutes may or may not say,the federal government may not,as a statutory matter,substantially burden a person exercise of religion.o centro espirita,at.emphasis added eeoc catholic of,noting that congress has at least the facial authority to determine against whom,and under what circumstances,title vii and other federal laws will be enforced.this aspect of rfra was acknowledged by the hankins court when it expressly held that rfra amended the adea it is obvious to us that because congress had the power under the commerce clause to enact the adea,it also had the power to amend that statute by passing the rfra.at.
in so holding,the hankins court began its analysis by addressing whether the church and bishop had waived any reliance upon rfra as a defense to the plaintiff action.in that case,the defendants mentioned rfra only in passing in their original appellate brief,arguing that the adea was an unlawful burden on their religious activities and that congress has enacted the rfra,a statute that applied to all federal laws,for this very reason.id.at.the court asked for further briefing on this seemingly dispositive but otherwise unmentioned statute.id.defendants supplemental brief,however,explicitly disclaimed any intention of raising a rfra defense and asserted rfra inapplicability because the case at bar is a matter relating to a private employment situation and does not involve actions by the government.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the hankins panel nevertheless held that the defendants had not waived a rfra defense because they argued in the district court and continue to application of the adea to the relationship between their church and appellant substantially burdens their religion.id.in short,they had argued the substance of a rfra defense.see id.but see id.at sotomayor,dissenting noting that invocation of first amendment rights does not necessarily implicate rfra.refuting the defendants argument that rfra did not apply to their case in any event because it concerned a dispute between purely private parties and did not involve the government,the hankins court held that rfra applied because the federal statute at issue the adea was enforceable by a government agency the eeoc the government therefore could have been a party to the suit,and the court reasoned that the application of rfra should not vary depending on whether the party actually bringing suit is a private party or the eeoc 
the adea is enforceable by the eeoc as well as private plaintiffs,and the substance of the adea prohibitions can not change depending on whether it is enforced by the eeoc or an aggrieved private party.an action brought by an agency such as the eeoc is clearly one in which the rfra may be asserted as a defense,and no policy of either the rfra or the adea should tempt a court to render a different decision on the merits in a case such as the present one.
id.at citation omitted.
notwithstanding our own doubts about hankins determination that rfra applies to actions between private parties when the offending federal statute is enforceable by a government agency there is no need for us to wrestle with rfra applicability because the defendants in this case,unlike in hankins,have waived a rfra defense.
under hankins,
a party may certainly waive or forfeit a rfra defense by failing to argue that a law or action substantially burdens the party religion where a party fails to assert a substantial burden on religious exercise before a district court,therefore,the party may not raise that issue for the first time on appeal.
id.at.here,the defendants never once mentioned rfra in their motion to dismiss before the district court,nor did they ever argue that title vii substantially burdens their religion.their arguments to the district court were premised entirely on the ministerial exception and the free exercise clause requirement that churches be free from government interference in matters of church governance and administration.on appeal,defendants argument is again rooted in the first amendment and the ministerial exception the first amendment protects employment decisions made by religious institutions regarding ministerial employees from governmental oversight,including judicial review.appellees br.at see also id.at.
moreover,defendants brief states that hankins should not apply because the diocese has not raised a rfra defense,and t he provisions of rfra may be waived.id.at.it goes on to affirmatively assert the defendants explicitly waive a rfra defense in this matter.id.at emphasis added.while the last section of their brief contains an argument that title vii imposes a substantial burden on their exercise of religion,see id.at,defendants were forced to make this argument because hankins had come down after their district court proceedings.recognizing hankins holding that a rfra defense might be considered notwithstanding an express waiver by the church,defendants plainly presented their rfrabased argument to cover the possibility that this panel would decide to follow the hankins panel analysis however,and in light of the hankins decision,should this court find that the defendants implicitly raise a rfra defense,the defendants include here the analysis of said defense.id.at see also id.at presenting a rfra analysis only s hould the hankins decision control this case.
because the defendants explicitly waived any defense based on a violation of rfra after they became aware of hankins,we find that they executed an effective waiver of a known right.see curtis publ g butts,d a n effective waiver must be one of a known right or privilege.citation omitted id.at.we would not hold that curtis waived a known right before it was aware of the new york times decision.we therefore analyze the case on the primary grounds argued by the application of the ministerial need not further address hankins treatment of rfra,as that statute is not at issue here.
ii.the ministerial exception 
a.the roots of the ministerial exception 
since at least the turn of the century,courts have declined to interfere with ecclesiastical hierarchies,church administration,and appointment of clergy.minker balt.annual conference of the united methodist church,internal quotation marks omitted see also douglas laycock,towards a general theory of the religion clauses the case of church labor relations and the right to church autonomy,colum.why they have done so remains a matter of some debate.see caroline mala corbin,above the law the constitutionality of the ministerial exemption from antidiscrimination law,fordham.some courts have stressed the right to church autonomy secured by the free exercise clause.see,petruska gannon,cir the free exercise clause protects not only the individual right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires,but also a religious institution right to decide matters of faith,doctrine,and church governance.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,cert.denied,d combs cent.annual conference of the united methodist church,cir catholic,at.
others have emphasized that taking sides in a religious dispute would lead an article iii court into excessive entanglement in violation of the establishment clause.see,tomic,at a suit to remove a priest on the ground that he is a heretic,or to reinstate a parishioner who has been excommunicated,has never been justiciable in the federal courts.gellington christian methodist episcopal church,cir scharon luke episcopal presbyterian,cir commack.kosher meats,weiss,cir.
thus,the ministerial exception can not be ascribed solely to judicial.watson,at it is not to be supposed that the judges of the civil courts can be as competent in the ecclesiastical law and religious faith of all these bodies as the ablest men in each are in reference to their own.it is also required by the constitution.this must be so because the presumptively appropriate remedy in a title vii action is reinstatement,see brooks travelers ins,cir,but it would surely be unconstitutional under the first amendment to order the catholic church to reinstate,for example,a priest whose employment the church had terminated on account of his excommunication based on a violation of core catholic doctrine.
finally,some courts have explained that t he right to choose ministers without government restriction underlies the of religious communit ies.
