new york state penal law permits new york city and nassau county to set and collect a residential handgun licensing fee that exceeds the maximum fee allowable under state law in other parts of new york state.currently,the cost to obtain a residential handgun license in new york city is for a license which lasts for three years.admin.code a rcny requiring renewal of handgun licenses every three years.in this appeal,which follows a grant of summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york john koeltl,judge,we are asked to determine whether new york city administrative code a,which sets the current residential handgun licensing fee in new york city at,violates the second amendment and whether new york state penal law,which allows new york city and nassau county to set and collect a residential handgun licensing fee outside the range permitted in other jurisdictions in new york state,violates the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause 
we hold that both statutes survive constitutional scrutiny,and therefore affirm the march,opinion and order of the district court,which granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants and dismissed the complaint.
background 
plaintiffs are individuals who have been issued residential handgun in new york city,and two organizations,the second amendment foundation and the new york state rifle pistol association jointly,plaintiffs they bring this action pursuant to,asserting that new york city administrative code a admin.code a violates the second amendment by requiring new york city residents to pay to obtain a residential handgun license and new york penal law penal law violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by allowing new york city and nassau county to charge a higher handgun licensing fee than other jurisdictions in new york state.
factual background 
in new york state,it is illegal to possess a handgun without a valid license,even if the handgun remains in one residence.see penal law,a.in new york city,the new york city police department license division license division is responsible for processing and issuing residential handgun licenses,as well as verifying that each applicant is eligible to receive such a license.see id,rcny a.
penal law one of the statutes challenged by plaintiffs sets the range of permissible fees that may be charged by localities for firearm licenses in new york state.although that statute sets the general range of fees at between and,it allows the new york city council and the nassau county board of supervisors to set licensing fees outside of this range.see penal law.in relevant part,it provides 
in new york city,the city council and in the county of nassau the board of supervisors shall fix the fee to be charged for a license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver and provide for the disposition of such fees.elsewhere in the state,the licensing officer shall collect and pay into the county treasury the following fees for each license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver,not less than three dollars nor more than ten dollars as may be determined by the legislative body of the county 
id.pursuant to admin.code a the other statute challenged by plaintiffs new york city currently charges residents for a residential handgun license,which lasts for three years 
the new york city council has been authorized by state law to set its own licensing fee since,independent of the licensing fee range allowed in other parts of the state.in,the new york city council set the fee at for an initial handgun license the maximum fee allowed in other parts of new york state at that time was.between and,the licensing fee in new york city was increased six times.in,local law amended admin.code a to change the residential handgun license from a permit with a fee of to the current permit with a fee of in practical terms,the amendment to a increased the cost for residential license holders of owning a handgun by per year.
the amendment to a also permitted new york city substantially to recoup the cost of processing license applications.in that regard,the new york city office of management and budget omb prepared a user cost analysis to accompany the introduction of local law,and this report showed that in fiscal year the average administrative cost for each handgun license application processed by the license division was.see joint app x.the committee on finance of the new york city council submitted a separate report detailing the costs and revenue associated with new york city handgun licensing scheme.it stated that,although the costs associated with operating the licensing scheme exceeded million per year,the fees collected only amounted to million.see id.at.the report also estimated that the increased licensing fees from per license to per license would result in an additional million in revenue,id.at,and concluded that the pre licensing fee d id not reflect the actual costs of licensing,id.at.
in,the cost of new york city licensing scheme again was studied by the new york police department nypd in conjunction with the omb.this most recent study concluded each initial residential handgun application cost the license division to process and that each renewal application cost.id.at.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed this action on april,against,inter alia,michael bloomberg in his capacity as mayor of new york city and the city of new york jointly,the city.by a stipulation dated may,the new york attorney general nyag intervened to defend penal law constitutionality.
on june,plaintiffs moved for summary judgment prior to the completion of any discovery.the city and the nyag for summary judgment on july,on march,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the for summary judgment filed by the city and the nyag.judgment was entered on march.
with regard to admin.code a,the district court held that the fee did not impermissibly burden plaintiffs second amendment rights under the supreme court fee jurisprudence because it was designed to defray,and did not exceed,the administrative costs of regulating an individual right to bear arms.see kwong bloomberg,d.in particular,the district court noted that t he plaintiffs offer no evidence disputing or rebutting the city defendants evidence that the application fees imposed by admin.code a do not exceed the administrative costs attendant to the licensing scheme.id.at.the district court also held that fee was permissible if analyzed under the scrutiny applicable to laws that burden the exercise of second amendment rights.id.at.after determining that intermediate scrutiny was appropriate because admin.code a does not effect a ban on handguns but only imposes a fee,and therefore the burden on the second amendment right is not severe,id.at,the district court upheld the fee,finding that it is substantially related to the important governmental interests of promoting public safety and preventing gun violence because the fee is designed to recover the costs attendant to the licensing scheme,id.
with regard to penal law,the district court rejected plaintiffs equal protection challenge under rational basis review.it held that rational basis review was appropriate inasmuch as this state statute did not involve any suspect classification,and did not burden plaintiffs second amendment rights because it permitted,rather than required,new york city to set a licensing fee higher than most jurisdictions in new york state.id.at.the district court also noted that e ven if penal law could be viewed as disparately burdening the second amendment right by imposing a higher fee on new york city residents,the law would still pass constitutional muster.id.at.specifically,it stated that s everal courts have declined to apply strict scrutiny in similar circumstances because they have concluded that the second amendment analysis is sufficient to protect these rights,and these courts have either declined to conduct a separate equal protection analysis or have subjected the equal protection challenge to rational basis review.id.citing,inter alia,nordyke king,cir,aff in relevant part,cir en banc.

discussion 
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party.viacom int l,youtube,cir.summary judgment is required if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see also lyons lancer ins,cir.
a is constitutional 
the first issue to which we turn is whether the handgun licensing fee imposed by admin.code a violates the second amendment,see note,ante,which is fully applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,mcdonald city of chicago.the supreme court has held that the second amendment confer s an individual right to keep and bear arms.district of columbia heller.it also has recognized,however,that the second amendment right to keep and bear arms i s not unlimited,just as the first amendment right of free speech i s not.id.citation omitted.
plaintiffs central argument against admin.code a is that it can not survive constitutional scrutiny because the licensing fee places too great a burden on their second amendment rights.we disagree.
i.the fee is permissible under the supreme court fee jurisprudence 
we first consider whether the licensing fee of admin.code a is a permissible licensing fee.the supreme court fee jurisprudence has historically addressed the constitutionality of fees charged by governmental entities on expressive activities protected by the first amendment such as fees charged to hold a rally or parade.two district court decisions that have considered the issue in the wake of heller and mcdonald have used the same analytical framework to consider similar claims involving the exercise of second amendment rights.see justice town of cicero,d,heller district of columbia,d,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds.in both of these cases,the courts have upheld the contested licensing or registration fees.we agree that the supreme court first amendment fee jurisprudence provides the appropriate foundation for addressing plaintiffs fee claims under the second amendment.see mcdonald.at scalia,concurring noting similarities between the scope of the first amendment and the second amendment heller,at same united states decastro,cir in deciding whether a law substantially burdens second amendment rights,it is therefore appropriate to consult principles from other areas of constitutional law,including the first amendment to which heller adverted repeatedly.
in the first amendment context,the supreme court has held that governmental entities may impose licensing fees relating to the exercise of constitutional rights when the fees are designed to meet the expense incident to the administration of the licensing statute and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed.cox new hampshire,quotation marks omitted.put another way,imposing fees on the exercise of constitutional rights is permissible when the fees are designed to defray and do not exceed the administrative costs of regulating the protected activity.citizens action grp.powers,cir licensing fees used to defray administrative expenses are permissible,but only to the extent necessary for that purpose.see int l women day march planning comm.city of san antonio,cir awareness found.abrams,cir thus,fees that serve not as revenue taxes,but rather as means to meet the expenses incident to the administration of a regulation and to the maintenance of public order in the matter regulated are constitutionally permissible.see also selevan thruway,cir upholding a toll bridge fee as constitutional ly permissib le in the right to travel context murdock pennsylvania,striking down a license tax that was not a nominal fee imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question 
the undisputed evidence presented to the district court demonstrates that the licensing fee is designed to defray and does not exceed the administrative costs associated with the licensing scheme.indeed,the only relevant evidence presented to the district court consisted of a report by the committee of finance of the new york city council,stating that the revenue generated by the licensing fees in before the fee increase covered just over half of the related expenses and d id not reflect the actual costs of licensing,joint app x and a report by the omb in,noting that the cost per licensing application was in and recommending that the licensing fee be increased to for a license to recover costs,id.at.a user cost analysis performed by the omb also showed that the licensing fee did not exceed the administrative costs of the scheme and only generated roughly of the costs incurred by the city of new york to process initial residential handgun licenses.id.at.
although plaintiffs are quick to argue that new york city residential handgun licensing fee is significantly higher than the fee charged in other jurisdictions,this is simply not the test for assessing the validity of a licensing fee.even assuming that an otherwise proper fee might be impermissible if it were so high as to be exclusionary or prohibitive,plaintiffs provide nothing beyond unsubstantiated assertions to suggest that the fee for a license reaches this level.moreover,the facts of this case demonstrate that the fee was not prohibitive or exclusionary as applied to these individual plaintiffs because they all were able to obtain the residential handgun licenses that they sought in light of these principles and the evidence presented in the record,we hold that the district court correctly concluded that admin.code a imposes a constitutionally permissible fee.
ii.the fee is not an unconstitutional burden 
we next consider whether admin.code a fee imposes an unconstitutional burden on the exercise of plaintiffs second amendment rights.in united states decastro,we held that the appropriate level of scrutiny under which a court reviews a statute or regulation in the second amendment context is determined by how substantially that statute or regulation burdens the exercise of one second amendment rights.at.we further explained that where the burden imposed by a regulation on firearms is a marginal,incremental or even appreciable restraint on the right to keep and bear arms,it will not be subject to heightened scrutiny.id.at emphasis supplied.rather,heightened scrutiny is triggered only by those restrictions that like the complete prohibition on handguns struck down in heller operate as a substantial burden on the ability of citizens to possess and use a firearm for or for other lawful purposes.id.emphasis supplied see also nordyke,at o nly regulations which substantially burden the right to keep and to bear arms trigger heightened scrutiny under the second amendment.
on the facts of this case,we find it difficult to say that the licensing fee,which amounts to just over per year,is anything more than a marginal,incremental or even appreciable restraint on one second amendment rightsespecially considering that plaintiffs have put forth no evidence to support their position that the fee is prohibitively expensive see decastro,at holding that heightened scrutiny is not appropriate where the regulation does not impose a substantial burden on the ability of plaintiffs to possess and use a firearm for see also kwong,d at noting that because admin.code a does not effect a ban on handguns but only imposes a fee,the burden on the second amendment right is not severe.indeed,the fact that the licensing regime makes the exercise of one second amendment rights more expensive does not necessarily mean that it substantially burdens that right.see nordyke,at similarly,a law does not substantially burden a constitutional right simply because it makes the right more expensive or more difficult to exercise.see also planned parenthood of se.casey,the fact that a law which serves a valid purpose,one not designed to strike at the right itself,has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to exercise the right can not be enough to invalidate it.heller,at n othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.
but we need not definitively decide that applying heightened scrutiny is unwarranted because we agree with the district court that admin.code a would,in any event,survive under the intermediate form of heightened scrutiny under this test,a regulation that burdens a plaintiff second amendment rights passes constitutional muster if it is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental interest.kachalsky cnty.of westchester,cir.
we recently observed that new york has substantial,indeed compelling,governmental interests in public safety and crime prevention.id.at.because the record demonstrates that the licensing fee is designed to allow the city of new york to recover the costs incurred through operating its licensing scheme,which is designed to promote public safety and prevent gun violence,we agree with the district court that admin.code a easily survives intermediate scrutiny.kwong,d at finding that admin.code a is substantially related to the important governmental interests of promoting public safety and preventing gun violence because the fee is designed to recover the costs attendant to the licensing scheme see bach pataki,cir,overruled on other grounds by mcdonald.at noting that the state has a substantial and legitimate interest in insuring the safety of the general public from individuals who,by their conduct,have shown themselves to be lacking the essential temperament or character which should be present in one entrusted with a dangerous instrument quotation marks omitted see also awareness,at in sum,we conclude that the fee serves the legitimate purpose of defraying the expenses incident to the administration and enforcement of b.ctr.for auto safety,athey,cir holding that fees on certain types of solicitation were narrowly tailored to further a legitimate governmental purpose where the fees were calibrated to approximate the costs of administering the statute,and the revenues raised by the fees d id not exceed these costs.
for these reasons,we affirm the march,opinion and order of the district court insofar as it concludes that admin.code a licensing fee is constitutional.
penal law is constitutional 
the second issue presented in this appeal is whether penal law,which allows the city of new york and nassau county to set the residential handgun licensing fee outside the range permitted in the rest of new york state,violates the equal protection clause.in short,plaintiffs argue that this statutory provision should be reviewed under strict scrutiny,and should be found to be unconstitutional to the extent it authorizes the city to impose a fee greater than,because it burdens the exercise of a fundamental right.appellants br.we disagree with plaintiffs views about the appropriate level of scrutiny as well as the constitutionality of the penal law.
penal law is subject to rational basis review 
although the equal protection clause is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike,city of cleburne cleburne living,it does not require that all persons be dealt with identically,but it does require that a distinction made have some relevance to the purposes for which the classification is made,baxstrom herold.
here,penal law simply allows the new york city council to fix the fee to be charged for a license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver in new york city,while the licensing fee to carry or possess such a firearm outside new york city must be not less than three dollars nor more than ten dollars as may be determined by the legislative body of the county.penal law but for the purposes of plaintiffs equal protection challenge,it is perhaps more important to summarize what penal law does not do.it does not require the new york city council to charge a higher or lower fee than other jurisdictions in the state.it does not restrict other jurisdictions from obtaining a legislative exemption from the fee range like new york city and nassau county and it does not allow a local government to charge any fee amount all license or permit fees in new york can not exceed a sum reasonably necessary to cover the costs of the issuance,inspection and enforcement.see atm one.vil.of freeport,dep t quotation marks omitted.in other words,beyond setting the fee range applicable to most of new york state which plaintiffs do not contest penal law itself does nothing to burden anyone second amendment rights.
in light of what penal law does and does not do,we agree with the district court that rational basis review is appropriate because penal law geographic classification is not suspect,see city of cleburne,at,and the statute itself does not burden a fundamental right,see romer evans,i f a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class,the legislative classification will be upheld so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.
ii.penal law survives rational basis review 
penal law survives rational basis review which requires only that there be a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose,for many of the reasons mentioned above regarding admin.code a.see heller doe.
plaintiffs do not dispute that the state has a legitimate interest in allowing new york city to recoup the costs incurred by its regulatory schemes more fully.see appellant br.see also thomas chi.park,approving a municipality use of permits that were designed,at least in part,to assure financial accountability for damage caused by an event int l women day march planning,at it is undisputed that san antonio has a significant interest in recouping the expenses it incurs from the processions held on its streets.awareness,at concluding that that an fee serve d the legitimate purpose of defraying the expenses incident to the administration and enforcement of a statutory scheme regarding professional solicitors.moreover,by providing flexibility to the city of new york to defray the costs of operating this licensing scheme,the state through penal law helps ensure that new york city licensing scheme is adequately funded,thereby allowing it to function properly.see cox,at the suggestion that a flat fee should have been charged fails to take account of the difficulty of framing a fair schedule to meet all circumstances,and we perceive no constitutional ground for denying to local governments that flexibility of adjustment of fees which in the light of varying conditions would tend to conserve rather than impair the liberty sought.avery midland,the constitution does not require that a uniform straitjacket bind citizens in devising mechanisms of local government suitable for local needs and efficient in solving local problems.indeed,as e very application under penal law triggers a local investigation by police into the applicant mental health history,criminal history,and moral character,kachalsky,at,helping ensure that the scheme functions properly promotes public safety,see bach,at noting that the state has a substantial and legitimate interest in insuring the safety of the general public from individuals who,by their conduct,have shown themselves to be lacking the essential temperament or character which should be present in one entrusted with a dangerous instrument quotation marks omitted.
for these reasons,we conclude that penal law,which permits new york city and nassau county to charge a fee outside of the range applicable in other jurisdictions in new york state,survives rational basis review and does not violate the equal protection clause.
conclusion 
to summarize,we hold that,on the facts presented in this appeal 
a,which sets the residential handgun licensing fee in new york city at for a license,is a constitutionally permissible licensing fee 
although we are skeptical that admin.code a should be subject to any form of heightened scrutiny,see united states decastro,cir,we need not definitively answer that question because we conclude that it survives intermediate scrutiny in any event 
penal law,which allows new york city and nassau county to set and collect a residential handgun licensing fee outside the range permitted in other jurisdictions in new york state,is subject only to rational basis review under the equal protection clause because it neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class.romer evans,and 
penal law survives rational basis review.
accordingly,the march,judgment of the district court is affirmed.
this case presents complicated questions in an area of law in which the supreme court has provided limited guidance.the full import of the second amendment right and the government burden to justify the infringement of this right in different contexts remain opaque.thus,it is not entirely surprising that,while i agree with the majority that the two laws at issue here are constitutional,i reach that conclusion by a different route.
i would hold that administrative code a,which imposes a,indeed significant,initial handgun licensing fee of,does not violate the second amendment.although the fee constitutes a substantial burden on the fundamental second amendment right to possess a handgun in the home for,see mcdonald city of chicago,and thereby necessitates intermediate scrutiny,the statute survives such heightened review the government interest at the public safety is an important one,and the fee is collected solely to recoup the costs of the licensing regime that is designed to further that interest.indeed,because of the heightened public safety concern in the second amendment context,i find it unlikely that handgun licensing fees tied to cost recovery would ever fail to meet this heightened standard.
second,i would hold that penal law does not violate the equal protection clause,despite the fact that it,in combination with local law,permits the city of new york and nassau county to impose significantly higher residential handgun licensing fees than other new york counties.the fee disparity burdens the exercise of a fundamental right differently for different new york state residents and therefore demands a heightened level of review.however,the governmental interest at issue here permitting local discretion in deciding whether and how to recoup costs related to protecting the public safety justifies this disparity.
administrative code a does not violate the second amendment 
the majority begins its analysis of the constitutionality of administrative code a under the second amendment with a discussion of the supreme court first amendment fee jurisprudence.it concludes and i agree that the licensing charge is not an unconstitutional tax,but rather a constitutionally permissible fee.
the majority then addresses the question of whether the fee is an unconstitutional burden on the second amendment.in other words,does a impose a substantial burden on the fundamental right to keep a handgun in the home 
as the majority notes,the second circuit does not read supreme court jurisprudence as mandat ing that any marginal,incremental or even appreciable restraint on the right to keep and bear arms be subject to heightened scrutiny.united states decastro,cir determining that a statute that barred the transportation of firearms across state lines required only rational basis review because individuals could apply for licenses to own guns in all states.instead,we have determined that heightened scrutiny is triggered only by those restrictions that operate as a substantial burden on the ability of citizens to possess and use a firearm for or for other lawful purposes.id.emphasis added.the majority relies on decastro appreciable restraint language to suggest we need not apply heightened scrutiny to a licensing fee that amounts to just over per year.ante at.however,because it ultimately finds that the statute would survive intermediate scrutiny,the majority observes that it need not address the questions of whether the fee is a substantial burden and what level of review is required.
while i agree with the majority that a survives intermediate scrutiny,i believe that such review is required.the supreme court has clarified that a citizen right to possess a handgun in the home for is fundamental.see mcdonald.at.any licensing fee necessarily constitutes a substantial burden on this right and,unlike the statute at issue in decastro,which barred transporting a firearm across state lines,there are no alternative options for obtaining a license to have a handgun.kachalsky cnty.of westchester,cir.
intermediate scrutiny is sufficient,however,because a licensing fee imposes only a burden not a ban on this fundamental right.id.at.accordingly,and for substantially the same reasons advanced by the majority,i believe that a easily survives intermediate scrutiny.indeed,i would go a step further.as we recently noted,t he regulation of firearms is a paramount issue of public safety,and recent events in newtown,connecticut are a sad reminder that firearms are dangerous in the wrong hands.osterweil bartlett,cir.because of the heightened safety concerns in the second amendment context,i would find that handgun licensing fees tied to and limited by cost recovery are generally constitutional under the second amendment.
penal law,separately or in combination with local law,does not violate the equal protection clause 
the majority reasons that,because penal law simply allows the new york city council to fix the fee to be charged for a license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver in new york city,ante at quotation marks and alteration omitted,it itself does nothing to burden anyone second amendment fundamental rights,ante at.furthermore,the majority notes,does not permit new york city and nassau county to charge any amount they wish no licensing fee can exceed a sum reasonably necessary to cover the costs of the issuance,inspection and enforcement.atm one llc.vill.of freeport,dep t quotation marks omitted.based on its determination that the contested law does not burden any fundamental rights and the fact that the statute geographic classification is not suspect,the majority concludes that only rational basis review is warranted under the equal protection clause.
this analysis both blinks reality and condones a loophole that permits disparate burdens on a fundamental right for different individuals.penal law does not operate in a vacuum it is applied through local legislation that has the result of a gun owner paying a handgun licensing fee in one new york state jurisdiction and a fee in another.this disparate burden of a fundamental right necessitates more exacting scrutiny than rational basis review 
courts apply heightened scrutiny when a legislative classification burdens a fundamental right.romer evans,i f a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class,we will uphold the legislative classification so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.however,strict scrutiny does not appear warranted when,as here,an equal protection claim is based on a burdening of a fundamental right that demands only intermediate scrutiny under that right jurisprudence.see ramos town of vernon,cir applying intermediate scrutiny based on the lack of a suspect class,despite the legislative burdening of a fundamental right,and noting that the equal protection framework allows for a more discerning inquiry to accommodate competing governmental and individual interests.accordingly,i believe that this is a situation where intermediate scrutiny is sufficient.
even if strict scrutiny were applicable,this would be one of those rare situations where strict scrutiny would not be fatal in fact.see adam winkler,vand,finding that approximately percent of all applications of strict scrutiny result in the challenged law being upheld united states miles,d,upholding a gun control law under strict scrutiny.
first,there is an important and compelling governmental interest in allowing local governments to be flexible in setting fees to recoup costs related to protecting the public safety if they so choose,even if this results in different localities charging different fees for a activity.see cox new hampshire,the suggestion that a flat fee should have been charged for a parade license fails to take account of the difficulty of frami
