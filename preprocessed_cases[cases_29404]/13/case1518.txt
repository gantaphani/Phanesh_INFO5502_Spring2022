vargas,a black officer of hispanic descent,then sued in district court alleging that his dismissal violated equal protection and due process.his theory was that his discipline was racially tainted since white officers convicted of similar offenses typically received less serious sanctions.the court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine,which provides that inferior federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over cases that effectively seek review of state court judgments.the court concluded that the relief vargas sought would,if granted,effectively overrule the results of the article proceeding.because we conclude that the doctrine does not prevent the exercise of federal jurisdiction over vargas equal protection claim,we vacate the district court dismissal of vargas complaint and remand for further proceedings.however,we affirm the court dismissal of his due process claim.
background 
on august,vargas and his partner responded to a complaint that an elderly woman had been threatened by a man with a gun.a suspect,glen givens,was located and arrested after a brief altercation.givens sustained a serious injury to his left eye and filed a complaint alleging the use of excessive force with the civilian complaint review board against vargas and his partner,as well as two other officers who responded to the call.in,almost three years later,vargas was charged by the department with using excessive force and a disciplinary hearing was held before the office of administrative trial hearings oath a.testimony was taken from all four officers who responded to the call,as well as givens and francisco flores,who was with givens at the time of the arrest.although vargas and his partner denied assaulting givens,both givens and flores testified that,among the four officers,vargas and his partner were principally involved in the altercation a,and the other two officers merely observed to insure that bystanders did not intervene.a the administrative law judge found that vargas and his partner punched and kicked givens in a manner that was clearly unnecessary and gratuitous,a and that they compounded their misconduct by denying in sworn testimony that they kicked or punched givens while he was on the ground.a police dep t vargas,index,slip op.at,oath july.citing a recent oath decision in which an excessive force determination resulted in the termination of the officer,the alj recommended that both vargas and his partner be dismissed from the nypd a,despite the recommendation of an nypd internal prosecutor that vargas should merely be suspended for thirty days and placed on probation for one year.upon receiving the alj report and recommendation,the police commissioner terminated vargas a 
vargas challenged his termination in an article proceeding in new york state supreme court,claiming that the alj determination that he used excessive force was not supported by substantial evidence.the petition was transferred to the appellate division,see g,which dismissed it.vargas i,at a.the appellate division held that the determination was supported by substantial evidence,that no basis existed to disturb the alj credibility findings,and that the penalty of dismissal did not shock the conscience in view of the evidence that the complainant had been repeatedly kicked and punched while restrained and lying on the ground,sustaining severe injury to his left eye that required surgery and may leave him permanently visually impaired.id.a 
ii.the district court decision 
vargas then sued in district court alleging that his termination violated his equal protection rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.specifically,he alleged that,apart from whether substantial evidence supported the alj factual determination,his punishment was racially discriminatory because it was the policy and practice of the nypd to selectively prosecut e hispanic and other minority police officers more often and more severely than their white.compl.ja 
the city moved to dismiss the complaint under rule c,arguing that collateral estoppel and the doctrine barred vargas claims.the district court granted the motion,holding that collateral estoppel applied because vargas was seeking to relitigate the propriety of his termination,which had been fully and fairly litigated in the article proceeding.vargas city of new york,civ.lap,dist.lexis,at,vargas ii.the court rejected vargas contention that,because he only learned of the alleged discriminatory policy after the article proceedings concluded,he did not have an opportunity to litigate his racial discrimination claim in state court.it concluded that vargas could have raised the issue and that,in any event,the state proceedings resolved the issue against him.the court,in dismissing his petition,reasoned that the state court necessarily concluded that his dismissal was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or an abuse of discretion.id.

vargas equal protection claims.
under the doctrine,inferior federal courts have no subject matter jurisdiction over suits that seek direct review of judgments of state courts,or that seek to resolve issues that are inextricably intertwined with earlier state court determinations while we have noted that the supreme court has provided little guidance in determining when claims are inextricably intertwined with a prior state court judgment,we have held that inextricably intertwined means,at a minimum,that where a federal plaintiff had an opportunity to litigate a claim in a state proceeding,subsequent litigation will be barred under the doctrine if it would be barred under principl
