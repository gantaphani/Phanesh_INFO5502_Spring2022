the appellants,ims health,verispan,llc,source healthcare analytics,and pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma collectively,the appellants challenge a vermont statute banning the sale,transmission,or use of data pi data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents.in,vermont enacted the statute at issue,namely.acts,codified at.stat.ann.tit,as amended by.acts changing effective date of from january,to july,act,section.the appellants appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,judge finding section to be a constitutional restriction on commercial speech pursuant to central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,and finding that section does not violate the commerce clause,art.i,cl,of the united states constitution ims health sorrell,d.
on appeal,the appellants argue that section restricts speech and can not withstand strict scrutiny,that even if section restricts only commercial speech,it can not withstand intermediate scrutiny under central hudson,and that section violates the dormant commerce clause by prohibiting commerce wholly outside of vermont.the appellees,vermont attorney general william sorrell,vermont governor jim douglas,and secretary of the agency of human services of the state of vermont robert hofmann,contend that section does not implicate the appellants first amendment rights,that even if section is a restriction on the appellants commercial speech,section survives intermediate scrutiny because it is a narrowly tailored statute that directly advances vermont substantial interest in protecting medical privacy,in controlling health care costs,and in promoting public health,and that the appellants lack standing to challenge section under the dormant commerce clause and that,in any event,section does not violate the dormant commerce clause because it regulates intrastate commerce.
we conclude that because section is a commercial speech restriction that does not directly advance the substantial state interests asserted by vermont,and is not narrowly tailored to serve those interests,the statute can not survive intermediate scrutiny under central hudson.therefore,we reverse and remand the judgment of the district court.
background 
the vermont legislature passed act in,intending to protect public health,to protect prescriber privacy,and to reduce health care costs.section prohibits the sale,license,or exchange for value of pi data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug,and prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers from using pi data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug,unless the prescriber consents.see.stat.ann.tit,a d.as amended,section was effective on july.see.acts.
when filling prescriptions,pharmacies in vermont collect information including the prescriber name and address,the name,dosage,and quantity of the drug,the date and place the prescription is filled,and the patient age and gender.pharmacies sell this pi data to the data mining appellants ims health,verispan,llc,and source healthcare analytics,these data mining companies,all located outside of vermont,aggregate the data to reveal individual physician prescribing patterns and sell it outside of vermont,primarily to pharmaceutical manufacturers.the pi data sold by the appellants is stripped of patient information,to protect patient privacy.appellant pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma is a association representing pharmaceutical researchers and manufacturers,the primary customers of the data mining appellants.
pharmaceutical manufacturers market their products through various means,including advertising and detailing.detailing refers to visits by pharmaceutical representatives,called detailers,to individual physicians to provide information on specific prescription drugs,including the use,side effects,and risks of drug interactions.pharmaceutical manufacturers use pi data to identify audiences for their marketing efforts,to focus marketing messages for individual prescribers,to direct scientific and safety messages to physicians most in need of that information,to track disease progression,to aid law enforcement,to implement risk mitigation programs,and to conduct clinical trials and surveillance required by the united states food and drug administration fda.
while section in part aims to decrease detailing,prescribers may want to receive the information detailers provide,and,in any event,prescribers are free to decline meetings with detailers.
as the district court noted,pharmaceutical industry spending on detailing has increased exponentially along with the rise of data mining.detailing is only for drugs.when a patent expires,competitors can introduce bioequivalent generic drugs.bioequivalent generic drugs are not necessarily identical to the brand name version,but are required to demonstrate an absorption rate between and percent of the drug.variations in absorption rates among branded or generic drugs may cause different reactions,such as side effects.the district court also noted that while a drug is not necessarily better than its generic version,the drug is typically more expensive.
pharmaceutical manufacturers are not the only entities that purchase pi data from the data mining appellants,although pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers are the only customers banned from using pi data in their marketing efforts by section.the state of vermont itself uses pi data for law enforcement and other state programs.researchers use pi data to identify overuse of a pharmaceutical in specific populations,to develop new drugs,and to facilitate identification of potential patients to participate in clinical trials.the fda,the center for disease control,and the federal drug enforcement agency use pi data to monitor usage of controlled substances and to identify prescribers who need safety information.insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers use the data to process claims and manage formulary compliance.moreover,insurance companies and state governments like vermont use pi data to encourage the use of cheaper,generic very medications section seeks to promote.while insurance companies and governments collect their own pi data,their databases are not as thorough as those maintained by the data mining appellants.to preserve the value of their data,data mining companies typically restrict of the data they provide their customers.the appellants argue that the sales covered by section are essential to the ability of the data mining appellants to provide pi data for these other,permitted,uses.
the vermont law was adopted in the wake of a similar statute that had been enacted in new hampshire,and shortly before another similar statute adopted in maine.
in the new hampshire state legislature passed a statute prohibiting the transmission or use of and pi data for most commercial purposes.see ims health ayotte,d,rev,f d cir.in relevant part,the statute reads 
records relative to prescription information containing and data shall not be licensed,transferred,used,or sold for any commercial purpose,except for the limited purposes of pharmacy reimbursement formulary compliance care management utilization review by a health care provider,the patient insurance provider or the agent of either health care research or as otherwise provided by law.commercial purpose includes,but is not limited to,advertising,marketing,promotion,or any activity that could be used to influence sales or market share of a pharmaceutical product,influence or evaluate the prescribing behavior of an individual health care professional,or evaluate the effectiveness of a professional pharmaceutical detailing sales force.
ann.f.the stated intent of the statute,passed without any formal legislative findings,was to protect patient and physician privacy and to reduce health care costs.see ayotte,d at.the united states district court for the district of new hampshire found the statute unconstitutional because it restricted commercial speech without directly promoting substantial state interests,and despite the existence of alternative approaches to achieve these interests,in violation of the test for restrictions on commercial speech set out in central hudson.see ayotte,d at.
maine also enacted a law in regulating the use of pi data.the legislative findings indicate that the statute was passed to improve public health,to reduce costs,and to protect patient and prescriber privacy.see.ann.tit,invalidated by ims health rowe,d,rev,ims health mills,cir.the maine statute prohibits the use of pi data for marketing purposes when the prescriber opts out of its use.in relevant part,it reads 
a carrier,pharmacy or prescription drug information intermediary may not license,use,sell,transfer or exchange for value,for any marketing purposes,prescription drug information that identifies a prescriber who has filed for confidentiality protection 
ann.tit.the united states district court for the district of maine found the statute unconstitutional because it did not survive intermediate scrutiny despite the provision.see rowe,d at.
while an appeal of the maine district court decision was pending,the court of appeals for the first circuit reversed the judgment of the new hampshire district court and upheld the constitutionality of the new hampshire statute.see ayotte,at.the majority found that the new hampshire statute regulated only the conduct of data miners,and therefore did not violate their first amendment rights.id.at.even if the statute did regulate commercial speech,the majority concluded that it would find that the statute survived intermediate scrutiny.id.at.concurring in the result,judge lipez concluded that the statute regulates commercial speech,but that it survived intermediate scrutiny review.id.at,lipez,concurring and dissenting.
the court of appeals for the first circuit recently followed its decision in ayotte.it reversed the district court preliminary injunction in rowe,and found the maine statute regulating the use of pi data to be constitutional.mills.
in,vermont passed act,section,legislation aimed at restricting the use of pi data in pharmaceutical marketing.the state legislature explained that 
it is the intent of the general assembly to advance the state interest in protecting the public health of vermonters,protecting the privacy of prescribers and prescribing information,and to ensure costs are contained in the private health care sector,as well as for state purchasers of prescription drugs,through the promotion of less costly drugs and ensuring prescribers receive unbiased information.
stat.ann.tit,a.the statute adopts an approach,allowing prescribers to opt in to allow the use of their pi data for marketing purposes.see id.at c.otherwise,the sale or transfer of pi data for marketing purposes,or the use of pi data for marketing purposes,is prohibited.the statute provides 
a health insurer,a employer,an electronic transmission intermediary,a pharmacy,or other similar entity shall not sell,license,or exchange for value regulated records containing information,nor permit the use of regulated records containing information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug,unless the prescriber consents as provided in subsection c of this section.pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical marketers shall not use information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents as provided in subsection c of this section.
id.at d.marketing is defined by the statute to include 
advertising,promotion,or any activity that is intended to be used or is used to influence sales or the market share of a prescription drug,influence or evaluate the prescribing behavior of an individual health care professional to promote a prescription drug,market prescription drugs to patients,or to evaluate the effectiveness of a professional pharmaceutical detailing sales force.
the statute expressly permits the sale,transfer,or use of pi data for multiple other purposes,including the limited purposes of pharmacy reimbursement prescription drug formulary compliance patient care management utilization review by a health care professional,the patient health insurer,or the agent of either health care research dispensing prescription medications the transmission of prescription data from prescriber to pharmacy care management educational communications provided to a patient,including treatment options,recall or safety notices,or clinical trials and for certain law enforcement purposes as otherwise authorized by law.see id.at e.
the vermont state legislature issued legislative findings in support of the statute.see.acts.the findings expressly state the legislature intent to interfere with the marketplace of ideas to promote the interests of the state.for example,the findings note that the legislature views the goals of pharmaceutical marketing as often in conflict with the goals of the state.id.at.the legislature expressed its concern that the marketplace for ideas on medicine safety and effectiveness is frequently,leading doctors to prescribe drugs based on incomplete and biased information.id.at.the legislature therefore found that p ublic health is ill served by the massive imbalance in information presented to doctors and other prescribers.id.at.section is the state attempt to correct what it sees as an unbalanced marketplace of ideas that undermines the state interests in promoting public health,protecting prescriber privacy,and reducing health care costs.
the data mining plaintiffs filed suit on august,against the vermont attorney general,seeking to enjoin enforcement of the statute prior to its taking effect.in november the action was consolidated with a suit by phrma against the appellees seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.an amended complaint was filed on may.after a bench trial,the district court denied the plaintiffs motions for declaratory and injunctive relief and for summary judgment,and denied as moot the defendants motions for summary judgment.see sorrell,d at.
the district court found that section restriction of commercial speech survived intermediate scrutiny under central hudson.see sorrell,d at.the district court likewise found that section did not violate the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution see id.at.
the appellants appealed from the judgment of the district court,arguing that section is either a restriction on speech requiring strict scrutiny,or a restriction on commercial speech that does not survive intermediate scrutiny.the appellants also argue that the statute restricts commercial activities outside of vermont,in violation of the dormant commerce clause.the appellees respond that the statute restricts conduct rather than speech,that even if the statute does restrict commercial speech it survives intermediate scrutiny,and that it does not violate the dormant commerce clause.because we find that section is an improper restriction on commercial speech under the test set forth in central hudson,we find the statute unconstitutional and reverse and remand.
discussion 
because this case turns on constitutional issues,our review is de novo.see boy scouts of am.dale,melzer bd.of educ.of the city sch.dist.of the city of new york,cir.
the appellants principal argument is that section violates their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.see const.amend.i congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.the first amendment has been applied against state action by the fourteenth amendment.see gitlow new york,incorporating first amendment freedom of speech against the states under const.amend xiv.because the appellees contend that section merely regulates conduct that is not subject to first amendment protections,it is necessary to determine whether the statute restricts protected speech before determining whether that restriction is permissible under the first amendment.
the district court found that section is a restriction on speech,and does not merely regulate the appellants conduct.see sorrell,d at.the appellees argue that the statute is simply a restriction on a commercial practice.they argue that the data miners are buying and selling a commodity,which can be regulated.they concede that the activities of the pharmaceutical companies who seek to use that information to market prescription drugs is a closer question under the first amendment,but they contend that the statute is nevertheless a restriction on the commercial conduct of the pharmaceutical companies.
we agree with the district court.the first amendment protects e ven dry information,devoid of advocacy,political relevance,or artistic expression.universal city studios,corley,cir.see also.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,drug price information in drug advertisements is speech universal city studios,at computer program is speech.furthermore,it is plain that speech in a form that is sold for profit is entitled to first amendment protection.see.state,at.
the court of appeals for the first circuit found that a similar new hampshire statute was not a restriction on speech,but primarily a restriction on conduct,although it considered the statute only as it affected the activities of data miners rather than pharmaceutical manufacturers.see ayotte.the court therefore considered the statute to be a species of economic regulation,subject only to rational basis review,which the plaintiffs conceded the law satisfied.see id.at.
in ayotte,the court treated the new hampshire statute among the narrow categories of regulations restricting speech that are not entitled to first amendment protection,in the tradition of chaplinsky new hampshire,which found lewd,obscene,profane,libelous,and fighting words to be categories of speech wholly outside the protections of the first amendment.the court of appeals interpreted the new hampshire statute as principally a regulation of conduct because it restrict s the ability of data miners to aggregate,compile,and transfer information destined for narrowly defined commercial ends in a transaction where the information itself has become a commodity.ayotte,at.the court of appeals thought it would stretch the fabric of the first amendment beyond any rational measure to treat a regulation of information differently from a regulation of beef jerky when the information is a product.id.at.the majority of the court of appeals concluded that it was consistent with the first amendment for the legislature to level the playing field not by eliminating speech but,rather,by eliminating the detailers ability to use a particular information a particular way.id.at.however,as the supreme court recently affirmed,courts do not have freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the first amendment.united states stevens.the obscure distinction between speech and information asset s is an insufficient basis for giving the government leeway to level the playing field subject only to rational basis review.
here,the legislature explicitly aimed to correct the massive imbalance in information presented to doctors and other prescribers.acts.the statute specifically decries that t he marketplace for ideas on medicine safety and effectiveness is frequently id.at.the statute is therefore clearly aimed at influencing the supply of information,a core first amendment concern.instead of mere rational basis review,the first amendment teaches that courts should assume that truthful commercial information is not in itself harmful.state,at,and conclude that when a statute aims to restrict the availability of such information for some purposes,that restriction must be judged under the first amendment.
the appellees also argue that the statute only regulates conduct and not speech because the appellants have no first amendment right to access health records without consent.however,the appellants have not claimed a first amendment right to obtain information.they challenge the restriction on their ability to purchase and use information otherwise available to them but for the state restriction.the statute prevents willing sellers and willing buyers from completing a sale of information to be used for purposes that the state disapproves.indeed,section does not prohibit the collection of pi data so long as it is not used for purposes that the state has prohibited.
the appellees rely on the supreme court decision in los angeles police department united reporting publishing.however,that case illustrates why the appellees argument is misplaced.in united reporting,the supreme court held that restrictions on access to certain police department information were not facially unconstitutional under the first amendment.id.at.the supreme court noted that,what we have before us is nothing more than a governmental denial of access to information in its possession.id.at.the court also noted that t his is not a case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.id.in this case,the information is not in the government possession.rather,the state seeks to limit the acquisition and use of information in the hands of pharmacies,data miners,and pharmaceutical companies.this is a case about the extent of the permissible governmental regulation of information in the hands of private actors.it is not a case about a claim by private parties to a first amendment right to access information in government files.
because we agree with the district court that the statute restricts protected speech,it is necessary to determine whether section violates the appellants first amendment rights.
the appellants argue that section restricts noncommercial speech,even though pi data is sold for a profit.they argue that the statute should be subject to strict scrutiny.see bd.of trs.of state of fox,some of our most valued forms of fully protected speech are uttered for a profit.the appellees contend,and the district court agreed,that section restricts only commercial speech,and therefore is subject to intermediate scrutiny under the test set out in central hudson.see sorrell,d at.the district court noted that pi data has both commercial and noncommercial uses.see sorrell,d at.the data can be used in research regarding the use of prescription medications,to identify harmful consequences of particular medications,and to warn doctors who have prescribed a particular medication of safety concerns that arise after fda approval.the data can also be used for the purely commercial purposes of marketing branded prescription drugs.
section restricts the speech of both the pharmaceutical manufacturers represented by phrma,who are prohibited from using vermont pi data for marketing purposes,and the data mining appellants,who are prohibited from selling or transferring vermont pi data if the data is to be used for marketing purposes.see.stat.ann.tit,d.we address each in turn.
section prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from using pi data regarding prescriptions written and dispensed in vermont in their marketing efforts.see id.the statute therefore affects manufacturers ability to promote drugs to doctors through detailing,for example,by making it harder to identify those physicians for whom the message will be most relevant and to tailor the detailing messages based on individual physicians prescribing histories.
the core notion of commercial speech is that which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.anderson treadwell,cir,quoting bolger youngs drug prods.it can not be seriously disputed that the primary purpose of detailing is to propose a commercial sale of prescription drugs to patients.the manufacturers argue,however,that the detailing message includes fully protected speech,specifically information regarding medical conditions the prescribers treat and a manufacturer innovative treatments for those conditions and that strict scrutiny should apply here because section restricts commercial speech that is inextricably intertwined with otherwise fully protected speech.riley fed of the blind of.however,the mere presence of information in an otherwise commercial presentation does not transform the communication into fully protected speech.see,bolger,at we have made clear that advertising which links a product to a current public debate is not thereby entitled to the constitutional protection afforded noncommercial speech.bad frog brewery,state liquor,cir holding product label to be commercial speech despite social commentary purportedly communicated by the labeling.
therefore,although some of the information communicated by detailers might be fully protected in another context,we will analyze section as a restriction on commercial speech with respect to the pharmaceutical manufacturers.see bolger,at a company has the full panoply of protections available to its direct comments on public issues,so there is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection which such statements are made in the context of commercial transactions.
section also prohibits data miners from selling or transmitting pi data regarding prescriptions written and dispensed in vermont if that pi data will later be used for marketing purposes.see.stat.ann.tit,d.data miners do not themselves use pi data in their own marketing efforts.rather,data miners are in the business of aggregating and selling the data to pharmaceutical manufacturers,among other entities,so that pharmaceutical manufacturers can use the data in their marketing strategies.the data miners regulated speech is therefore one step further removed from the marketing goals of the pharmaceutical manufacturers,although it remains a necessary step in the pharmaceutical manufacturers marketing efforts.
the sale of information is protected by the first amendment,and is not necessarily commercial speech.see,universal city studios,at finding computer program is speech,and not scrutinizing it under the commercial speech doctrine.however,unlike the data miners sale of pi data here,the computer program in universal city studios was not a step in a chain intended to influence marketing efforts.
because this court finds that section restriction on data miners can not survive even the lower intermediate scrutiny that applies to regulations of commercial speech,we assume without deciding that the statute restricts the data mining appellants commercial speech.
under central hudson,the government may regulate commercial speech when the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity the government assert s a substantial interest to be achieved by the regulation the restriction must directly advance the state interest and finally if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech,the excessive restrictions can not survive.central hudson,at.there is no allegation that the commercial speech regulated by section is either misleading or related to an unlawful activity.therefore,for the statute to survive intermediate scrutiny,the government must assert a substantial state interest that is directly advanced by the statute,and the regulation must not be more extensive than necessary to achieve the government interest.
the second prong of central hudson requires that the state assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech.id.vermont alleges that section advances three substantial state interests the state interest in protecting the public health,protecting the privacy of prescribers and prescribing information,an interest the state sometimes also refers to as an interest in protecting medical privacy,and the state interest in containing health care costs in both the private and public sectors.see.stat.ann.tit,a.
the district court found that vermont cost containment and public health interests were substantial government interests to justify the statute.sorrell,d at.the court found that it was unnecessary to consider whether protecting prescriber privacy was also a substantial government interest.id.at.the appellants do not seriously dispute that the state has a substantial interest in protecting public health and containing health care costs,although the appellants do argue that section does not directly advance these substantial state interests.
the parties dispute whether protecting the privacy of prescribers and prescribing information is a substantial state interest.section itself refers to protecting the privacy of prescribers and prescribing information,but the statute plainly does not protect physician privacy.stat.ann.tit,a.physician privacy might be protected if the statute prohibited the collection and aggregation of pi data for any purpose,or if the use of such data were permitted in only rare and compelling circumstances.the statute at issue here,however,does not forbid the collection of pi data in the first instance.furthermore,the statute does not ban any use of the data other than for marketing purposes,including widespread publication to the general public.there is nothing in the statute that would prevent the use of such data for journalistic reports about physicians.
vermont contemplates that the data will still be collected and used,albeit for purposes other than marketing.for example,the state acknowledges that the statute permits the use of pi data for health care research,treatment,and uses.the statute only imposes restrictions on the sale or use of such data for marketing or promoting a prescription drug.vermont does not explain how the continued collection of pi data,and its use for purposes,is compatible with an alleged interest in protecting physician privacy.indeed,the concern that patient information can be gleaned from pi data is not reduced in any way by section,and the statute does not prohibit wide public dissemination of pi data.
the appellees argue that the state interest in privacy is that pharmaceutical marketers should not be exerting undue influence and intruding on the relationship by marketing prescription drugs using pi data.according to this argument,the state has an interest in preventing pharmaceutical manufacturers from using pi data to persuade doctors to prescribe medications because patient care can be compromised and because patient trust in the health care system is undermined.therefore,what the appellees refer to as medical privacy is actually two distinct interests.the first is an interest in the integrity of the prescribing process itself,and the second is an interest in preserving patients trust in their doctors by preventing patients from believing that their physicians are inappropriately influenced by pi marketing.
however,the state asserted interest in medical privacy is too speculative to qualify as a substantial state interest under central hudson.intermediate scrutiny requires that the state demonstrate that the harms it recites are real.rubin coors brewing.on the record in this case,vermont has not shown any effect on the integrity of the prescribing process or the trust patients have in their doctors from the use of pi data in marketing.vermont own expert was unaware of any instance in which a detailing interaction caused a doctor to prescribe an inappropriate medication.to the extent that the record might suggest pi data has damaged the relationship between doctors and patients,the evidence is either speculative or merely indicates that some doctors do not approve of detailing or the use of pi data in detailing.for example,vermont expert witness david grande opined that the use of pi data will make patients only feel more anxious about whether or not in fact their interests are being put first,but he had not conducted any studies of patient perception of pi data to support that conclusion.
therefore,we agree with the district court that vermont does have a substantial interest in both lowering health care costs and protecting public health.however,the state asserted interest in medical privacy is too speculative to satisfy the second prong of central hudson.
the third prong of central hudson requires that the regulation directly advance the state interest involved.cent.hudson,at see also edenfield fane,describing third prong of central hudson as whether the challenged regulation advances these interests in a direct and material way.it is well established that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it.edenfield,at alteration omitted quoting bolger youngs drug prods.this prong is critical and requires invalidating a regulation that restricts commercial speech if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government interest.greater new orleans broad.ass united states,quoting cent.hudson,at.
the vermont statute can not be said to advance the state interests in public health and reducing costs in a direct and material way.section can advance the state interests in protecting public health and reducing health costs only by the following route the statute prevents pi data from being transferred from data miners to pharmaceutical manufacturers for marketing purposes,who in turn are prevented from using the data in their marketing efforts.failure to use pi data in marketing results in less effective marketing for prescription drugs,some of not more expensive yet provide no therapeutic advantage over generic alternatives.less effective marketing will result in doctors writing fewer prescriptions for prescription drugs,thereby reducing health care costs and protecting public health by minimizing prescriptions for more expensive or less tested medications.the state own explanation of how section advances its interests can not be said to be direct.the statute does not directly restrict the prescribing practices of doctors,and it does not even directly restrict the marketing practices of detailers.rather,it restricts the information available to detailers so that their marketing practices will be less effective and less likely to influence the prescribing practices of physicians.
the appellees have failed to cite to any case from the supreme court or this court that has upheld a regulation on speech when the government interest in the regulation is to bring about indirectly some social good or alter some conduct by restricting the information available to those whose conduct the government seeks to influence.cent.hudson,at we review with special care regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a policy.regulations of conduct are permitted,but only if the government interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression.united states.however,the legislative findings are explicit that vermont here aims to do exactly that which has been so highly,put the state thumb on the scales of the marketplace of ideas in order to influence conduct.the legislature found that the marketplace for ideas on medicine safety and effectiveness is frequently in that companies invest in expensive pharmaceutical marketing campaigns to doctors.the nature of the marketing leads to doctors prescribing drugs based on incomplete and biased information.acts.in other words,the statute seeks to alter the marketplace of ideas by taking out some truthful information that the state thinks could be used too effectively.
the state approach to regulating the interaction between detailers and doctors is premised on limiting the information available to physicians as a means of impacting their conduct.this approach is antithetical to a long line of supreme court cases stressing that courts must be very skeptical of government efforts to prevent the dissemination of information in order to affect conduct.see liquormart,rhode island,the first amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good.state,at alternative to ban on pharmacist advertising is to assume that this information is not in itself harmful,that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed,and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them.even if section is successful in altering the conduct of physicians in their prescribing practices,the supreme court reminds us that i t is precisely this kind of choice,between the dangers of suppressing information,and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available,that the first amendment makes for us.state,at see also thompson states med,if the first amendment means anything,it means that regulating speech must be a.
the appellees place extensive reliance on anderson treadwell,cir.in anderson,this court upheld a new york statute banning real estate solicitations of homeowners in certain zones designated by the secretary of state if the homeowner indicated that the homeowner did not wish to receive such solicitations.id.at.the statute was designed to prevent blockbusting the practice of obtaining real estate listings by emphasizing that a neighborhood is undergoing a religious,racial,or ethnic change.id.at.however,this court upheld the statute on the basis of the government interest in protecting the privacy of homeowners from harassing real estate solicitations,an interest that is not present here.see id.at.the statute in anderson directly regulated the potentially harassing sales calls.it directly targeted the harassing visits that were viewed as problematic.the statute in anderson did not ban any entity from transmitting marketing data that would be useful to real estate agents in deciding which homeowners to target.it did not seek to affect the conduct of homeowners by limiting the information available to them.in contrast,section does not ban detailing,even when that detailing is seen as harassment by an individual physician.it does not even restrict such detailing.the provision of section does not make the statute comparable to the statute in anderson.the provision in the vermont statute relates solely to a physician agreement that the physician pi data can be used.physicians in vermont can always choose to decline to be visited by detailers,even without section.the provision in the statute in anderson was a consent to be solicited by real estate licensees,not a consent to have information used 
because section is an attempt to influence the prescribing conduct of doctors by restricting the speech of data miners and pharmaceutical does not directly advance the state interests in protecting public health and reducing health care costs.instead,the statute restricts protected speech when uttered for purposes the government does not approve of in order to reduce the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and,ultimately,alter the behavior of prescribers,who are not regulated by the statute.this route is too indirect to survive intermediate scrutiny.
section also fails under the final prong of central hudson,which requires invalidating the restriction if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech.at.
the government is not required to employ the least restrictive means conceivable,but it must demonstrate narrow tailoring of the challenged regulation to the asserted interest a fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served.
greater new orleans,at quoting fox,at.the burden is on the government to show that it carefully calculated costs and benefits of burdening speech.id.while the fit need not be perfect,if the government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech,or that restricts less speech,the government must do so.thompson,at.
the regulation at issue here applies to all brand name prescription drugs,irrespective,for example,of whether there is a generic alternative or whether an individual drug is effective or ineffective.this is a poor fit with the state goal to regulate new and allegedly insufficiently tested drugs in cases where there are cheaper generic alternatives available.the statute targets the use of pi data to market all brand name prescription drugs,not merely new drugs or those medications for which there are generic alternatives.
the appellees argue that the court should defer to the legislative determination that the statute is a reasonable fit so long as that determination is itself reasonable.the appellees rely on this court recent decision in clear channel outdoor,city of new york,cir,for the proposition that this court should defer to a government reasonable determination regarding how to regulate commercial speech.however,reliance on clear channel is misplaced because that decision specifically addresses a regulation of commercial billboards,a distinctive method of speech that poses unique problems such as the potential to distract drivers and is therefore particularly amenable to government regulation.see id.at.this court stressed the particular government interests involved in the law of billboards.id.quoting metromedia,city of san diego.
in any event,we need not decide what level of deference is appropriate here.the statute prohibits the transmission or use of pi data for marketing purposes for all prescription drugs regardless of any problem with the drug or whether there is a generic alternative.the statute bans speech beyond what the state evidence purportedly addresses.it seeks to discourage detailing about new prescription drugs which may not be efficacious or which may not be more effective than generic alternatives.however,it does that by precluding the use of pi data for the marketing of any prescription,no matter how efficacious and no matter how beneficial those drugs may be compared to generic alternatives.even if the court defers to the legislature determinations,those determinations can not support banning speech in circumstances that the state evidence does not address.the fact that section sweeps beyond vermont interests in public health and health care costs undermines the state argument that the statute is a reasonable fit with its interests.
moreover,vermont does have more direct,less means available.the state could wait to assess what the impact of its newly funded program will be,including academic detailing and sample generic vouchers.the state could mandate the use of generic drugs as a first course of treatment,absent a physician determination otherwise,for all those patients receiving medicare part d funds.all of these means could be targeted at new drugs particularly when there are alternatives available,unlike section approach that applies to every prescription drug regardless of whether it is a less tested version of an existing medication or a breakthrough drug with no reasonable alternative.all of these alternative means would directly promote the state interests,although they would do so without impacting first amendment rights.
the district court found that section satisfied the narrow tailoring requirement of central hudson because the statute allows prescribers to determine how their pi data would be used,just as the statute at issue in anderson allowed homeowners to determine whether they would receive solicitations from real estate agents.see sorrell,d at citing anderson,at.we reject the comparison of section with the statute at issue in anderson,for the reasons explained above.moreover,the district court did not consider whether there are any reasonable alternatives that would be less than section.while we agree with the district court that central hudson does not require the state to use the least restrictive means available to it to achieve its goals,this court has examined the available alternatives in other cases to determine whether there was a reasonable fit between the regulation and the state asserted interests.see state ass of realtors,shaffer,cir invalidating regulation banning real estate brokers from soliciting residential property owners in certain designated areas when defendant failed to provide empirical evidence regarding whether less approaches would sufficiently promote the asserted government interests.
the state argues that section is narrow because it does not ban detailing and is therefore narrower than speech restrictions that have been struck down.see ayotte,at id.at lipez,concurring.the district court agreed with this reasoning.see sorrell,d at.the statute may be narrow in the sense that it does not prohibit detailing and does not proscribe any particular claim or message.however,the statute does ban a set of messages that vermont itself contends are particularly effective,namely,messages informed by pi data,and curbs the ability of pharmaceutical manufacturers to market drugs.
vermont argues that,unlike other regulations that have been struck down,the statute at issue here does not ban an entire category of speech because doctors can permit their own pi data to be transmitted and used for marketing purposes.alexander cahill,cir finding statute banning potentially,but not actually,misleading use of nicknames in attorney advertising an unconstitutional regulation of commercial speech.however,the mere fact that the statute does permit doctors to choose to make their pi data available for marketing purposes,even if a substantial number of doctors would do so,does not render the disputed provisions any less categorical.see id.the statute bans the transmission or use of pi data for marketing purposes,unless the prescriber consents,without regard to whether the data pertains to a prescription drug that is efficacious and whether or not it has a generic alternative.it is the fact that the statute does not distinguish between drugs,no matter how unique and efficacious,that renders the statute a categorical ban.
the appellees failed to explain how section is no more extensive than necessary to serve its asserted interests in health care costs and public health,or why the proposed alternatives would be inadequate.the state did present limited testimony at trial relating to these alternatives.for example,aaron kesselheim testified that the pharmaceutical industry total annual detailing budget was approximately billion and that it was not realistic for vermont to spend this amount on academic detailing.kesselheim also testified that formularies,step therapy,and prior authorization have been in place for a few years but we still see overuse of products that potentially place patients at risk.however,the testimony fell far short of demonstrating that the alternatives would be inadequate.therefore,section can not survive central hudson scrutiny because vermont did not offer any reason why these possibilities,alone or in combination,would be insufficient to achieve the government interests.thompson.
vermont does argue in its brief that the statute is narrowly tailored because it focuses on the specific problem identified by the legislature the use of pi data to fuel marketing campaigns.however,this argument is not responsive to the inquiry under central hudson.vermont has not asserted a substantial state interest in curbing the use of pi data in marketing campaigns.to satisfy the final prong of central hudson,vermont must show that section is narrowly tailored to serve the substantial state interests that it contends justify the speech health care costs and protecting public health.
because the statute restricts speech even with regard to prescriptions of breakthrough medications for which there are no generic alternatives,and because the state could pursue alternative routes that are directly targeted at encouraging the use of generic drugs the state wishes to promote,the state has not demonstrated that its interests in protecting public health and containing health care costs could not be as well served by a more limited restriction on speech.therefore,section can not survive intermediate scrutiny and is an unconstitutional regulation of commercial speech under the test set forth in central hudson 
conclusion 
for the reasons explained above,we reverse and remand the judgment of the district court.
misconstruing vermont prescription confidentiality law.stat.ann.tit.hereinafter section as a direct restriction on pharmaceutical marketing,which is indisputably a form of commercial speech for purposes of the first amendment,the majority extends first amendment protection to data miners and pharmaceutical companies principally challenging a restriction on access to otherwise private information.in so doing,the majority not only reaches the wrong result in this case,but creates circuit precedent likely to have pernicious broader effects in a complex and evolving area of first amendment law.because i would find that section permissibly restricts access to information that vermont requires pharmacies to collect and that the statute has very limited,if any,effects on first amendment activity,i respectfully dissent.
i begin with common ground there is no dispute that,data which documents the prescribing habits of a particular doctor pi data is exceptionally valuable to pharmaceutical companies,who make use of it to market their highly profitable brand name drugs through a process known as detailing.there also is no dispute that the marketing messages detailers deliver in meetings with doctors constitute protected first amendment activity.finally,there is no dispute that section does not directly regulate those messages or the marketing practices of detailers.op.at.instead,vermont law regulates the dissemination of confidential,pi the process by which it is collected and sold.because section targets that process rather than detailing itself,understanding the sequence of events section is,the process by which pi data travels from the prescription pad to the hands of a pharmaceutical detailer is crucial to understanding the statute legal status.ims health mills,cir lipez,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
pursuant to vermont law,every time a pharmacy fills a prescription within the state,it is required to collect certain information about the doctor,the patient,and the medication being prescribed.see.bd.of pharmacy admin.rules,because that information is so valuable to any number of third parties,including the in this case,pharmacies,for some time,have made a practice of selling without the knowledge or permission of the doctor,let alone the various third parties,including data mining vendors such as ims health,verispan,llc,and south healthcare analytics collectively,the data mining appellants these vendors aggregate and compile the data they acquire from pharmacies and then license it to pharmaceutical companies,represented here by pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma,who use the information to guide some of their marketing and in particular,their detailing,efforts.specifically,pharmaceutical companies use pi data to identify particular doctors for detailing,to monitor the success of their detailing efforts,and to compensate individual detailers based on the prescriptions written by the doctors they meet with.pharmaceutical detailers do not,however,directly reference pi data in their meetings with doctors,and in fact,are prohibited from doing so by the terms of their employers licensing agreements with the data mining appellants.
accordingly,before a detailer ever sets foot in a doctor is,before the commercial speech the majority focuses on ever least three events take place first,a pharmacy gathers information from patients seeking to fill prescriptions second,it collects and sells that data to third parties,principally data vendors or data miners such as appellants here and third,these data miners repackage that data and license it to pharmaceutical companies.see generally ims health ayotte,cir.only after these three transactions occur does pi data land in the hands of detailers who then use it to facilitate their detailing efforts.
troubled by this sequence of events whereby otherwise confidential information ends up in the hands of pharmaceutical detailers and in response to concerns about medical privacy,threats to patient health,and rising health care costs attributable to the widespread use of new brand name prescription drugs which the record indicates are those most likely to be the subject of extensive detailing efforts vermont enacted its prescription confidentiality law.in relevant part,the law prohibits any health insurer,employer,electronic transmission intermediary,pharmacy,or other similar entity from sell ing,licens ing,exchang ing for value or otherwise permit ing the use of information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug absent the prescriber consent.the law further prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers and marketers from us ing information for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless the prescriber consents in the manner provided by statute.stat.ann.tit,d.
focusing heavily on that last restriction,the majority begins its analysis at the end of the sequence of events,at the point at which pi data is already in the hands of pharmaceutical concludes that the law impermissibly restricts the speech of both the pharmaceutical manufacturers who are prohibited from using vermont pi data for marketing purposes,and the data mining appellants,who are prohibited from selling or transferring vermont pi data if the data is to be used for marketing purposes.op.at.the law,however,starts at the beginning,and seeks to cut off the flow of pi data at its source section prohibits any pharmacy from sell ing information or permitting its use for marketing or promoting a prescription drug.stat.ann.tit,d emphasis added because the restrictions imposed by section begin there,and because that first restriction prevents pi data from ever reaching the hands of,the principal question to be one the majority wholly whether the restriction on pharmacies implicates the first amendment interests of the data miners and pharmaceutical companies before the court 
in considering that restriction,i begin with the undisputed fact that vermont pharmacies have access to and collect prescription information only under the direction and authority of state law.as noted,vermont requires pharmacies to collect information such as the name of the prescribing doctor,the name and age of the patient,and the drug and dose prescribed.having mandated the collection of that otherwise highly confidential information,the state unquestionably has an interest in controlling its further dissemination.it is that interest that section respect to appellants,vermont law operates principally to prevent them from obtaining otherwise private pi data,and as such,does no more than restrict their unfettered access to information.this the first amendment permits.see zemel rusk,first amendment does not carry with it the unrestrained right to gather information.
in finding that section operates principally as a permissible regulation on access to information,i am guided by the supreme court decision in los angeles police department united reporting publishing corporation.there,a private publishing company challenged a california state law that restricted access to information collected by local police departments respecting those arrested within the state.the court found that,at least with respect to that plaintiff,the law had no first amendment implications because it did no more than regulate access to information in the hands of the police department.id.at.as the court further noted,california could decide not to give out arrestee information at all without violating the first amendment.id.
the majority attempts to distinguish united reporting on the ground that while the california law amounted to a government denial of access to information in its possession,id.emphasis added,here the information is not in the government possession but instead in the hands of pharmacies.op.at.as a preliminary matter,the argument completely disregards the fact that the information is only in the hands of pharmacies because the state has directed them to collect it.as such,vermont interest in controlling the further dissemination of that information is not conceptually different from california interest in stemming the further dissemination of information in the hands of local police departments.under the majority reasoning,united reporting hinges on the fact that the city of los angeles used its own police than the private prison or security contractors it might have relied process and house its arrestees.see clifford rosky,force,the privatization of punishment,policing,and military force in liberal states,noting the rapid growth of private prisons and their use in more than half the country.i see no basis for reading united reporting that narrowly.
but second,the majority attempt to distinguish united reporting would lead to the rather startling proposition that the first amendment rights,if any,of those seeking access to information turn on whom they are requesting it from.under the majority analysis,for example,the family educational rights and protection prohibits universities from disseminating information collected about enrolled students,see b operates as a permissible restriction on access to information if a request for student records is denied by a public university but implicates the requestor first amendment rights if it leads to a denial by a private school.i find that outcome both illogical and untenable.united states miami,f d,cir interpreting ferpa and rejecting asserted first amendment right of access to student records.indeed,for the putative gatherer of information,the difference is of no discernable let alone constitutional significance.houchins kqed,there is an undoubted right to gather news but that affords no basis for the claim that the first amendment compels persons or supply information.plurality opinion emphasis added.
no doubt sensing the tenuous nature of that position,the majority argues that appellants have not claimed a first amendment right to obtain information but instead challenge section insofar as it regulates the use of information already in their hands.op.at.united reporting,at this is not a case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.the argument rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of section the sequence of events that it regulates.because,as noted,the majority begins at the end of that sequence,it ignores the fact that section regulates the flow of pi data well before it ever comes to be in the hands of appellants.indeed,under operation of the law,appellants can only possess pi data if they have obtained it from pharmacies on the condition that it not be used for marketing or promoting of a prescription drug.having thus obtained pi data with conditions clearly attached,appellants can not subsequently contend those conditions amount to restrictions on information they already possess.
i do not question the proposition that different considerations apply where the government is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses.i simply conclude that none of the appellants in this case are so affected by operation of section.nor do i pass on the pressed by appellants selectively restricting access to information may raise first amendment concerns.united reporting,at scalia,concurring allowing selective access may create restriction s upon speech rather than upon access to government information id.at ginsburg,j,concurring selective restrictions on access could impermissibly burden speech where selection is based upon an illegitimate criterion.i simply conclude that,based on the record before this court,section operates as a permissible restriction on access to information that the government has directed pharmacies to collect,and the majority errs in concluding to the contrary.
because i thus conclude that section should be upheld as a permissible restriction on access to information,i could end my analysis there.the majority,however,proceeds to the question of whether,as applied to appellants,vermont law regulates conduct or speech.because i view that issue as one of some importance,and because i am deeply troubled by the majority discussion of it,i,too,address the issue in order to express considerable doubt that,as applied to the data mining appellants in particular,section can properly be characterized as a restriction on speech.in considering the law as applied to data miners and pharmaceutical companies,i once again reject the majority approach and follow the sequence of events the law regulates,beginning,here,with the restriction as applied to the data miners.
as a preliminary by the parties dispute whether section actually restricts the data miners at all.indeed,section makes no mention of data miners or vendors.accordingly,it is not clear to me that data miners have any amendment or stake here.section,would,at most,appear to eliminate a substantial market for data miners services by eliminating the desire of pharmaceutical companies to purchase marketing information the statute prohibits them from using.as the first circuit recently observed,however,the first amendment does not safeguard against changes in commercial regulation that render previously profitable information valueless.ayotte,at quoting wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir.nevertheless,because section restricts other similar entities from sell ing,licens ing,or exchang ing for value pi data if the transfer is made for marketing or promoting a prescription drug,and because a data miner could conceivably be deemed a similar entity and thus so regulated,i proceed to consider the law as it might be applied to them.
the question,thus,is whether that restriction,should it be imposed,infringes data miners first amendment rights.there are significant reasons to conclude that it does not.as the majority concedes,these data disingenuously style themselves publishers for purpose of this litigation do not themselves use pi data but instead are in the business of aggregating and selling data.op.at.nevertheless,citing our opinion in universal city for the proposition that t he first amendment protects even dry information,devoid of advocacy,political relevance,or artistic expression,op.at citing universal city studios,at alteration omitted,the majority concludes that the data miners sale of that dry information constitutes protected speech,even implying that it may constitute speech.id.at.
i do not read universal city to support such a sweeping proposition.there,we observed in dicta that even dry information may be protected speech and held,specifically,that computer programs constructed from code can merit first amendment protection,at,emphasis added see also id.at noting that in the modern age,this court has taken an evolutionary approach favoring narrow holdings that would permit the law to mature on a basis quoting,network solutions,cir.on the facts of that case,we concluded that the computer code in question warranted first amendment protection because it had the capacity to communicate information to human beings and had promoted both discourse among computer scholars and the exchange of ideas and expression.id.at.however,in so doing,we distinguished commodity futures trading commission vartuli,cir sack,where we found that the computer program in question there did not warrant first amendment protection on the ground that the values served by the first amendment were not advanced by the vartuli code.id.at citing vartuli at see also vartuli,at noting that those values include the pursuit of truth,the accommodation among interests,the achievement of social stability,the exposure and deterrence of abuses of authority,personal autonomy and personality development,and the functioning of democracy.
accordingly,the critical question in applying universal city is not merely whether the appellants are engaged in the sale of dry information but rather whether they are engaged in a sale of dry information that advance s the values served by the first amendment.vartuli,at language serves a variety of functions,only some of which are covered by the special reasons for freedom of speech.quoting kent greenwalt,speech and crime,am.found.res.here,there are strong reasons to question whether the data mining appellants are engaged in conduct that meets that standard.as the majority characterizes them,the data mining appellants are in the business of aggregating and selling data data which communicates nothing about them nor allows them to express or communicate anything at all.op.at.
to be clear,the dissemination of dry information can qualify for first amendment protection.for instance,as we observed in universal city,courts have subjected to first amendment scrutiny restrictions on the dissemination of technical scientific information and scientific research.universal city,at internal citations omitted see also miller california,the first amendment protects works which,taken as a whole,have serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value.emphasis added.but here,data mining appellants do not contend on appeal that section precludes them from distributing data to foster scientific or medical research.to the contrary,to the extent vermont law applies to them at all,it merely prevents them from licensing their data for a single marketing of prescription drugs.nor do data mining appellants contend the statute prohibits them from fostering public opinion or the contrary,as noted above,data mining appellants actually prohibit their customers from disclosing the data they license to anyone else,much less the general public.as such,i have some difficulty comparing the data they sell to discourse or the exchange of ideas.
the first circuit,in evaluating a similar law,concluded that pi data was just a product,not distinguishable from the data miners perspective to widgets,or,as the first circuit suggested,beef jerky.ayotte,at.as such,the court found that this is a situation in which information itself has become a commodity an informational asset.id.at reno condon,sale of collected driver information proper subject of federal regulation because the information is,in this context,an article of commerce.under these circumstances,that court was unwilling to conclude that simply because a party product is information that any regulation of that product constitutes a restriction on speech.ayotte,at.such an interpretation,it concluded,stretches the fabric of the first amendment beyond any rational measure.id.
the majority rejects,out of hand,the first circuit beef jerky analogy and labels obscure its distinction between speech and information asset s.i do not necessarily mean to endorse that court approach or even its ultimate conclusion.but i am deeply troubled by the fact that the majority becomes the first opinion to hold that data miners sale of pi data constitutes first amendment does not even bother to engage in the fundamental first amendment analysis our case law requires.the majority offers no cogent reason for why this dry information falls into the category the first amendment protects,nor any discussion of how this dry information can be deemed to advance the values served by the first amendment.see vartuli,at.
to reiterate,i do not question that dry information may be of first amendment importance given the role information frequently plays in forming public opinion or fostering the marketplace of ideas.indeed,dry the form of a professor research or a programmer frequently be of core first amendment value.but in an era where increasingly,information is sold as a commodity without being embedded in any practice that could reasonably be regarded as an effort to communicate,robert post,prescribing records and the first hampshire statute,new eng,at,i am unwilling to presume that simply because a business is engaged in the transfer of information rather than widgets that its activities are automatically entitled to the potent shield of the first amendment.and i can not join a majority opinion that offers no principled basis for determining when such conduct should and should not be considered protected first amendment activity.
with respect to the pharmaceutical companies,section primarily prohibits them from accessing and acquiring pi data for a particular,for use in assuming they do acquire it,prohibits them from using it for that purpose.with respect to the first and primary restriction,i would find for the reasons set forth above,that section operates as a perfectly permissible restriction on access to information and thus does not implicate appellants first amendment rights.with respect to the second restriction,i note as i did above that to the extent pharmaceutical companies obtain pi data under the express condition that they can not use it for marketing purposes,they can not subsequently be heard to complain that those express operate as restrictions on information already within their possession.
more generally,i question whether first amendment protection should be afforded to what amounts to a business method or practice,wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir ban on joint advertising strategies permissible restriction on conduct or business method,not speech,one that itself has no expressive quality,but is instead meant at most to facilitate the delivery of other expressive conduct.there is no dispute that the practice of detailing is,of delivering a marketing message to commercial speech.there is also no dispute,however,that pharmaceutical detailers do not refer to pi data in their conversations with doctors.the data is used,instead,to identify doctors most likely to prescribe particular kinds of drugs so that sales pitches may be effectively directed at them,to monitor the success of these detailing efforts by tracking any changes in the prescribing habits of the doctors thereby targeted,and to compensate detailing personnel based on the success of their efforts.
the majority concludes that section impacts pharmaceutical companies speech interests because it affects manufacturers ability to promote drugs to doctors by making it harder to identify those physicians for whom the message will be most relevant and to tailor the detailing messages based on individual physicians prescribing histories.op.at.however,the majority cites no authority for the proposition that the first amendment provides alone,the strong protection the majority affords the methods of identifying an audience,and while the process of tailoring detailing messages arguably comes closer to first amendment activity,the record provides little basis for evaluating the extent to which pi data is actually used in that manner.accordingly,even if section has some minimal and indirect effect on the manner in which detailers tailor those messages,that effect is a very thin reed on which to hang a finding that section restricts first amendment activity rather than conduct.rumsfeld forum for acad.inst.rights,fair,i t has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated,evidenced,or carried out by means of language,either spoken,written,or printed.quoting giboney empire storage ice.
finally,however,even if i were to conclude that section total effect on detailing was sufficient to constitute a restriction on commercial speech,i would nonetheless uphold the statute because i would find that it complies with the standard set forth in central hudson.
under central hudson,to regulate commercial speech that is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity,the government must assert a substantial interest to be achieved,and demonstrate that the restriction directly advances that interest,and the limitation is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.cent.hudson gas pub.serv.comm n,anderson treadwell,cir.as we have previously observed,the latter two steps coalesce to require a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.anderson,at quoting lorillard tobacco,reilly.accordingly,while central hudson compels more searching review of a restriction on commercial speech than a restriction on pure conduct,it does not require strict scrutiny.see id.at t he supreme court has rejected the argument that strict scrutiny should apply to regulations of commercial speech,adhering instead to the somewhat less rigorous standards of central hudson.collecting cases.
with respect to the first factor,vermont identifies three substantial interests section advances an interest in protecting the public health,an interest in protecting the privacy of prescribers and prescribing information,and and an interest in ensur ing costs are contained in the health care sector.the majority concludes that the first and third constitute substantial state interests but that the second is too speculative to qualify.op.at.i would conclude that all three constitute substantial state interests.with respect to the second,which is the only asserted interest on which the majority and i diverge,i am unable to accept the majority conclusion that the state interest in medical privacy is too speculative to qualify as a substantial interest.the majority focuses on the evidence,or asserted lack thereof,of section effect on medical relevant only to whether section directly advances the state interest it has no bearing on whether that interest is real and substantial,an issue which the majority does not directly question.indeed,neither appellants nor the majority advances any serious argument that the state does not have a legitimate and substantial interest in medical privacy,nor am i aware of any.to the contrary,in an era of increasing and concern about medical privacy and the rampant dissemination of confidential information,the federal government has repeatedly acted on that interest and legislated to protect the privacy of medical records,see,protecting information collected pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act et protecting privacy of genetic information,protecting records of medicaid patients,and thirteen states and the district of columbia have considered or enacted bills aimed at protecting medical privacy in the very same way vermont statute does.see br.of amicus curiae privacy inf.ctr.epic at collecting statutes.accordingly,i would find that all three of the state asserted interests are substantial for purposes of central hudson and proceed to evaluate whether section directly advances those interests.
the second and third prongs of the central hudson test require us to consider whether the regulation at issue directly advances the asserted state interests as well as whether the restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve th ose interest s.cent.hudson,at.to meet these requirements,the government carries the burden of establishing a reasonable fit between the law ends and the means chosen to achieve those ends.city of cincinnati discovery network,internal quotation marks omitted.however,as we have recently observed,a reasonable fit is not a least restrictive means test,clear channel outdoor,atl.outdoor advertising,cir,and thus we do not ask whether there is no conceivable alternative but instead demand only that the regulation not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.id.quoting bd.of trs.of the state of fox.the critical inquiry,as the district court noted,is therefore whether the restriction on speech is in reasonable proportion to the substantial state interest s served.sorrell,d at internal quotation marks omitted.
with respect to these factors,the government carries the burden of showing that its law furthers at least one interest in a direct and material way,edenfield fane,and accordingly we ask whether the state has demonstrated that the harms it recites are real and that the restriction will alleviate them to a material degree.anderson,at internal citation and quotations omitted.in evaluating whether the government has met that burden,the parties dispute the level of deference,if any,we owe to the legislature determination.specifically,the parties dispute whether we should apply turner deference and thereby accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of legislative bodies which,as institution s are far better equipped than the judiciary to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon legislative questions.turner broad.fed.comm.comm n,u,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.like the majority,i feel no need to decide the issue,as i would conclude that even without applying turner deference,vermont meets its burden.because i feel the majority overstates that burden,however,i explain briefly what i consider the prevailing standard to be.
as appellants correctly note,turner did not address a restriction on commercial speech,a context in which the supreme court,independent of turner,has repeatedly urged deference to legislative findings.see ayotte,at lipez,concurring in part and dissenting in part t he general principle of legislative deference articulated in turner also is compatible with the court commercial speech precedent.specifically,the court has found that the commercial speech doctrine allows some room for the exercise of legislative judgment,liquormart,rhode island,plurality opinion,and cautioned that,where a legislature has deemed a particular regulation a properly tailored response to a substantial interest,we have been loath to the g overnment judgment to that effect.fox,at.accordingly,as we recently observed in upholding a commercial speech regulation,if a government determination about how to regulate commercial speech is reasonable then we should defer to that determination.clear channel,at.such deference is all the more appropriate where,as here,the law targets a form of commercial speech that has traditionally been subject to extensive regulation,anderson,at,or where the regulation fits within a broader regulatory or policy framework.clear channel,at i t is not this court role to second guess the city urban planning decisions.
accordingly,in evaluating legislative findings and conclusions in the context of a commercial speech regulation,we do not necessarily demand hard evidence,particularly,where,as here,the statute had yet to take effect when first challenged,but instead ask whether the government is able to support its restriction on speech by adduc ing either empirical support or at least sound reasoning on behalf of its measure.ayotte,at lipez,concurring in part and dissenting in part internal quotation marks and alterations omitted emphasis added see also id.at a state need not go beyond the demands of common sense to show that a statute promises directly to advance an identified government interest.citing burson freeman.
the majority,while declining to determine what level of deference is appropriate,contends that clear channel should be limited to the context of commercial billboards.op.at.there is nothing in the language of that opinion to suggest as much,and indeed,the clear channel opinion cites ward rock against racism,a case that did not involve outdoor advertising at the proposition that deference to a government determination of reasonableness is appropriate.see clear channel,at.moreover,as noted above,clear channel is entirely consistent with a much broader body of our case law making clear that deference to legislative findings in the context of restrictions on commercial,particularly,commercial speech in a heavily regulated appropriate.
accordingly,as i proceed to ask whether section directly advances at least one of the three asserted government interests and whether it is not more extensive than necessary to serve th ose interest s,i engage in de novo review of the record.bose consumers union of.but in so doing,i do not substitute my judgment for that of the legislature and instead defer to that body determinations where reasonable.clear channel,at see also ayotte,at lipez,concurring in part and dissenting in part if the government makes the requisite showing,we defer to the legislative judgment to adopt the challenged measure.moreover,i am cognizant of the context in which the restriction was passed and examine section in relation to the overall problem the government seeks to correct.clear channel,at quoting ward,at.engaging in such review,i would conclude that the statute directly advances each of the asserted interests in a material manner,and that it is reasonably proportional which is to say that it does not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.id.at.
first,i would find on this record that section directly advances all three of vermont asserted substantial interests.with respect to cost containment and the public health,the district court found,and the record supports the finding that,section materially advances both.the record establishes that pharmaceutical companies spend billions to detail new brand name prescription drugs that are more expensive,although not necessarily more effective,than generic class equivalents and whose effects and potential risks are less well known than those associated with generic class equivalents.sorrell,d at.the record further establishes that detailing who are detailed are more likely to prescribe new brand name
