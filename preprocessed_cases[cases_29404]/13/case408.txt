appellant,gary lund,contends that the city of fall river zoning ordinances violate the first amendment by preventing him from opening an adult entertainment establishment on land zoned industrial without providing an adequate opportunity elsewhere.the district court rejected his claim,and we affirm.
by the terms of a fall river ordinance,intending providers of adult entertainment must obtain a special permit,see revised code of ordinances of the city of fall river,ordinances,which may be granted only if the applicant meets a variety of zoning conditions,see id.so far as it matters here,mandates a minimum amount of parking proportional to the size of the building to be used and requires it to be surrounded by a,landscaped perimeter.all parking and loading structures must be at least feet from any street and feet from any residence.section forbids adult entertainment on a site within an industrial district.
lund applied for a special permit to open club martinique at front street,even though he conceded that his proposal failed to comply with the ordinance.see.front street is within an industrial district and is thus disqualified as a site for adult entertainment by,and beyond that his proposal would have violated owing to the presence of parking spaces closer than feet to the street and the absence of landscaping.when the city denied his application,lund appealed to the zoning board of appeals for variances from the ordinances,which the board denied,noting the unequivocal language of and.see,id.any building containing an adult use shall meet the setback requirements id.in an industrial district,no structure shall be used except for one of the following uses existing mill buildings may be used for art use,except adult use as defined in section is prohibited.ellipses omitted.
lund then went to the superior court of the commonwealth of massachusetts for declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as compensatory damages,alleging that the city ordinances violate the first amendment.he contended that sections and,individually and in combination,den y him a reasonable opportunity and accommodation to open and operate,within the city,an adult entertainment club.the city removed the case to the district court,see a,which had jurisdiction under.
there,the scope of disagreement narrowed substantially after an evidentiary hearing on lund request for preliminary injunction,in which he and the city offered expert testimony about the amount of legally available land in the city.at the close of evidence,lund counsel stated,i do think that there any facts sic in dispute here.and i know i said at the beginning just a preliminary injunction,but i do see why you ca make a summary judgment decision as well.i do think there any factual dispute between the two experts.there are different scenarios that they presented evidentiary hearing tr,june.the district court responded that the disputed question was fairly discrete,as addressing the last of the conditions to be met by adult commerce regulation subject to intermediate scrutiny under city of renton playtime theatres,d whether the ordinances blocking the proposed adult use provide reasonable alternative means for lund to conduct his adult entertainment business.
the court if that the framing of the issue then i think we have all the evidence we need to decide the merits of the case one way or the other.
cunha plaintiff counsel and i do disagree.
the court does the c ity disagree with that 
pereira defendants counsel no,your honor.
evidentiary hearing tr,june,see also lund city of fall river,wl,at.may,lund conceded that the sole question presented here is whether sections and provide reasonable alternative avenues of communication.
after consideration,the district court entered judgment for the city on the authority of renton.see lund,wl,at.the court found that out of the city developable acres,acres or,on separate sites,are available as adult entertainment venues.id.at.the court thus rejected lund objections that he could not have adequate space within that acreage without combining multiple parcels and undertaking costly redevelopment to comply with the ordinances the district court declined to declare any of the acres unavailable due to such economic considerations.see id.at.finally,the court held that of the city provided lund with reasonable room to exercise his protected expressive right,id.at,relying upon our decision in associates,cir,which found no constitutional deprivation in municipal zoning that left only of developable land available for adult entertainment.
this timely appeal followed,there being no question of our jurisdiction under.
the standard of review that we apply turns on the character of the proceeding in the period after the case was submitted to the court at the end of the colloquy just quoted.lund counsel expressly proposed treating his motion for a preliminary injunction as a motion for summary judgment,which would leave it to the court to draw fair inferences from the undisputed material facts and determine whether lund was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see jirau bernal agrait,cir.presumably he intended the court to act as if for summary judgement were before him,and so to grant judgment for the city if it was entitled to it as a matter of law.looked at this way,the case here would present only issues of fair inference and legal entitlement,which we would review de novo,as on a conventional appeal from summary judgment.see shafmaster united states,cir.
but the colloquy did not end with simple assent to proceed on summary judgment.the court response spoke of hav ing all the evidence we need to decide the merits of the case one way or the other,and each counsel went on record as having no disagreement.this sounds more like an agreement for plenary submission of the case to the judge as,and this is what the judge ultimately understood.his order here on appeal begins with citation to federal rule of civil procedure,subsection a of which authorizes a court to advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing on a motion for preliminary relief.this also seems to be what lund counsel understood he had agreed to,for his appeal addresses the merits of the ruling,not the procedural propriety of the route to reaching it.accordingly,we think the better view is to see the order appealed not as one of summary judgment,but as the product of the procedural crawl that breyer described in federacion de empleados del tribunal de justicia torres,cir.
w here,in a nonjury case,the basic dispute between the parties concerns the factual inferences that one might draw from the more basic facts to which the parties have drawn the court attention,where t here are no significant disagreements about those basic facts,and where neither party has sought to introduce additional factual evidence or asked to present witnesses the standard for appellate oversight shifts from de novo review to review.
eeoc steamship clerks union,loc,cir quoting federacion de empleados del tribunal de justicia,at.it follows that our review standard is for clear error on all issues not purely legal,though we will be candid to say that the result would be the same if the examination were de novo.
lund exceptions to the district court ruling boil off at two.he contends it was error to find that acres on sites were available for adult entertainment,and he argues that the available land does not provide him a reasonable opportunity to open an adult business.
after testimony and evidence from both parties experts,the district court adopted the city contention that the ordinances left acres for adult entertainment,being of the city developable land,comprising sites.the court found that lund contrary assertions lack ed evidentiary support,whereas the city figure was by the testimony and exhibits presented.lund,wl,at.lund argues the contrary on three grounds.
first,despite his concession in the district court that no further trial proceedings were necessary,he says now that a remand is needed to determine the effect of the limitation that p arking and loading facilities be set back a minimum of feet from any structur
