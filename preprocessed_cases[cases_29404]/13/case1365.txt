this appeal concerns a first amendment challenge to an student suspension for sharing with friends via the internet a small drawing crudely,but clearly,suggesting that a named teacher should be shot and killed.martin and annette wisniewski,the parents of aaron wisniewski,appeal from the june,amended judgment of the district court for the northern district of new york norman mordue,chief judge,dismissing their federal civil rights claims against the weedsport central school district board of education and school superintendent richard mabbett and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims.we conclude that the federal claims were properly dismissed because it was reasonably foreseeable that wisniewski communication would cause a disruption within the school environment,and that it was appropriate not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.we therefore affirm.
background 
facts of the episode.this case arose out of an internet transmission by an at weedsport middle school,in the weedsport central school district in upstate new york.in april,the pupil,aaron wisniewski aaron,was using aol instant messaging im software on his parents home computer.instant messaging enables a person using a computer with internet access to exchange messages in real time with members of a group usually called buddies in im lingo who have the same im software on their computers.instant messaging permits rapid exchanges of text between any two members of a buddy list who happen to be at the same time.different im programs use different notations for indicating which members of a user buddy list are at any one time.text sent to and from a buddy remains on the computer screen during the entire exchange of messages between any two users of the im program.
the aol im program,like many others,permits the sender of im messages to display on the computer screen an icon,created by the sender,which serves as an identifier of the sender,in addition to the sender name.the im icon of the sender and that of the person replying remain on the screen during the exchange of text messages between the two buddies,and each can copy the icon of the other and transmit it to any other buddy during an im exchange.
aaron im icon was a small drawing of a pistol firing a bullet at a person head,above which were dots representing splattered blood beneath the drawing appeared the words kill vandermolen.philip vandermolen was aaron english teacher at the time.aaron created the icon a couple of weeks after his class was instructed that threats would not be tolerated by the school,and would be treated as acts of violence.aaron sent im messages displaying the icon to some members of his im buddy list.the icon was not sent to vandermolen or any other school official.
the icon was available for viewing by aaron buddies for three weeks,at least some of whom were aaron classmates at weedsport middle school.during that period it came to the attention of another classmate,who informed vandermolen of aaron icon and later supplied him with a copy of the icon.vandermolen,distressed by this information,forwarded it to the high school and middle school principals,who brought the matter to the attention of the local police,the superintendent mabbett,and aaron parents.in response to questioning by the school principals,aaron acknowledged that he had created and sent the icon and expressed regret.he was then suspended for five days,after which he was allowed back in school,pending a superintendent hearing.vandermolen asked and was allowed to stop teaching aaron class.
at the same time,a police investigator who interviewed aaron concluded that the icon was meant as a joke,that aaron fully understood the severity of what he had done,and that aaron posed no real threat to vandermolen or to any other school official.a pending criminal case was then closed.aaron was also evaluated by a psychologist,who also found that aaron had no violent intent,posed no actual threat,and made the icon as a joke.
the superintendent hearing.in may a superintendent hearing,regarding a proposed suspension of aaron,was held before a designated hearing officer,attorney lynda vancoske.aaron was charged under new york education law with endangering the health and welfare of other students and staff at the school.
in her decision of june,vancoske found that the icon was threatening and should not have been understood as a joke.although the threatening act took place outside of school,she concluded that it was in violation of school rules and disrupted school operations by requiring special attention from school officials,replacement of the threatened teacher,and interviewing pupils during class time.the hearing officer acknowledged the opinions of the police investigator and the psychologist that aaron did not intend to harm vandermolen and that he did not pose any real threat,but stated that intent is irrelevant.citing the evidentiary standard followed in new york suspension hearings,the decision concluded 
substantial and competent evidence exists that aaron engaged in the act of sending a threatening message to his buddies,the subject of which was a teacher.he admitted it.competent and substantial evidence exists that this message disrupted the educational environment 
as a result of the foregoing,i conclude aaron did commit the act of threatening a teacher,in violation of page of the student handbook,creating an environment threatening the health,safety and welfare of others,and his actions created a disruption in the school environment.
the hearing officer recommended suspension of aaron for one semester.the recommendation was presented to the district board of education board which approved the one semester suspension in late september.aaron was suspended for the first semester of the school year.during the period of suspension the school district afforded aaron alternative education.he returned to school for the spring term.at oral argument,we were advised that because of school and community hostility,the family moved from weedsport.
the district court litigation.in november aaron parents filed on his behalf the current suit against the board and superintendent mabbett,seeking damages under.the complaint included five counts the first count claimed that aaron icon was not a true threat,but was protected speech under the first amendment.it therefore alleged that in suspending aaron the board acted in a retaliatory manner in violation of his first amendment rights.the second and third counts alleged that the board and mabbett,respectively,had failed to train school staff in threat assessment,thereby leading to the violation of aaron first amendment rights.the fourth and fifth counts claimed the board had violated new york state education law.
in june,chief judge mordue granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.the district court first found that the hearing officer had made a factual determination,entitled to preclusive effect,that the icon was a threat and,as such,not protected by the first amendment.alternatively,the court made its own determination that the icon was reasonably to be understood as a true threat lacking first amendment protection.the court also found that,in any event,mabbett would be entitled to qualified immunity.having dismissed all three federal law claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining two state law claims,and dismissed them without prejudice.
discussion 
we see no need to resolve the dispute between the parties as to whether the plaintiffs claim was barred by collateral estoppel arising from the determinations in the superintendent hearing.instead,we turn directly to the merits of the plaintiffs claim that aaron icon was protected speech under the first amendment.
in assessing that claim,we do not pause to resolve the parties dispute as to whether transmission of the icon constituted a true threat within the meaning of the supreme court decision in watts united states,d.watts concerned a criminal prosecution for violating a,which provides punishment for knowingly and willfully mak ing a threat against the president.the de
