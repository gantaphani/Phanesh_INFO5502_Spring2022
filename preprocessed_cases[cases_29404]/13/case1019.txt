john doe appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york amon,granting summary judgment in favor of the governor of the state of new york and the acting commissioner of the state of new york division of criminal justice services dcjs on doe constitutional challenges to the enforcement of certain amendments to the new york state sex offender registration act sora.the amendments we are asked to review were enacted after doe pleaded guilty to misdemeanor attempted possession of a sexual performance by a child,as a result of which he was classified as a sex offender required to register under sora.the amendments extended the registration requirement for sex offenders from ten years to a minimum of twenty years and also eliminated the ability of sex offenders to petition for relief from registration.doe argues,among other things,that requiring him to comply with these amendments violates the ex post facto clause and the fourth amendment,and deprives him of due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment,in violation of.we disagree and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,after he was arrested for downloading six images depicting child pornography,doe pleaded guilty in queens county criminal court to one count of attempted possession of a sexual performance by a child,a class a misdemeanor.during the plea colloquy,the state court told doe that he could petition the court as to registration,reporting requirements and release relief at some future point.doe was then sentenced principally to three years probation and designated a sex offender,which required him to register under sora.
at the time of doe guilty plea,sora required sex offenders to register annually for ten years from the initial date of registration,correct.law h,and also provided that a ny sex offender required to register pursuant to this article may be relieved of any further duty to register upon the granting of a petition for relief by the sentencing court,id.o.in the new york state legislature amended sections h and o.the relevant change to h increased the registration requirement for level one offenders from ten to twenty years effective as of january.doe pataki,cir.section o was amended to strip out language that had given a ny sex offender an opportunity to petition the sentencing court for relief from registration,limiting the opportunity to petition for relief to offenders who have already been registered for thirty years.however,as amended,o also provides that,regardless of the offender risk category,a ny sex offender required to register or verify pursuant to this article may petition the sentencing court or the court which made the determination regarding the level of notification for an order modifying the level of notification.correct.law o emphases added.
for a full decade,doe complied with the conditions of his probation and his obligations under sora.then,in,he petitioned the queens county criminal court pursuant to the amended o to relieve him of his registration requirements,to strike his name from the sex offender registry maintained by dcjs,and to enjoin dcjs from publishing his identity to other government entities or the public.doe argued that o affords offenders a statutory right to petition for an order adjusting their risk level downward below level one,thereby necessarily reliev ing the offender from any registration requirement.woe spitzer,d.the criminal court denied doe petition on the ground that sora,as amended,required offenders like doe to remain registered for a minimum period of twenty years without providing any avenue for relief from registration.
as relevant to this appeal,in doe sued the governor and the commissioner of dcjs in federal court under,claiming that sora was unconstitutional as applied to him and seeking to enjoin the enforcement of sections h and o against him.when the defendants moved for summary judgment,the parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of fact.concluding that all of doe federal constitutional claims were meritless,the district court granted the summary judgment motion and dismissed the lawsuit.
doe appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.
doe raises three main arguments on appeal.first,he claims that the amendments to sections h and o as applied to him transformed sora registration and notification requirements into punitive measures,in violation of the ex post facto clause.second,he argues that the state enforcement of the amendments deprived him of procedural and substantive due process.third,doe claims that the state breached its plea agreement with him,insofar as the agreement allowed him to petition for relief from sora registration requirement.we address each argument in turn.
ex post facto challenge 
the ex post facto prohibition applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them.collins youngblood,d.i f a legislative burden is imposed for the purposes of is,to reprimand the wrongdoer,to deter others,it has been considered penal.doe pataki doe i,cir quoting trop dulles,d.the state may not increase the punishment for a crime after it is committed.see id.at.the state is free,though,to make reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.smith doe,d emphasis added.on occasion a law is intended to be civil or regulatory rather than punitive,but we nevertheless look to see if its effect is punitive.see id.at kennedy mendoza martinez,d.the factors most relevant to our analysis are whether,in its necessary operation,the regulatory scheme has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment imposes an affirmative disability or restraint promotes the traditional aims of punishment has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose or is excessive with respect to this purpose.smith,at.
in doe i,a suit brought by a different anonymous plaintiff,we considered a similar constitutional challenge to the version of sora in effect in and held that the statute notification and registration requirements were nonpunitive and therefore did not violate the ex post facto clause.see doe i,at.the analysis we employed in doe i to arrive at that conclusion was reaffirmed by the supreme court decision in smith,d,which rejected an ex post facto challenge to arguably broader notification and registration requirements imposed on sex offenders in alaska.in urging us to distinguish our holding in doe i,doe argues that the amendments to sections h and o have,by design or in effect,transformed sora into a punitive statute 
notification provisions 
doe first argument concerns sora amended notification provisions,which permit free public telephonic access to the registry and authorize law enforcement officers to disseminate information regarding sex offenders to entities with vulnerable populations.we agree with the district court that doe failed to demonstrate that the amendment was punitive rather than regulatory or that his case is otherwise meaningfully distinguishable from doe i.the text and structure of the amendments as well as their legislative history support our conclusion.
as an initial matter,we note that sora notification provisions retain the key features that we cited in doe i as strong evidence of the act nonpunitive nature the calibration of notification requirements to the offender perceived risk of the regulation of public access to and limitations on dissemination of registrant information and the protections against misuse of information.see doe i,at.for example,individual callers to the registry still must provide identifying information to access the registry and are warned about the consequences of misuse.see correct.law p.and it remains the case that the only affirmative dissemination that can be conducted by the state is to entities with vulnerable populations,and not to neighbors,employers,landlords,or news agencies even then,law enforcement officials may not reveal a offender exact address.doe i,at see sess.laws ch.
