liberty mutual insurance operates a employee health plan.a vermont statute requires all health insurers including plans to file with the state reports containing claims data and other information relating to health care.a state regulation specifies how such information must be recorded and transmitted.
when vermont subpoenaed claims data from the liberty mutual plan administrator,this suit was commenced in the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions.liberty mutual sought a declaration that the employee retirement income security act of erisa preempts the vermont statute and regulation.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of vermont.
the erisa preemption clause is not and erisa preemption doctrine is not static.the early judicial consensus,based on the broad wording of the preemption clause and legislative history,was to construe preemption broadly.more recent precedent has pulled back by setting a rebuttable presumption against preemption of state health care regulations.two constants,however,remain recognition that erisa preemption clause is intended to avoid a multiplicity of burdensome state requirements for erisa plan administration and acknowledgment that reporting is a core erisa administrative function.these two considerations lead us to conclude that the vermont law,as applied to compel the reporting of liberty mutual plan data,is preempted.we therefore reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of liberty mutual.
background 
the vermont statute establishes and provides for the maintenance of a unified health care database.stat.ann.tit,a.the database enable s the state department of banking,insurance,securities and health care administration department to carry out its duties,including 
a determining the capacity and distribution of existing resources 
b identifying health care needs and informing health care policy 
c evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programs on improving patient outcomes 
d comparing costs between various treatment settings and approaches 
e providing information to consumers and purchasers of health care and 
f improving the quality and affordability of patient health care and health care coverage.
to populate the database,the statute requires h ealth insurers,health care providers,health care facilities,and governmental agencies to file reports,data,schedules,statistics,or other information,as the department deems necessary,at the time and place and in the manner the department requires.id.at c d.the statute authorizes the department to require the filing of health insurance claims and enrollment information used by health insurers and any other information relating to health care costs,prices,quality,utilization,or resources.id.at c.
knowing and willful failure to comply is punishable by penalty of not more than per violation.see id.at g.
in,the department promulgated a regulation to implement the statute and create the vermont healthcare claims uniform reporting and evaluation system the reporting system.see regulation h,regulation h.the regulation requires reporting of myriad categories of claims data.see infra.health insurers are required to regularly submit medical claims data,pharmacy claims data,member eligibility data,provider data,and other information relating to health care provided to vermont residents and health care provided by vermont health care providers and facilities to both vermont residents and in specified electronic format to the department for each health line of business per the data submission requirements contained in appendices to the regulation.regulation h d.
a h ealth insurer is defined broadly to include any health insurance company,third party administrator,and any entity conducting administrative services for business or possessing claims data,eligibility data,provider files,and other information relating to health care provided to vermont residents or by vermont health care providers and facilities.id.x.
begging the preemption question,the term h ealth insurer may also include,to the extent permitted under federal law,any administrator of an insured,or publicly funded health care benefit plan offered by public and private entities.id.emphasis added.a health insurer with or more enrolled or covered members in each month during a calendar year is designated a mandated reporter.id.ab.all other entities are voluntary reporter s.id.as.
the department makes the collected data available as a resource for insurers,employers,providers,purchasers of health care,and state agencies to continuously review health care utilization,expenditures,and performance in vermont.stat.ann.tit,h b.the department decides the extent of such disclosure allowed by hipaa,the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of,and maintains the confidentiality code by which filed information is handled in an ethical manner,id.f.d irect personal identifiers,such as name,address,and social security number,may not be publicly disclosed.id.h d.
sixteen other states collect health care data for their own health care claims databases.state health reporting laws summary table.data submission requirements vary.some states provide only for voluntary reporting.see id.some expressly exclude employee plan data from their database reporting laws.see id.the majority,however,follow vermont in requiring such plans to report claims data.see id.
liberty mutual insurance is the administrator and named fiduciary of a health plan the plan that provides benefits to individuals in vermont and to over individuals nationwide.the plan is or,health care claims are paid from liberty mutual general assets.
plan documents provide that the plan has been established for the exclusive benefit of participants and except as otherwise provided,all contributions under the plan may be used only for such purpose.the documents also represent that medical records,such as those related to risk factor screening,are kept strictly confidential.the plan represents,however,that it shall comply with all other state and federal law to the extent not preempted by erisa and to the extent such laws require compliance by the plan.
like many employer health plans,the plan uses a administrator tpa.blue cross blue shield of massachusetts,blue cross,as the plan tpa for vermont participants,does processing,review,and payment.under its contract with liberty mutual,any information transferred to blue cross must be used solely for the purpose of administering the plan,and blue cross auditors must guard against unauthorized disclosure of health care information.see.liberty mutual itself is a voluntary reporter because it has fewer than covered members in vermont and has presumably decided not to volunteer but because blue cross qualifies as a mandated reporter and possesses the plan claims data,the reporting of its data is mandatory.
in august,vermont issued a subpoena demanding that blue cross supply the plan e ligibility files,m edical claims files,and p harmacy claims files and threatened that noncompliance might result in fines and a suspension of blue cross authority to do business.liberty mutual instructed blue cross not to comply and filed this suit,seeking a declaration that erisa preempts the vermont statute and regulation and an injunction blocking enforcement of the subpoena.vermont agreed to stay enforcement of the subpoena pending judicial resolution of the erisa preemption question.
in dueling motions,vermont sought to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim,and liberty mutual moved for summary judgment.with the consent of the parties,the district court treated the motions as for summary judgment.see liberty mut.ins.kimbell,cv,wl,at.
the court concluded that liberty mutual had article iii standing but that erisa did not preempt the vermont statute and regulation and that vermont was therefore entitled to summary judgment.see id.
discussion 
we agree with the district court that liberty mutual has standing to challenge the subpoena issued to blue cross liberty mutual has demonstrated the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d footnote,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is of no moment that the subpoena was issued to blue cross and not directly to liberty mutual.the tpa agreement provides that liberty mutual will hold blue cross harmless for any financial charges arising from or in connection with the plan.liberty mutual therefore faces a choice between allowing blue cross to turn over the plan data in what liberty mutual considers a violation of its duties as plan administrator and fiduciary or directing,and indemnifying blue cross for the ensuing civil penalties.either way,under lujan,liberty mutual suffers a redressable as a direct result of vermont threatened,imminent action.
we review de novo the grant of summary judgment on the preemption question.see,wrobel cnty.of erie,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.w e may reverse the grant of summary judgment and order judgment for the party if we find undisputed support in the record entitling the party to judgment as a matter of law.new england health care emps.union mount sinai,cir.
erisa comprehensive regulatory scheme governs most employee benefit plans,including health plans.see.erisa requires plan administrators to file annually with the department of labor reports detailing financial and actuarial information.see id.the department of labor is authorized to undertake research and surveys and in connection therewith to collect,compile,analyze and publish data,information,and statistics relating to employee benefit plans.id.erisa broadly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.id.a emphasis added.with remarkable consistency,the legislative history reflects that this broad wording was purposeful it was intended to eliminate the threat of a multiplicity of conflicting or inconsistent state laws and to achieve broad preemptive effect in the areas of,reporting,and disclosure 
vermont argues and the district court agreed that congress could not have intended broad preemption of state reporting laws because the same congress also passed the national health planning and resources development act of nhprda.the nhprda provided for the establishment of state health planning agencies and authorized these agencies to assemble and analyze data concerning health health care delivery,resources,and use and related environmental factors.see,stat,at b.the supreme court consulted the nhprda to decide erisa preemption in a case in which the nhprda expressly contemplated a state regulatory measure.see state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.here,however,the nhprda is not similarly indicative and if there were tension between nhprda and erisa,it was relieved in when the nhprda was repealed.
the supreme court,and this court,initially applied erisa preemption as broadly as the statutory phrase relate to any employee benefit plan seemed to require.
as explained in shaw delta air lines,the breadth of erisa reach is apparent from that section language,d see id.at congress used the words relate to in their broad sense.shaw formulated the modern erisa preemption test a state law is preempted if it has a connection with or reference to an erisa plan.id.at emphases added.the court treated as obvious that erisa preempted state laws dealing with the subject matters covered by erisa reporting,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like.id.at emphases added.the open question was whether preemption went beyond these core areas,and the court held it did.see id.at.the one note of caution in shaw was consigned to a footnote 
some state actions may affect employee benefits plans in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law relates to the plan.am.merry,state garnishment of a spouse pension income to enforce alimony and support orders is not.the present litigation plainly does not present a question,and we express no views about where it would be appropriate to draw the line.
for another decade,the supreme court and this court followed shaw and repeatedly emphasized the broad reach of erisa preemption.see,fmc holliday,d the clause is conspicuous for its breadth.state dep t of labor,cir erisa was intended to have a sweeping preemptive effect in the employee benefit plan field.congress intended erisa to occupy and regulate the field of employee benefit plans.citation omitted.the threat of conflicting state and local regulation was consistently cited as a paramount reason for preemption preemption was intended to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or between states and the federal government.ingersoll rand mcclendon,d see fort halifax packing coyne,d we have not hesitated to enforce erisa provision where state law created the prospect that an employer administrative scheme would be subject to conflicting requirements such a situation would produce considerable inefficiencies,which the employer might choose to offset by lowering benefit levels.howard gleason,cir t he express provisions of erisa are deliberately expansive,and designed to establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern in order to afford employers the advantages of a uniform set of administrative procedures governed by a single set of regulations.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
these cases specifically that reporting and disclosure are core erisa functions subject to a uniform federal standard.see ingersoll rand,at erisa sets various uniform standards,including rules concerning reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary responsibility fmc,at listing reporting and disclosure as subject matters covered by erisa.
the supreme court has explained the importance of having uniform federal and reporting requirements 
the legislative history reflect s recognition of the administrative realities of employee benefit plans.an employer that makes a commitment systematically to pay certain benefits undertakes a host of obligations,such as determining the eligibility of claimants,calculating benefit levels,making disbursements,monitoring the availability of funds for benefit payments,and keeping appropriate records in order to comply with applicable reporting requirements.the most efficient way to meet these responsibilities is to establish a uniform administrative scheme,which provides a set of standard procedures to guide processing of claims and disbursement of benefits.such a system is difficult to achieve,however,if a benefit plan is subject to differing regulatory requirements in differing states.a plan would be required to keep certain records in some states but not in others to make certain benefits available in some states but not in others to process claims in a certain way in some states but not in others and to comply with certain fiduciary standards in some states but not in others.

liberty mutual places great weight on the supreme court summary affirmance of one of these early preemption cases,standard oil agsalud,cir.we need not rest our ruling on that case or on so perfunctory a disposition as summary affirmance at the same time,it is telling that when congress amended erisa in to exempt from certain provisions of the hawaii act,it did not exempt from those portions of the law dealing with reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary requirements.fort halifax,at see,at.the provision continues federal preemption of state law with respect to matters governed by the reporting and disclosure and the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa.
the supreme court decision in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers insurance marked something of a pivot in erisa preemption.see,d.the court began with the starting presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law,especially if the state action occurs in fields of traditional state regulation,like health care id.at.to preempt,a clear and manifest purpose by congress is required.id.at.following on this presumption,the court pulled back on its broad,literal reading of relate to if the phrase were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes would never run its course.id.
applying the shaw test in light of these new principles,the court concluded that a state statute requiring hospitals to collect a surcharge from patients covered by commercial insurers was not preempted.see id.at.the court explained that state law is preempted if it mandate s employee benefit structures or their administration or provid es alternative enforcement mechanisms.id.at.the state surcharge law withstood preemption in travelers because it had no more than an indirect economic influence on erisa plans,it did not bind plan administrators to any particular choice and thus function as a regulation of an erisa plan itself,and it did not preclude uniform administrative practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit package if a plan wishes to provide one.id.at.
the court again recognized the central roles of reporting and disclosure erisa controls the administration of benefit plans,as by imposing reporting and disclosure mandates.id.at emphasis added citation omitted.congress extension of to all state laws relating to benefit plans was meant to sweep more broadly than state laws dealing with the subject matters covered by erisa,reporting,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like.id.at emphases added internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
applying travelers,cases conclude that state laws having only an indirect economic effect on erisa plans lack sufficient connection with or reference to an erisa plan to trigger erisa preemption.new england health care emps.union mount sinai,cir see also de buono nysa ila med.clinical servs.funds,d state hospital tax not preempted nys health maint.org.conference curiale,cir o nly link state surcharge law has with erisa plans is its indirect effect on rate diversification among insurers.nevertheless,the supreme court teaches that travelers and its progeny do not disturb the principle that state statutes that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration have a connection with erisa plans and are therefore preempted.cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,d emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.like travelers itself,later cases reiterate that erisa is expressly concerned with reporting,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also boggs boggs,d plumbing indus.bd.howell,cir.
the use of preemption to avoid proliferation of state administrative regimes also remains a vital feature of the law.d iffering state regulations affecting an erisa plan system for processing claims and paying benefits impose precisely the burden that erisa was intended to avoid.egelhoff egelhoff,d emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted see romney lin,cir basic purpose of erisa preemption is to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.
it is true that this court three most recent cases focus primarily on the relationships among the core erisa entities,and caution against preemption of generally applicable state laws.see stevenson bank of,cir hattem schwarzenegger,cir gerosa savasta,cir.but these cases involve either a state income tax with only indirect economic effects the kind of law travelers expressly permits,see hattem,at,or state law causes of action that have little to do with the conduct of the plan,gerosa,at see also stevenson,at noting that state law suit did not implicate actual administration of the plan.they do not purport to save state laws that subject plans to sets of inconsistent state obligations or that tend to control or supersede central erisa functions.gerosa,at.

we hold that the reporting requirements of the vermont statute and regulation have a connection with erisa plans though no reference to and are therefore preempted as applied.our holding is supported by the principle undisturbed in travelers that reporting is a core erisa function shielded from potentially inconsistent and burdensome state regulation

not every state law imposing a reporting requirement is preempted.burgio and hmi allow a slight reporting burden to be laid on plans,consistent with the preemption rule tolerating laws that create no impediment to an employer adoption of a uniform benefit administration scheme,fort halifax,at,and with too tenuous,remote,or peripheral an effect on employee benefit plans,shaw,at.
but the reporting mandated by the vermont statute and regulation is burdensome,and risky.even considered alone,the vermont scheme triggers preemption considered as one of several or a score of uncoordinated state reporting regimes,it is obviously intolerable.
a quick overview of the reporting system is telling 
plans must periodically report 
medical claims data composed of service level remittance information for all adjudicated claims for each billed service including,but not limited to member demographics,provider information,information,and clinical diagnosis and procedure codes,and includ ing all claims related to behavioral or mental health 
pharmacy claims data containing service level remittance information from all adjudicated claims for each prescription including,but not limited to member demographics,provider information,information,and national drug codes 
member eligibility data containing demographic information for each individual member eligible for medical or pharmacy benefits for one or more days of coverage at any time during the reporting month 
and any other information relating to health care provided to vermont residents and health care provided by vermont health care providers and facilities to both vermont residents and for each health line of business.regulation h.
plans must report their data frequently.thus plans with to covered members must report quarterly and plans with or more covered members must report monthly.see id.compare this to erisa,which requires a single report annually.see.
data must be coded under the appropriate source code system.see regulation h a a.sixteen source code systems are provided,including the admission source code a variety of codes explaining who recommended admission to a medical facility and the international classification of diseases,revision,clinical modification code describes the classification of morbidity and mortality information for statistical purposes and for the indexing of hospital records by disease and operations.id.appendix 
individual data elements,data types,field lengths,field assignments,and mapping locators for each file must conform to specified requirements.id.b.fields include admission hour and discharge hour,thirteen diagnosis fields,three procedure fields,and the drug name and quantity dispensed.id.appendices c e.
t he social security number of the and the subscriber and member names must be encrypted prior to submission by utilizing a standard encryption methodology provided.id.a b.encryption is not required for other data fields.
and nothing prevents the department from changing these myriad requirements from time to time,so long as the department complies with the broad mandate of the statute.
the confidentiality provisions of the vermont scheme are complex but loose,and impair or at least reassign the obligation in the plan documents to keep medical records strictly confidential,as well as the undertaking by blue cross as tpa to use information solely for plan administration purposes and to prevent unauthorized disclosure the regulation specifically contemplates access to health care claims data sets and related information by persons other than the department.id.each data field is classified into one of three use and release categories 
unavailable data elements not available for general use and release.
restricted data elements only available for use and release as part of a limited use research health care claims data set approved by the department.these elements,and information that can be derived from these elements,include the member city and zip code,the admission and discharge dates and hours,and the service provider and pharmacy names.
unrestricted data elements available for general use and public release upon written request.these publicly available elements,and information that can be derived from these elements,include the member gender,age,medical coverage,prescription drug coverage,and diagnosis the type of procedure the service provider speciality and zip code and the name and price of any drugs prescribed.
id.appendices j j.specific as these categories are,they may be illusory,because the department can ease public release restrictions on data that is currently restricted or unavailable,so long as direct personal identifiers are not published and the data is in the department opinion handled in an ethical manner.stat.ann.tit,e f,h d.
since other states can impose their own regimes for reporting and many do these burdens and risks must be multiplied.
the trend toward narrowing erisa preemption does not allow one of erisa core functions reporting to be laden with burdens,subjected to incompatible,multiple and variable demands,and freighted with risk of fines,breach of duty,and legal expense 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse and remand with instructions to enter judgment for liberty mutual.
i respectfully dissent in part and concur in part.
i concur with part i of the discussion section of the majority opinion finding that liberty mutual has standing.for the reasons that follow,i dissent from the majority holding that the vermont statute is preempted by erisa.
the majority finds that the burden imposed by the vermont reporting requirement warrants preemption of the statute.this conclusion falters for two primary reasons.first,the reporting requirement imposed by the vermont statute differs in kind from the reporting that is required by erisa and therefore was not the kind of state law congress intended to preempt.second,liberty mutual has failed to show any actual burden,much less a burden that triggers erisa preemption.rather,the vermont statute,like others we have previously upheld,does not interfere with an erisa plan administration of benefits.for these reasons,our precedent and that of the supreme court do not support the conclusion that the vermont statute reporting requirements pose the sort of threat to the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans that would trigger preemption.state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d hereinafter travelers.
looking at the objectives of erisa and the impact of the vermont statute on erisa plans,as we must in order to determine whether the statute has an improper connection with erisa plans,i conclude that this is not the type of statute that congress intended to preempt.
the preemption clause of the erisa statute provides that,with certain exceptions not relevant here,erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.the supreme court has stated that the basic thrust of the preemption clause was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.travelers,at.does not occur,however,if the state law has only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral connection with covered plans,as is the case with many laws of general applicability.burgio campofelice,state dep t of labor,cir internal quotations marks omitted quoting shaw delta air lines,d.
two kinds of state laws relate to erisa for purposes of preemption those that mandate employee benefit structures or their administration,and those that provide alternative enforcement mechanisms.hmi mech,mcgowan,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.the vermont statute does neither.we have noted that courts are reluctant to find that congress intended to preempt state laws that do not affect the relationships among the core erisa entities beneficiaries,participants,administrators,employers,trustees and other fiduciaries,and the plan itself.gerosa savasta,cir.the vermont statute does not even arguably regulate these relationships.moreover,the vermont statute does not impose regulations on how plans are to be run or how benefits are to be administered.
yet the majority takes up liberty mutual invitation to give the term reporting its broadest meaning,and finds the statute is preempted because reporting is a core erisa function shielded from potentially inconsistent and burdensome state regulation.op.at while it is certainly true that erisa core areas include reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary responsibility,shaw,at,and that state laws that would tend to control or supersede central erisa functions have typically been found to be preempted,gerosa,at,the majority argument misses the nuance of what reporting means in the context of erisa,and ignores the case law focus on whether the administration of benefits to beneficiaries is impacted,an issue on which there is no showing.
traditional state regulation of health care and the presumption against preemption 
the majority finding,hidden in a footnote,that the presumption against preemption does not apply here,flies in the face of clear supreme court precedent instructing us to begin with the presumption that congress does not intend to supplant state law.travelers,at.i n cases like this one where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation,we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.this is because nothing in the language of erisa or the context of its passage indicates that congress chose to displace general health care regulation,which historically has been a matter of local concern.id.at.
the majority nonetheless holds that the presumption against preemption does not apply here because state health data collection laws do not regulate the safe and effective provision of health care services.op.at this contradicts the very supreme court precedent the majority relies upon debuono nysa ila medical and clinical services fund,d.in that case,new york imposed a tax on patient services at various health care providers.at.the court applied the presumption,reasoning that although the new york law was a revenue raising measure,rather than a regulation of hospitals,it clearly operates in a field that has been traditionally occupied by the states.id.at.the court further stated that the fact that the challenged law targets only the health care industry supports the application of the starting presumption against,because the historic police powers of the state include the regulation of matters of health and safety.id.at.debuono is indistinguishable from the case at hand.here,the vermont statute targets only the health care industry and,even if it is not a regulation of health care entities,it certainly operates in the field of health and safety.indeed,the stated purpose of the vermont statute is to help improve health care quality.see.stat.ann.tit.a listing purposes,including improving the quality and affordability of patient health care.there should be no question,therefore,that the presumption applies here.
b.there is no improper connection with erisa plans 
when analyzing whether erisa preempts a state law,we apply the shaw test,as narrowed by travelers presumption against preemption.under that test,we analyze whether a state law has an impermissible connection with or reference to an erisa plan.see,hattem schwartzenegger,cir.despite paying lip service to the shaw test,the majority eschews a full analysis in favor of a talismanic recitation of the word reporting.
i agree with the majority that because the vermont statute requires data collection from entities other than erisa plans,such as hospitals,health insurers,and pharmacy benefit managers,it functions irrespective of the existence of an erisa plan and therefore does not make an improper reference to erisa plans.see cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham constr,d internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.the connection with prong,on which the majority hangs its hat,instructs us to examine both the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive and the effect of the state law on erisa plans.see egelhoff egelhoff ex rel.breiner,d internal quotation marks omitted see also hmi,at analyzing a state law connection with erisa plans requires the courts to consider erisa objectives and the effect of the state law on erisa plans.this analysis leads to the conclusion that the vermont statute is not preempted.
objectives of erisa 
the objectives of the erisa statute are not in dispute.congress enacted erisa in to respond to growing concerns about the risk of employers defaulting on pension plans,which were increasingly widespread but little regulated.see mallory jensen,is erisa preemption superfluous in the new age of health care reform,colum.bus,internal footnotes omitted see also brendan maher and peter stris,erisa and uncertainty,few dispute that the statute was passed,in part,as a response to several pension defaults that arose from company failures that devastated the pensions of many workers.citing wooten,the most glorious story of failure in the business the studebaker packard the origins of erisa,buff.indeed,the statute itself declares that,in passing erisa,congress sought to 
protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries,by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto,by establishing standards of conduct,responsibility,and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans,and by providing for appropriate remedies,sanctions,and ready access to the federal courts.
these objectives are reflected in the erisa reporting and disclosure requirements,which are concerned with the mismanagement of funds and failure to pay employee benefits,and seek information on plan assets or allocation.see requiring publication of annual report to include a financial statement of assets and liabilities,changes in fund balance,disclosures about changes made in the plan,and financial commitments,including loans,leases,and transactions,and an actuarial statement.the plain language of the erisa reporting requirements shows that they are limited to the furnishing of a summary plan description to plan participants and an annual report to the secretary.see.the former is essentially a summary of key plan terms,id,while the latter is concerned with the financial soundness of the plan,id.thus,under erisa,plans must report information that goes to the financial integrity of the plan.
it is important to recognize that,as liberty mutual conceded at oral argument tr.at,the reporting required by erisa is wholly distinct from the reporting sought by vermont.as the majority describes in some depth,the vermont statute seeks information on medical claims data,the services that have been provided to beneficiaries,charges and payments for those services,and demographic information about those receiving the coverage.op.at at bottom,the state seeks to collect the information it needs to fulfill its role of providing health care to its citizens.vermont does not seek information on plan assets,and does not review the allocation or denial of benefits,see reg.h,denied claims shall be excluded from all medical and pharmacy claims file submissions,the topics on which erisa requires reports.indeed,the secretary of labor,who oversees the reporting requirements and is responsible for enforcing and administering title i of erisa,has advised us that the focus and purpose of vermont data collection is different from the reporting requirements in erisa.see amicus secretary of labor br.at.
this contrast between the objectives and reporting requirements of erisa and those of the vermont statute suggests that the vermont statute is not of the type that congress intended to preempt.
effect of the vermont statute on erisa plans 
we look next to the effect of the vermont statute on erisa plans.the vermont statute asks for information which plan administrators,such as blue cross blue shield of massachusetts bcbsma,already have in their possession.see tr.at.indeed,by all accounts bcbsma is happy to provide the data vermont has asked for,and it does so for other clients.because liberty mutual possesses all the information vermont seeks,the only alleged burden here is providing the data to vermont in the requested format.
the majority finds that there is an obvious burden connected with the formats and requirements specified by vermont,although it does not explain exactly how that burden manifests itself.perhaps this is because liberty mutual has failed to provide any details or showing of the alleged burden,arguing only that all regulations have their costs.appellant br.at.see also br.for amicus chamber of commerce at increased steps required by a tpa to fulfill requirements and arguing generally that additional requirements will cost additional money.
in as much as this burden is a financial one,as liberty mutual suggests,we have stated clearly,as has the supreme court,that indirect financial costs from a state law are not a concern unless they preclude uniform administration practice or the provision of a uniform interstate benefit package.travelers,at.indeed,our case law addressing statutes which impose added costs on erisa plans states clearly that an indirect economic impact is sufficient to trigger preemption only if it produce s such acute,albeit indirect,economic effects as to force an erisa plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers.travelers,at see also aetna life ins.borges,cir noting that indirect economic and administrative effects are not substantial enough to persuade us that this is the type of law congress intended to preempt and upholding connecticut escheat law requiring aetna to pay all unclaimed bene
