this is an appeal from an opinion and order denying appellant neftalí soto qualified immunity defense.soto,acting in his capacity as secretary of the department of agriculture of the commonwealth of puerto rico,has been sued in his personal capacity under for enforcing a sugar regulation that prevented appellees,starlight sugar,and pan american grain company,from importing sugar into puerto rico in bulk for packaging in units.we reverse the district court opinion and hold that soto is entitled to qualified immunity.
background 
section vi of market regulation prohibits the importation of sugar into puerto rico for consumer use unless the sugar has been packaged in bags two and bag sizes prior to its arrival in puerto rico in other words,sugar can not be shipped to puerto rico in bulk for packaging in puerto rico.it is undisputed that the effect of this regulation is to prevent sugar intended for consumer use from being brought into puerto rico.
an explanation of the history of the sugar industry in puerto rico is provided in the district court opinion granting a preliminary injunction,starlight sugar,soto,hereinafter starlight sugar i,aff,cir hereinafter starlight sugar ii,and need not be retold here.a summary of the litigation history of market regulation,however,is worth noting.
the prohibition on repackaging imported sugar was first challenged in the puerto rico court system in.while the puerto rico supreme court was considering the issue,a concurrent suit was filed in federal district court in.the district court stayed the proceedings pending a decision by the puerto rico supreme court.on november,the puerto rico supreme court rendered such a decision,upholding regulation against due process and equal protection claims based on the puerto rico constitution.puerto rico sugar garcía,offic.trans.sugar repacker garcía returned to the federal district court seeking relief in that forum.the district court,after dismissing the claims brought under the due process and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution,held that a claim could be maintained under the commerce clause,because such a claim could not have been litigated in the puerto rico courts garcía bauzá salas,under puerto rican law,as espoused by the puerto rico supreme court,the clause is inapplicable to the island.the district court went on to enjoin enforcement of the regulation.id.at.on appeal,this court vacated the injunction,holding that the district court action violated the act,because the order enjoining enforcement of regulation directly conflicted with the injunction affirmed by the puerto rico supreme court barring garcía from repackaging sugar in puerto rico.garcía,cir.
in,appellee pan american grain imported approximately pounds of sugar into puerto rico for consumer repackaging by appellee starlight sugar.pursuant to regulation,the department of agriculture issued a detention order prohibiting appellees from selling the sugar to grocery stores in puerto rico.sued,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as damages,and based their challenge of regulation on the commerce and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution.
the district court granted motion for preliminary injunctive relief,holding that there was a likelihood of success on the merits as to both the commerce clause and equal protection arguments.starlight sugar i.at.the court found that regulation facially discriminates against interstate commerce and that the government had failed to assert a compelling interest sufficient to justify this discriminatory purpose and effect,thus implicating the commerce clause.id.in addition,the district court held that the government had put forth no legitimate government objective for regulation,and that the regulation,therefore,likely violated the equal protection clause.id.
this court affirmed the grant of the preliminary injunction,finding no abuse of discretion and no error of law.starlight sugar ii,at.regarding the likelihood of success on the merits,we note d that commerce clause caselaw strongly supports the position of the plaintiff sugar importers.id.we characterized regulation as facially discriminatory,and thus presumptively invalid.id.
in the most recent development of this case,the district court ruled,in an opinion and order,in favor of motion for summary judgment.starlight sugar,soto,d hereinafter starlight summary judgment.the court affirmed its prior intimations that market regulation violated both the commerce and equal protection clauses.pursuant to this finding,the district court granted injunctive relief against soto.the court next turned to claim for damages against soto in his personal capacity,and,in that context,analyzed soto assertion of qualified immunity.
citing harlow fitzgerald,d,the district court identified a test for determining whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity whether the law was clearly established at the time the action was taken and if so,whether the official knew or reasonably should have known that the action or inaction would violate petitioner constitutional rights.id.at.the district court found that the law was clearly established and that soto knew or should have known that enforcement of market regulation violated constitutional rights.the court called the commerce clause a cornerstone of our economy and our country and was hard pressed to believe that soto,an attorney,would be unaware of the existence of the commerce clause.starlight summary judgment,d at.in a footnote,the court stated,a similar result is found when analyzing the equal protection clause id.at.
appellant soto brings this interlocutory appeal pursuant to,challenging only the district court rejection of his qualified immunity defense.see mitchell forsyth,d.entitlement to the defense of qualified immunity is a question of law subject to de novo review.see,elder holloway,d.accordingly,we proceed to the merits of this appeal.
discussion 
this court has identified a process for evaluating qualified immunity claims whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction and if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative,whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated that clearly established constitutional right.nelson kline,cir ford,cir see wilson layne,d.this particular order of analysis is designed to spare a defendant not only unwarranted liability,but unwarranted demands customarily imposed upon those defending a long lawsuit.wilson,at.quoting siegert gilley,d.addressing the constitutional question first promotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct,to the benefit of both the officers and the general public.id.
the district court held that market regulation violated clearly established commerce clause and equal protection clause caselaw.we will examine both,turning first to the commerce clause claim.
commerce clause analysis 
in explaining dormant commerce clause jurisprudence,the district court quoted the following passage 
this negative aspect of the commerce clause prohibits economic is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors thus,state statutes that clearly discriminate against interstate commerce are routinely struck down unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.
starlight sugar i.at quoting west lynn creamery,healy,d quoting new england of limbach,d.the district court found market regulation to be facially discriminatory,falling within a category of government regulation that the dormant commerce clause renders invalid.the court further held that soto had failed to advance any justification for the repackaging prohibition that did not ultimately amount to economic protectionism id.at see also starlight sugar ii,at.
the commerce clause confer s a right to engage in interstate trade free from restrictive state regulation.dennis higgins,d.we agree with the district court that have identified a deprivation of this constitutional right.the next question to address is whether this right was clearly established at the time of soto enforcement of regulation.we hold that it was not.
citing first circuit precedent,the district court stated that the constraints of the dormant commerce clause apply equally to puerto rico.starlight sugar i.at.in trailer marine transport rivera vázquez,cir,we explicitly considered whether and how the commerce clause constrains legislation and administrative action of puerto rico.id.at.characterizing puerto rico status as unique,we noted that puerto rico has no voting representation in congress,that congress may fashion laws in a manner that treats puerto rico differently from the states,that not all federal constitutional rights apply in puerto rico,and that it has not been determined whether puerto rico is governed by the fifth or by the fourteenth amendment.id.at.nevertheless,we concluded that puerto rico is bound by the dormant commerce clause in the same way that the states are.the commerce clause purposes of foster ing economic integration and prevent ing local interference with the flow of the nation commerce appl y with equal force to official actions of puerto rico.id.at.in addition,we found that puerto rico enjoys sufficient autonomy as an entity to justify treating it as independent of congress and thus subject to dormant commerce clause restraints.id.
the supreme court of puerto rico,we have noted,has taken a different view.id.at.commenting on the scope of the application of the commerce clause to puerto rico,that court said this interstate commerce relation between puerto rico and the united states has constitutionally had,and still has,contours which are different from the relation which under the constitution prevails among states of the union.government of the capital.this amorphous statement eludes concrete interpretation,and the opinion itself fails to further elaborate on how puerto rico relationship with the united states would affect the application of the commerce clause to puerto rico.subsequent decisions by the puerto rico supreme court are similarly unilluminating.see,iberia secretario de hacienda,finding it unnecessary to comment on the applicability of the commerce clause to puerto rico marketing departamento de agricultura,wl deciding that the dormant commerce clause question need not be answered in the course of decision.one interpretation of the language by this court,as illustrated by our comment in trailer marine,and the puerto rico federal district courts is that the dormant commerce clause does not apply to puerto rico.garcía.at,municipality of san juan.in an earlier opinion,however,we rejected an argument that the puerto rico courts were closed to a commerce clause claim,stating that in our view,the position taken by the supreme court of puerto rico in is far more flexible.carrier pérez,cir.
in an effort to clarify how we interpret the puerto rico supreme court position,we offer the following commentary.first,the case offers the only substantive statement on application of the commerce clause to puerto rico by the puerto rico supreme court.it,at minimum,suggested that there could be situations in which the commerce clause would not apply to puerto rico,even though it would constrain a state in comparable circumstances.second,the case was written in,and the relationship between puerto rico and the united states has been refined and clarified since that time.see,examining bd.of eng rs flores de otero,d the purpose of congress in the and legislation was to accord to puerto rico the degree of autonomy and independence normally associated with states.noting that in more recent years puerto rico has acted and been treated more like a state,we overturned our holding in buscaglia ballester,cir,that the dormant commerce clause did not apply to puerto rico.trailer marine,at.the decision relied,at least in part,on buscaglia,at.perhaps recognizing that the status of puerto rico is not as was perceived at the time that was decided,and that the precedential underpinnings for its commerce clause comments have been weakened,the puerto rico supreme court has intimated that the applicability of the dormant commerce clause to puerto rico is an unresolved question.see iberia,at marketing,at.unfortunately,this has not spurred the puerto rico supreme court to address the issue squarely.as a result,we are left with the vague language in that the commerce clause,as applied to puerto rico,has contours which are different from those when applied to the states.at.from this conclusion,we proceed with the qualified immunity analysis.
when determining whether a constitutional right is clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity,state as well as federal,decisions can be considered.see cinelli cutillo,cir citing a massachusetts supreme judicial court opinion at length in concluding that the right was clearly established.the seventh circuit has commented 
state judges like federal judges take an oath to uphold the constitution of the united states,and unlike the converse case of federal judges enforcing state law,where it is accepted that the ultimate authority on questions of state law resides with state rather than federal courts,the federal courts of appeals do not have the ultimate authority to decide issues of federal law.
burgess lowery,cir.in turning to both the state and federal case law in this instance,we find a potential conflict.
in trailer marine,as noted,we held that the dormant commerce clause applies to puerto rico the puerto rico supreme court took a different view in the case.the united states supreme court has anticipated this potential for disagreement each system proceeds independently of the other with ultimate review in this court of the federal questions raised in either system.understandably this dual court system i s bound to lead to conflicts and frictions.atlantic coast line brotherhood of locomotive eng rs,d.
in the past,we have held that a right can be treated as clearly established in this circuit if we have unequivocally identified that right in prior decisions,regardless of supreme court silence on the subject or a lack of unanimity among the circuits.newman massachusetts,cir.however,newman did not address whether a right could be considered clearly established in a case such as this,where there is arguably contrary authority from the highest court of a state within the first circuit.this distinct circumstance necessarily impacts our view on whether a right is clearly established.
the seventh circuit has stated that an official should not be shielded by the defense of qualified immunity simply because there is one contrary decision at either the federal court of appeals or the state supreme court level.burgess,at involving the constitutionality of strip searching prison visitors without reasonable suspicion.again,the precedent under examination in burgess may be distinguished,as the only conflicting authority came from a state court in another circuit,the supreme court of hawaii.because neither burgess nor newman dealt with conflicting precedent from a state within the circuit,much less conflicting precedent from the state in which the alleged constitutional violation occurred,our reliance on them for guidance in our assessment of qualified immunity in this case is necessarily circumspect.
we conclude that the applicability of the dormant commerce clause to puerto rico is disputed,and,thus,appellees attendant constitutional right is not clearly established our holding is consistent with and respects the role of state systems in identifying and defining federal constitutional rights on a parallel basis with the federal courts with ultimate supervisory authority to harmonize any potential conflicts residing in the united states supreme court soto is,therefore,protected by the qualified immunity defense as far as the commerce clause challenge is concerned.
