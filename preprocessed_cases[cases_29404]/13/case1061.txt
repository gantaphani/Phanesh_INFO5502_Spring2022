sec enforcement actions and settlements 
in,the sec alleged that the specialist firms had used two manipulative tactics interpositioning and trading ahead.both interpositioning and trading ahead involve a specialist firm trading as a principal even though such trading is unnecessary to maintain a fair and orderly market because there are customers who are prepared to trade with each other.interpositioning refers to the practice of capturing the spread between a buy order and sell order.for example,if one customer has placed an order indicating her willingness to sell a security for,and another customer has placed an order indicating his willingness to buy the security for,the specialist firm should see both orders on the display book for the security and match them,allowing the former customer to sell to the latter at a price of either or.the specialist firm could engage in interpositioning by purchasing the security for its own account for from the former customer and selling the security from its own account to the latter customer for.by standing between the two customers,the specialist firm would reap a profit on the trade.
trading ahead refers to the practice of executing proprietary trades ahead of the trades ordered by customers.for example,the specialist firm might use its unique access to customers orders to determine whether the price of a security is trending up or down.if the specialist firm found that the price of the security would fall,the specialist firm could use this knowledge to reap a profit by trading ahead of the sell orders.it would do this by failing to match the buy and sell orders in the display book,and instead satisfying the buy orders by selling the security out of the specialist firm own inventory.the specialist firm would then wait for the security price to fall before replenishing its inventory by satisfying the sell orders.this would allow the specialist firm to transfer the negative impact of the decline from itself to the customers who had sought to sell.similarly,if the specialist firm found that the price of the security would rise,it could trade ahead of the customers who had sought to buy by purchasing for its own account,waiting for the price increase,then satisfying the customer buy orders by selling from its own inventory.this would allow the specialist firm to capture a price increase that would otherwise accrue to the customers who had sought to buy.
the sec alleged that the specialist firms had engaged in unlawful interpositioning or trading ahead in a specific set of trades.in order to identify these trades,the sec used an algorithm that identified situations in which a specialist firm had traded for its own account even though a buy order and a matching sell order appeared on the display book.however,the sec recognized that its algorithm could generate false positives.a system error or a delay could prevent a specialist firm from recognizing the match,or the specialist firm might have orally executed the trade involving the matching orders.in order to screen out false positives to match orders,the sec excluded instances in which the orders appeared on the display book for less than ten seconds.
the trades in which matching orders sat unexecuted for ten seconds or more the covered transactions were subject to the sec enforcement action against the specialist firms.in the aggregate,these million transactions resulted in profits to the specialist firms of million.through settlements with the sec in march and july of the settlement orders,the specialist firms agreed to disgorge these million in profits,and to pay additional civil penalties of million.the settlement orders also provided that the disgorgement and civil penalties would be deposited in fair funds for distribution according to a plan drawn up by an administrator.each settlement order provided that the fair fund it created would be used i to pay for the costs of administering the distribution plan ii to reimburse injured customers for their loss and iii pay prejudgment interest to injured customers.the sec shall determine the appropriate use for the benefit of investors of any funds left in the distribution fund following such payments.under no circumstances shall any part of the fair fund be returned to the specialist firms.
the sec established the fair funds in october of,and appointed the firm of heffler,radetich saitta heffler as administrator.in order to distribute funds to the injured customers,heffler began tracing the covered transactions by working with clearing firms.clearing firms process the final stages of a securities transaction,including delivery.in many instances,the clearing firm could only identify the brokers involved in a transaction,and many of the brokers involved had either destroyed their records or ceased to exist.at the end of this process,heffler was able to match customers for of the covered transactions.million remained in the fair funds because heffler was unable to match a customer to the remaining of the covered transactions,and because many of the customers identified either could not be located or failed to cash checks mailed to them.
empire programs,was identified as a customer in certain covered transactions,and has received a distribution compensating it for losses it suffered in connection with those transactions.
ii.private class action
