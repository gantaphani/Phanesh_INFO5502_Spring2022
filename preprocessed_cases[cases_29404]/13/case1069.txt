in the early morning hours of march,petitioner pedro estanislado pretzantzin estanislado pretzantzin awoke to a loud banging he opened his bedroom window to see a group of armed,uniformed officers at his apartment building front door in jamaica,new york the officers were from the department of homeland security dhs and worked for immigrations and customs enforcement ice.estanislado pretzantzin shared the apartment with members of his extended family,including petitioners jose matias pretzantzin,pacheco pretzantzin,pedro pacheco lopez pacheco lopez,and juan miguel pretzantlin yax through the open window,the officers informed estanislado pretzantzin that they were the police and ordered him downstairs to open the door.estanislado pretzantzin complied.
after confirming that he lived on the third floor,one of the officers led estanislado pretzantzin back upstairs and ordered him to allow the other officers inside.at no point during the encounter did the officers explain their presence,present a warrant,or request consent to enter the apartment.once inside,ice officers rounded up the remaining petitioners,who were asleep in their beds,assembled them in the living room,and demanded to see their papers.it appears that only pacheco lopez the sole petitioner who had a passport was able to comply with the officers directive.the officers did not ask estanislado pretzantzin whether he had legal status in the united states before arresting him.
all petitioners were handcuffed and transported to ice facilities at federal plaza,in new york city,where they were notified for the first time that they were in the custody of immigration officials.ice officers interviewed petitioners and told them to sign statements that were not read to them in english which petitioners speak minimally if at all these statements were subsequently memorialized on form i record of alien.petitioners were released from custody later that afternoon and served with notices to appear,charging them with removability under immigration and nationality act ina a a i,a a i,as natives and citizens of guatemala who had entered the united states without inspection.
following consolidation of their proceedings,petitioners appeared before immigration judge george chew the ij and conceded that they were the individuals named in the notices to appear,but denied the charges of removability and moved to suppress the evidence against them and terminate their proceedings.petitioners argued that they were entitled to the suppression of all statements and evidence obtained as a consequence of the nighttime,warrantless raid of their home under the fourth and fifth amendments.in opposition,the government argued,inter alia,that it possessed independent evidence of petitioners alienage.specifically,the government claimed that it had obtained petitioners guatemalan birth certificates from the united states embassy in guatemala using petitioners names,and that it also had petitioner pacheco lopez criminal history report,arrest record,and fingerprint card from a theft of services conviction for jumping.the arrest report listed guatemala as pachecolopez birthplace.
the government ostensibly relied on the admission in petitioners motion to suppress indicating that petitioners were related and pacheco lopez arrest records confirming that he was born in guatemala to target the united states embassy in guatemala for the birth certificate request.in connection with petitioners birth certificates,the government proffered a federal express delivery record label for a package sent from ice facilities at federal plaza to the united states embassy in guatemala,but it did not submit a copy of the actual birth certificate request or any other evidence bearing on the package contents.following petitioners testimony at a subsequent suppression hearing the ij invited the government to proffer a warrant,statements from the officers,or any other evidence to justify their intrusion into petitioners home.the government,however,declined to do so and explicitly disavowed any reliance on petitioners form i,choosing to rely instead on petitioners birth certificates and pacheco lopez arrest records as the sole evidence of alienage.
in june,the ij granted petitioners motion to suppress the government evidence of alienage and terminate the proceedings,finding that the nighttime,warrantless entry into their home and resulting arrests constituted an egregious violation of petitioners fourth and fifth amendment rights.having found petitioners testimony and supporting affidavits sufficient to establish a prima facie case for suppression,the ij reasoned that the government failure to offer any justification for the conduct of its agents resolved the issue in petitioners favor.the ij also rejected the government contention that petitioners birth certificates and pacheco lopez arrest records constituted independent evidence of alienage,finding that this evidence could only have been obtained through the use of evidence illegally procured as a result of the raid of petitioners home,namely,pacheco lopez passport and petitioners statements.
the government appealed.in a december,order,the bia vacated the ij decision.in re jose matias pretzantizin,et,nos.relying on ins lopez mendoza,for the proposition that identity is never suppressible as the fruit of an unlawful arrest,the bia found that it need not determine whether petitioners suffered an egregious violation of their constitutional rights because their birth certificates and pacheco lopez arrest records were obtained after the government had determined their identities.the bia explained that petitioners birth certificates were obtained from guatemalan authorities using petitioners insuppressible identities the bia offered no similar justification for the independence of pacheco lopez arrest records.lastly,although the government had expressly declined to rely on petitioners form i before the ij,the bia found this evidence admissible because petitioners had not argued that their statements were untrue or unreliable.in re pretzantizin,at.
petitioners were subsequently ordered removed to guatemala and have timely petitioned for review.
the general rule in a criminal proceeding is that statements and other evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful,warrantless arrest are suppressible if the link between the evidence and the unlawful conduct is not too attenuated.lopez mendoza,at citing wong sun united states.t he exclusionary sanction applies to any fruits of a constitutional violation whether such evidence be tangible,physical material actually seized in an illegal search,items observed or words overheard in the course of the unlawful activity,or confessions or statements of the accused obtained during an illegal arrest and detention.united states crews,internal citations omitted.outside of the criminal context,however,the applicability of the exclusionary rule becomes less certain.lopez mendoza,at.
in lopez mendoza,the supreme court held that a fourth amendment violation does not,standing alone,justify the suppression of evidence in the course of a civil deportation proceeding,id.at this court has since interpreted lopez mendoza to allow suppression following an egregious violation,see almeida amaral gonzalez,cir.today,as discussed in a companion case argued in tandem with the case at bar,doroteo sicajau cotzojay holder,ag,cir,we confirm what the bia and other courts have already recognized a nighttime,warrantless raid of a person home by government officials may,and frequently will,constitute an egregious violation of the fourth amendment requiring the application of the exclusionary rule in a civil deportation hearing.see matter of guevara mata,no.june,oliva ramos att y of,cir.
in the instant case,the bia did not reach the question of whether there was an egregious violation of the fourth amendment,but instead predicated its reversal of the ij grant of suppression on a finding that petitioners birth certificates and pacheco lopez arrest records were independently obtained through the use of only their names.to reach this result,the bia relied on lopez mendoza statement that t he body or identity of a defendant or respondent in a criminal or civil proceeding is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest,at flopez mendoza identity statement.the task then is to discern the meaning of this statement that has bedeviled and divided our sister circuits.united states oscar torres,cir for the reasons that follow,we join the fourth,eighth,and tenth circuits in finding that lopez mendoza reaffirmed a rule of personal jurisdiction it did not create an evidentiary rule insulating specific pieces of evidence from suppression.
ins lopez mendoza 
the jurisdictional nature of lopez mendoza identity statement is evidenced by both the context in which it was made and the authority upon which it relied.in lopez mendoza,the supreme court reviewed challenges in two civil deportation proceedings,each of which were commenced following unlawful arrests.at.in the first proceeding,respondent adan lopez mendoza did not seek suppression of any specific piece of evidence and,instead,objected only to the fact that he had been summoned to a deportation hearing following an unlawful arrest.id.at.the supreme court easily dispensed with lopez mendoza challenge to the validity of the proceedings against him because t he mere fact of an illegal arrest has no bearing on a subsequent deportation proceeding.id.alteration in original and internal quotation marks omitted.it was in this context that the supreme court stated that t he body or identity of a defendant or respondent in a criminal or civil proceeding is never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest,even if it is conceded that an unlawful arrest,search,or interrogation occurred.id.at citations omitted.
in the second proceeding,respondent elias sandoval sanchez moved to suppress his form i record of alien,which memorialized incriminating statements relating to his immigration status and place of birth.id.at,lopez mendoza ins,cir,rev.the court observed that sandoval sanchez had a more substantial claim because h e objected not to his compelled presence at a deportation proceeding,but to evidence offered at that proceeding.at.accordingly,the court considered whether the exclusionary rule should apply to prohibit the government from using illegally obtained evidence of sandoval sanchez alienage against him in deportation proceedings.id.at.the court ultimately found the exclusionary rule inapplicable in sandoval sanchez case after weighing the likely social benefits and costs pursuant to the framework established in united states janis.lopez mendoza,at.
the court differing treatment of lopez mendoza personal jurisdiction challenge and sandoval sanchez evidentiary challenge,and the corresponding omission of any considerations from the evaluation of the latter claim,show that lopez mendoza identity statement merely confirmed the jurisdictional rule that an unlawful arrest has no bearing on the validity of a subsequent proceeding the court did not announce a new rule insulating all evidence from suppression.see oscar torres,at united states olivares rangel,cir united states guevara martinez,cir.after all,if lopez mendoza identity statement applicable to both criminal and civil proceedings,at was intended as a rule of evidence,it would have been impracticable for the court to employ a analysis in deciding whether to apply the exclusionary rule to sandoval sanchez civil deportation proceedings without first determining whether the statements he sought to suppress were evidence.
the jurisdictional nature of lopez mendoza identity statement is further evidenced by the authorities it employed,which relate to the ker frisbie doctrine providing that an illegal arrest does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over the defendant or otherwise preclude trial.see id.at citing,inter alia,frisbie collins,and gerstein pugh,see also olivares rangel,at recognizing lopez mendoza identity statement as an application of the ker frisbie doctrine accord oscar torres,at.in ker illinois,the supreme court first considered the effect of an unlawful taking of custody on the validity of a subsequent proceeding the court concluded that due process was not violated when a defendant was kidnaped in peru and forcibly returned to illinois to stand trial.due process did not restrict the methods employed to bring the defendant before the court it governed what happened once he was there.the court reasoned that due process is complied with when the party is regularly indicted by the proper grand jury in the state court,has a trial according to the forms and modes prescribed for such trials,and when,in that trial and proceedings,he is deprived of no rights to which he is lawfully entitled.id.at.
more than sixty years later,in frisbie,the supreme court refused to depart from ker when faced with a due process challenge by a defendant who was abducted in illinois and taken to michigan for trial,noting that t here is nothing in the constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty person rightfully convicted to escape justice because he was brought to trial against his will.at see also gerstein,at declining to retreat from the established rule that illegal arrest or detention does not void a subsequent conviction.lopez mendoza reliance on the ker frisbie line of authority in support of its identity statement leaves no doubt that the court was referencing the jurisdictional rule that an unlawful arrest has no bearing on the validity of a subsequent proceeding rather than announcing a new rule insulating all evidence from suppression.
contemporary case law confirms our view.a jurisdictional reading of lopez mendoza identity statement is compelled by the supreme court recent decision in maryland king.in king,the supreme court examined the inventory or booking search exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement and found that a criminal defendant was not subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure when a sample of his dna was taken,pursuant to the maryland dna collection act,following a lawful arrest for a serious offense that was supported by probable cause.id.at.in reaching this result,the court identified the legitimate government interest served by maryland dna collection act as the need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process and identify the persons and possessions they must take into custody,id.at,and concluded that w hen probable cause exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society and hold him in legal custody,dna identification plays a critical role in serving those interests,id.at.importantly,we note that the inventory or booking search exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement is not implicated on the facts of the case at bar because,unlike in king,petitioners were not subjected to lawful arrests based on probable cause.indeed,here the ij explicitly found that petitioners arrests constituted unlawful seizures under the fourth amendment 
still,we find king description of evidence telling.in finding that name alone can not address the government interest in identity,the court noted that other relevant forms of identification include fingerprints,name,alias,date and time of previous convictions and the name then used,photograph,social security number,or dna profile.id.at.this broad concept of identity,when read in conjunction with the government proffered interpretation of lopez mendoza identity statement as precluding the suppression of all evidence,would render the inventory or booking search exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement superfluous.after all,if dna is evidence,and lopez mendoza precludes the suppression of all evidence,then why bother to couch maryland dna collection act within the booking exception at all and if evidence includes fingerprints,and lopez mendoza precludes the suppression of all evidence,then what are we to make of controlling precedent mandating the suppression of this insuppressible evidence see,e,hayes florida,holding fingerprints properly suppressed when defendant was arrested without probable cause,taken to police station without consent,and detained and fingerprinted for investigatory
