statement of the case 
statutory background 
in july,in response to the national housing and economic crisis,congress passed the housing and economic recovery act of hera.see,stat.congress enacted hera because it was concerned about the financial condition of fannie mae,freddie mac,and other entities gses.hence,congress created fhfa as an independent agency of the federal government,a,and conferred upon fhfa broad power to appoint itself conservator or receiver of the gses,id.a,and to take such action as may be necessary to put the gses in a sound and solvent condition and.appropriate to carry on the business of the gses and preserve and conserve their assets and property,id.b d.congress specifically authorized fhfa,as conservator or receiver,to collect all obligations and money due the gses.id.b b ii.
hera set forth provisions governing the limitations period for actions brought by fhfa as conservator or receiver.section b of hera the extender statute provides 
a in general 
notwithstanding any provision of any contract,the applicable statute of limitations with regard to any action brought by the agency as conservator or receiver shall be 
i in the case of any contract claim,the longer of 
i the year period beginning on the date on which the claim accrues or 
ii the period applicable under state law and 
ii in the case of any tort claim,the longer of 
i the year period beginning on the date on which the claim accrues or 
ii the period applicable under state law.
b determination of the date on which a claim accrues 
for purposes of subparagraph a,the date on which the statute of limitations begins to run on any claim described in such subparagraph shall be the later of 
i the date of the appointment of the agency as conservator or receiver or 
ii the date on which the cause of action accrues.
on july,as hera was signed into law,congress appointed james lockhart iii acting director of fhfa.lockhart had previously been nominated by president bush and confirmed by the senate as director of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo of the department of housing and urban development.on august,after lockhart resigned his position from fhfa,president obama designated edward demarco who was then deputy director of fhfa as its acting director,effective september.
b.the facts 
as relevant to this appeal,the allegations of the second amended complaint are assumed to be true and may be summarized as follows 
from september through august,fannie mae and freddie mac purchased billion in residential securities sponsored or underwritten by ubs.they did so in reliance on certain false and misleading statements contained in the offering documents.in particular,ubs represented to potential investors that the mortgage loans serving as collateral for the securitizations were underwritten in accordance with established guidelines to ensure that borrowers could meet their payment obligations,and ubs provided statistical material relating to the likelihood that underlying mortgage loans would be repaid.these representations were false.as a consequence of their reliance on these representations,fannie mae and freddie mac sustained massive losses.
acting director lockhart appointed fhfa conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac on september.
c.the proceedings below 
on july,more than three years after the last of the securities offerings in question but within three years of fhfa appointment as conservator,fhfa commenced this action below.it did so at the direction of acting director demarco.
on september,fhfa filed some seventeen other similar actions against other financial institutions.sixteen of these actions were assigned to judge cote in the southern district of new york as related to this case,but one was subsequently transferred to the central district of california.the seventeenth case was filed in the district of connecticut.
the second amended complaint asserted claims under,a,and of the securities act of the securities act,a,and the virginia securities act,ann.a ii and the district of columbia securities act,a b,c.the second amended complaint also asserted a common law claim for negligent misrepresentation.defendants moved to dismiss,contending,inter alia,that the securities claims were,fhfa had no standing to pursue the action because its director had not been constitutionally appointed,and the negligent misrepresentation claim failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
on may,in a thorough and carefully considered opinion and order,the district court denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the statutory claims and granted it only with respect to the negligent misrepresentation claim.see fhfa ubs americas,d.by order entered june,the district court certified an interlocutory appeal from its may opinion and order.on august,we granted ubs petition for interlocutory appeal.
discussion 
on this appeal from the district court ruling on a motion to dismiss,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,accepting the factual allegations of the second amended complaint as true.see commack self serv.kosher meats,hooker,cir.
two issues are presented first,the timeliness of this action,and,second,fhfa standing to bring this suit.
timeliness 
the principal question is whether fhfa claims under the securities act and the virginia and blue sky laws are governed by hera extender statute,including,in particular,the provision extending the statute of limitations for tort claims to the period after the appointment of fhfa as conservator or receiver.b.ubs argues that hera extender statute applies only to statutes of limitations and not to statutes of repose the securities act and the virginia and blue sky laws are governed by statutes of repose,which are separate and distinct from statutes of limitations and the applicable statutes of repose all expired prior to the commencement of suit in the district court.
applicable law 
statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are often confused,though they are distinct.ma merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.statutes of limitations limit the availability of remedies and,accordingly,may be subject to equitable considerations,such as tolling,or a discovery rule.see stolz family daum,cir.in contrast,statutes of repose affect the underlying right,not just the remedy,and thus they run without interruption once the necessary triggering event has occurred,even if equitable considerations would warrant tolling or even if the plaintiff has not yet,or could not yet have,discovered that she has a cause of action.id.at.in fact,a statute of repose may bar a claim even before the plaintiff suffers injury,leaving her without any remedy.see id.at accord stuart am.cyanamid,cir.
as ubs correctly notes,we have characterized the statute of limitations in of the securities act as a statute of repose.stolz,at see also lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d referring to year period of repose in securities act and exchange act ubs also argues,and we assume without deciding the question,that the limitations provisions of the virginia and blue sky laws are also statutes of repose.the question thus is whether the words the applicable statute of limitations in b of hera refer only to statutes of limitations and not to statutes of repose.
in construing a statute,we begin with the plain language,givin
