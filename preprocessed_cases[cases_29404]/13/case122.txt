when petitioners filed for chapter bankruptcy,they sought to exclude roughly in an inherited individual retirement account ira from the bankruptcy estate using the retirement funds exemption.see b c.the bankruptcy court concluded that an inherited ira does not share the same characteristics as a traditional ira and disallowed the exemption.the district court reversed,explaining that the exemption covers any account in which the funds were originally accumulated for retirement purposes.the seventh circuit disagreed and reversed the district court.
held funds held in inherited iras are not retirement funds within the meaning of b c.
a the ordinary meaning of retirement funds is properly understood to be sums of money set aside for the day an individual stops working.three legal characteristics of inherited iras provide objective evidence that they do not contain such funds.first,the holder of an inherited ira may never invest additional money in the account.d.second,holders of inherited iras are required to withdraw money from the accounts,no matter how far they are from retirement.a,a b.finally,the holder of an inherited ira may withdraw the entire balance of the account at any time and use it for any purpose without penalty.
b this reading is consistent with the purpose of the bankruptcy code exemption provisions,which effectuate a careful balance between the creditor interest in recovering assets and the debtor interest in protecting essential needs.allowing debtors to protect funds in traditional and roth iras ensures that debtors will be able to meet their basic needs during their retirement years.by contrast,nothing about an inherited ira legal characteristics prevent or discourage an individual from using the entire balance immediately after bankruptcy for purposes of current consumption.the retirement funds exemption should not be read in a manner that would convert the bankruptcy objective of protecting debtors basic needs into a free pass,schwab reilly.
c petitioners counterarguments do not overcome the statute text and purpose.their claim that funds in an inherited ira are retirement funds because,at some point,they were set aside for retirement,conflicts with ordinary usage and would render the term retirement funds,as used in b c,superfluous.congress could have achieved the exact same result without specifying the funds as retirement funds.and the absence of the phrase debtor interest,which appears in many other exemptions,does not indicate that b c covers funds intended for someone else retirement.where used,that phrase works to limit the value of the asset that the debtor may exempt from her estate,not to distinguish between a debtor assets and the assets of another.also unpersuasive is petitioners argument that b c sentence structure,a broad category,here,retirement funds,followed by limiting language,here,to the extent that prevents the broad category from performing any independent limiting work.this is not the only way in which the phrase to the extent that may be read,and this argument reintroduces the problem that makes the term retirement funds superfluous.finally,the possibility that an account holder can leave an inherited ira intact until retirement and take only the required minimum distributions does not mean that an inherited ira bears the legal characteristics of retirement funds.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
when an individual files for bankruptcy,she may exempt particular categories of assets from the bankruptcy estate.one such category includes certain retirement funds.b c.the question presented is whether funds contained in an inherited individual retirement account ira qualify as retirement funds within the meaning of this bankruptcy exemption.we hold that they do not.
when an individual debtor files a bankruptcy petition,her legal or equitable interests in property become part of the bankruptcy estate.a.to help the debtor obtain a fresh start,however,the bankruptcy code allows debtors to exempt from the estate limited interests in certain kinds of property.rousey jacoway.the exemption at issue in this case allows debtors to protect retirement funds to the extent those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section,or a of the internal revenue code.b c,d the enumerated sections of the internal revenue code cover many types of accounts,three of which are relevant here.
the first two are traditional and roth iras,which are created by and,respectively.both types of accounts offer tax advantages to encourage individuals to save for retirement.qualified contributions to traditional iras,for example,are.a.roth iras offer the opposite benefit although contributions are not,qualified distributions are.c,d.to ensure that both types of iras are used for retirement purposes and not as general savings vehicles,congress made certain withdrawals from both types of accounts subject to a percent penalty if taken before an accountholder reaches the age of.see t see also,infra.
the third type of account relevant here is an inherited ira.an inherited ira is a traditional or roth ira that has been inherited after its owner death.see d c ii,a.if the heir is the owner spouse,as is often the case,the spouse has a choice he or she may roll over the ira funds into his or her own ira,or he or she may keep the ira as an inherited ira subject to the rules discussed below.see internal revenue service,publication individual retirement arrangements iras.when anyone other than the owner spouse inherits the ira,he or she may not roll over the funds the only option is to hold the ira as an inherited account.
inherited iras do not operate like ordinary iras.unlike with a traditional or roth ira,an individual may withdraw funds from an inherited ira at any time,without paying a tax penalty.t a ii.indeed,the owner of an inherited ira not only may but must withdraw its funds the owner must either withdraw the entire balance in the account within five years of the original owner death or take minimum distributions on an annual basis.see a,a b cfr and a incorporating a and a see generally cartano,taxation of individual retirement accounts a.and unlike with a traditional or roth ira,the owner of an inherited ira may never make contributions to the account.d.
in,ruth heffron established a traditional ira and named her daughter,heidi,as the sole beneficiary of the account.when heffron died in,her ira which was then worth just over passed to her daughter and became an inherited ira.elected to take monthly distributions from the account.
in october,and her husband,petitioners in this court,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.they identified the inherited ira,by then worth roughly,as exempt from the bankruptcy estate under b c.respondents,the bankruptcy trustee and unsecured creditors of the estate,objected to the claimed exemption on the ground that the funds in the inherited ira were not retirement funds within the meaning of the statute.
the bankruptcy court agreed,disallowing the exemption.in re clark,wd.relying on the plain language of b c,the court concluded that an inherited ira does not contain anyone retirement funds,because unlike with a traditional ira,the funds are not segregated to meet the needs of,nor distributed on the occasion of,any person retirement.at the district court reversed,explaining that the exemption covers any account containing funds originally accumulated for retirement purposes.in re clark,wd.the seventh circuit reversed the district court judgment.in re clark.pointing to the d ifferent rules govern ing inh
