this appeal arises out of the refusal by the united states department of housing and urban development hud to authorize reimbursement of the defense costs of plaintiff richard guertin,who in was corporation counsel for the city of middletown,new york.guertin incurred these costs successfully defending criminal charges stemming from a series of transactions that involved middletown use of funds it received from hud.invoking the administrative procedure act,the apa,and his due process and equal protection rights under the united states constitution,guertin sought an order in the district court for the southern district of new york kenneth karas,overturning hud decision.the district court affirmed hud decision.we reverse and order hud to authorize reimbursement.
background 
between and,the city of middletown received funds under hud community development block grant cdbg program,which provides federal grants to local governments to promote the the development of viable urban communities.c.congress delegated the administration of the cdbg program,including the actual expenditure of federal funds,to the grant recipients.see dixson united states.as corporation counsel for the city of middletown,guertin had oversight responsibilities of cdbg fund expenditures.
on august,new york state indicted guertin along with middletown mayor joseph destefano and middletown community development director neil novesky on a variety of charges tied to the alleged misuse of cdbg funds.the essence of these allegations was that,as corporation counsel,guertin had conspired with destefano and novesky in an illegal scheme by which mayor destefano had personally benefitted from the loans made from cdbg funds.following a bench trial,plaintiff,destefano and novesky were found not guilty of all charges against them 
in rendering the bench verdict,the trial judge found that novesky simply did his job as director of the office of economic and community development,and that there was no credible evidence that he was involved in any illegal scheme.verdict transcript,joint app x.with regard to mayor destefano,the judge found one of the eight loans from cdbg funds to be troubling.id.at.although a had originally sought the loan to renovate a building,the loan constituted an indirect pecuniary benefit to destefano and created a prohibited conflict.id.at.the judge,however,found that destefano had not acted with the mens rea mandated by new york conflict of interest statute which requires,in addition to illegality,some evil purpose or plan.
of relevance to this appeal,the judge found that guertin had negotiated this prohibited transaction ostensibly in his private capacity as destefano private lawyer.id.at.but because there was no evidence that guertin was seen in contact or consult or conversation with either of his two at any time,id.at,the judge found that guertin involvement did not amount to participation in a criminal conspiracy.the judge stated that,like it or not,attorney guertin did wear two hats.and in his zeal to represent his private client destefano,he was blinded to his obligation to the city of middletown and he should have exercised more due care so guertin did his job as attorney for a private citizen,destefano.perhaps he did do his job quite as well as corporate counsel for the city of middletown.id.at.
following his acquittal,novesky attorney asked hud if federal regulations allowed middletown to reimburse novesky from cdbg funds for the legal fees he had incurred in defending against the criminal charges.hud concluded that reimbursement of novesky legal fees from cdbg funds was permitted because the proceedings resulted from actions undertaken in the ordinary course of novesky employment and because the legal expenses were incurred pursuant to the administration of the cdbg program.letter from hud associate general counsel to novesky attorney,joint app x.
naturally,guertin and mayor destefano then sought hud approval for reimbursement of their legal fees from hud funds,but elton lester,hud associate general counsel,denied their requests.whereas novesky actions had been undertaken in the ordinary course of the employee position,in his letter denying reimbursement,lester stated that the actions of guertin and mayor destefano that had led to their prosecution were of a personal nature,letter from hud associate general counsel to guertin attorney,joint app x.in hud view,legal expenses arising from a mayor private business dealings,as well as those arising from advising the mayor on such matters,are not required in the city administration of the cdbg program,and,therefore,are not reimbursable.id.
after unsuccessful attempts to get hud to reconsider its decision,guertin filed an action in the district court alleging,among other things,that hud decision to deny reimbursement was impermissibly arbitrary and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the fifth amendment.the parties for summary judgment and,based on the undisputed administrative record,the district court granted the government motion,and denied guertin.see guertin united states,d.
this appeal followed.

the apa limits judicial review of agency action.as relevant to this dispute,the apa provides that a reviewing court shall only hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.under this deferential standard of review,we must assess,among other matters,whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.bechtel admin.review,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in doing so,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the agency however the record must show that the agency examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.natural res.defense council,envtl.prot.agency,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.an agency decision will thus only be set aside if it has relied on factors which congress had not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.bechtel,at quoting of home builders defenders of wildlife.
as relevant here,the cdbg program was created by statute in as part of an effort to promote the development of viable urban communities,by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities,principally for persons of low and moderate income.c.the municipal grantee of cdbg funds is largely in control of disbursement.while this control is extensive,it is not unlimited.the statute provides that permissible expenditures include the payment of reasonable administrative costs related to establishing and administering federally approved enterprise zones and payment of reasonable administrative costs and carrying charges related to the planning and execution of community development and housing activities.id.
