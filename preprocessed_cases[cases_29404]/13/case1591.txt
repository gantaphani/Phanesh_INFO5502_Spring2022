this appeal requires us to decide whether a state regulation of residential real estate solicitations by licensed real estate salespersons violates their free speech rights under the first amendment.alexander treadwell,new york secretary of state,appeals from the june,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york thomas platt,district judge,granting summary judgment to patricia anderson,michael hosein,and stephen parker,real estate sales licensees,who challenged the constitutionality of real prop.law mckinney on its face and as applied,and regulations promulgated under the statute.the district court ruled unconstitutional subsection and the regulations establishing zones in which homeowners can elect not to receive real estate solicitations.judge platt concluded that the regulatory scheme lacked a reasonable fit between the state alleged interest in homeowner privacy and the means chosen to serve that interest.for the reasons stated below,we reject the appellees constitutional challenges and therefore reverse.
background 
new york human rights law outlaws blockbusting the practice of soliciting real estate sales and listings by representing that a change in the racial,ethnic,or religious character of a block,neighborhood,or area is underway as we have previously recognized,i n its most systematic and crudest form,blockbusting entails the churning of a local real estate market,a practice in which real estate brokers engage in frenzied solicitation practices that prey upon the racial and ethnic fears of persons residing in transitional neighborhoods as a means for increasing the volume of residential real estate transactions.while realtors gain the benefit of the commissions generated by the increase in sales,homeowners and communities suffer the detriment of declining property values and neighborhood instability brought on by panic selling,the fanning of racial tensions and promoting of ethnic stereotypes.new york state association of realtors,shaffer,cir nysar.nysar thus recognized that blockbusting is not only the solicitation of homeowners to sell their homes out of fear of changing neighborhood demographics but also the harmful effects that result when such solicitations precipitate home sales.
in,in an effort to enforce its ban on blockbusting,the new york state legislature enacted real property law.as enacted,subsection allows the secretary of state to find,after public hearing and investigation,that a defined geographic area is subject to blockbusting,and to adopt a nonsolicitation order forbidding all solicitations of residential real estate listings or sales from any homeowner within that zone.subsection authorizes the secretary,upon finding a pattern of intense and repeated solicitations within a defined geographic area,to establish zones,within which real estate licensees are forbidden from directing solicitations to homeowners who have registered in advance with the secretary of state their wish not to receive such solicitations.
in,the new york state association of realtors challenged the nonsolicitation orders on first amendment grounds,and this court,applying the test for commercial speech,ruled the nonsolicitation regulation promulgated pursuant to subsection invalid because the secretary had failed to provide direct and concrete evidence of the harm that was alleged to justify the restriction.see nysar,at.accordingly,the court concluded that the secretary had failed to establish a reasonable fit between the degree of the harm and the scope of the restriction.see id.at.
under subsection the secretary can create zones in those areas where he determines that owners of residential real estate property are subject to intense and repeated solicitations by real estate brokers to place their property for sale.in these zones,real estate licensees are prohibited from soliciting a listing from any owner who has filed a statement with the secretary of state expressing the wish not to be solicited,and whose name appears on the list.a rule establishing such a zone is effective for five years,after which the secretary can the rule or it will expire.
current regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection establish five zones,and delineate their boundaries.regs.tit,c.the regulations prohibit a real estate licensee from solicit ing the sale,lease or the listing for sale or lease of residential property from an owner in the zone who has signed onto the list.id.c.solicitation is defined as an attempt to purchase or rent or an attempt to obtain a listing of property for sale,for rent or for purchase,and the solicitation ban extends to use of the telephone,mails,delivery services,personal contact or otherwise causing any solicitation,oral or written,to be left for the owner or anyone else at the owner home address.id.d.the solicitation ban does not cover classified advertising in estate publications,advertisements placed in public view,or radio or television advertisements.id.d.the regulations define residential property as one,two,and houses,including and condos.id.e.
currently,approximately homeowners are on the list,with more than in queens county.the secretary determines whether any particular communication is an unlawful solicitation by investigating the content of the communication and the intent of the licensee in sending the communication.the regulation has been applied broadly to prohibit most communications by licensees to residents located at homes on the list,and licensees have been found to have violated the regulations by distributing business cards,or having promotional advertisements in mass distributed coupon packs that arrive at homes on the list.
the plaintiffs are real estate professionals licensed by the department of state,offering services in new york,including areas that have been designated zones by the defendant.they contend that,in order to obtain real estate listings,they rely upon direct,solicitations,including visits,telephone calls,and literature delivered directly to homeowners.plaintiff parker brings the suit as a sales agent reasonably fearing prosecution and risking sanction for violation of subsection.he alleges that he has had particular difficulty developing his business due to this restriction.the plaintiffs allege that the solicitation of listings is critical to the success of a real estate licensee,and that there is no alternative to communicating truthful,information about the real estate market,the licensee,the licensee company,and the nature of their services.
plaintiffs hosein and anderson were charged by the defendant with a disciplinary violation due to hosein mailing a flier to an addressee on the list for queens county.the flier introduced hosein to potential clients,and detailed some of the services provided by his company,coldwell banker halmike realty.the flier concluded with the following sentence,which the secretary of state deemed to be a solicitation for a listing if you have considered selling or buying a home now or in the near future,or simply want to find out what your home is worth in today market,do hesitate to call.hosein and anderson pled no contest to the charge of violating section by soliciting a listing for the sale of residential property,and entered into a consent order with the department of state,pursuant to which each paid a fine.
the plaintiffs commenced this action pursuant to the constitution and in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york in february.on for summary judgment,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,concluding that subsection and the regulations promulgated thereunder were unconstitutional.the district court applied the test for regulations of speech,see united states playboy entertainment group,d,and deemed the statute underinclusive as to the stated goal of homeowner privacy because it did not proscribe solicitation by other types of solicitors,see city of cincinnati discovery network,d.accordingly,the court concluded that the remedy did not reasonably fit with the problem it sought to address,see central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york,d,and that the state had failed to show that less restrictive,solutions were not available.
discussion 
level of first amendment protection 
one important determinant of the degree of protection afforded by the first amendment is whether the activity sought to be regulated constitutes commercial or noncommercial speech.bolger youngs drug products,d.the core notion of commercial speech is that which does no more than propose a commercial transaction.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.even a communication combining commercial and noncommercial elements,if it is an advertisement,makes reference to a specific product,and the speaker has an economic motivation for the communication,is properly characterized as commercial speech.id.at.
the plaintiffs acknowledge that their communications include truthful,information about themselves,the real estate market,the nature of their services,and those of their company.brief for appellees at.they claim that the regulations prevent them from providing invaluable information regarding market conditions,financing and refinancing alternatives,and opportunities which would not otherwise come to the attention of area residents,their families,neighbors and friends.id.at.in making the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech,bolger,at,we place this type of speech squarely into the category of commercial speech.
somewhat the commercial speech category,the plaintiffs contend,in agreement with the district court,that because the statute and regulation target only real estate solicitations,their constitutionality should be evaluated under the rigorous test applicable to regulations of speech.although some members of the supreme court have questioned whether the central hudson analysis should be applied in particular commercial speech cases,see greater new orleans broadcasting association,united states,d stevens,id.at.thomas,concurring in judgment liquormart,rhode island,d scalia,concurring in part and in judgment discovery network,at.stevens,the court has rejected the argument that strict scrutiny should apply to regulations of commercial speech that are,adhering instead to the somewhat less rigorous standards of central hudson.see thompson western states medical center,d,acknowledging the challenge to the central hudson analysis,but finding no need in this case to break new ground lorillard tobacco reilly,d refusing to apply strict scrutiny to regulations,and finding central hudson an adequate basis for commercial speech cases see also long island board of realtors,incorporated village of massapequa park,cir rejecting the argument that a municipal ordinance regulating the display of signs should be subject to a heightened level of scrutiny as a regulation.
ii.the central hudson test 
central hudson sets forth a framework for considering whether commercial speech may be validly restricted.first,for commercial speech to merit any first amendment protection,it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,the government must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by the restriction.if both these conditions are met,the third and fourth parts of the test are whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and whether the regulation is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.central hudson,at.
substantial state interest 
in this case,the secretary does not dispute the district court conclusion that the prohibited solicitations contain speech that is lawful and not misleading.to meet the second step of the analysis,the secretary identifies two governmental interests promoted by subsection the state interest in protecting neighborhoods from blockbusting,and the state interest in protecting the privacy of homeowners from harassing real estate solicitations because the state regulatory scheme is sustainable solely on the homeowners privacy interest,we need not consider the interest in avoiding blockbusting.
the homeowners privacy interest is substantial within the meaning of central hudson.the supreme court has declared that protecting the,tranquility,and privacy of the home is certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society.florida bar went for it,d internal quotation marks omitted frisby schultz,d noting,in upholding ban on residential picketing,that a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own walls,which the state may legislate to protect,is an ability to avoid intrusions see also watchtower bible and tract society of new york,village of stratton,d noting that residents privacy is among important interests that the village may seek to safeguard through some form of regulation of solicitation activity.the court has observed that e ven solicitation that is neither fraudulent nor deceptive may be pressed with such frequency or vehemence as to intimidate,vex,or harass the recipient p rotection of the public from these aspects of solicitation is a legitimate and important state interest.edenfield fane,d internal citations and quotations omitted see also ohralik ohio state bar association,d.as the district court noted,the secretary asserts such a situation here,stating that many homeowners feel harassed,overwhelmed,threatened,and offended by the extensive telephonic,mail,flyers,and personal direct solicitation they receive.accordingly,the interest in protecting homeowners from such harassing solicitations is a substantial state interest.
reasonable fit 
the third and fourth steps coalesce to require a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.lorillard tobacco,at.internal quotations marks omitted.the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it,and can not satisfy this burden by mere speculation or conjecture but must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restrictions will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.edenfield,at.
the record adequately demonstrates that the harm to homeowners privacy from real estate solicitations is real,and that the zones advance that interest directly and to a material degree.the popularity of the program,statements at the public hearings in support of the zones,and complaints of violations of the registry all support the contention that homeowners feel harassed by the amount and the intensity of the solicitations,and that the zones have alleviated that harm.although a prohibition that makes only a minute contribution to the advancement of the state interest is not considered to have advanced the interest to a material degree,see edenfield,at.bad frog brewery,new york state liquor authority,cir a state must demonstrate that its commercial speech limitation is part of a substantial effort to advance a valid state interest,not merely the removal of a few grains of offensive sand from a beach of vulgarity,the state evidence satisfies the material degree standard.
as to reasonable fit,the regulation can hardly be accused of being more extensive than necessary it is precisely with those who are experiencing the particular harm that it is designed to alleviate.this is the kind of restriction that was endorsed by the supreme court in rowan united states post office department,d,and more recently in playboy,at.see also watchtower bible.at observing,as to regulation of activities including religious proselytizing,that provision for posting of no solicitation signs and recognizing right to refuse conversation provides ample protection for the unwilling listener.in rowan,the court reviewed a statute under which a person could require a mailer of material that he deemed to be erotically arousing or sexually provocative to remove his name from its mailing lists and stop all future mailings to the householder.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court rejected the argument that the statute violated the mailers right to communicate,concluding that such a right could be limited by an affirmative act of the addressee giving notice that he wishes no further mailings from that mailer.id.at.in playboy,the court explicitly endorsed the practice of targeted blockin
