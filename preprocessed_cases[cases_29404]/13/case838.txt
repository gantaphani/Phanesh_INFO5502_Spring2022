we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the appellant,drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.see macone town of wakefield,cir.on september,mard,a firefighter for the town of amherst,massachusetts,answered an emergency ambulance call at amherst college.while proceeding down a hill with a stretcher to retrieve a patient,mard slipped and fell,landing on her back and shoulder.as a result of the fall,mard received injuries to her back,neck,shoulders,left arm,left leg,right knee,and ankle.

as a member of the amherst fire fighters,local,the union,mard was a party to a collective bargaining agreement between the union and the town.the agreement,a copy of which is sent to all union members within their first month of full employment,specifies the rights and obligations of union members who are sick or injured and affirms that the provisions of the agreement shall not be less than the provisions of.laws ch.article of the agreement further provides

in june,the town requested that the plaintiff attend an independent medical examination conducted by neurologist linda cowell.cowell conducted an extensive evaluation and prepared an report for the town,which included medical records provided by mard.the report noted that the examining process was explained to the examinee and she understands there is no physician relationship and the report will be sent to the requesting client.it concluded that mard could perform a light duty job with essentially no lifting.
immediately after mard examination by cowell,another neurologist,brian smith,prescribed medication for migranes that mard said she had been experiencing.mard notified the town that smith had placed her on medication that caused her dizziness and disequilibrium and that therefore precluded her from driving.in response to this information,the town approved the continuation of mard injury leave.
on august,the town sent mard a letter notifying her that an appointment for an independent medical examination ha d been arranged for her with a neurologist,william donahue.the letter instructed mard to bring to the appointment any,ct scans,mri studies,or other medical records pertaining to her injury and warned that pursuant to section of the workers compensation act,failure to attend or obstruction of this examination may suspend your right to compensation.
mard attended her appointment with donahue and brought with her medical records from her orthopedic surgeon,primary care physician,and chiropractor,as well as records relating to a prior mri.mard claims that donahue did not ask for her medical records and refused to review the records when she offered them to him.she states that donahue told her that he did not wish her to provide any unsolicited information and that she should answer only those questions he asked.she further claims that the physician conducted an examination,asking only general questions and neglecting to inquire about her migraines or the side effects of her migraine medication.according to mard,donahue did not review her march mri or the initial study of the migraines and failed to address her migraines or the effects of her medication in his report to the town.
the town,on the other hand,argues that mard had the opportunity and did,in fact,present her side of the story to donahue,and that the doctor opinion was based on reliable information,including his physical examination,the plaintiff description of her symptoms,and a medical records review.in his report to the town,donahue stated that he took a medical history from mard and reviewed her medical records,including an extensive independent medical examination particularly in terms of a history that was done by linda cowell.he discussed in some detail the results of his physical examination of mard and related mard description of her own symptoms.he noted that he did not have available for review the april mri study or any significant recent records of treatment and evaluation.after the evaluation,donahue determined that mard would be able to work in moderate duty capacity,with certain limitations.
on october,keith hoyle,the town fire chief,notified mard by letter that she would no longer be on injured duty status effective october,at which time she would be assigned moderate duty.when mard did not return to work on october,the town terminated her benefits.on october,mard filed a grievance under article of the collective bargaining agreement,which provides extensive procedures for resolving grievances,defined as any difference between the parties to the agreement relating to its interpretation,application,or administration pursuant to the grievance procedures established by the agreement,the grievance committee found that a grievance existed and referred the dispute to chief hoyle.after meeting with the committee,the fire chief agreed that mard could remain on personal sick leave pending the outcome of the grievance procedure.also in accord with the collective bargaining agreement,the committee forwarded the grievance to the town manager,who conducted a hearing on november,that involved both parties to the grievance.on november,the town manager determined that mard was no longer eligible for injured on duty status under or.three days later,the union notified the town of its intent to file for arbitration on mard behalf as provided for by the collective bargaining agreement.
on december,mard filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,alleging that the town terminated her injury leave benefits without providing adequate notice and hearing as required by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment mard filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and summary judgment on march.on april,the town filed its answer to the complaint.
on may,while the arbitration and civil lawsuit were pending,the union and the town executed a settlement agreement.it provided,in part 
whereas,the parties have reached agreement to settle all issues with regard to the grievance and they intend by the settlement to resolve all outstanding issues relative to all allegations contained in the grievance 
the agreement restored mard to injured on duty status retroactively to the date on which it had been converted to sick leave,and accorded to her all benefits that would have accrued had this status not been withdrawn.it further provided that mard should continue to receive benefits pursuant to until the hampshire county retirement board rendered a decision on her pending involuntary application for accidental disability retirement benefits.
the town moved for summary judgment in the civil lawsuit on november.on january,the district court held a hearing on the cross motions.at the conclusion of this hearing,the court ruled from the bench that summary judgment should be entered for the town.to implement this ruling,the court issued an order on january,denying mard motion for a preliminary injunction and cross motion for summary judgment and granting the town cross motion for summary judgment.in an accompanying memorandum,the district court summarized the reasons for its decision to enter summary judgment in favor of the town,referring to its bench decision for a more complete explanation.the court ruling rested on three grounds the independent medical examination that led to the termination of mard benefits provided her with constitutionally adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard mard was afforded constitutionally adequate due process pursuant to the doctrine and the grievance settlement entered into by the parties constituted a waiver of mard due process claims.

the threshold issue in a procedural due process action is whether the plaintiff had a constitutionally protected property interest at stake.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d bd.of regents roth,d.if she did,the state could not deprive her of this property without due process of law under the fourteenth amendment.loudermill,at.

once we determine that mard possessed a constitutionally protected property interest in the continued receipt of her benefits,we must next ask what procedures were required before the town could constitutionally deprive her of these benefits.it is well established that individuals whose property interests are at stake are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.dusenbery united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.mard argues that the town failed to provide her with constitutionally adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before terminating her injury leave benefits.we examine each of these claims in turn.
mard claims that the district court erred in determining that the town provided her with constitutionally sufficient notice of the impending termination of her benefits.she argues that she had no knowledge that her examination with donahue could result in the termination of her benefits either before or immediately after the examination and that she did not learn of the contemplated action until she received a letter on october,two weeks after her appointment with donahue,informing her that her benefits would be terminated the next day.
although we view the facts in the light most favorable to the appellant,we can not conclude that the notice provided by the town was constitutionally deficient.due process requires notice that is reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections,mullane central hanover bank trust,and that affords the affected individual a fundamentally fair chance to present his or her side of the story.puerto rico telephone telecommunications regulatory bd.of puerto rico,cir quoting in re nineteen appeals arising out of the san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir see mathews eldridge,at.requiring for due process purposes the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.the purpose of notice under the due process clause is to apprise the affected individual of,and permit adequate preparation for,an impending hearing.memphis light,gas water div.craft,d.

in this case,the town notified mard by letter that an appointment for an independent medical examination had been arranged for her at the request of the town.the letter directed mard to bring to the appointment any,ct scans,mri studies,and other records pertaining to her injury.in determining whether this letter was reasonably calculated to apprise mard of the pendency of the examination and possible termination,we must take into account the particular circumstances and conditions under which the letter was sent.see sarit united states drug enforcement,cir noting that mullane clearly contemplates inquiry into the peculiarities and practicalities of a given case at the time the notice was sent internal quotation marks omitted.
both the state statute and the collective bargaining agreement indicate that the purpose of a required independent medical examination by a physician is to evaluate an injured firefighter or police officer continued eligibility for benefits.under the statute,injured on duty status shall not extend beyond any period after a physician designated by the board or officer authorized to appoint police officers or fire fighters in such town determines that such incapacity no longer exists.laws ch.additionally,the collective bargaining agreement,a copy of which was issued to mard when she began to work as a firefighter for the town,provided that on his own initiative,the fire chief may arrange for a medical evaluation of the length and extent of the disability,including an opinion as to the ability of the employee to perform limited duty.collective bargaining agreement.it also authorized the fire chief to require the timely presentation of such medical evidence or other evidence reasonably satisfactor
