this interlocutory appeal and present issues concerning individual and governmental agency liability,in the aftermath of the attack,for alleged breach of duties owed to a putative plaintiff class of people who reside,attend school,or work in lower manhattan or brooklyn.the principal claim is that government officials misled the plaintiff class members by stating that the air quality in the period after the destruction of the world trade center towers was safe enough to permit return to homes,schools,and offices.the are christine todd whitman,the former administrator of the environmental protection agency epa,stephen johnson,the current administrator of epa,and epa the latter two,collectively,the epa defendants.they appeal from the february,opinion and order of the district court for the southern district of new york deborah batts,district judge ruling on the defendants motions to dismiss.

background 
the complaint.each of the complaint four counts relates to the defendants response to the presence of allegedly dangerous dust in the air above lower manhattan and brooklyn resulting from the collapse of the world trade center wtc towers on september.the allegations focus on the effect of that dust wtc dust on air quality apartments,offices,and schools.
count one the bivens count is a bivens claim seeking damages from whitman in her individual capacity.it alleges that in the weeks and months after whitman and epa officials acting at her direction made statements regarding air quality in lower manhattan and brooklyn that failed to report health risks associated with wtc dust or misrepresented the nature of those risks,and caused epa to issue press releases containing those false and misleading statements,thereby violating the plaintiffs fifth amendment substantive due process right to be free from health risks.the bivens count does not allege that whitman intended to cause harm,but it does allege that she acted with deliberate indifference because she knew that the content of her and epa reassuring statements and press releases was false.
count two the apa count is a claim under the apa against epa.it alleges that epa failed to fulfill various of its regulatory obligations in connection with air quality and interior building cleanup in the wtc area following.like the bivens count against whitman,the apa count alleges that epa acts and omissions in the aftermath of violated the plaintiffs substantive rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the apa count seeks,among other things,a finding of liability as to epa and prospective injunctive relief in the form of an order compelling epa to perform tests for hazardous substances in buildings housing offices,schools,and residences in lower manhattan and brooklyn implement a complete professional of all such buildings that are determined to contain hazardous substances and implement a program for medical monitoring services to detect,diagnose,study,and prevent any conditions caused by exposure to wtc dust.
count three is a mandamus claim against epa,seeking an order compelling it to perform what the plaintiffs allege are mandatory duties as to the removal of wtc dust from building interiors.
count four is a claim against epa brought pursuant to subsection of cercla provision,a.count four alleges that epa handling of the wtc dust phenomenon in the aftermath of violated national contingency plan ncp regulations promulgated under cercla.
the district court decision.whitman sought dismissal of the bivens count on the ground that she was entitled to qualified immunity because her alleged conduct did not violate a constitutional right.judge batts denied her motion.see benzman whitman,civ,wl,at.judge batts held that the bivens count stated a violation of a clearly established substantive due process right to be free from official government policies that increase the risk of bodily harm.id.at see id.at.
epa sought dismissal of the apa count under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure on the ground that judicial review of the underlying agency decisions was unavailable for two reasons.first,epa argued that the discretionary function provision of the stafford act,precluded judicial review because the agency decisions on which the apa count is based were discretionary.see id.at.second,epa argued that the agency decisions forming the basis of the apa count did not constitute the sort of agency actions for which judicial review is available under the apa.see id.at.judge batts agreed with the epa that the underlying agency decisions were discretionary because the relevant ncp regulations established duties judge batts therefore dismissed,pursuant to the stafford act,those aspects of the apa count that were based on alleged violations of ncp regulations.see id.at.however,judge batts also ruled that the stafford act did not preclude judicial review of the entirety of the apa count because that count includes a constitutional claim against epa,the same substantive due process claim that forms the basis of the bivens count against whitman.see id.at.judge batts also concluded that the agency action identified by the plaintiffs in response to epa motion to voluntary cleanup program undertaken by epa in the wtc area and completed before this final agency action within the meaning of the apa,rendering the challenged agency decisions culminating in that action subject to judicial review.see id.at.
judge batts dismissed the mandamus count on the ground that the apa count,which had been sustained in part,provided the plaintiffs with an adequate remedy for the same injuries implicated in the mandamus count.see id.at.
epa sought dismissal of the cercla count on the ground that,because the count challenged epa performance of its regulatory duties,this count could not be brought under the subsection of cercla provision that the plaintiffs had invoked in the of a.see id.at.judge batts agreed with epa and dismissed the cercla count,observing that the plaintiffs had alleged a failure by epa to perform purportedly acts and duties under cercla the appropriate claim,if any,would therefore have been against the administrator of epa pursuant to subsection.see id.at.
whitman appeals,under the collateral order doctrine,the denial of her motion to dismiss the bivens count based on the defense of qualified immunity.see mitchell forsyth,d.epa appeal and the plaintiffs are brought pursuant to b.
discussion 
i.the bivens count against whitman 
standard of review.whitman appeal reasserts her claim to qualified immunity.although qualified immunity is an affirmative defense,available to federal officials sued under bivens,see wilson layne,d,it may be asserted in a motion to dismiss under rule b of the rules of civil procedure as long as the defense is based on facts appearing on the face of the complaint.mckenna wright,cir.
this court reviews de novo a district court decision adjudicating a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity,see,pena deprisco,cir,and the plaintiff is entitled to all reasonable inferences from the facts alleged,not only those that support his claim,but also those that defeat the immunity defense,mckenna,at see,anderson recore,cir.
the plaintiffs core allegation.the core of the plaintiffs substantive due process claim is that whitman should be held personally liable for damages because she knew of the dangers posed by wtc dust and yet issued and approved a series of press releases that falsely represented to the plaintiffs and the putative class that the air in and around lower manhattan was safe to breathe.complaint.
validity of the bivens claim.our initial issue in considering the bivens claim is whether the creation of a new implied cause of action for damages against a government official is appropriate in the context presented by the plaintiffs complaint.a bivens action is a blunt and powerful instrument for correcting constitutional violations and not an automatic entitlement associated with every governmental infraction.wilkie robbins,d.it is important to bear in mind that the purpose for creating a bivens cause of action is to deter unconstitutional behavior by individual federal officials.see carlson green,d.the supreme court has cautioned hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation in the bivens context.see wilkie.at quoting bush lucas,d.the defendants assert a substantial basis for such hesitation by pointing out that no court has ever held a government official liable for denying substantive due process by issuing press releases or making public statements.not only is the plaintiffs assertion of an implied cause of action unprecedented,it also encounters the substantial objection that congress has already provided a statutory cause of action for claims arising out of the airplane crashes that destroyed the wtc towers.see air transportation safety and system stabilization act atsssa,b,stat.codified at note supp.iv.the atsssa creates an exclusive federal cause of action for such claims,see,to be brought in the southern district of new york,see id.b,and adjudicated on the basis of applicable state law,see id.b.with respect to claims brought by workers alleging respiratory injuries sustained during cleanup efforts,we said that it require d no great stretch to view such injuries as arising out of the plane crashes and stated that congress intended atsssa cause of action to be sufficiently expansive to cover such claims.see in re wtc disaster site,cir.whether or not an atsssa claim could be successfully maintained against whitman,the fact that congress established this exclusive statutory cause of action weighs strongly against the judicial creation of a novel bivens action implied by the substantive component of the due process clause.see wilkie.at.
even in the absence of an alternative remedial scheme,we must evaluate whether any special factors weigh against creation of a novel bivens action.see id.here,there are reasons for allowing congress to prescribe the scope of relief that is made available.bush,at.like the relationship between an agency and its employees,see,or the regulation of military life,see chappell wallace,d,the federal response to disasters,such as the events at issue here,involves policy questions in an area that has received careful attention from congress.schweiker chilicky,d.federal disaster response and efforts are an area in which congress has developed considerable familiarity and may inform itself through factfinding procedures such as hearings that are not available to the courts.bush,at.indeed,we have recently recognized the additional separation of powers concern the right of federal agencies to make discretionary decisions when engaged in disaster relief efforts without the fear of judicial that informs the stafford act grant of discretionary function immunity to government officials engaged in administration of the disaster relief act.see in re world trade center disaster site litigation,wl,at cir.we therefore conclude that a suit against a federal official for decisions made as part of federal disaster response and cleanup efforts implicate the sort of special factors that counsel against creation of a bivens remedy.
if an implied cause of action were available in this context,the next issue would be whether the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,saucier katz,d.t o establish a violation of a right to substantive due process,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the government action was so egregious,so outrageous,that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.pena,at quoting county of sacramento lewis,d.as the supreme court noted in county of sacramento,c onduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.at.nothing in the plaintiffs complaint alleges that any defendant intended to injure anyone.
mindful of the supreme court admonition not to permit the due process clause to transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation,deshaney winnebago county dep t of social services,d,we have recognized two separate and distinct theories of liability under the substantive component of the due process clause special relationship liability and liability.pena,at.in cases arising under,we have applied with considerable stringency both special relationship liability,see ying jing gan city of new york,cir prosecutor lacked special relationship with complaining witness doe new york city dep t of social services,cir city placement of child in foster care created special relationship,and liability,see pena,at danger where police officers condoned fellow officer drunk driving hemphill schott,cir danger where police officers handed weapon to robbery victim and drove him to scene of robber arrest where victim shot the robber dwares city of new york,cir danger where police officers permitted skinheads to beat up protestors.
in the pending case,the plaintiffs allegations fall far short of showing either the type of special relationship between governmental actor and victim or a danger arising from the relationship between the state and the private assailant,pena,at,that might lead to liability for denial of substantive due process.instead,they seek to allege a danger,sufficient to impose such liability,based on a senior official public statements that offered assurances of environmental safety that turned out to be substantially essence a mass tort for making inaccurate statements.in considering a novel claim of this sort,we must heed the supreme court cautionary words that the court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process.collins city of harker heights,d.
we recently ruled that a claim similar to the plaintiffs did not allege the denial of a right to substantive due process.see lombardi whitman,cir.the claim in lombardi was brought against whitman by emergency responders to the ground zero site in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack and by workers at the site in the weeks thereafter.like the plaintiffs here,they claimed that many of the same statements at issue here violated their right to substantive due process by assuring them that it was safe to work at the site where they were subject to the same dangers from contaminated air alleged in the pending case.we rejected the claim,primarily on the ground that,absent an allegation of intent to harm,a viable substantive due process violation could not be asserted against government officials,who,in the aftermath of an unprecedented disaster,were obliged to make operational decisions in a context where they were subject to competing considerations.see id.at.
the plaintiffs here seek to distinguish lombardi on the ground that the considerations favoring prompt appearance at ground zero by first responders and other workers in order to minimize loss of life and injury and to clear debris find no analogue in the decision of whitman to assure area residents that it was safe to return.we agree that the considerations weighing upon government officials in the two cases differ.while it was obviously important to have the lombardi plaintiffs at ground zero promptly even if health risks would be encountered,the balance of competing governmental interests faced in reassuring people that it was safe to return to their homes and offices was materially different from that faced in lombardi.
a flaw in the plaintiffs claim,however,is that,from the face of their complaint,it is apparent that whitman did face a choice between competing considerations,although not the stark choice between telling a deliberate falsehood about health risks and issuing an accurate warning about them.as the complaint alleges,quoting a report from the epa office of inspector general,the white house council on environmental quality ceq influenced,through the collaboration process,the information that epa communicated to the public through its early press releases when it convinced epa to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones.complaint.the realistic choice for whitman was either to accept the white house guidance and reassure the public or disregard the ceq views in communicating with the public.a choice of that sort implicates precisely the competing governmental considerations that lombardi recognized would preclude a valid claim of denial of substantive due process in the absence of an allegation that the government official acted with intent to harm.
moreover,although the reasons to encourage the return of workers to the site promptly were undoubtedly weightier than any concern to encourage the return of residents to homes and offices,whitman was subject to an array of competing considerations of the sort identified in lombardi.see at.whether or not whitman resolution of such competing considerations was wise,indeed,even if her agency overall performance was as deficient as the plaintiffs allege,she has not engaged in conduct that shocks the conscience in the sense necessary to create constitutional liability for damages to thousands of people under the substantive component of the due process clause.
we recognize that the plaintiffs have alleged not only whitman deliberate indifference to the consequences of her decision,see,complaint,but have also alleged that the reassurances she issued were knowingly false,id.preliminarily,we note that it is far from clear that a complaint adequately alleging knowing falsity would have survived dismissal in the absence of an allegation of intent to injure,and we are not ruling that such a complaint would have stated a valid bivens claim.indeed,two passages in lombardi,read in combination,appear to preclude such a claim.we stated that when agency officials decide how to reconcile competing governmental obligations in the face of disaster,only intent to cause harm arbitrarily can shock the conscience in a way that justifies constitutional liability.lombardi,at.and we added,accepting as we must the allegation that the defendants made the wrong decision by disclosing information they knew to be inaccurate,and that this had tragic consequences for the plaintiffs,we conclude that a poor choice made by an executive official between or among the harms risked by the available options is not merely because for some persons it resulted in grave consequences that a correct decision could have avoided.id.at.
in any event,plaintiffs complaint has not adequately pleaded an allegation of knowing falsity.in assessing the sufficiency of the complaint,we are guided by the supreme court recent decision in bell atlantic twombly,d.the court there somewhat modified the previously applicable standard for assessing the sufficiency of complaints in civil cases and ruled that if a claim was not plausible,it would have to be supported by an allegation of some subsidiary facts to survive a motion to dismiss.see id.at iqbal hasty,cir,cert.pet.pending,interpreting bell atlantic to have established a plausibility standard for civil pleading.
in iqbal,we ruled that an allegation that senior officials of the department of justice were involved in unlawful actions occurring at a maximum detention facility in new york city survived a motion to dismiss because it was plausible to believe that these officials would have concerned themselves with the implementation of policies concerning the arrest and detention of those suspected of possible involvement in the attack.see at.by contrast,a bare allegation that the head of a government agency,guided by a relevant white house office,knew that her statements were false and knowingly issued false press releases is not plausible in the absence of some supporting facts.although the complaint contains numerous allegations that various employees within epa were aware of data indicating health risks there is no allegation that whitman,from whom damages are sought in her personal capacity,was herself aware of such information.perhaps,as a competent administrator,she should have been aware of significant information known to her subordinates,but arguably inadequate management of a vast agency of employees is not a basis for constitutional tort liability.
the bivens count,alleging whitman personal liability for damages for a denial of substantive due process,must be dismissed.
ii.the apa count 
the apa count against the epa defendants,brought pursuant to sections and of the apa,seeks injunctive relief and a finding of liability based on two independent claims.the first claim is a substantive due process claim,which mirrors the plaintiffs bivens claim in count one against whitman.with the failure of the bivens claim against whitman,the first component of the apa claim fails for many of the same reasons.moreover,to the extent that this component alleges that epa failure to act or perceived inadequacies in epa response to the disaster constitutes a violation of substantive due process,it is foreclosed by deshaney,at.o ur cases have recognized that the due process clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual,and its progeny,see,pena,at a failure to interfere when misconduct takes place,and no more,is not sufficient to amount to a state created danger.emphasis in original.
the second component of the apa count rests on allegations that epa failed to fulfill mandatory cleanup and public information duties assigned to it in various national contingency plan ncp regulations the claims.the plaintiffs challenges judge batts ruling as to the claims in the apa count.
the apa count seeks an order compelling epa to take certain actions,as follows first,to perform representative testing of all office buildings,schools,and residences in lower manhattan,including brooklyn,for any and all hazardous substances,in accordance with applicable federal regulations and standards,and,where such tests reveal the presence of hazardous substances,implement a complete professional of all such buildings and,second,in summary,to implement a program for medical monitoring services to detect,diagnose,study,and prevent any conditions caused by exposure to wtc dust.complaint,count ii,prayers for relief c and d.the plaintiffs contend that each type of relief may be awarded under either sections or.we will consider each section separately 
section.section empowers a district court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.the plaintiffs do not dispute that a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take,norton southern utah wilderness alliance,d emphases in original suwa.they contend that the actions epa allegedly failed to take satisfy the suwa standard.we disagree.
in suwa,the supreme court explained that,like the power to grant writs of mandamus,empowers a court only to compel an agency to perform a ministerial or act,or to take action upon a matter,without directing how it shall act.at.quoting attorney general manual on the administrative procedure act emphasis in suwa.the plaintiffs describe the section aspect of the apa count as grounded on the allegation that the epa failed to follow the ncp,as mandated by d.br.for appellees at.epa does not dispute that the ncp was in effect after,as d provides,but argues that none of the ncp regulations invoked by the plaintiffs requires epa to take discrete actions.several sections of title of the code of federal regulations are at issue,which we consider separately.
section provides when an incident occurs,it is imperative to give the public prompt,accurate information on the
