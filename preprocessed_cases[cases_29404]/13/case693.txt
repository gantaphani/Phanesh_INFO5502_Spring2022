appellant thomas gaffney was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of months after pleading guilty to three counts stemming from a conspiracy to distribute,and the distribution of,cocaine base.he now claims that his conviction and sentence should be vacated because the district court wrongly denied him the opportunity to obtain new counsel before entering his plea.although appellant characterizes the court action as either the denial of the counsel of his choice or the denial of a request for substitute counsel in violation of the sixth amendment,we view the court action as a denial of a request for a continuance of a change of plea hearing,sought by defendant to explore the possibility of hiring a new attorney.thus viewed,we conclude that the denial of that continuance request was not an abuse of discretion.we therefore affirm.
appellant gaffney and a,james barr,were charged by complaint in october with conspiring to distribute and the distribution of crack cocaine.after attorneys handled the initial appearance and detention hearings,gaffney and barr hired private counsel.a grand jury returned a indictment against gaffney in november,and the government filed an information alleging that he had a prior felony drug conviction which would trigger a mandatory minimum ten year sentence.on december,gaffney and his attorney,thomas connors,signed a written plea agreement in which gaffney agreed to plead guilty on all three counts.barr signed a similar agreement.
at a joint plea hearing on december,edward mcenaney,an associate of connors,represented gaffney.counsel for both defendants expressed their clients concern about going forward with their guilty pleas because they feared that their prior convictions might dramatically increase their sentences under the career offender provision of the sentencing guidelines noting that this issue has a serious impact on the potential penalties involved in this case,the court granted a continuance to allow the defendants additional time to get a clearer picture of what it looks like for you in the event you decide to plead guilty.the court also arranged a meeting between counsel and the probation officer for the next day.the court repeatedly warned defendants that evaluations done by the government are only estimates that they are not binding and that the court itself would determine the prior convictions effects under the guidelines.the court asked both defendants if they understood these warnings and they replied that they did.
when the hearing resumed two days later,the court noted that both gaffney and barr had informed the court prior to the hearing that they were dissatisfied with their counsel and asked counsel for an update.mcenaney,again serving as counsel for gaffney,responded that his client had a problem with the mandatory minimum sentence that would result from his likely classification as a career offender.counsel continued he is interested in hiring another counsel.he does not believe that i done everything,nor connors that we done everything on his behalf to help him.counsel concluded that we have no alternative but to ask on his behalf for an extension of time so he may meet with another counsel and someone who he may have more confidence in.
the court then asked to hear directly from the defendants about what they think counsel have not done for them,because it strikes me that this is nothing more than a play for additional time gaffney responded well,your honor,first of all,my lawyer,the one that was paid to represent me ai even here.he on vacation.gaffney continued i do got nothing on my case.i do got one piece of paper.gaffney then contended that,without this paperwork,he had been unable to look up cases like his in the law library.the court questioned gaffney extensively regarding his complaint about the missing paperwork,taking particular care to ascertain that gaffney was familiar with both the indictment and the plea agreement.gaffney acknowledged that his lawyers had read both to him.
after some consideration,the court declined to grant a continuance of the change of plea hearing to allow barr and gaffney to obtain alternative counsel.having heard now from both counsel and defendants,the court reiterated its opinion that the defendants were asserting dissatisfaction with their attorneys in order to try to get some more time.the court also found that defendants dissatisfaction here is not with your attorneys.it with what your attorneys are telling you.the court added i have heard anything that indicates to me that they not representing you effectively.he also commended counsel for their effort to get you more time in order to further investigate the effect of the prior convictions on sentencing.he noted that you do usually get that extra time,but i gave it to you so you could be as informed as possible b ut now you been informed of that.you understand what you facing here.the court then offered the men three choices plead guilty,plead not guilty and proceed to trial with present counsel,or represent themselves.the court also offered counsel an opportunity to move to withdraw neither counsel did.gaffney then pled guilty on all counts.
during the plea colloquy,gaffney confirmed that his lawyers had read the indictment and plea agreement to him.the court asked gaffney putting all the issues of time aside,do you have any reason to feel that you have gotten good advice and good counsel from your attorneys here gaffney responded no.the court accepted gaffney guilty plea.
subsequently,the court conducted three separate sentencing hearings to resolve gaffney challenges to the calculations proposed by the government.gaffney was represented by connors at each of these hearings.the court ultimately imposed a term of imprisonment of months.although he was classified as a career offender based on his prior convictions,gaffney received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and his ultimate sentence was more than five years less than the minimum guidelines term.
on appeal,gaffney argues that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to counsel by denying a request for counsel of his choice or by denying a motion for substitution of counsel.in response,the government asserts that gaffney decision to plead guilty following his colloquy with the trial court waived any claim for the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred before the plea.see tollett henderson,d.alternatively,the government argues that gaffney never asked for substitution of counsel or counsel of his choice,but instead sought a continuance of the change of plea hearing to explore the possibility of hiring another attorney.the government insists that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying that request.
in tollett,the supreme court held that a defendant who pleads guilty unconditionally waives all independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.at.united states cordero,cir.the government contends that tollett is applicable here and urges us to deny gaffney appeal on that basis.we decline to do so 
the court reasoned in tollett that a guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process,at,and reflects a defendant decision to leave behind claims of constitutional error in an effort to expeditiously resolve the criminal proceedings against him.here,defendant expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney at the change of plea hearing itself and then entered his guilty plea immediately after the court denied his request for time to explore the possibility of retaining different counsel.arguably,the plea was intertwined with the alleged constitutional violation in a fashion that differs from many of the precedents applying tollett.however,we find it unnecessary to decide whether gaffney complaint is indeed an independent claim waived by tollett,or whether it is so intertwined with the plea itself that it evades tollett strictures.instead,we conclude that gaffney claim for relief under the sixth amendment is otherwise deficient.
