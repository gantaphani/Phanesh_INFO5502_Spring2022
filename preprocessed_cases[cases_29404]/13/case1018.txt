plaintiff appellant darryl holland holland,an inmate and practicing muslim,asserts that defendant prison officials glenn goord,anthony annuci,anthony zon,thomas schoellkopf,john barbera,and martin kearney collectively,appellees unconstitutionally burdened his religious exercise when they ordered him to provide a urine sample within a window the time limit then permitted by prison regulations while holland fasted in observance of ramadan,the holy month during which muslims refrain from ingesting food and drink during daylight hours.though holland cited his fast to explain why he could not comply with the order or drink water to aid his compliance,appellees did not permit holland an opportunity to provide a urine sample after sunset when his fast had ended.instead,when holland failed timely to produce a sample,he was ordered confined in keeplock in this ensuing lawsuit,holland asserts that appellees order and disciplinary action infringed his rights under the free exercise clause of the first amendment and the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,et.holland also asserts that his inability to call a witness during a subsequent disciplinary hearing resulted in a denial of due process under the fourteenth amendment,and that his confinement in keeplock amounted to first amendment retaliation.holland seeks damages and injunctive relief.
following for summary judgment,the district court telesca,entered judgment in favor of appellees.significantly,the district court held that holland could not prevail on his first amendment free exercise and rluipa claims because appellees conduct had placed only a de minimis burden on holland religious exercise.see holland goord,civ.mat,wl,at june.the district court also ruled that,in the alternative,appellees were entitled to qualified immunity as to holland free exercise claims because holland right to an exception from the limit had not been clearly established at the time the order was given.id.at.further,the district court noted that rluipa does not support holland claim for money damages,id.at it dismissed holland due process claim on the ground that holland lacked a liberty interest in avoiding keeplock,id.at and,finally,the court concluded that holland first amendment retaliation claim was properly dismissed because holland failed to raise any issue as to a retaliatory motive underlying his keeplock confinement,id.at.
on appeal,we conclude that the choice either to provide a urine sample by drinking water during his fast or to face disciplinary action placed a substantial burden on holland religious exercise.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment insofar as it concerns holland claim for damages under the first amendment free exercise clause and remand for further consideration of this claim.we affirm the remainder of the judgment,albeit largely on alternate grounds.
background 
holland was incarcerated in wende correctional facility wende from until,during which time he converted to islam.on november,martin kearney,a captain at wende,purportedly received information that holland was using drugs and directed john barbera,a correctional officer at wende,to obtain a urine sample from him.at the time,new york state department of correctional services docs directive required that inmates provide a urine sample within three hours of being ordered to do so,without exception.the directive also provided that inmates could be given up to eight ounces of water per hour during the time span to assist in their production.on kearney order,barbera directed holland to provide a urine sample.however,holland stated that he was unable to do so,citing his fast in observance of ramadan.holland also refused water on those grounds.though holland offered to drink water and provide a sample after sunset,when his fast had ended,barbera declined to permit an exception to the directive.after three hours had elapsed and holland had failed to comply with the order,barbera issued a misbehavior report charging holland with violating the urinalysis guidelines and defying a direct order.holland was then placed in keeplock pending a disciplinary hearing on the matter.
at that hearing,holland testified that he had been unable to provide a sample when he was ordered to do so because he could not drink water prior to sunset during ramadan.holland also requested that his imam be permitted to attest to these beliefs however,thomas schoellkopf,a hearing officer at wende,refused to permit the witness,stating that it was unnecessary to call the imam given that he had not been present at the incident and that his testimony regarding the practice of muslims observing the ramadan fast would be duplicative of holland.following this exchange,schoellkopf found holland guilty of violating the urinalysis guidelines,stating that he was not aware of any religious exceptions such as ramadan that excuse participation in drug testing.schoellkopf also found holland not guilty of the charge that he failed to comply with a direct order,stating that his more lenient disposition was an attempt to encourage holland to follow the urinalysis guidelines in the future.in light of the guilty disposition on the urinalysis charge,schoellkopf sentenced holland to days in keeplock,as well as days of lost privileges.
holland initiated several administrative appeals of the verdict from keeplock and sent a letter to anthony zon,the of wende,informing him of the sentence.holland imam also sent a memorandum to kearney,reaffirming holland beliefs,questioning why holland had not been permitted to provide a sample after sunset,and asking kearney to look into the matter.while holland initial appeals were resolved in his favor with zon determining on january,that u rinalysis testing could be taken after sunset holland was not immediately released from keeplock.instead,holland further appealed his claims until,on february,the director of special discipline working under commissioner glenn goord reversed and expunged the disciplinary action,citing schoellkopf failure to elicit relevant testimony from holland imam.holland was released from keeplock that day,after serving days in detention.while in keeplock,holland was confined to his cell for hours each day,was barred from attending islamic services,including the eid feast celebrating the end of ramadan,allegedly received punishment trays containing meager portions,and lost his seniority and higher wage job at wende.
procedural history 
holland filed the underlying action pro se in june.after his complaint survived two motions to dismiss,see holland goord,civ.cjs,wl holland goord,civ.cjs,wl july,holland was appointed counsel and filed a second amended complaint,asserting under and rluipa that the order to provide a urine sample and his resultant confinement in keeplock violated his right to free exercise of religion.holland also asserted under that schoellkopf refusal to call his imam as a witness denied him due process under the fourteenth amendment,and that his confinement in keeplock amounted to retaliation for his religious beliefs in violation of the first amendment.as relevant here,holland sought damages and injunctive relief.as part of holland requested injunctive relief,he sought an order requiring docs to amend directive to include express protection for inmates fasting during ramadan.
in june and july,the parties for summary judgment.in may,after seven years of litigation and while the parties motions were fully briefed,docs added a note to directive advising that 
i nmates participating in an approved religious fast should not be required to provide a urine sample during fasting periods since consumption of water may be necessary.sample requests should be scheduled during other periods of the day and normal urinalysis testing procedures should then apply,including offering water to those inmates unable to provide a urine sample.
appellees did not notify either the district court or holland that this note had been added.
on june,the district court granted appellees motion for summary judgment and denied holland.in its decision,the district court held that the order to provide a urine sample placed only a de minimis amendment free exercise and rluipa claims.holland,wl,at.in reaching that conclusion,the court credited holland imam testimony that holland could have fasted for one additional day to atone for taking a drink of water to aid compliance with the order.id.in addition,the district court held that appellees were entitled to qualified immunity from holland free exercise claims because the right to an exception from directive had not been clearly established in november.id.at.the court also noted that rluipa did not support holland claim for money damages.id.at.finally,the district court concluded that holland lacked a protected liberty interest in remaining free from keeplock,precluding his due process claim,and that holland had not drawn a causal connection between his religious exercise and appellees disciplinary action,precluding the first amendment retaliation claim.id.at.holland appealed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.see jeffreys city of new york,cir.summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see jeffreys,at.
first amendment free exercise claim 
it has not been decided in this circuit whether,to state a claim under the first amendment free exercise clause,a prisoner must show at the threshold that the disputed conduct substantially burdens his sincerely held religious beliefs.salahuddin goord,cir see ford mcginnis,cir assuming without deciding that substantial burden requirement applies.holland challenges the continued viability of the substantial burden test in light of the supreme court statement in employment division smith that application of the test embroils courts in the unacceptable business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims.ford,at quoting emp t div.smith,internal quotation marks omitted see also williams morton,cir declining to apply the substantial burden test to a claim regarding the availability of meals conforming to religious dictates in prison.however,we need not decide the issue here,as even assuming the continued vitality of the substantial burden requirement,our precedent squarely dictates that holland religious exercise was unconstitutionally burdened a point,moreover,that appellees do not contest on appeal.see salahuddin,at declining to address continued viability of substantial burden test when the defendants failed to argue that the inmate burdened religious practice was peripheral or tangential to his religion see also jolly coughlin,cir noting that a substantial burden exists when the state puts substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in one of several cases concerning this issue,we held in ford mcginnis that a muslim inmate free exercise rights would be substantially burdened if prison officials denied his request for a meal to celebrate the eid feast.at.though a question of fact remained as to whether the meal had,in fact,been denied,in vacating summary judgment in favor of the defendants,we emphasized both that the inmate had credibly claimed that the meal was critical to his observance as a practicing muslim and that inmates have a clearly established right to a diet consistent with their religious scruples.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.then,in mceachin mcguinnis,we cited this language to hold that an inmate stated a free exercise claim based on his assertion that prison officials had denied him properly blessed food to break his fasts during ramadan,cir.though the court declined to address the substantial burden standard on a motion to dismiss,we emphasized that courts have generally found that to deny prison inmates the provision of food that satisfies the dictates of their faith does unconstitutionally burden their free exercise rights,noting that this court had recognized such a principle since at least as early as.id.at citing kahane carlson,cir determining that orthodox jewish inmate had right to provision of kosher meals.finally,in jolly coughlin,we held that forcing an inmate to choose between his religious beliefs which forbade the medical testing prison officials attempted to impose upon him or confinement in keeplock itself constitute d a substantial burden.at.
taken together,these cases clearly support the conclusion that ordering holland to provide a urine sample and drink water in violation of his fast or face confinement in keeplock substantially burdened holland free exercise right.first,it is undisputed that holland is a practicing muslim and that fasting in observance of ramadan is a core tenet of his faith.see holland,wl,at.thus,there can be no debate that directly ordering holland to drink water in violation of his fast would substantially burden his free exercise rights.as we stated in ford and reiterated in mceachin,inmates have a clearly established right to a diet consistent with their religious scruples.see mceachin,at quoting ford,at brackets omitted.the difference between the denial of a meal and the imposition of a drink is of no constitutional significance.see id.at stating,in light of the inmate claim that an officer deliberately ordered him to act in contravention of his beliefs,that p recedent suggests that inmates have a right not to be disciplined for refusing to perform tasks that violate their religious beliefs.by contrast,the district court conclusion that the order to provide a urine sample placed only a de minimis burden on holland free exercise because he could make up a premature drink of water with one extra day of fasting,see holland,wl,at quoting holland and his imam testimony,finds no support in our case law.while this court has suggested that t here may be inconveniences so trivial that they are most properly ignored,mceachin,at,the uncontradicted evidence submitted by holland that breaking his fast prior to sunset would have been a grave sin regardless whether atonement was possible prevented such a conclusion in this case.
the closer question identified but not determined by the district court is whether,in the district court words,an issue as to causation barred holland claim.see holland,wl,at.that is,while the denial of a religious meal plainly burdens the inmate right to eat that meal,as in ford and mceachin,it is not that an inmate inability or refusal to provide a urine sample followed from his forbearance from drinking water.however,no such question of fact exists in this case.holland explained to schoellkopf at his disciplinary hearing that he had not complied with the order because he was fasting during ramadan and,as a result,was not able to go to the bathroom due to his not being able to drink any water.and,in his deposition,schoellkopf stated that he believed holland statement,though he nonetheless sentenced him to days in keeplock because there was no exception to the docs rule.
if appellees were able to counter these facts,they have failed to do so.instead,appellees argued broadly below that holland could not establish a link between his fast and failure to comply with the order,while neglecting to cite record evidence countering the foregoing material.see,mem.in support of summary judgment,holland goord,civ,doc,at june,it is common knowledge that people that do not eat or drink for a day are still able to produce urine.but no such argument has been advanced on appeal.thus,it is now uncontested that holland,a practicing muslim,was unable to comply with the order to provide a urine sample within three hours because he was fasting in observance of ramadan.while appellees permitted holland a choice between prematurely breaking his fast or facing confinement in keeplock,that choice as has been clearly established by our precedent for decades placed a substantial burden on the free exercise of his religion.see jolly,at.
of course,this conclusion does not end the inquiry into holland first amendment free exercise claim.given the difficult judgments attendant to prison operation,turner safley,a genera
