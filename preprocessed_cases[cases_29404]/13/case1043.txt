appellants the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic and jpmorgan chase bank,national association chase appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff hillside metro associates,llc hillside.this litigation arises out of the failure of washington mutual bank wamu and the assumption of wamu assets and liabilities by chase from the fdic,acting in its capacity as wamu receiver.the district court held that hillside,which owned premises leased by wamu just before the financial crisis,had standing to enforce the alleged assignment of wamu real estate lease to chase pursuant to a purchase agreement between the fdic and chase,even though the fdic validly repudiated the lease and the parties to the purchase agreement assert that it did not in fact assign the lease.we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss hillside complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
this appeal arises out of the financial crisis of and the threat it posed to the national economy.the crisis resulted in wamu collapse in september and the appointment of the fdic as wamu receiver.chase immediately assumed many of wamu assets and liabilities from the fdic pursuant to a purchase and assumption agreement the paa or the agreement between chase and the fdic.the question before us is whether hillside has standing to assert that a lease between wamu and hillside was among the assets and liabilities chase assumed under the agreement.
the facts are not in dispute.in april hillside and wamu entered into a lease for the premises at hillside avenue,queens,new york,a former video store.the parties to the lease intended that the premises would be used as a wamu bank branch,and plans for renovating the store on the premises were attached to the lease.the store was never converted into a bank branch.see hillside metro,llc jpmorgan chase bank,n.hillside ii,cv jg smg,wl,at may.
on september,the office of thrift supervision declared wamu insolvent,and the fdic was appointed as wamu receiver.that same day,consistent with its practice of entering into timely agreements with acquiring financial institutions,the fdic entered into the paa with chase.the paa assigned to chase both wamu assets and its liabilities,with enumerated exceptions.
as relevant here,pursuant to section of the paa,chase acquired most of wamu real property leases,but not its leased bank premises.the paa defined bank premises as 
the banking houses,banking facilities,and teller facilities staffed or automated together with appurtenant parking,storage and service facilities and structures connecting remote facilities to banking houses,and land on which the foregoing are located,that are owned or leased by wamu and that are occupied by wamu as of bank closing.
instead,section a of the paa granted chase the option to accept or decline assignment of each bank premises within days of signing the paa 
the paa contained two more provisions that are important to the resolution of this appeal.first,section provided that the paa was entirely for the benefit of the fdic in its capacity both as a government entity the corporation and as receiver and chase as the assuming bank,and it expressly ruled out any intent to benefit third parties 
except as otherwise specifically provided in this agreement,nothing expressed or referred to in this agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person other than the receiver,the corporation and the assuming bank any legal or equitable right,remedy or claim under or with respect to this agreement or any provisions contained herein,it being the intention of the parties hereto that this agreement,the obligations and statements of responsibilities hereunder,and all other conditions and provisions hereof are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the receiver,the corporation and the assuming bank and for the benefit of no other person.
second,section provided that the agreement would be governed by federal law or,in the absence of controlling federal law,by the laws of the state where the main office of wamu is located.
by the end of the fdic and chase had agreed that wamu lease with hillside was a lease for bank premises.by january chase had notified both hillside and the fdic pursuant to section a of the paa that it had declined assignment of and would not assume the lease.prompted by chase notice of declination,the fdic determined that complying with the lease would burden its receivership of wamu.accordingly,in april the fdic notified hillside that it would exercise its authority under section e of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of firrea,e,to repudiate the lease.as a result of the repudiation,hillside recovery against the fdic was limited to the unpaid rent that had accrued before repudiation.see e.for its own reasons,however,hillside declined to seek recovery from the fdic under u.e.instead,hillside sought recovery from chase,taking the position that chase had assumed the lease under the paa and was in default.in turn,chase took the position that it did not assume the lease,and refused to pay the unpaid rent.
procedural history 
in march hillside sued chase in the eastern district of new york for failure to pay the amounts due under the lease.the fdic successfully moved to intervene.in may hillside moved for summary judgment.chase opposed the motion and for summary judgment,while the fdic also opposed the motion and to dismiss the suit under federal rule of civil procedure b or c.chase and the fdic argued principally that hillside lacked standing to sue chase for breach of the lease because hillside was neither a party to nor a beneficiary of the paa.
in october the district court denied all of the parties motions.see hillside metro,llc jpmorgan chase bank,n.hillside i,cv jg smg,wl.the court acknowledged that there was a split of authority on the issue of whether a landlord in hillside position had standing to sue in similar cases involving the fdic.it noted that some courts had held that the paa could not establish privity between the landlord and the assuming bank because the landlord was not an intended beneficiary of the paa,while other courts viewed the paa assignment provisions as establishing privity between the landlord and the assuming bank on the theory that the provisions effected an assignment of the lease to the bank.relying on steel citizens for a better environment,d,the district court concluded that hillside had standing to sue chase because hillside interpretation of the paa as having assigned the lease to chase plausibly placed chase and hillside in privity of estate and gave hillside a legally protected interest in the enforcement of the paa.it also concluded that hillside had standing to assert a claim under new york property law,even if the agreement precluded a breach of contract claim.
in denying the for summary judgment,the district court asserted that it had insufficient evidence to determine whether the property constituted bank premises under the agreement.it permitted the parties to submit more evidence on the issue.in may,with the benefit of additional evidence,the district court concluded that the lease was not for bank premises under the paa because the video store had not been fully converted into a bank by the time wamu failed.accordingly,it held that the lease was automatically assumed by chase through section of the paa and granted hillside motion for summary judgment as to chase liability 
chase and the fdic appealed.
discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is whether hillside has standing to sue chase for breach of the lease based on hillside own interpretation of the paa when it was neither a party to nor an intended beneficiary of the paa.in asserting that it has standing,hillside argues that under new york property law,which governs the lease,it had a right to have a court determine whether the paa assigned the lease to chase.the fdic responds that under federal common law or,alternatively,under new york common law only the parties to and intended benef
