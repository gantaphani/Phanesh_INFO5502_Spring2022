background 
this being an appeal from a denial of a motion to suppress and a conviction after a trial,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the government.see glasser united states.united states fields,cir united states peterson,cir.appellant was arrested by new york city detective robert martin and officer anthony bencivengo on the night of january.at that time,martin and bencivengo were in an unmarked police car looking for a murder suspect.they possessed a mugshot of the suspect and pedigree information that described him as a twenty black male,weighing pounds and being tall,with a visible scar on one arm.as they drove through the parkchester section of the bronx,martin spotted appellant walking on a sidewalk approximately one block from where the murder had taken place.from his viewpoint in the car,martin believed that appellant closely matched the picture of the suspect.martin then alerted bencivengo,who agreed that appellant might be the suspect.
martin stopped the car while still behind appellant,and bencivengo got out to follow appellant on foot.martin then drove the car past appellant and parked.martin got out of the car,approached appellant,and identified himself as a police officer.he told appellant that he would like to speak with him and asked appellant to put down a bag that he was carrying.as appellant placed the bag on the ground,he turned his body so that his right hand was no longer visible to martin.this alarmed martin,and he reached around appellant to grab his arm.in doing so,martin felt a hard object near appellant waist that felt like the butt of a gun.martin shouted a warning codeword to bencivengo,and they subdued and handcuffed appellant.martin and bencivengo thereafter retrieved a loaded gun from appellant waistband.the two policemen realized that appellant was not the murder suspect only after taking him into custody.
before appellant trial commenced,he moved to suppress the gun on the theory that it was the product of an invalid search.the district court denied this motion.appellant also requested,along with the government,that the district court question prospective jurors during voir dire about possible bias involving police officers.in particular,appellant wanted the district court to ask does any juror or any member of his or her family have any relationship or friendship with any city,state or federal law enforcement officer and would any juror attach greater weight to the testimony of a witness because he or she happens to be a government employee or law enforcement agent as opposed to a witness who is not so employed 
the district court declined to ask these questions.instead,in questioning each potential juror individually,the district court primarily asked about i where they lived ii where they worked iii whether they lived with any other adults and,if so,what were their occupations iv whether they had served on a jury before v whether they could be fair and impartial and vi whether they were willing to serve.
after the jury was selected and the trial began,the government presented evidence that the gun possessed by appellant came from and that he had previously been convicted for a felony under the name clement christopher tomlinson.the government also called martin and bencivengo to testify about the events leading up to appellant arrest.before bencivengo appeared as a witness,however,the government moved to preclude appellant from questioning him about an earlier finding by the civilian complaint review board that bencivengo,in an unrelated incident,had used excessive force against an arrestee.over appellant objection,the district court granted this motion,concluding that this evidence was not particularly probative and might distract the jury from the salient issues.
the jury convicted appellant,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
a motion to suppress 
appellant argues that the district court should have suppressed the gun as evidence because the police officers did not harbor a reasonable suspicion that he was the murder suspect when they stopped him.in reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we must uphold the district court findings unless they are clearly erroneous.see fields,at peterson,at.however,whether a suspicion leading to a search is reasonable is a question of mixed fact and law,which we review de novo.see united states bold,cir.
appellant relies principally upon the dissimilarity between his appearance and the description of the murder suspect.while the suspect was described as a twenty black male,weighing pounds and in height,appellant is years old,weighs pounds,and is in height.furthermore,unlike the suspect,he has no scar on his arm but does have a scar on his face,under his right eye.
the district court credited the testimony of the officers and concluded that the dissimilarity between the suspect description and appellant did not fatally undermine the reasonableness of the policemen suspicion.the district court compared the mugshot of the suspect carried by the officers on the night of the arrest with a photograph of appellant and concluded that they had similar facial features.the court also noted that martin and bencivengo had been informed by some sources that their suspect was,rather than,tall.finally,the court noted that martin and bencivengo saw appellant at night and in the middle of winter,when appellant was wearing a heavy coat.the district court concluded that the policemen discovered the gun only after acting on a reasonable suspicion.
we can not say that the district court conclusion was in error.reasonable suspicion is not a high threshold,and the requisite level of suspicion is considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence.united states tehrani,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,notwithstanding some differences in the description between the suspect and appellant,the match between the two men was,under the and a person in a heavy enough to justify a reasonable suspicion.see united states jackson,cir.
b voir dire 
appellant maintains that the district court erred when it refused to quiz prospective jurors during voir dire about their relationships with,and attitudes toward,police officers.a district court is accorded ample discretion in determining how best to conduct voir dire.united states,d see also united states millar,cir.moreover,a district court has broad discretion whether to pose a defendant requested voir dire questions.united states kyles,cir.accordingly,we will not reverse unless we determine that this discretion has been abused.see united states salameh,cir.
voir dire is necessarily a matter in which the trial court has extremely broad discretion.voir dire is of course an important part of trial proceedings,but federal trial judges are not required to ask every question that all is appropriate.court and counsel have somewhat different goals in voir dire.the court wants a fair and impartial jury to be chosen and to move expeditiously to the presentation of evidence.counsel want a jury favorable to their or voir dire aids them in exercising peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.counsel have an additional purpose in voir dire moreover and that involves exposing jurors to various arguments they intend to make at trial.counsel view voir dire as an opportunity for advocacy similar to,albeit not the equivalent of,openings or summations.this additional purpose has led to a long struggle between bench and both the state and federal courts,see,united states barnes,cir united states,cir united states bryant,per curiam in which the bar has sought the right to question jurors at great length.thus far,federal courts have successfully resisted such attempts.see united states diez,cir see also.a.a.
we are,therefore,reluctant to reverse a conviction solely because a particular question s was not asked on voir dire.because trial strategy and voir dire are inseparable,there will be,in any case,large numbers of questions that counsel would like to ask,or to have asked,in order to press their view of the case to potential jurors.on appeal,however,a party can easily claim that the failure to ask any one or series of questions impaired its exercise of peremptory challenges or created a possibility of a jury harboring a particular prejudice.in reviewing such a claim,therefore,we should recognize that the selection by a district judge of voir dire questions must balance i the need to afford counsel a feel as to each potential juror both to allow a reasonable exercise of challenges and to exclude individuals with viewpoints that might impair an impartial weighing of the evidence against ii the need to avoid use of the voir dire as a that delays the presentation of evidence.
the questioning of potential jurors on voir dire is,therefore,quintessentially a matter for the discretion of trial courts.indeed,the history of appellate court reversals for a district court failure to pose questions is a mixed one.for example,appellant relies heavily upon the ninth circuit decision in united states,cir.involved some facts similar to the present case,namely the predominance of police witnesses,and the ninth circuit reversed the district court for its failure to inquire whether prospective jurors had any bias for officers.id.at.however,since then,the ninth circuit has made a career of distinguishing that case.see,united states nielsen,cir united states payne,cir united states powell,cir.indeed,the district court in powell asked nearly identical questions during voir dire as the district court did in this case,and the ninth circuit ruled that it was sufficient to ask prospective jurors whether they could be fair generally,without making a more specific inquiry regarding the police.id.
this court appears never to have reversed a conviction for the failure to ask a particular question on the voir dire of prospective jurors.of course,a voir dire may be so insufficient as to call for a reversal,but the record viewed as a whole must show either i a voir dire so demonstrably brief and lacking in substance as to afford counsel too little information even to draw any conclusions about a potential juror general outlook,experience,communication skills,intelligence,or,united states rhodes,cir reversing because trial court voir dire question was so ambiguous that no prospective juror or counsel could be sure what exactly was asked ii a failure to inquire about,or warn against,a systematic or pervasive bias,including one that may be but existent at the time of trial,in the community that would have been cured by asking a question posed by a party,see,morgan illinois,d ham south carolina,d or iii a record viewed in its entirety suggesting a substantial possibility that a jury misunderstood its duty to weigh certain evidence fairly that would have been clarified by asking a requested voir dire question,united states gelb,cir.none of those conditions are met here.
appellant does not claim that the failure to ask the questions he posed rendered the voir dire here so perfunctory as to fall within i.
the nature of his argument does suggest,however,that the bias favoring officials was so pervasive in new york city that it should be asked in all cases in which the credibility of such officials is important in a criminal case.we do not exclude the possibility that,at some time or in some place,the existence of a systematic bias favoring officials may be,or have been,demonstrable,but that is not presently the case in the southern district of new york.
the new york times has reported,well before more recent highly publicized incidents involving violence by members of the new york city police department,that juries in new york city show a healthy skepticism of prosecution cases built entirely on the credibility of police officers.see clifford krauss,bratton announces plan to train officers to testify,times,at joe sexton,jurors question honesty of police,times,at joe sexton,types of perjury common among police officers are detailed,times,april,at.since those reports,the prosecution of the police officers in a case of an accidental shooting had to be moved from new york city to albany because of community anger,see people boss,per curiam changing venue for trial of police officers for accidental shooting of amadou diallo,and every officer charged in the cases involving the aggravated brutality toward abner louima,see united states aleman,cir aleman and rosario united states schwarz,cir schwarz,wiese,bruder,volpe,and bellomo united states volpe,cir volpe,was convicted by a officers whose convictions have been reversed by this court on the ground of legally insufficient evidence.see schwarz,at reversing convictions for conspiracy to obstruct justice in violation of.we therefore do not believe that there was such a pervasive bias favoring police officers in new york city at the time of trial as to render the failure to ask the questions proposed by appellant counsel reversible error per se.
the questions proposed by appellant were not that different from a range of other questions that counsel would like asked about potential witnesses.numerous trials involve witnesses who have occupations with reputations earned and,government officials,accountants,doctors,members of the who represent a vast array of ethnicities or personal appearances that are arguably the subject of stereotypes relevant to credibility.as the fourth circuit has remarked,if a district court must,on pain of reversal,ask the venire whether they would give heightened credibility to the testimony of a police officer when the government case depends on testimony,logic compels that a similar question be asked whenever the government case depends on the testimony of any identifiable class of witnesses that might conceivably be thought by jurors to be inherently credible,be they firefighters,priests,physicians,attorneys,butchers,bakers,or candlestick makers.united states lancaster,cir en banc.moreover,appellant argument would support claims for questions relating to various factual and other theories counsel intend to use at trial,can you believe that a skilled and reputed name any professional might name a corresponding professional mistake are you able to find for and compensate a person injured as a result of the mistake by a reputed professional and so on.
we turn then to iii,viewing the record in this case as a whole,whether there is a substantial possibility that the jury misunderstood its duty not to accord the testimony of officials credibility solely because of their office.we believe that the record rebuts any such danger.
in gelb,we rejected a claim that a failure to ask on voir dire cautionary questions about testimony of agents is per se reversible.at.we held,rather,that the issue essentially turns on weighing i the importance of testimony to the case as a whole,taking into account the extent to which the credibility of that testimony is challenged or is corroborated by witnesses and ii the extent to which the issue of testimony is covered by questions on voir dire and by the charge to the jury.see id.we recognize that gelb is distinguishable because the testimony in that case was of marginal importance,see,whereas such testimony was critical to the conviction here.nevertheless the record of the voir dire and charge to the jury in this case demonstrate that the jurors received adequate cautions about bias toward officers.
first,the questions asked would reveal whether the potential juror or a member of the juror household was in law enforcement,the most compelling circumstances with regard to the need for further inquiry.moreover,when such circumstances were revealed,the court followed up with pertinent questions regarding credibility.for example,near the beginning of the voir dire and in the presence
