petitioner water splash sued respondent menon,a former employee,in a texas state court,alleging that she had begun working for a competitor while still employed by water splash.because menon resided in canada,water splash obtained permission to effect service by mail.after menon declined to answer or otherwise enter an appearance,the trial court issued a default judgment for water splash.that court subsequently denied menon motion to set aside the judgment on the ground that she had not been properly served.on appeal,menon argued that service by mail does not comport with the requirements of the convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters hague service convention,which seeks to simplify,standardize,and generally improve the process of serving documents abroad,specifying certain approved methods of service and preempting inconsistent methods of service wherever it applies,volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk.the texas court of appeals agreed with menon,holding that the convention prohibited service of process by mail.article,the provision at issue,consists of articles b and c,which plainly address permissible methods of service,and article a,which provides that the convention will not interfere with the freedom to send judicial documents,by postal channels,directly to persons abroad,but does not expressly refer to service.
held the hague service convention does not prohibit service of process by mail.
a this court begins its analysis by looking to the treaty text and the context in which its words are used.see schlunk,at.the key word in article a send is a broad term,and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude the transmission of documents for the purpose of service.the structure of the convention strongly counsels against such an exclusion.the convention preamble and article limit the scope of the convention to service of documents abroad,and its full title includes the phrase service abroad.this court has also held that the scope of the convention is limited to service of documents,at.it would thus be quite strange if article a apparently alone among the convention provisions concerned something other than service of documents.indeed,such a reading would render article a superfluous.article function is to ensure that,generally,the convention shall not interfere with the activities described in a,b,and c.but since article already eliminates the possibility that the convention would apply to any communications that do not culminate in service,at,in order for article a to do any work,it must pertain to sending documents for the purposes of service.menon attempt to avoid this superfluity problem by suggesting that article a applies not to service of process but only to the service of judicial documents lacks any plausible textual footing in article.if the drafters wished to limit article a to a particular subset of documents,they could have said so as they did,in article,which refers to a writ of summons or an equivalent document.instead,article a uses the term judicial documents the same term featured in b and c.and the ordinary meaning of the word send is broad enough to cover the transmission of any judicial documents.accordingly,the text and structure of the convention indicate that article a encompasses service by mail.
b the main counterargument that article a phrase send judicial documents should mean something different than the phrase effect service of judicial documents in article b and article c is unpersuasive.first,it must contend with the compelling structural considerations strongly suggesting that article a pertains to service of documents.second,reading the word send as a broad concept that includes,but is not limited to,service is probably more plausible than interpreting the word to exclude service,and it does not create the same superfluity problem.third,the french version of the convention,which is equally authentic to the english version,schlunk,supra,at,uses the word adresser,which has consistently been understood to mean service or notice.at best,menon argument creates an ambiguity as to article a meaning.the court thus turns to additional tools of treaty interpretation,which comfortably resolve any lingering ambiguity in water splash favor.
c three extratextual sources are especially helpful in ascertaining article a meaning.first,the convention drafting history strongly suggests that the drafters understood that service by postal channels was permissible.second,in the since the convention was adopted,the executive branch has consistently maintained that the hague service convention allows service by mail.finally,other signatories to the convention have consistently adopted water splash view.
d the fact that article a encompasses service by mail does not mean that it affirmatively authorizes such service.rather,service by mail is permissible if the receiving state has not objected to service by mail and if such service is authorized under law.because the court of appeals concluded that the convention prohibited service by mail,it did not consider whether texas law authorizes the methods of service used by water splash.that and any other remaining issues are left to be considered on remand to the extent they are properly preserved.

water splash,petitioner tara menon 
on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of texas,fourteenth district 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the scope of the convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters,hague service convention.the purpose of that multilateral treaty is to simplify,standardize,and generally improve the process of serving documents abroad.preamble,see volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk.to that end,the hague service convention specifies certain approved methods of service and inconsistent methods of service wherever it applies,at.today we address a question that has divided the lower courts whether the convention prohibits service by mail.we hold that it does not.
petitioner water splash is a corporation that produces aquatic playground systems.respondent menon is a former employee of water splash.in,water splash sued menon in state court in texas,alleging that she had begun working for a competitor while still employed by water splash.app.water splash asserted several causes of action,including unfair competition,conversion,and tortious interference with business relations.because menon resided in canada,water splash sought and obtained permission to effect service by mail.ibid.after menon declined to answer or otherwise enter an appearance,the trial court issued a default judgment in favor of water splash.menon moved to set aside the judgment on the ground that she had not been properly served,but the trial court denied the motion.ibid.
menon appealed,arguing that service by mail does not comport with the requirements of the hague service convention.ibid.the texas court of appeals majority sided with menon and held that the convention prohibits service of process by mail,at.justice christopher dissented,at.the court of appeals declined to review the matter en banc,app,and the texas supreme court denied discretionary review,at.
the disagreement between the panel majority and justice christopher tracks a broader conflict among courts as to whether the convention permits service through postal channels.compare,bankston toyota motor,holding that the convention prohibits service by mail,and nuovo pignone,spa storman asia,same,with,brockmeyer may,holding that the convention allows service by mail,and ackermann levine,same.we granted certiorari to resolve that conflict.
the primary innovation of the hague service convention set out in articles is that it requires each state to establish a central authority to receive requests for service of documents from other countries.schlunk,supra,at.when a central authority receives an appropriate request,it must serve the documents or arrange for their service,and then provide a certificate of service.
submitting a request to a central authority is not,however,the only method of service approved by the convention.for example,article permits service through diplomatic and consular agents article provides that any two states can agree to methods of service not otherwise specified in the convention and article clarifies that the convention does not preempt any internal laws of its signatories that permit service from abroad via methods not otherwise allowed by the convention.
at issue in this case is article of the convention,the english text of which reads as follows 
provided the state of destination does not object,the present convention shall not interfere with 
a the freedom to send judicial documents,by postal channels,directly to persons abroad,
b the freedom of judicial officers,officials or other competent persons of the state of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers,officials or other competent persons of the state of destination,
c the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers,officials or other competent persons of the state of destination.at.
articles b and c,by their plain terms,address additional methods of service that are permitted by the convention unless the receiving state objects.by contrast,article a does not expressly refer to service.the question in this case is whether,despite this textual difference,the article a phrase send judicial documents encompasses sending documents for the purposes of service.
in interpreting treaties,we begin with the text of the treaty and the context in which the written words are used.schlunk,at internal quotation marks omitted.for present purposes,the key word in article a is send.this is a broad term and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude the transmission of documents for a particular purpose namely,service.moreover,the structure of the hague service convention strongly counsels against such a reading.
the key structural point is that the scope of the convention is limited to service of documents.several elements of the convention indicate as much.first,the preamble states that the convention is intended to ensure that judicial and extrajudicial documents to be served abroad shall be brought to the notice of the addressee in sufficient time.emphasis added.and article defines the convention scope by stating that the convention shall apply in all cases,in civil or commercial matters,where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.emphasis added.even the convention full title reflects that the convention concerns service abroad.
we have also held as much.schlunk,at stating that the convention applies only to documents transmitted for service abroad as we explained,a preliminary draft of article was criticized because it suggested that the convention could apply to transmissions abroad that do not culminate in service.ibid.the final version of article,however,eliminates this possibility.ibid.the wording of article makes clear that the convention applies only when there is both transmission of a document from the requesting state to the receiving state,and service upon the person for whom it is intended.ibid.
in short,the text of the convention reveals,and we have explicitly held,that the scope of the convention is limited to service of documents.in light of that,it would be quite strange if article a apparently alone among the convention provisions concerned something other than service of documents.
indeed,under that reading,article a would be superfluous.the function of article is to ensure that,absent objection from the receiving state,the convention shall not interfere with the activities described in a,b and c.but article already eliminates the possibility that the convention would apply to any communications that do not culminate in service,at,so it is hard to imagine how the convention could interfere with any communications.accordingly,in order for article a to do any work,it must pertain to sending documents for the purposes of service.
menon attempts to avoid this superfluity problem by suggesting that article a does refer to serving documents but only some documents.specifically,she makes a distinction between two categories of service.according to menon,article a does not apply to service of process which we have defined as a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action,at.but article a does apply,menon suggests,to the service of judicial documents that is,any additional documents which may have to be served later in the litigation.brief for respondent.the problem with this argument is that it lacks any plausible textual footing in article 
if the drafters wished to limit article a to a particular subset of documents,they presumably would have said so as they did,for example,in article,which refers to a writ of summons or an equivalent document.instead,article a uses the term judicial documents the same term that is featured in b and c.accordingly,the notion that article a governs a different set of documents than b or c is hard to fathom.and it certainly derives no support from the use of the word send,whose ordinary meaning is broad enough to cover the transmission of any judicial documents including documents.nothing about the word send suggests that article a is narrower than b and c,let alone that article a is somehow limited to documents.
ultimately,menon wishes to read the phrase send judicial documents as serve a subset of judicial documents.that is an entirely atextual reading,and menon offers no sustained argument in support of it.therefore,the only way to escape the conclusion that article a includes service of process is to assert that it does not cover service of documents at all and,as shown above,that reading is structurally implausible and renders article a superfluous.
the text and structure of the hague service convention,then,strongly suggest that article a pertains to service of documents.the only significant counterargument is that,unlike many other provisions in the convention,article a does not include the word service or any of its variants.the article a phrase send judicial documents,the argument goes,should mean something different than the phrase effect service of judicial documents in the other two subparts of article.
this argument does not win the day for several reasons.first,it must contend with the compelling structural considerations discussed above.see air france saks,treaty interpretation must take account of the context in which the written words are used university of.southwestern medical center nassar,slip,at just as congress choice of words is presumed to be deliberate,so too are its structural choices 
second,the argument fails on its own terms.assume for a second that the word send must mean something other than serve.that would not imply that article a must exclude service.instead,send ing could be a broader concept that includes service but is not limited to it.that reading of the word send is probably more plausible than interpreting it to exclude service,and it does not create the same superfluity problem 
third,it must be remembered that the french version of the convention is equally authentic to the english version.schlunk,at.menon does not seriously engage with the convention french text.but the word adresser the french counterpart to the word send in article a has been consistently interpreted as meaning service or notice.hague conference on private int l law,practical handbook on the operation of the service convention,ed.
in short,the most that could possibly be said for this argument is that it creates an ambiguity as to article a meaning.and when a treaty provision is ambiguous,the court may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.schlunk,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.as discussed below,these traditional tools of treaty interpretation comfortably resolve any lingering ambiguity in water splash favor.
three extratextual sources are especially helpful in ascertaining article a meaning the convention drafting history,the views of the executive,and the views of other signatories.
drafting history has often been used in treaty interpretation.see medellín texas,saks,supra,at see also schlunk,supra,at analyzing the negotiating history of the hague service convention.here,the convention drafting history strongly suggests that article a allows service through postal channels.
philip amram was the member of the united states delegation who was most closely involved in the drafting of the convention.see exec,sess.app.exec.statement of state department deputy legal adviser richard kearney.a few months before the convention was signed,he published an article describing and summarizing it.in that article,he stated that article permits direct service by mail unless the receiving state objects to such service.the proposed international convention on the service of documents abroad,
along similar lines,the rapporteur report on a draft version of article which did not materially differ from the final version stated that the provision of paragraph also permits service by telegram and that the drafters did not accept the proposal that postal channels be limited to registered mail.ristau a,at.in other words,it was clearly understood that service by postal channels was permissible,and the only question was whether it should be limited to registered mail.
the court also gives great weight to the executive branch interpretation of a treaty.abbott abbott,internal quotation marks omitted.in the half century since the convention was adopted,the executive has consistently maintained that the hague service convention allows service by mail.
when president johnson transmitted the convention to the senate for its advice and consent,he included a report by secretary of state dean rusk.that report stated that article permits direct service by mail unless the receiving state objects to such service.convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters message from the president of the united states,exec.doc.c.
in,the eighth circuit issued bankston,the first federal court of appeals decision holding that the hague service convention prohibits service by mail,at.the state department expressed its disagreement with bankston in a letter addressed to the administrative office of the courts and the national center for state courts.see notice of other documents,united states department of state opinion regarding the bankston case and service by mail to japan under the hague service convention,excerpts of,letter.the letter stated that bankston is incorrect to the extent that it suggests that the hague convention does not permit as a method of service of process the sending of a copy of a summons and complaint by registered mail to a defendant in a foreign country.at.the state department takes the same position on its website 
finally,this court has given considerable weight to the views of other parties to a treaty.abbott,at internal quotation marks omitted see lozano montoya alvarez,slip,at noting the importance of read ing the treaty in a manner consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties internal quotation marks omitted.and other signatories to the convention have consistently adopted water splash view.
multiple foreign courts have held that the hague service convention allows for service by mail in addition,several of the convention signatories have either objected,or declined to object,to service by mail under article,thereby acknowledging that article encompasses service by mail finally,several special commissions comprising numerous contracting states have expressly stated that the convention does not prohibit service by mail by contrast,menon identifies no evidence that any signatory has ever rejected water splash view.
in short,the traditional tools of treaty interpretation unmistakably demonstrate that article a encompasses service by mail.to be clear,this does not mean that the convention affirmatively authorizes service by mail.article a simply provides that,as long as the receiving state does not object,the convention does not interfere with the freedom to serve documents through postal channels.in other words,in cases governed by the hague service convention,service by mail is permissible if two conditions are met first,the receiving state has not objected to service by mail and second,service by mail is authorized under law.see brockmeyer,at.
because the court of appeals concluded that the convention prohibited service by mail outright,it had no occasion to consider whether texas law authorizes the methods of service used by water splash.we leave that question,and any other remaining issues,to be considered on remand to the extent they are properly preserved.
for these reasons,we vacate the judgment of the court of appeals,and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
justice gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
see black law dictionary ed.defining send,in part,as t o cause to be moved or conveyed from a present location to another place,to deposit a writing or notice in the mail 
the argument also assumes that the scope of the convention is not limited to service of process otherwise,article a would be superfluous even under menon reading.schlunk can be read to suggest that this assumption is wrong,at see ristau,international judicial assistance,ed.ristau stating that the english term service in the convention means the formal delivery of a legal document to the addressee in such a manner as to legally charge him with notice of the institution of a legal proceeding for the purposes of this discussion,we will assume,arguendo,that menon assumption is correct.
another plausible explanation for the distinct terminology of article a is that it is the only provision in the convention that specifically contemplates direct service,without the use of an intermediary.see brief for united states as amicus curiae i n contrast to article a,all other methods of service identified in the convention require the affirmative engagement of an intermediary to effect service the use of the word send may simply have been intended to reflect that distinction.
two years later,amram testified to the same effect before the senate foreign relations committee.exec,at stating that service by central authority is not obligatory,and that other available techniques included direct service by mail
