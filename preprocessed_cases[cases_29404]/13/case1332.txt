nelson arriaga arriaga petitions for review of a final order of removal of the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia dismissed arriaga appeal from the decision of the immigration judge ij paul gagnon,which sustained arriaga removability under the subsection of the immigration and nationality act ina that renders deportable any alien convicted of stalking.see ina a e i,a e i the ina stalking provision.in re arriaga,aff g no.immig.hartford.arriaga concedes that he was convicted of stalking under connecticut penal code,but he argues that the ina stalking provision,which does not define stalking,is unconstitutionally vague,on its face and as applied.this challenge presents a question of first impression in the courts of appeals.
background 
arriaga,a native and citizen of honduras,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in october,arriaga pled guilty in connecticut superior court to stalking in the second degree under connecticut general statutes a 
a person is guilty of stalking in the second degree when,with intent to cause another person to fear for his physical safety,he wilfully and repeatedly follows or lies in wait for such other person and causes such other person to reasonably fear for his physical safety.
in march,the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings against arriaga pursuant to ina a e i,which provides any alien who at any time after admission is convicted of a crime of domestic violence,a crime of stalking,or a crime of child abuse,child neglect,or child abandonment is deportable.a e i emphasis added.the ins added a second charge of deportability pursuant to ina a a i,which provides for the removal of an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after the date of admission.see a a i.
at his hearing in july,arriaga conceded the conviction,but argued that the offense was insufficiently violent or depraved to justify removal under the applicable statutes.the ij ruled arriaga removable because his crime was one of moral turpitude.but in october,the bia,citing the ij failure to provide reasons and bases for his conclusion,remanded for the ij to prepare a full decision.
the ij november decision found that arriaga is removable under both grounds charged by the ins.as to stalking,undefined in the ina,the ij looked to the law dictionary and decided that the common law and the connecticut statute criminalize the same type of behavior that of following another individual with the intent of causing him or her harm or to fear harm.the ij accordingly found that arriaga connecticut conviction qualified as a conviction for a crime of stalking under the ina.the ij also ruled that stalking involves moral turpitude because it entails predatory and inherently threatening conduct.
in february,the bia affirmed the removal order and dismissed the appeal,stating i nasmuch as arriaga conviction is clearly a crime of stalking,we find no error in the immigration judge conclusion that he is deportable pursuant to section a e i.the bia declined to consider whether arriaga is also deportable for having been convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude.the bia recognized that the agency lacks jurisdiction to consider arriaga argument that the ina stalking provision is unconstitutionally vague.see matter of,bia matter of c,bia see also zerrei gonzales,cir per curiam.
discussion 
on this appeal,arriaga challenges only the constitutionality of the ina stalking provision,arguing that the provision is void for vagueness on its face,and as applied in his case,because it does not define the word stalking.we review de novo constitutional challenges to a statutory provision.see mcnary haitian refugee,d field day,llc county of suffolk,cir.
it is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.grayned city of rockford,d.t he doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d.
the void for vagueness doctrine is chiefly applied to criminal legislation.laws with civil consequences receive less exacting vagueness scrutiny.see vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d expressing greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.chatin coombe,cir scrutinizing closely a prison regulation prohibiting religious services because its penalties were more akin to criminal than civil penalties see also jordan de george.reviewing deportation provision for vagueness because of the grave nature of the penalty of forfeiting one residence.the statute reviewed in jordan de george was an earlier version of the same section of the ina at issue here specifically,the subpart authorizing deportation for crimes involving moral turpitude.the court emphasized that this statute does not declare certain conduct to be criminal and that i ts function is to apprise aliens of the consequences which follow after conviction and sentence.id.at.however,because deportation is a drastic measure,the court assessed the statute for vagueness as if it imposed a criminal penalty.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also restrepo mcelroy,cir deportation,like some other kinds of civil sanctions,combines an unmistakable punitive aspect with aspects.we need not decide whether the ina stalking provision should be assessed as a civil or criminal statute because even under the close scrutiny accorded criminal laws,arriaga vagueness challenge fails.
claims of facial invalidity are generally limited to statutes that threaten first amendment interests.see chapman united states,d first amendment freedoms are not infringed by the statute at issue,so the vagueness claim must be evaluated as the statute is applied.arriaga does not claim that the ina stalking provision compromised his first amendment rights.vagueness challenges to statutes not threatening first amendment interests are examined in light of the facts of the case at hand the statute is judged on an basis.maynard cartwright,d see united states rybicki,cir en banc w hen the interpretation of a statute does not implicate first amendment rights,it is assessed for vagueness only as applied,in light of the specific facts of the case at hand and not with regard to the statute facial validity.quoting united states nadi,cir.
although we have suggested that some facial vagueness challenges may be brought where fundamental rights are implicated outside the first amendment context,we need not pursue that issue because arriaga has not identified a fundamental right compromised by the ina stalking provision.see farrell burke,cir noting that rybicki suggests that facial vagueness challenges may be brought where other fundamental rights are at stake.arriaga characterizes the ina stalking provision as a restriction on the right to travel and to interstate movement.see mem l hosp.maricopa county,d recognizing the right of interstate travel as a basic constitutional freedom.however,the ina provision does not prohibit stalking it provides for removal of aliens who have been convicted of that offense.in that light,the ina stalking provision is an exercise of the fundamental authority of the political branches to exclude undesirable aliens.o ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.fiallo bell,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted galvan press.policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are peculiarly concerned with the political conduct of government and the formulation of these policies is entrusted exclusively to congress.
opportunities to challenge the underlying offense of stalking as a violation of arriaga right to travel were presented at his criminal trial,or on appeal or collateral review of that conviction.however,collateral attack on a state criminal conviction is not available on a petition to review the bia removal decision.see abimbola ashcroft,cir.having conceded the validity of his stalking conviction for the purposes of the immigration laws,arriaga can not interpose the right to travel as the predicate for a facial challenge to the statute that treats the conviction as a ground for removal 
in deciding the vagueness challenge as applied to arriaga case,we employ the kolender inquiry does the ina stalking provision provide a sufficient notice and b limits on the discretion of law enforcement authorities kolender,at.see thibodeau portuondo,cir.
a.the first kolender inquiry asks whether the statute,as written,provides notice sufficient to alert ordinary people as to what conduct is prohibited.kolender,at.no one may be required at peril of life,liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.all are entitled to be informed as to what the state commands or forbids.lanzetta new jersey.statutes need not,however,achieve meticulous specificity,which would come at the cost of flexibility and reasonable breadth.grayned,at.the test is whether the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.jordan de george.citing connally constr.
jordan involved facts analogous to the present case.an alien twice convicted of fraud and tax evasion was subject to deportation pursuant to the predecessor version of the ina provision authorizing removal for crimes involving moral turpitude,a capacious phrase undefined in the statute.jordan,at.in rejecting a vagueness challenge,the court noted that while use of the phrase was widespread across a variety of statutes,n o case has been decided holding that the phrase is vague,nor are we able to find any trace of judicial expression which hints that the phrase is so meaningless as to be a deprivation of due process.id.at.the court further observed 
d ifficulty in determining whether certain marginal offenses are within the meaning of the language under attack does not automatically render a statute unconstitutional for indefiniteness.impossible standards of specificity are not required.
id.at.citation omitted.measuring the disputed phrase by common understanding and practices,the court concluded that crimes of fraud universally have been deemed to involve moral turpitude.id.at.the court held that doubt as to the adequacy of a standard in less obvious cases does not render that standard unconstitutional for vagueness.id.
because the ina does not define stalking,we accordingly measure the term by common understanding and practices to determine whether it gives sufficiently definite warning of the conduct subject to deportation.see lopez gonzales,d relying on everyday understanding and regular usage to define the term trafficking as used in the ina.a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states,d construing bribery in the travel act by its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.
the crime of stalking along with crimes of domestic violence,violations of protection orders,and crimes against children was added as a ground for deportation in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div,title a,stat,when iirira was adopted,laws against stalking were fairly recent.the first state to criminalize stalking by statute was california,in.see code current version.by,over half the states had enacted similar statutes.today,stalking is a crime in every state,and interstate travel for stalking is a federal offense.see see generally wayne lafave,substantive criminal law ed.supp.
though stalking is an offense unknown to the common law,consensus as to its meaning was aided by a model law commissioned by the justice department national institute of justice set out in the margin a working definition of stalking might be persistent and intrusive conduct directed at a specific person that conveys menace and that would cause a reasonable person to fear.this working definition comports with the definition found in treatises,see lafave,substantive criminal law threats,and in law dictionaries,see black law dictionary ed defining stalking as following,or loitering near another,often surreptitiously,with the purpose of annoying or harassing that person or committing a further crime such as assault or battery barron law dictionary ed defining stalking as persistent,distressing,or threatening behavior consisting of at least two elements the actor must repeatedly follow the victim and must engage in conduct that annoys or alarms the victim and serves no legitimate purpose.
in virtually every state,stalking entails conduct beyond a single occasion,intentionally or purposefully directed at a specific person,with the consequence of instilling fear in that person.state penal codes vary considerably in such particulars as the types of conduct,following,pursuing,surveilling,cyberstalking,the level of intent general or specific,and the standard of fear objective or subjective.see national center for victims of crime,stalking resource center,analyzing stalking laws,document id last visited march.the core meaning of stalking is demonstrated by the failure of almost every challenge brought against state stalking laws.see people stuart,collecting state court decisions upholding stalking laws and noting that vagueness challenges to stalking statutes have almost uniformly been rejected by reviewing courts jordan,at.rejecting vagueness challenge to crime involving moral turpitude where no other court found the phrase vague.
arriaga argues that variations among state penal codes as to the necessary elements of a stalking crime invalidate the ina use of the term.this argument is defeated by the rule that,absent contrary congressional intent,federal statutes are not to be construed so that their application is dependent on state law.see taylor united states,d construing burglary as used in federal sentencing statute according to its generic,contemporary meaning as used in the criminal codes of most states dickerson new banner,d t he application of federal legislation is nationwide and at times the federal program would be impaired if state law were to control.united states turley,d i n the absence of a plain indication of an intent to incorporate diverse state laws into a federal criminal statute,the meaning of the federal statute should not be dependent on state law.
uniformity among state law definitions of stalking is therefore unnecessary to give meaning to the term as used in the federal statute.we read the ina stalking provision to incorporate the generally accepted contemporary meaning of stalking as discussed above,regardless of the exact definition or label used in the various penal statutes.taylor,at.so construed,the ina stalking provision is sufficiently definite such that ordinary people would understand which conduct is prohibited.
as applied to arriaga,the ina stalking provision adequately warned him that a conviction under connecticut stalking law would subject him to deportation.arriaga pleaded guilty to stalking in the second degree under connecticut law,which constitutes his admission that with intent to cause another person to fear for his physical safety,he wilfully and repeatedly follow ed or l ay in wait for such other person and cause d such other person to reasonably fear for his physical safety.a.arriaga raised no constitutional objection to his conviction or to the connecticut law,which in any event has already withstood challenges for vagueness.see state marsala.holding that section is not unconstitutionally vague on its face,cert.denied,see also state cummings,terms repeatedly,follows,and lies in wait,as used in section,were not unconstitutionally vague.arriaga has thus conceded the validity of his stalking conviction for the purpose of applying the immigration laws.the remaining question is whether that conviction was stalking as used in the ina.see jordan,at.limiting vagueness assessment of crimes of moral turpitude to determining w
