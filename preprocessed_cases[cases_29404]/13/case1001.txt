safelite group,and its subsidiary,administrator safelite solutions llc,collectively safelite,appeal from a denial of a preliminary injunction against enforcement of connecticut public act pa,an act concerning automotive glass work.safelite claims that the act violates the first amendment because it is an impermissible constraint on commercial speech.
we hold that the district court erred in applying rational basis review under zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio,but rather should have applied intermediate scrutiny under central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york.concluding that the statute can not survive such scrutiny on the present record,we vacate and order an injunction preventing enforcement of public act c.
background 
we begin by describing the commercial context.safelite operates an insurance claims management company throughout the united states.its affiliate,safelite autoglass,operates in connecticut and provides repair and replacement.
when car owners with a claim concerning call their insurance company,they may,depending on the insurance company,be connected to safelite solutions.during this call,a safelite solutions representative reads a script that explains the consumer repair options.if practicable,the script recommends safelite autoglass to do the repairs.if a safelite autoglass facility is not available,the agent may recommend a shop that is on a list of seventy shops by safelite solutions.in order to be included on this list,the local repair shop must meet certain criteria and qualifications,and sign a participation agreement.
under connecticut law,automobile insurers and claims administrators are prohibited from requiring where repairs should be made and must give a notice of a right to choose on appraisals or estimates.according to the statute,appraisers may not require that appraisals or repairs be made in a specified facility or repair shop or shops.id.a.moreover,
n o insurance company doing business in connecticut,or agent or adjuster for such company shall require any insured to use a specific person for the provision of automobile physical damage repairs,automobile glass replacement,glass repair service or glass products,or state that choosing a facility other than a motor vehicle repair shop participating in a motor vehicle program established by such company will result in delays in repairing the motor vehicle or a lack of guarantee for repair work.
id.b.furthermore,any written appraisal or estimate must contain the following language in bold and in no less than font 
you have the right to choose the licensed repair shop where the damage to your motor vehicle will be repaired.
id.c.safelite alleges its compliance with this law.although not required by law,the safelite solutions script informs consumers of its affiliation with safelite autoglass.
the connecticut general assembly undertook an examination of the business model adopted by safelite with regard to repair.in may,it passed pa,which took effect on january.the act reads in relevant part 
no glass claims representative for an insurance company doing business in this state or a claims administrator for such company shall provide an insured with the name of,schedule an appointment for an insured with or direct an insured to,a licensed glass shop that is owned by a such company,b such claims administrator,or c the same parent company as such insurance company or claims administrator,unless such representative or claims administrator provides the insured with the name of at least one additional licensed glass shop in the area where the automotive glass work is to be performed.
pa c.thus,section prohibits insurance companies and claims administrators from requiring insureds to patronize their affiliates for repair purposes.pa additionally prohibits them from mentioning their affiliates with regard to glass claims unless they also name a competitor.
the legislative history of pa revealed no consumer dissatisfaction with safelite business model but substantial concerns on the part of unaffiliated glass dealers.while the connecticut insurance department stated that current law,as described above,provided adequate protection for consumers several legislators stated that pa was needed to protect local glass dealers not affiliated with safelite 
safelite brought the present action on july,challenging pa as infringing its first amendment rights and constituting discrimination against interstate commerce under the commerce clause.safelite moved for a preliminary injunction,which was denied by the district court.safelite brought the present appeal.the law took effect on january.safelite states,without objection,that it has since complied with pa.

a rational basis review versus intermediate scrutiny 
when a party challenges a law or regulation on the basis that it restricts or impermissibly regulates speech protected by the first amendment,we first look at the genre of speech involved.
it is undisputed that the speech in this case is commercial speech entitled to the protection of the first amendment,albeit to protection somewhat less extensive than that afforded noncommercial speech.zauderer,at.the states and the federal government are free to prevent the dissemination of commercial speech that is false,deceptive,or misleading,or that proposes an illegal transaction.commercial speech that is not false or deceptive and does not concern unlawful activities,however,may be restricted only in the service of a substantial governmental interest,and only through means that directly advance that interest.id.at citing central hudson,at other internal citations omitted.
the regulation of commercial speech is subject to different levels of review,depending on the nature of the law.in central hudson,the court established that a restriction on commercial speech is subject to intermediate scrutiny,that is,a determination of whether the restriction directly advances a substantial governmental interest and is not overly restrictive.at.in zauderer,however,the court created an exception that an informational disclosure law as opposed to a prohibition on speech was subject to rational review,that is,a determination of whether the required disclosure is reasonably related to the state interest.at.
the district court found that pa was simply an informational disclosure law and accordingly applied the rational basis review test.safelite grp.jepsen,jba,wl,at.we disagree and hold that the district court should have applied intermediate scrutiny under central hudson.
zauderer involved a state law that regulated commercial speech by attorneys,specifically whether an attorney could solicit business by running newspaper advertisements containing nondeceptive illustrations and legal advice,and whether the state could seek to prevent potential deception of the public by requiring attorneys to disclose in their advertising certain information regarding fee arrangements.at.the plaintiff in zauderer was an attorney who ran a small advertisement in the columbus citizen journal advising its readers that his law firm would represent defendants in drunken driving cases and that his clients full legal fee would be refunded if they were convicted of drunk driving.id.at alterations omitted.the attorney was disciplined by the office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio for violating the ohio code of professional responsibility,which requires that a client bear certain costs even if the client loses.id.at.
in applying rational basis review,the court found that by requiring the attorneys to state that the client may have to bear
