catherine mirabilio,a tenured culinary arts teacher,alleges that the regional school board failed to provide notice and a hearing before reducing her position to.she appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut chatigny,dismissing her claim that the school board thereby deprived her of her due process rights under the fourteenth amendment and violated connecticut general statute.because the reduction in hours and salary does not constitute a termination under connecticut law,we conclude that mirabilio was not entitled to notice or a hearing before the school board decision.
mirabilio was employed by connecticut regional school district board as a teacher.in may,the superintendent of schools informed her by letter that,under the school district budget,her position had been reduced to,commencing with the school year.rather than contesting the board decision by requesting an administrative hearing,mirabilio filed a lawsuit in connecticut superior court in september,alleging that the board violated her due process and equal protection rights by failing to provide her with notice and a hearing prior to reducing her work hours.she sought full reinstatement to her former position,reimbursement of lost salary and benefits,and other money damages.
the board removed the case to federal court and soon after filed a motion to dismiss for failure to sufficiently allege a constitutional or statutory violation or,in the alternative,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the board motion was granted the equal protection claim was dismissed with prejudice and the due process claim was dismissed without prejudice.mirabilio amended complaint,filed in october,reasserted her due process claim,and the board again moved to dismiss on the same grounds as before.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint,holding that,under settled connecticut law,i only a termination of a teaching position triggers a right to prior notice and a hearing,and ii reduction of hours from to did not constitute such a termination.this appeal followed.

connecticut law requires that,p rior to terminating a tenured teacher employment contract,the superintendent shall give the teacher concerned a written notice that termination of such teacher contract is under consideration and the teacher must be given the opportunity to file a written request for a hearing,which will be held shortly thereafter.d.it is clear that section create s a protectable property interest.zimmerman bd.of educ.of town of branford.although t he right to continued employment is a property right protected under the due process clause,see sekor bd.of educ.of the town of ridgefield,citations and alterations omitted,personnel decisions short of termination do not constitute a deprivation of a property interest cognizable under the fourteenth amendment.wargat long.emphasis added.
the connecticut supreme court has consistently held that t he administrative remedy provided in general statutes d does not apply to plaintiffs whose positions were being eliminated but whose employment with the board continued.school administrators ass of new haven dow,citing candelori bd.of educ.of the city of new britain,delagorges bd.of educ.of the town city of west haven.an employee reassigned to a position is not considered terminated for purposes of the statute even if paying position is not considered terminated for purposes of the statute even if the pay cut is substantial.see,candelori,at,new teaching positions resulting in substantially lower salary were not classified as terminations.
the plain text of the statute supports this view.section defines employment,f or the purposes of this section,as a teacher employment in a position at a salary rate of fifty per cent or more of the salary rate of such teacher in such position if such position were.a.since mirabilio salary was reduced by exactly percent,her new position is still deemed employment under the statute.because she remains a employee despite the reductions in time and salary,mirabilio was not terminated and no due process right was triggered.
mirabilio was therefore not deprived of her right to continued employment,and was not entitled to notice and a hearing before her hours and salary were reduced.
our colleague,deploring activism,dissents on the procedural issue of whether federal courts are obliged to certify questions of state law that have not been answered definitely by the state highest court consigning competing values to a footnote.with respect,deciding this case is activity,not activism.the dissent is expressly agnostic as to the merits,but the answer that the dissent would seek by certification has already been given,as the following analysis demonstrates.
the dissent distinguishes delagorges and candelori on the sole ground that the plaintiffs were administrators,not teachers.however,the connecticut supreme court has clarified that the decisive point in those cases was that the plaintiffs remained employed notwithstanding the substantial pay reduction.see cimochowski hartford pub,we held in delagorges that,when administrators are reassigned to classroom teaching positions rather than being fired outright,the teacher tenure act does not apply.id.at,i n delagorges we concluded that,because the two plaintiffs had not been terminated,the teacher tenure act did not apply.see also.educ.ass state bd.of labor relations,in delagorges,the court held that the transfer of two high school administrators to classroom positions was merely a reassignment which did not entitle the administrators to judicial review of the board of education decision under the teacher tenure act.
the dissent relies on cimochowski observation that administrators and teachers have differing levels of protection.at.but this distinction has no bearing on whether reassignment constitutes a termination.the very passage quoted by the dissent explains that administrators also enjoy a property right in a teaching position.and citing delagorges cimochowski observes that j udicial interposition into every reassignment of teaching or administrative personnel would carry substantial potential for administrative chaos.id.at,emphasis added.cimochowski conclusion that not all reassignments of teachers or administrators constitute a termination under the teacher tenure act follows plainly from the statutory text,which limits the reassignments that constitute termination to those that reduce a teacher salary below fifty percent of the current salary.see.a.
thus cimochowski i holds that administrators and teachers alike are covered by the teacher tenure act,and ii emphasizes that its holding is fully consistent with delagorges.there is no reason to ask the connecticut supreme court whether it meant what it said in cimochowski.why push on an open door 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
i would certify this case to the connecticut supreme court,and i write to record my strong dissent from our failure to do so.
judicial activism comes in many forms.one of the most unjustified is when a federal court,for no good reason,reaches out and answers an undetermined question of state law doing this,rather than certifying the question to the state highest court,impedes the state from determining the course of its own law,and subjects the parties to a decision that may be wrong and can not subsequently be corrected even if later the state has an opportunity to make its law clear this is especially unfortunate when the party against whom
