the wife and children of a former employee of the united states central intelligence agency the cia brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on september,by filing a heavily redacted complaint naming four defendants the cia,the director of the cia,the united states,and another federal agency the identity of which is redacted.the government responded by invoking the privilege with respect to allegedly classified information related to the events giving rise to the plaintiffs claims.it also moved to dismiss on the ground that litigation could proceed no further without disclosure of that information.
the district court laura taylor swain,judge,having reviewed ex parte and in camera the complaint and a classified declaration of the of the cia explaining why in his opinion the information in question qualified as state secrets,concluded that the government had properly invoked the privilege.the court thereupon granted the defendants motion to dismiss.
the plaintiffs argue on appeal that the government violated their constitutional right of access to the courts by refusing to provide plaintiffs counsel with secure facilities that would allow counsel to prepare an opposition to the government assertion of the privilege.specifically,counsel was denied permission to view the unredacted,classified version of the complaint,which he himself had drafted,and to use secure facilities necessary to prepare and submit at least some of the potentially privileged and classified information to the district court.the plaintiffs also assert that inasmuch as jane doe is unable to leave foreign country a,compl.and counsel is based in washington,the government is constitutionally obliged to provide secure facilities to permit doe and counsel to communicate about these matters by telephone or email.
the plaintiffs have no right to use material that is alleged by the government to contain state secrets in order to participate in the district court review of the bona fides of the government allegation.under controlling case law,that review was be conducted ex parte and in camera.we therefore conclude that even if the government,as the plaintiffs allege,prevented them from providing the necessary relevant information to their counsel and precluded their counsel from drafting and filing a substantive opposition brief using that information,pls.br,those actions did not violate the plaintiffs right of access to the courts.moreover,insofar as the plaintiffs argue that the government classification procedures unconstitutionally abridged their right to communicate with counsel,we conclude that the plaintiffs have established no infringement of any such right.
the judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.
background 
the plaintiffs public allegations 
by declaration,the plaintiffs counsel states that he regularly represents employees and former employees of the cia,and,in that capacity,has a secrecy agreement with the cia.decl.of mark zaid,june.that agreement permits him limited access to some of the classified information known to his clients,but requires him to submit all contemplated substantive court filings to the cia before filing so that it may conduct a classification review of the information therein.id.plaintiff jane doe also has signed various agreements.pursuant to the plaintiffs counsel agreement,the complaint was redacted to delete references to information the cia considered to be classified and was filed in redacted form in the public files of the district court.the redactions obscure much of the substance of the plaintiffs allegations.
for purposes of this appeal,we rely on the district court description of the redacted complaint in its publicly filed memorandum opinion and order granting the government motions.doe cent.intelligence agency,civ.lts fm,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
plaintiff jane doe is the wife of a former employee of the cia who remains in covert status.the other three plaintiffs are the minor children of jane doe and her husband.the complaint alleges that jane doe husband was summarily separated from his cia employment,for a reason that is redacted as classified,and terminated immediately for unspecified reasons.plaintiffs departed for foreign country a,where they currently reside because the cia has refused to provide any assistance,medical or otherwise.
the complaint alleges that plaintiffs are unable to leave foreign country a and that plaintiff jane doe is a virtual prisoner in her home.she is constantly fearful of eventual detection,for a reason that is redacted as classified.although plaintiff jane doe allegedly receives medical treatment and psychological counseling,she claims that the cia has demanded that she not disclose the basis for her apprehension to her medical professionals,while simultaneously refusing to provide her alternative treatment.plaintiff jane doe alleges that she suffers severe emotional distress producing physical symptoms from fear,and lives in constant fear the reason for her alleged fear is redacted as classified.
id.citations omitted.the plaintiffs redacted complaint asserts claims for damages and for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to the administrative procedures act,et,the privacy act,et,specified federal constitutional provisions,and unspecified new york state laws pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca,et 
the invocation of the privilege and the motion to dismiss 
after the redacted complaint was filed,the government requested,and the district court granted,an extension of several additional months time within which to respond.the government eventually did so,submitting for the court public files a declaration by porter goss,the director of the cia at the time,asserting a claim of state secrets privilege over the classified information described in a supplementary classified declaration submitted for the court ex parte,in camera review.formal claim of state secrets privilege by porter goss,director central intelligence agency.director goss declared that he was asserting the privilege as the head of the cia and after personal consideration of the matter.id.
goss public declaration did not describe the classified information at issue because,he said,he had determined that the bases for the assertion of the state secrets privilege can not be filed on the public court record,or in any sealed filing accessible to the plaintiffs or their attorneys,without revealing the very information that the government sought to protect.id.according to goss,neither plaintiffs nor their attorneys possess the need to know all of the classified information covered by the privilege assertion,id,notwithstanding the prior access by the plaintiffs and their counsel to a subset of that information pursuant to their limited security approvals,id.goss based his conclusion on his determination that the information was not necessary for the plaintiffs and counsel to perform or assist in a lawful and authorized governmental function under section c of executive order,id.the possible damage from even an inadvertent slip was too great,in goss judgment,to permit disclosure even under protective provisions that the court might be asked to enter.id.
according to goss public declaration,moreover,the classified information is so integral to the plaintiffs claims that further litigation of this matter would necessarily result in the disclosure of such classified information and reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.id.goss also stated that unspecified additional classified and purportedly privileged information might be at risk of disclosure through discovery or trial.id.based on the asserted need to keep the information secure,the government moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case without access to the information covered by the assertion of the privilege,and the defendants could not defend the case without disclosing it.
the plaintiffs opposition 
following the filing of the government motion and accompanying papers,the plaintiffs counsel wrote to the assistant united states attorney assigned to the case.counsel requested reasonable access to an unredacted copy of the complaint,which counsel had himself prepared and which was apparently in the files of the cia secure communication,which would enable him to contact his client in her present location with secure telecommunications equipment to discuss potentially classified information secure transmission between counsel and his clients of documents containing potentially classified information and access for himself and jane doe spouse to a cia computer at a designated location of the cia choice in order to draft the relevant substantive factual documentation,which he conceded would contain information that the cia considered classified.letter of mark zaid to ausa sarah normand,at.counsel sought the information in order to support his clients contemplated opposition to the invocation and the defendants motion to dismiss.all these requests were denied by the government.
notwithstanding the government continued refusal to provide such assistance,the plaintiffs opposed the government motions,addressing not whether the cia invocation of the state secrets privilege was appropriate or whether the plaintiffs case must be dismissed in its entirety as a result,but whether the first amendment has been violated by the government denial of counsel procedural requests.pls.oppos to defs.mot.to dismiss,june,at.the opposition characterized that denial as interference with the relationship and deprivation of the plaintiffs meaningful access to the courts.id.at see also id.at i n light of the unconstitutional denial of the plaintiffs first amendment right to counsel and meaningful access to this court,the cia motion must be initially denied without a decision on the merits of the invocation of the privilege.
the district court ruling 
upon the district court ex parte and in camera review of the government classified submissions and the complaint,the court approved the invocation of the privilege and granted the motion to dismiss.see doe,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court concluded that the assertion of the privilege was ripe despite the absence of by the plaintiffs,that the privilege was properly invoked,and that the action should be dismissed because the very subject matter of the litigation is a state secret.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court rejected the plaintiffs assertion of a right to submit classified material to the court in connection with the government claim of the state secrets privilege,concluding that t he disclosure and submission right asserted by plaintiffs would stand on its head the principle that courts are to be protective of material as to which the privilege is claimed.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court also rejected the plaintiffs complain t that the government has not facilitated their communications concerning classified matters,concluding that that was not a claim that ha d been asserted in the complaint in this action.id.at,dist.lexis,at.

discussion 
standard of review 
the parties dispute the standard by which we are to review the district court rejection of the plaintiffs opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss.the government contends that we should review the procedure by which a privilege invocation is considered for abuse of discretion the plaintiffs argue that the proper standard of review is de novo.we decline to resolve this issue because we conclude that the court judgment would survive review under either standard.
were we all in agreement that the merits of the government invocation of the privilege were the question before us,we would likely review the district court decision de novo on the ground that it was either a question of law or of the application of the law to facts that are not in dispute.see,hoblock albany county bd.of elections,cir.the majority is of the view,however,that the question before us on this appeal is the propriety of the procedures the district court used to obtain the facts necessary to assess the merits.we might well,for that reason,give substantial deference to the district court decision.see,in re agent orange prod.liability,cir we review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion.and northrop mcdonnell douglas,applying abuse of discretion standard to review claims of both procedural and substantive error in assessment.in the case before us,however,we need not decide which standard of review to apply inasmuch as we would affirm in any event 
ii.the privilege 
whether the government properly invoked the privilege and the district court properly dismissed this action are not questions before us for review because the plaintiffs did not contest those issues in the district court the question presented is,instead,whether the actions of the government in the course of invoking the privilege abridged the plaintiffs constitutional rights.in order to address this issue,we must first review the legal and procedural context in which those challenges are made.
in united states reynolds,the supreme court established the procedure by which federal courts police the government invocation of the privilege reynolds involved an ftca action brought by the widows of civilians who had died in the crash of a bomber that was testing secret electronic equipment.id.at.they sought discovery of an air force investigative report on the accident and statements provided by surviving members of the airplane crew.id.at.
the district court ordered the government to produce the documents for its review.id.at.the government refused,initially not on grounds,but under regulations which it described as having been designed to insure the collection of all pertinent information regarding aircraft accidents in order that all possible measures will be developed for the prevention of accidents and the optimum promotion of flying safety.reynolds united states,cir maris,reynolds cir.op.later,on rehearing,the government asserted that disclosure would seriously hamper national security and the development of highly technical and secret military equipment.reynolds,at.based entirely on the government refusal to produce the report,the district court entered judgment for the plaintiffs.reynolds,at.
the third circuit affirmed,concluding that the absolute housekeeping privilege asserted by the government against disclosing any statements or reports relating to this airplane accident regardless of their contents did not obtain.reynolds cir,at.in the court of appeals view,the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity meant that congress had yielded that vague national interest to the greater public interest involved in seeing that justice is done to persons injured by governmental operations.id.the court of appeals also warned that the existence of such a privilege might allow the government to keep information secret for the sole purpose of avoiding its own embarrassment or liability.see id.at.
the court of appeals distinguished the housekeeping privilege from the privilege which is properly invoked when the documents sought to be produced contain state secrets of a military character.id.at.it held that in evaluating the latter privilege,the district court judge had rightly directed that the documents in question be produced for his personal examination so that he might determine whether all or any part of the documents contain such confidential information.id.although the court of appeals thus rejected the contention that the claim of privilege was exempt from judicial review,it noted that s uch examination must obviously be ex parte and in camera if the privilege is not to be lost in its assertion.id.at.the court affirmed the judgment for the plaintiffs.
the supreme court reversed.addressing only the privilege against revealing military secrets,reynolds,at,the opinion of the court set forth various principles which control the application of the privilege,id.at.first,t he privilege belongs to the government and must be asserted by it it can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party.id.second,it is not to be lightly invoked.id.t he head of the department which has control over the matter must assert it only after his or her personal consideration.id.at.third,t he district court itself must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege,with the caveat that it must do so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect.id.by analogy to the balance struck on review of claims,the court warned that judicial control over the evidence in a case can not be abdicated to the caprice of executive officers but,at the same time,that a trial court may not automatically require a complete disclosure to the judge before the claim of privilege will be accepted in any case.id.at.
the court concluded that the district court must be satisf ied from all the circumstances of the case that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.id.at.if the district court is satisfied that there is such a danger,it should not jeopardize the security which the privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an examination of the evidence,even by the judge alone,in chambers.id.the court thus strongly suggested that if the district court is not satisfied by the claim of privilege,it may examine the evidence in question,so long as the review is ex parte and in camera.
the court explained 
in each case,the showing of necessity,the importance of the documents to the plaintiff case which is made will determine how far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate.where there is a strong showing of necessity,the claim of privilege should not be lightly accepted,but even the most compelling necessity can not overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake.
id.at.footnote omitted.
the reynolds court concluded,on the facts before it,that once the formal claim of privilege had properly been asserted,there was certainly a sufficient showing of privilege to cut off further demand for the document on the showing of necessity for its compulsion that had then been made.id.the court also decided that an offer the government had made to furnish several surviving members of the crashed airplane crew as witnesses,was an alternative to disclosure that made the plaintiffs need for the documents more dubious and presumably less necessary,id.at.the claim of privilege was thus correspondingly stronger.id.at.no submission of the accident report for inspection by the trial court was necessary or appropriate.the court remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration in light of the principles set forth in its opinion.see id.at.
justices black,frankfurter,and jackson dissent ed substantially for the reasons set forth in the opinion of judge maris for the third circuit.id.the crucial distinction between the majority and dissenting views was thus that the majority refused to go so far as to say that the district court may automatically require a complete disclosure to the judge before the claim of privilege will be accepted in any case.id.at.judge maris,and therefore presumably the dissenting justices,would have held to the contrary that 
a claim of privilege against disclosing evidence relevant to the issues in a pending law suit involves a justiciable question,traditionally within the competence of the courts,which is to be determined in accordance with the appropriate rules of evidence,upon the submission of the documents in question to the district judge for his examination in camera.
reynolds cir,at footnotes omitted.
we applied reynolds in zuckerbraun general dynamics,cir where we affirmed a district court dismissal of a wrongful death action against the manufacturers of a missile defense system that allegedly failed to repel a missile attack upon a united states navy frigate,id.at.we concluded that the district court rightly dismissed the suit because the government properly invoked the state secrets privilege and thereby prevented the plaintiff from establish ing a prima facie case.id.
we also summarized the requirements of the privilege as a procedural matter,t he privilege may be invoked only by the government and may be asserted even when the government is not a party to the case moreover,it must be claimed by the head of the department with control over the matter in question after personal consideration by that officer.id.at.the district court must also address the validity of the privilege,satisfying itself that there is a reasonable danger that disclosure of the particular facts in litigation will jeopardize national security,while not compelling disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court must then address the effect of an invocation of the privilege,in light of the exclusion of the evidence,on the plaintiff claim or defendant defense.id.at.in some cases that effect may be so drastic as to require dismissal.id.
as the district of columbia circuit has observed,
the critical feature of the inquiry in evaluating the claim of privilege is not a balancing of ultimate interests at stake in the litigation but the determination whether the showing of the harm that might reasonably be seen to flow from disclosure is adequate in a given case to trigger the absolute right to withhold the information sought in that case.
halkin helms.before such a determination can be made,however,the court must first decide how much of a showing is required by the government to permit the court to draw conclusions about whether and to what extent there exists a reasonable danger of inadvertent disclosure,private necessity for the evidence,and governmental caprice in asserting the privilege.see reynolds,at.the trial court may not automatically require the government to produce the material for which secrecy is claimed,however,even for perusal of the judge in chambers.id.at.of course,at the other extreme,it may not undertake an insufficient investigation of the assertion to satisfy itself that actual military secrets are at stake and the danger of their disclosure is reasonably likely.see see also zuckerbraun,at.a complete abandonment of judicial control would lead to intolerable abuses.reynolds,at.
in some cases,the required scrutiny will be relatively modest,permitting the court to rely on nothing more than the complaint and the government declaration.see,zuckerbraun,at w e conclude that it is,in light of the government declaration describing the subject matter of the information sought,that disclosure of secret data and tactics concerning the weapons systems of the most technically advanced and heavily relied upon of our nation warships may reasonably be viewed as inimical to national security.sterling tenet,cir accepting district court reliance on government declaration in approving invocation,in light of the highly classified nature of covert cia agent discrimination and retaliation claims,cert.denied,d ellsberg mitchell,w hen assessing claims of a state secrets privilege,a trial judge properly may rely on affidavits and other secondary sources more often than he might when evaluating assertions of other evidentiary privileges,cert.denied,d.
sometimes,however,review may require examination of the classified material itself.see united states,cir.in some situations,a court may conduct an in camera examination of the actual information sought to be protected,in order to ascertain that the criteria set forth in reynolds are fulfilled,cert.denied,d ellsberg,at when a litigant must lose if the claim is upheld and the government assertions are dubious in view of the nature of the information requested and the circumstances surrounding the case,careful in camera examination of the material is not only appropriate,but obligatory.citations omitted.
iii.the plaintiffs contentions 
the plaintiffs argue that the government unconstitutionally denied their counsel access to the secure media he needed to draft an opposition to the government assertion of the privilege.in particular,counsel was refused permission to review the classified version of the complaint which he himself
