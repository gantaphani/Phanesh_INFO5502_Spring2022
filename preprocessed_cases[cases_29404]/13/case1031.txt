background 
in,renata wadsworth sought treatment from john ziegler,an ithaca,new york chiropractor.during her four visits with him,ziegler repeatedly touched wadsworth in an inappropriate,sexual manner without her consent.wadsworth reported ziegler conduct to local authorities,who arrested him.ziegler later pled guilty to assault for his actions against wadsworth.
wadsworth subsequently filed a civil action against ziegler seeking damages for emotional injury and lost income stemming from the sexual assault.following a bench trial,the supreme court of tompkins county,new york john sherman,judge,entered a judgment in wadsworth favor,which ziegler failed to satisfy.invoking ins.law,and satisfying the conditions precedent of that provision,see infra,wadsworth then sued allied professionals insurance company apic,which was ziegler insurance carrier at the time of the sexual assault.apic is registered in new york as a federal risk retention group and is recognized as such by the new york department of financial services.domiciled in arizona,apic has over insureds in new york,including acupuncturists,chiropractors,and massage therapists.
apic removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of new york,and the parties for summary judgment.in a memorandum decision and order,the district court norman mordue,judge granted apic motion and denied wadsworth,concluding that any construction of new york law that would impose direct action requirement on foreign risk retention groups was preempted by the lrra

discussion 
before turning to the preemption analysis,we briefly outline the history and structure of the various statutory schemes implicated by this case.
i.the liability risk retention act of 
under the mccarran ferguson act,et,the business of insurance is generally regulated by the states rather than the federal government.in the late,however,congress perceived a seemingly unprecedented crisis in the insurance markets,during which many businesses were unable to obtain product liability coverage at any cost.and when businesses could obtain coverage,their options were unpalatable.premiums often amounted to as much as six percent of gross sales,and insurance rates increased manyfold within a single year.see home warranty caldwell,cir.
after several years of study,congress enacted the product liability risk retention act of the act which was meant to be a national response to the crisis.as relevant here,the act authorized persons or businesses with similar or related liability exposure to form risk retention groups for the purpose of.a.the act only applied to product liability and completed operations insurance,but following additional disturbances in the interstate insurance markets,in,congress enacted the lrra,and extended the act to all commercial liability insurance.see supp.iv preferred physicians,at.at the time of the lrra passage,however,most states,exercising their traditional power over the business of insurance,did not permit such risk retention groups.preferred physicians,at.
rather than enacting comprehensive federal regulation of risk retention groups,see corcoran,at,congress enacted a reticulated structure under which risk retention groups are subject to a tripartite scheme of concurrent federal and state regulation.first,at the federal level,the act preempts any state law,rule,regulation,or order to the extent that such law,rule,regulation or order would make unlawful,or regulate,directly or indirectly,the operation of a risk retention group,a,language that we have previously described as expansive,preferred physicians,at,and sweeping,corcoran,at.
that preemption is not universal.the second part of the scheme secures the authority of the domiciliary,or chartering,state to regulate the formation and operation of risk retention groups.a.federal preemption,therefore,functions not in aid of a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme,but rather to allow a risk retention group to be regulated by the state in which it is chartered,and to preempt most ordinary forms of regulation by the other states in which it operates.thus,the act provides for broad preemption of a state licensing and regulatory laws,dep t of ins.amusement purchasing,cir.similarly,the act prohibits states from enacting regulations of any kind that discriminate against risk retention groups or their members,but does not exempt risk retention groups from laws that are generally applicable to persons or corporations.a.
while the act assigns the primary regulatory supervision of risk retention groups to the single state of domicile,the third part of its regulatory structure explicitly preserves for nondomiciliary states several very important powers,dep t of,at.the act specifically enumerates those reserved powers in subsequent subsections,with many powers of the nondomiciliary state being concurrent with those of the chartering state.see a a i,d.in particular,subject to the act provisions,nondomiciliary states have the authority to specify acceptable means for risk retention groups to demonstrate financial responsibility as a condition for granting a risk retention group a license or permit to undertake specified activities within the state borders.d.additionally,any state may,after an investigation of the group financial condition,commence a delinquency proceeding.a f i any state may also require a risk retention group to comply with any order resulting from such an investigation,or from a voluntary dissolution proceeding.a f i ii.in short,as compared to the near plenary authority it reserves to the chartering state,the act sharply limits the secondary regulatory authority of nondomiciliary states over risk retention groups to specified,if significant,spheres.
ii.new york insurance law 
general provisions 
new york insurance law,as it pertains to risk retention groups,largely mirrors the structure of federal law.article of the new york insurance law expressly recognizes the limits imposed by the lrra,noting that its purpose is to regulate the formation operation of risk retention groups formed pursuant to the provisions of the federal liability risk retention act of,to the extent permitted by such law.ins.law internal citation omitted.in keeping with those limits,new york cleanly distinguishes between the broad regulatory authority it exercises over those risk retention groups that seek to be chartered in new york,and the more limited regulations it is permitted to adopt with respect to nondomiciliary risk retention groups.section,entitled domestic risk retention groups,commands that such groups shall comply with all of the laws,regulations and orders applicable to insurers organized and licensed in this state,id.a emphasis added.in contrast,applicable to r isk retention groups not chartered in new york,requires that such groups comply with the laws of new york set out in ten subsequent subsections,largely tracking the powers reserved to nondomiciliary states by a a i.those ten subsections do not include the provisions of new york law that are at issue in this case,ins.law a b,or indeed any part of.
new york insurance law 
section a,in its current form,was codified in and has remained unchanged ever since.see richards select ins.co,d,in derogation of the common law,vests a substantive right in an injured party against a tortfeasor insurer.see state trading of india assuranceforeningen skuld,cir noting that a direct action statute is substantive accord lang hanover ins,noting that a remedied inequity of common law by creating a limited statutory cause of action on behalf of injured parties directly against insurers.
section requires that every insurance policy issued in new york contain,among other required provisions,a provision that the insolvency or bankruptcy of the person insured,or the insolvency of the insured estate,shall not release the insurer from the payment of damages for injury sustained or loss occasioned during the life of and within the coverage of such policy or contract.ins.law a.it further authorizes any person who has obtained a judgment against the insured for damages for injury sustained or loss or damage occasioned during the life of the policy or contract to maintain an action against the insurer s ubject to the limitations and conditions of paragraph two of subsection a of this section.id.b.subsection a states in case judgment against the insured shall remain unsatisfied at the expiration of thirty days from the serving of notice of entry of judgment upon the attorney for the insured,or upon the insured,and upon the insurer,then an action may be maintained against the insurer.id.a.
in short,grants an injured party a right to sue the tortfeasor insurer,but only under limited circumstances the injured party must first obtain a judgment against the tortfeasor,serve the insurance company with a copy of the judgment,and await payment for days.compliance with those requirements is a condition precedent to a direct action against the insurance company.lang,at.
given the foregoing,there is a strong argument that as a matter of new york law,simply does not apply to foreign risk retention groups.section lists the specific laws and requirements with which foreign risk retention groups must comply that list does not include any portion of.section,moreover,largely mirrors a,which explicitly reserves specific regulatory authority of the states over nondomiciliary risk retention groups those sections themselves do not require the inclusion of a direct action provision in such insurance contracts or expressly authorize nonchartering states to do so.because the declared intention of new york is to regulate risk retention groups to the extent permitted by federal law,ins.law,we are inclined to believe that new york did not intend to apply to risk retention groups chartered in another state.
we are unaware,however,of any decision of a new york court so holding,and we refrain from relying unnecessarily on that ground.the question presented by this appeal,and to which we now turn,is whether the lrra preempts application of a to foreign risk retention groups.we hold that any construction of new york law that would impose direct action requirements on foreign risk retention groups is preempted by a of the lrra.
iii.preemptive effect of the lrra 
general preemption principles 
the supremacy clause provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.from that constitutional principle,it follows,that when acting within the scope of its enumerated powers,congress may preempt state law.in re mtbe prods.liability,cir.despite its importance,the preemption power is sensitive,and when congress has legislated in a field which the states have traditionally occupied,we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress,wyeth levine,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.further,state laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance do not yield to conflicting federal statutes unless a federal statute specifically requires otherwise.united states dep t of treasury fabe,quoting b.
language and structure of the lrra 
even given the general presumption,specifically reinforced by the mccarran ferguson act that insurance regulation is generally left to the states,the language and purpose of the lrra clearly announce congress explicit intention to preempt state laws regulating risk retention groups.section of the lrra provides,in relevant part,that 
a except as provided in this section,a risk retention group is exempt from any state law,rule,regulation,or order to the extent that such law,rule,regulation,or order would 
make unlawful,or regulate,directly or indirectly,the operation of a risk retention group 
a emphasis added 
section a then goes on to provide general authority for the jurisdiction in which it is chartered to regulate the formation and operation of such a group.id.in stark contrast,the act authorizes nonchartering states to require risk retention groups to comply only with certain basic registration,capitalization,and taxing requirements,as well as various claim settlement and fraudulent practice laws.see a a i.
it is undisputed that apic is a risk retention group formed and functioning under the lrra and that it is domiciled in arizona.therefore,a,insofar as it relates to the powers of nondomiciliary states,governs the authority of new york to impose regulations on apic operations in new york.further,wadsworth does not argue that new york direct action provision falls within the ambit of the specific exceptions from preemption set forth in subsections a a i instead,she argues for a narrow construction of the preemption provision itself.reasoning that congress was concerned with discrimination by the states against alternative insurance providers,wadsworth contends that congress main purpose in passing the act was to ensure further state discrimination would not occur.appellant br.on this reading of the lrra,ins.law would be a generally applicable,nondiscriminatory statute that does not conflict with or frustrate a,and is therefore not preempted.
the lrra language and structure,however,as well as our prior decisions,render wadsworth reading of the statute untenable.plainly,a and are not directed toward placing risk retention groups on equal footing with traditional insurers.to the contrary,both of those provisions excuse risk retention groups from certain requirements that states may and typically do impose upon insurers licensed within that state.moreover,a expressly prohibits discrimination against risk retention groups.if the entire purpose of the preemption provision was solely to invalidate discriminatory state laws,congress could have enacted a far less complex statute that simply adopted the language of subsection a without more,and thus prohibited all state laws,and only those,that discriminate against risk retention groups.instead,however,congress specifically preempted any law,rule,or regulation by a nondomiciliary state that would regulate,directly or indirectly,the operation of a risk retention group.a emphasis added.a clearer prohibition would be hard to devise.the express preemption of any regulation simply can not be read as preemption only of discriminatory regulation 
for these reasons,we have read the lrra preemption language broadly.in enacting the lrra,we have held,congress desired to decrease insurance rates and increase the availability of coverage by promoting greater competition within the insurance industry.preferred physicians,at,citing,t he legislative history of the act makes clear that congress intended to exempt risk retention groups broadly from state law requirements that make it difficult for risk retention groups to form or to operate on a basis.id.at,citing,an expansive reading of the preemption language furthers the act purpose.id.at.
effects of applying a to foreign risk retention groups 
the effects that application of ins.law a would have on nondomiciliary risk retention groups further buttress our conclusion.that section,which is in derogation of the common law,allows an injured party with an unsatisfied judgment against an insured
