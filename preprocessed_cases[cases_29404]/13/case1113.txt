background 
the following facts are drawn from the complaint,the allegations of which,at this stage,we accept as true.see gonzalez hasty,cir.js is a federal prisoner who was incarcerated at the federal correctional institution otisville and who participated in the program from december until march.js participation was governed by a witness security program prisoner witness agreement the written agreement and a memorandum of understanding mou between js and the department of justice.
the attorney general has broad discretion to administer the program.doe civiletti,cir see also bergmann united states,cir.this discretion is reflected throughout the governing statute.whether or not a witness will be protected under the program is within the attorney general discretion.abbott petrovsky,cir see also a the attorney general may provide for the relocation and other protection of a witness or a potential witness.emphasis added.once a witness is admitted,the type and level of protection afforded is also within the attorney general discretion,and may continue for as long as,in the judgment of the attorney general,the danger to that person exists.b.an individual participation in the program is voluntary,and an individual who joins is free to leave at any time.hertzke riley,aff,cir.
rule of the written agreement provides that contacting or attempting to contact unauthorized individuals constitutes a breach of the agreement.the mou provides a similar prohibition on unauthorized contacts.the written agreement states that f ailure to adhere to this agreement could result in termination of program services without notice emphasis in original.neither the mou nor the written agreement sets forth the procedures to be followed in the event the justice department office of enforcement operations oeo recommends termination.
in october,the oeo notified js that it was aware that he had made contact with unauthorized individuals in violation of rule.on march,the oeo sent js a termination notice,stating that he had again violated rule by having unauthorized contacts with unauthorized individuals.the notice instructed js on how to appeal his termination.
on march,js filed a notice of appeal contending that his termination violated due process because oeo had failed to inform him of whom he was alleged to have contacted.he also contended that,because all his contacts had been approved by staff persons at the institution,he could not have violated the agreement.louis scialabba,a counselor at otisville,reviewed the appeal and forwarded it to oeo with a recommendation that the termination be finalized.js also wrote to eileen ruleman,chief of oeo,on march expressing his frustration at having been terminated without first being told the factual basis for the termination.oeo received that letter on april.
the record does not indicate that the oeo received js march notice of appeal,and its written disposition suggests that oeo had received only js march letter.that letter did not state the basis for his appeal but merely expressed his displeasure with having been terminated from the program.oeo concluded that js had failed to articulate a ground for appeal and affirmed his termination,finding that he had initiated contact on multiple occasions with unauthorized individuals.
on april,donna hill,a unit manager at otisville,gave js a copy of an order from stephen,director of oeo,denying the appeal.js then complained to hill that oeo had failed to explain the factual basis for the allegations that led to his termination.hill responded,oeo does have to go by the same rules as everybody else.they do have to tell you what you did,you know what you did.hill then instructed js to initial order.immediately upon his initialing the order,prison officials placed js in the shu,where he was held for days.in december,js initiated this bivens action against,ruleman,oeo coordinator jennifer segui,hill,and scialabba in their individual capacities alleging that his termination and placement in segregated housing violated his rights under the fifth and eighth amendments.
in february,prior to a responsive pleading,the district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint.the district court held that in light of f which provides that t he decision of the attorney general to terminate a witness protection under the program shall not be subject to judicial review,the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over js due process claim.the court also ruled that the complaint otherwise failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court sua sponte dismissal of an action and its complaint de novo.see mceachin mcguinnis,cir.the complaint must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d see also ashcroft iqbal,d.where,as in this case,the plaintiff is proceeding pro se,the district court must construe the complaint liberally,reading it with special solicitude and interpreting it to raise the strongest claims that it suggests.harris city of new york,cir.moreover,district courts generally should not dismiss a pro se complaint without granting the plaintiff leave to amend.see shomo city of new york,cir cuoco moritsugu,cir.
termination from the program 
js alleges that his participation in the program constituted a property interest and that he was wrongly deprived of that interest because he was not afforded an opportunity to meaningfully challenge the oeo decision to terminate him.specifically,he contends that because he was not informed of the factual basis supporting the termination until after his appeal was denied,he could not properly appeal the termination and the district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review his claims we disagree.
the program is governed by,which the government argues,and the district court held,deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to consider js challenge to his termination.as noted,section f provides that the attorney general decision to terminate protection is not subject to judicial review.because jurisdiction is a tribunal power to hear a case,morrison australia bank,d internal quotation marks omitted,this provision leaves a district court without power or discretion to hear challenges to program terminations.see gigante,at holding that a district court is without jurisdiction to consider challenges to program terminations.
even though this provision is clear and resort to legislative history is not required,we note that congress intention to bar judicial review of terminations and the process through which termination decisions are reached is clearly reflected in the legislative history of.the original draft of the section,found in,contained a provision permitting judicial review of the attorney general decision to terminate a witness from the program and of whether the attorney general had breached the mou.the initial bill would have allowed the witness to apply for a hearing to contest the proposed termination of protection to the united states district court and would have required the attorney general to provide the witness with notice of the right to request such a hearing.marshals se
