according to the prosecution,kenneth phoenix almost committed the perfect crime except for one mistake.based on that fingerprint left near the was convicted of the first degree murder of raymond green.although phoenix defense counsel the forensic serologist and fingerprint experts presented by the commonwealth of massachusetts,he did not call defense experts to further contradict their testimony.phoenix now claims that his attorney decision not to call such experts denied him his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.having had his petition for a writ of habeas corpus denied by the district court,he appeals to this court.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
as our previous decision,phoenix matesanz,cir,summarizes this case procedural history prior to the district court denial of habeas,we need provide only a brief summary here.
raymond green was a plant manager at the belchertown state school.on august,he was found dead in his office,shot five times.police found pieces of a green scouring pad on his face and on the floor of his office,as well as in a metal drum on the first floor of the plant.in that drum police also found a crumpled brown paper bag.fingerprints and blood were found on the paper bag.two experts presented by the commonwealth testified at trial that the identifiable fingerprints on the bag belonged to phoenix,who was one of employees supervised by green.expert serologist moses schanfield testified that the blood from the only successfully tested blood stain was consistent with green blood and inconsistent with phoenix blood.based largely on these two pieces of incriminating evidence,phoenix was convicted.
although phoenix counsel,william bennett,had retained a forensic serologist and a fingerprint analyst,he called neither to testify.the serologist,brian wraxall,later filed an affidavit stating that he would have testified that the allotype blood test performed by schanfield yielded scientifically meaningless results.wraxall would have further testified that no scientific basis existed to conclude that the tested stain was either consistent with green blood or inconsistent with phoenix blood.the fingerprint expert,herbert macdonnell,filed an affidavit stating that the fingerprint lacked sufficient detail to be identified either as phoenix or not phoenix.
after phoenix direct appeals were denied,ultimately by the massachusetts supreme judicial court,commonwealth phoenix,he filed a second motion for a new trial claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel based on bennett failure to call wraxall and macdonnell.the superior court denied his motion,as did a single gatekeeper justice of the sjc.the federal district court then found that phoenix was not procedurally barred from filing a habeas petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel,a decision we affirmed.see phoenix matesanz,cir.after remand,the district court ruled on the merits of phoenix petition,ultimately concluding that the state court decisions did not involve an unreasonable application of the strickland washington,d,standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel.
discussion 
applying the habeas corpus statute 
in enacting the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,congress placed new restrictions on the power of federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners.as relevant here,d was revised to provide 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
until last term,the supreme court had not been presented with the opportunity to elucidate the meaning of the revised provision,and the various courts of appeals,including this court,had been left to take our best shots.see,green french,cir dubois,cir drinkard johnson,cir lindh murphy,cir.however,in williams taylor,d,the supreme court provided the first explicit guidance on the construction of this section of the aedpa,fortuitously in the very context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel it is to this decision that we must now turn.
addressing a case out of the fourth circuit,williams taylor,cir,the supreme court generally upheld green interpretation of d,albeit with several significant differences.the court began by sustaining the green conception of the contrary to clause,holding that the clause applied in two types of situations.first,a decision will certainly be contrary to our clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases.williams,at.at.for example,requiring a petitioner to meet a higher burden than that provided for in strickland would be contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.see id.second,a decision will also be contrary to this court clearly established precedent if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a supreme court decision and nevertheless arrives at a different result.id.at.at.however,justice noted that the case,applying the correct legal rule to a new set of facts,would not fit comfortably within the contrary to clause of d.to place such a case within that clause would sap the unreasonable application clause of any meaning.see id.
the court then found that the fourth circuit was again generally correct as to its interpretation of the unreasonable application clause.green held that an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent occurs when i the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case,and ii when the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.at citing green,at.the court endorsed the first approach,see id.at.at,while withholding judgment on the second,see id.at.at.
however,the court refused to endorse the fourth circuit determination of what exactly qualifies as an unreasonable application of law under d.green limited unreasonable applications to those cases where all reasonable jurists would agree that the state court application of law is unreasonable.see green,at.the supreme court concluded that such an approach provides little assistance to federal courts,and is in fact misleading in its subjectivity.see williams,at.at noting that under such a standard,any conflicting authority,including a split,would foreclose review.instead,the federal habeas court should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.id.although unreasonable may be difficult to define,justice noted that it is a term familiar to the legal world and to federal judges.at the very least,an unreasonable application of federal law differs from an incorrect application of federal law.see id.at.at citing wright west,d,for this distinction.in sum,u nder d unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.
finally,justice noted that old rules under teague lane,d,would qualify as clearly established federal law,the only caveat being that,such old rules could only stem from the supreme court jurisprudence.see williams,at.at.
the supreme court then applied its williams taylor analysis to the denial of effective assistance of counsel,concluding that i t is past question that the rule set forth in strickland qualifies as clearly established law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.williams,at.at.the court noted that the strickland test,of necessity,requires a examination of the evidence,but held that such concerns obviate neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the rule must be seen as established by this court.id.
ii.the strickland standard 
the court in williams nicely summarized the relevant aspects of the strickland test 
a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel has two components 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland,at.
to establish ineffectiveness,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.to establish prejudice,he must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
williams,at.at.
in strickland itself the supreme court spoke in more detail about the deferential level of scrutiny involved in this review,particularly with respect to potentially strategic decisions made by counsel.the court cautioned as to the use of hindsight it is all too tempting for a defendant to counsel assistance after conviction,and it is all too easy for a court,examining counsel defense after it has proved unsuccessful,to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.strickland,at.see also united states natanel,cir cautioning that the fact that counsel selection of a stratagem may,in retrospect,have proved unsuccessful,or even unwise,is not the issue.the defendant,as a result,must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.quoting michel louisiana.specifically,a court must judge the reasonableness of counsel challenged conduct on the facts of the case at the time of that conduct.moreover,counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.id.at.in short,strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.id.emphasis added 
iii.application to phoenix appeal 
under strickland,we must ask whether defense counsel decision not to call either defense expert was an act that falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.however,if the state court applied the correct test,we can not answer this question de novo.see williams,at.at holding that application of the strickland test is under the unreasonable application prong of d.although justice fried,as single gatekeeper justice of the sjc,did not cite strickland in his analysis,it is clear from his language that his decision denying phoenix motion was based on the judgment that the failure to call wraxall was a strategic choice 
it is this strategy which defendant now claims amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.the defendant claims that if only the expert witness,wraxall,had been called to testify,it would have had a damaging effect on the commonwealth own expert testimony regarding the crucial blood testimony.but the subject of the reliability of the commonwealth testimony on this score had been so thoroughly canvassed both at trial,by by defendant counsel,and then examined by the full court on plenary review,that i think the claim of ineffectiveness of counsel is so as to be insubstantial.
phoenix commonwealth,no,at sjc memorandum,fried,may.
the strategy to which justice fried referred was described in the prior decision of the full sjc see commonwealth phoenix,as well as in a subsequent superior court decision refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on the issue,see commonwealth phoenix,at superior court memorandum,moriarty,march,hereinafter phoenix,march memorandum.in denying leave to admit into the record on direct appeal the wraxall affidavit,the sjc referred to defendant arguments that he did not have wraxall testify because of the expense and because of his belief that schanfield testimony would expose the unreliability of the critical test.the sjc concluded that t hese considerations were purely ones of trial strategy,and,therefore,there is no reason to permit the filing of the affidavit.phoenix,at.similarly,although judge moriarty formally relied on waiver in denying defendant request for an evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance,he made it quite clear that he did not think the failure to call wraxall was ineffective assistance,and,more generally,he praised trial counsel performance in general and at the trial.
phoenix,march memorandum,at.
as for the fingerprint evidence,judge moriarty plainly found that the failure to call macdonnell was a strategic one.see phoenix,march memorandum,at bennett made a tactical probably a wise one.
hence,we must assess whether the respective state court applications of strickland to these ineffective assistance claims was in fact objectively unreasonable.we make this assessment under the guidance of our decision in lema united states,cir in lema,we denied an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel failure to call three witnesses proposed by the defendant.we noted that t he decision whether to call a particular witness is almost always strategic,requiring a balancing of the benefits and risks of the anticipated testimony.id.at.where the prosecution case is less than compelling the risk of rocking the boat may warrant a decision by trial counsel to forego the presentation of further defense testimony,even favorable testimony.id.citing johnson lockhart,cir.moreover,choices in emphasis during are prototypical examples of unchallengeable strategy.see matthews rakiey,cir.
what we have noted about the state court analysis may not have measured up to strickland requirements.impliedly recognizing this,a prior panel of this court remanded the case to the district court for a more thorough and explicit consideration of his claim than has so far occurred.phoenix,at.given the district court meticulous examinations of the claims,we find no error that merits relief.we now examine each claim in turn,relying on the analysis of the district court.
we now examine each claim in turn.
a.the fingerprint evidence 
in response to the prosecution experts identification of his client prints and exclusion of another suspect prints,bennett the commonwealth two fingerprint experts both at voir dire and at trial.bennett challenged whether the paper bag had been treated for prints at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner he exposed that the expert worked only from photographs,rather than from the paper bag itself and he raised questions about the chain of custody.bennett also spent a significant amount of time questioning the methodology of one of the commonwealth experts shiflett,particularly with regard to discrepancies between the paper bag print and the comparison print.in particular,his prompted shiflett to testify that the quality of the print had limited his observations and that the print on the paper bag was similar to but not identical to the print taken from phoenix used for purposes of comparison.
defense expert macdonnell submitted an affidavit stating that,in his opinion,the quality of the fingerprint evidence is inadequate to make a positive id,and as a result he could not conclude with certainty that the unknown print is not from phoenix.macdonnell could only testify in response to the prosecution experts that identification of the fingerprint was impossible,in his opinion.he could not identify the fingerprint as that of another potential suspect.he could not say,for certain,that the fingerprint did not belong to phoenix.although bennett had not thoroughly discredited the commo
