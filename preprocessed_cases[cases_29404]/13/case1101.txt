chad wertman wertman appeals from the january,opinion and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york holwell,denying wertman motion for summary judgment.linda stansbury stansbury brought this action pursuant to alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution.wertman moved for summary judgment,asserting that there was probable cause for the arrest and prosecution,or,in the alternative that he was entitled to qualified immunity based on the existence of arguable probable cause.
the district court analyzed each piece of evidence in the case seriatim and in isolation and concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether wertman had probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest stansbury.this was error.analyzing the evidence in its totality,we hold that no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that wertman did not have probable cause to arrest and to prosecute stansbury.we therefore reverse the district court opinion and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment for wertman.
background 
at on april,a woman shoplifted approximately of goods from a stop shop supermarket in somers,new york.mary sue cirrincione cirrincione,the store detective who was trained to focus on distinctive facial characteristics,observed the crime on the store by monitor.cirrincione see also stansbury wertman,cv rjh,wl at.cirrincione alerted mark john john,who physically observed the perpetrator and watched her open,crisp,new old navy bags and place items from the shelves into the bags and then in her shopping cart.id.when she tried to leave,john attempted to block the perpetrator exit and asked to see her receipt she ran around him,exited the building,and jumped into a white van.id.john noted the van license plate number as it drove away.id.
cirrincione and john reported the incident to the police,and new york state trooper chad wertman arrived to investigate.wertman recovered a bus receipt from an old navy bag the perpetrator had left behind.he watched the videotape of the theft and took the tape as evidence.cirrincione and john both described the perpetrator as a black female wearing blue jeans and a maroon windbreaker john added that she was about.id.the bus ticket and license plate number did not yield any additional leads.
noting that the perpetrator old navy bags were in mint condition,wertman traveled to one of the two nearby old navy stores.the old navy manager reported that a black woman had attempted to buy some clothing at the store at that evening,but that her credit card was declined.the manager reported that new bags,typically stored in the rear of the store,were discovered strewn on the ground near the door around the same time.id.at.wertman traced the credit card receipt to a card belonging to nicole stansbury nicole,linda stansbury daughter.after repeated attempts,wertman was able to contact nicole by telephone she alleged that she had been in old navy on april before visiting an a p supermarket and returning to her mother house.
wertman went to stansbury house on may to interview nicole.wertman asserts that on his arrival,he recognized linda stansbury as the perpetrator he had seen on the videotape.id.he interviewed both women,but his notes of the interview reflect that linda was nervous,that she would not answer his questions directly,and that nicole answered many of the questions he asked of her mother.id.
after the interview,wertman reviewed stansbury criminal history and discovered an arrest for grand larceny.he then obtained a dmv photograph of stansbury and asked another trooper to prepare a photo array.before the array was complete,wertman and two senior officers reviewed the videotape,compared it to the dmv photograph and confirmed their collective belief that stansbury was the perpetrator.
wertman scheduled a interview with linda and nicole stansbury at the police barracks in somers.he planned to have cirrincione and john come to the station and view linda stansbury to see if they could identify her as the shoplifter the stansburys never arrived.id.at.because the photo array was not yet ready,wertman showed stansbury dmv photograph to cirrincione and john without any control photographs,in violation of the new york state police field manual field manual both cirrincione and john identified stansbury as the perpetrator and signed a sworn statement under penalty of perjury to that effect.cirrincione confirmed without any doubt or reservation that stansbury was the perpetrator,and john was positively without a doubt able to identify her as the thief.after wertman spoke with her attorney,stansbury turned herself in the next day she was listed as tall upon arrest.
stansbury was tried for petit larceny in somers town court.after a bench trial including testimony by cirrincione and john,stansbury was acquitted.two years later she commenced this suit,alleging false arrest and malicious prosecution under.wertman moved for summary judgment finding genuine issues of material fact with respect to probable cause,the district court denied his motion in january.id.at.wertman timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals of denials of motions for summary judgment where the motion is predicated in whole or in part on assertions of qualified immunity.see,amore novarro,cir.wertman alleges both that he is entitled to qualified immunity based on the existence of arguable probable cause and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the existence of probable cause.
we may exercise pendent jurisdiction to decide whether stansbury has alleged a constitutional violation at all before deciding whether wertman is shielded by qualified immunity.finigan marshall,cir.although it is no longer required,see pearson callahan,the probable cause inquiry may precede any inquiry into qualified immunity because there can not be an allegation of a constitutional violation where probable cause justifies an arrest and prosecution.panetta crowley,cir.in this case,it is beneficial,pearson,at,to first address whether wertman had probable cause,because it best serves the interests of judicial economy,see escalera lunn,cir.thus,because the probable cause inquiry is inextricably intertwined with the immunity question,we will exercise our discretion to consider otherwise nonappealable issues based on our review of the question of qualified immunity.san filippo trust.of,inc,cir see also golino city of new haven,cir.
the standard of review here is we conclude that wertman had both probable cause and arguable probable cause to arrest and prosecute stansbury the district erred in denying wertman motion for summary judgment as to the false arrest and malicious prosecution claims.
ii.false arrest 
p robable cause is an absolute defense to a false arrest claim.torraco port auth.of and,cir quoting jaegly couch,cir.an officer has probable cause to arrest when he or she has knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has committed a crime.jaegly,at.a court must consider only those facts available to the officer at the time of the arrest and immediately before it.panetta,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.a court examines each piece of evidence and considers its probative value,and then look s to the totality of the circumstances to evaluate whether there was probable cause to arrest and prosecute the plaintiff.id.quotation marks omitted.if probable cause existed,it presents a total defense to stansbury actions for false arrest and malicious prosecution wertman would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.savino city of new york,cir 
available evidence as to probable 
the district court analyzed five separate pieces of evidence before concluding that wertman was not entitled to a probable cause determination 
cirrincione and john eyewitness accounts of the shoplifting the store surveillance tape wertman identification of stansbury as the perpetrator on the surveillance tape other officers opinion s that stansbury dmv picture matched the perpetrator depicted on the surveillance tape and cirrincione and john photo identification.
stansbury,wl,at.the record also includes uncontested evidence that the district court chose not to analyze the shoplifter use and possession of pristine old navy bags wertman observations of stansbury behavior during his interview his knowledge of stansbury previous larceny arrest and similarities between stansbury handbag and the perpetrator handbag.
the district court began its discussion by analyzing the evidence related to the videotape including wertman identification of stansbury in person,his colleagues corroborating identifications of stansbury based on her dmv photograph,and the videotape itself.the district court noted that the evidence was probative,but not sufficient,finding that nothing in it was so persuasive that a jury would be unreasonable in concluding that the videotape was not sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in concluding that stansbury was the perpetrator.id.quoting jaegly,at.we do not disagree with the court here,but that does not end the inquiry.the district court noted that t here are several instances on the videotape where the perpetrator face appears with some definition,though the perpetrator face did not appear to perfectly match stansbury dmv photo.id.the visibility of the perpetrator on the tape makes wertman identification probative and allows the other officers identifications based on the tape to contribute meaningfully to wertman probable cause to arrest stansbury.
after disposing of the videotape,the court proceeded to analyze the identifications made by cirrincione and john at the police barracks.as an initial matter,the district court rightly condemned the use of a array to confirm identity.id.at decrying the absence of indicia of reliability spelled out in neil biggers.showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification has been widely condemned,even when done in person.stovall denno,overruled on other grounds by griffith kentucky.the use of a single photograph of the suspect is not more reliable.
however,absent circumstances that raise doubts as to the victim veracity,a victim identification is typically sufficient to provide probable cause.singer fulton cnty.sheriff,cir holding that a store clerk description of an incident of shoplifting supported a finding of probable cause wertman had no reason to doubt the honesty of either cirrincione or john,each of whom made statements under penalty of perjury and lacked incentive to single out stansbury as the perpetrator although cirrincione and john identifications were too problematic alone to provide probable cause to arrest stansbury,this flaw does not render the evidence.e vidence need not be admissible at trial in order to support a finding of probable cause.phillips allen,cir interpreting illinois gates.a lthough not able to be used at his criminal trial,victim identification of the perpetrator may properly provide a basis for probable cause to arrest him.people nelson.div.dep t cardamone,justice abrogated on other grounds by people cintron.div d dep t.
the shoplifter old navy bags,which in the video appear never to have been unfolded or used,properly narrowed wertman investigation to the universe of people who may have visited an old navy shortly before the robbery.wertman discovery that unused bags were seen strewn on the floor at a nearby store minutes before the robbery,around the time a middle aged black woman used nicole stansbury credit card at old navy,was undoubtedly relevant to assessing his probable cause determination.this circumstantial evidence that stansbury may have had an opportunity to obtain unused old navy bags just prior to the shoplifting incident is probative as to the likelihood that she was the perpetrator.
when wertman interviewed the stansburys about their presence at old navy,he observed that linda stansbury was very nervous and evasive.furthermore,wertman noticed that nicole tried to cover for her mother during the interview.a police officer contemporaneously recorded observation that a suspect was evasive when questioned may be a significant factor in a probable cause determination.see,united states gagnon,cir courts consider several factors when determining probable cause,including the defendant excessive nervousness and evasive or contradictory answers to questions.people kelley.div d dep t cited approvingly by people hall.accordingly,the district court erred by failing to consider this interview in its probable cause analysis.
other evidence tending to make it more likely that stansbury was the stop shop culprit included wertman knowledge of her arrest for grand larceny in white plains and wertman comparison of her handbag to the perpetrator handbag as observed on the video.though neither piece of information individually yields a significant step towards establishing probable cause,the district court should have considered both as part of the totality of circumstances.similarly,john assertion that the perpetrator was tall in light of stansbury stature is part of the total mix of evidence necessary to properly evaluate wertman decision to arrest stansbury 
probable cause under the totality of the circumstances 
the district court analyzed the evidence seriatim,finding that no piece of evidence was sufficient in itself to establish arguable probable cause.stansbury,wl,at.although it adequately evaluated the pieces of evidence that it chose to consider,the district court erred insofar as it did not account for the evidence on the totality of the circumstances.jenkins city of new york,cir citing brinegar united states.
the totality of the circumstances test is no mere formality it may frequently alter the outcome of a case.those who do not take into account conditional probability are prone to making mistakes in judging evidence.they may think that if a particular fact does not itself prove the ultimate proposition,whether the officer had probable cause,the fact may be tossed aside and the next fact may be evaluated as if the first did not exist.al adahi obama,the significance of each relevant factor may be enhanced or diminished by surrounding circumstances.jenkins,at.review for probable cause should encompass plainly exculpatory evidence alongside inculpatory evidence to ensure the court has a full sense of the evidence that led the officer to believe that there was probable cause to make an arrest.fabrikant french,cir quoting panetta,at.a story is never a single chapter,it is the experience of the entire tale the same is true of probable cause.
the district court looked to our efforts in jenkins city of new york to support its determination in jenkins,new york police department nypd detectives investigated a series of robberies and a homicide committed by the main perpetrator and an accomplice.at.by tracing the first victim stolen red honda civic,reportedly used in all subsequent crimes,the nypd found blyther,the perpetrator.when the police raided blyther apartment,they also found and arrested jenkins they contended that he resembled descriptions of blyther accomplice in that he was a black male.id.at.three lineups were conducted for one witness and two victims,all of whom identified jenkins as blyther accomplice in his crime spree.id.at.in one lineup,however,the witness was not permitted to leave without fingering one of the men.id.at.eight months later,blyther named his actual accomplice not jenkins.id.at.some material facts including jenkins behavior prior to arrest were subject to genuine dispute.
this court held that the officers developed probable cause only after the second and third identifications which,though flawed,were procedurally superior to the first lineup.id.at.the totality of the evidence available to the police at that time included jenkins presence in blyther apartment days after the crimes jenkins race and gender,which corresponded with the accomplice race and gender a witness coerced and therefore meaningless identification of jenkins and two victims identifications of jenkins in subsequent less tha
