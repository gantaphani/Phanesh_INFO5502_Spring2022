the instant appeal arises from the suppression of certain custodial statements made by gordon plugh shortly after his arrest.the district court siragusa,suppressed these statements after concluding that plugh had successfully invoked his miranda rights by declining to sign a form,united states plugh,d,and a panel of this court affirmed,united states plugh,cir hereinafter,plugh i.specifically,the plugh i majority concluded that the defendant unequivocal refus al to sign the waiver of rights form was itself sufficient to invoke those rights,thus rejecting application of the standard set forth in davis united states,d,whereby a defendant must unambiguously invoke his rights in order to cut off questioning,plugh i,at.as the plugh i majority reasoned,davis does not instruct courts on how to analyze an initial invocation of one fifth amendment rights following the miranda warnings but is instead limited to cases where a defendant attempts to subsequently invoke previously waived fifth amendment rights.id.at.
shortly thereafter,while this case was pending before the district court,the supreme court announced its opinion in berghuis thompkins,d.there,the court clarified that the davis unambiguous statement standard does control a court analysis of an initial invocation of both the right to remain silent and the right to counsel,id.at,and it further held,on the facts of that case,that the defendant conduct,which included a refusal to sign an form,did not amount to an unambiguous invocation of those rights sufficient to cut off further questioning by law enforcement officials,id.at.
in light of berghuis,the united states now asks us to revisit our decision affirming the order of suppression in plugh because we agree with the government that berghuis constitutes an intervening change in controlling law,doe dep t of soc,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and because we further agree that berghuis compels a different outcome on these facts,we reconsider the district court order of suppression in this case and now vacate that order.
background 
a.the custodial statements 
because the underlying facts are amply set forth in plugh i,we rehearse them here only as necessary to facilitate this discussion 
defendant plugh initially came to the attention of fbi agents in july during the course of an investigation into child pornography possession and online trafficking.at that time,agents questioned plugh and,with his consent,obtained from him a personal computer to be searched.that search uncovered evidence of child pornography.on september,plugh was arrested at his father home in wayland,new york.plugh i,at.upon placing plugh in handcuffs,the agents advised plugh of his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,and then asked him to sign a form.that form,prominently labeled your rights,contained the following 
before we ask you any questions,you must understand your rights.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can be used against you in court.
you have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions.
you have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning.
if you can not afford a lawyer,one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.
if you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present,you have the right to stop answering at any time.
waiver of rights 
i have read this statement of my rights and i understand what my rights are.at this time,i am willing to answer questions without a lawyer present.

plugh,d at.plugh,who c an read and write,id.at,told the agents that he understood his rights,adding that he had previously worked in law enforcement as a state corrections officer,but he declined to sign the waiver on the grounds that i am not sure if i should be talking to you and i do know if i need a lawyer,plugh i,at quoting plugh,d at.accordingly,the agent wrote refused to sign on the waiver form and placed plugh in a car for transport to the fbi field office in rochester.id.
during the minute drive to the fbi office in rochester,plugh repeatedly asked the agents for advice on what to do.id.while the agents made clear they would not discuss the case further with him at that time,they stated that should he wish to cooperate and answer questions,they would relay any such cooperation to the attorney office handling the prosecution.no further relevant discussion took place for the remainder of the drive.id.
once at the fbi office in rochester,the agents placed plugh in a back interview room and informed him that he was about to be turned over to the marshals for booking.they added,however,that i f he wanted to make any statements this was the point at which he should do so.id.alteration in original.plugh then affirmatively indicated that he wished to make statements,and the agents him of his miranda rights.at no point did plugh indicate that he wished to consult with an attorney.id.as the district court concluded in findings of fact which are not disputed before this court,plugh was calm and cooperative.no threats or promises were made to the defendant to get him to talk to the police.plugh,d at.plugh then signed a form and proceeded to make the series of inculpatory statements at issue on appeal.id.
plugh was indicted in january on nine counts of receipt and possession of child pornography,see a a,a b,and defense counsel moved to suppress,among other things,plugh statements.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion,and then granted it in relevant part.framing the inquiry as whether plugh conduct could reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney or to remain silent,plugh,d at,the district court concluded that plugh unequivocal refusal to sign the form was sufficiently clear to meet that standard,id.at.accordingly,it determined that the agents should have ceased all questioning in the face of that refusal to sign the form and suppressed the ensuing statements.id.at.
the government appealed,and a divided panel of this court affirmed.relying heavily on the prior opinion of this court in united states quiroz,cir,which it read to stand for the proposition that when a custodial officer specifically asks a suspect if he will waive his rights by signing a form and does so in such a way that the accused would interpret a refusal to sign as a negative answer,the suspect has taken sufficient action to trigger the prophylactic rule announced in edwards arizona,d,the plugh i majority concluded that plugh had taken sufficient action on these facts to trigger that rule.plugh i,at.while acknowledging that plugh statements,i am not sure if i should be talking to you and i do know if i need a lawyer appear ambiguous,the majority found that plugh ultimate action his refusal to sign the form constituted an unequivocally negative answer to the question posed namely,whether he was willing to waive his rights.id.at quoting plugh,d at.
in so concluding,the plugh i majority expressly rejected application of the standard articulated in davis,at,whereby a defendant must unambiguously invoke his rights in order to cut off questioning.the panel majority reasoned,in reliance on its view of the law at the time plugh i was decided,that davis applies only in circumstances in which a defendant makes a claim that he subsequently invoked previously waived fifth amendment rights.plugh i,at.
chief judge jacobs dissented,arguing principally that the davis standard should apply on these facts and that plugh conduct,considered in totem,besp oke indecision and ambiguity.id.at jacobs,dissenting.with respect to the refusal to sign the form in particular,chief judge jacobs argued that,in context,it was wholly consistent with the expression of uncertainty and was thus insufficient to unambiguously invoke the defendant fifth amendment rights.id.at.
after plugh i was decided but before the case proceeded to trial below,the supreme court announced its opinion in berghuis.there,as here,the defendant had been offered the chance to sign an form but had declined to do so berghuis.at.there,as here,the defendant nonetheless subsequently made voluntary inculpatory statements to the police.on direct appeal,the defendant,van chester thompkins,argued that his ensuing statements should have been suppressed because his conduct,namely his silence during several hours of attempted questioning,constituted an implicit invocation of those rights and thus should have cut off all further questioning.id.at.the state courts rejected that argument,and thompkins filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court reiterating those claims.see.the sixth circuit granted the writ,reasoning that the invocation of thompkins rights could be inferred from his conduct on the whole.thompkins berghuis,cir.
the supreme court reversed.as a preliminary matter,the court clarified that the davis unambigous invocation standard applies to both the right to counsel and the right to remain silent,and it applies where,as here,a court evaluates an initial rather than subsequent invocation.as the court explained,a requirement of an unambiguous invocation of miranda rights results in an objective inquiry that avoid s the difficulties of proof and provide s guidance to officers on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity.berghuis.at quoting davis,at.alterations in original.alternatively,i f an accused makes a statement concerning the right to counsel that is ambiguous or equivocal or makes no statement,the police are not required to end the interrogation,or ask questions to clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her miranda rights.id.at internal quotation marks,citation omitted.
applying that standard,the court then found,on those facts,that thompkins had not unambiguously invoked his rights,rejecting as insufficient his mere silence in the face of several hours of attempted questioning.see id.specifically,it noted that thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police.had he made either of these simple,unambiguous statements,he would have invoked his right to cut off questioning.id.at internal quotation mars omitted.in assessing the asserted invocation,the court made no mention of the form or of thompkins refusal to sign it.
having determined that thompkins never invoked his miranda rights,the court proceeded to consider whether he had waived those rights and concluded that he had.noting that the law can presume that an individual who,with a full understanding of his or her rights,acts in a manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish the protection those rights afford,the court found that thompkins had engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver,including voluntarily answering questions about the crime after being fully apprised of his rights.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,it concluded the statements were properly admitted at trial.
d.the decision below 
in light of berghuis,the government asked the district court to reconsider its prior order suppressing the statements in this case.the district court denied the motion to reconsider.noting that a panel of this court had already affirmed the order of suppression,the district court declined to exercise its discretion to reconsider it.moreover,it noted its belief that the facts here were distinct from those in berghuis because,in that court view,plugh refusal to sign the form constituted an unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
law of the case doctrine 
as a general matter,this court will adhere to its own decision at an earlier stage of the litigation.doe,at quoting united states cirami,cir see also united states tenzer,cir same.however,this law of the case doctrine is subject to limited exceptions made for compelling reasons.doe,at.as we have explained,t he major grounds justifying reconsideration are an intervening change of controlling law,the availability of new evidence,or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.id.similarly,where,as here,reconsideration of our prior decision requires revisiting and reversing existing circuit law,we do so only under limited circumstances,among them,where there has been an intervening supreme court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent.wojchowski daines,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the intervening decision need not discuss the precise issue decided by the panel for this exception to apply.in re zarnel,cir.
the government argues that berghuis constitutes an intervening change of controlling law sufficient to cause us to revisit our decision in plugh i.we agree.as set forth more fully below,berghuis departed from the law applied by the plugh i majority in several,critical ways.most important,as noted above,the berghuis court made clear that for a defendant successfully to invoke his miranda rights,he must do so through a clear,unambiguous affirmative action or statement.because the plugh i majority expressly rejected application of this unambiguous invocation standard based on its view of the state of the law at the time of its decision,this change in controlling law alone warrants revisiting plugh i and reconsidering the order of suppression entered below in light of the now clearly governing standard.
plugh urges us to reject berghuis as a statement of new law,arguing that it was a case.while arguably true,the contention is unpersuasive in this context as the plugh i majority correctly noted,all c ases in this area of law are fact intensive.plugh i,at.berghuis clarified and altered the invocation standard prevailing in this circuit at the time it was decided.and because it did so in a manner that departed significantly from the approach in plugh i,we revisit the order of suppression and now consider it in light of berghuis.
application of the berghuis standard 
as berghuis instructs,the relevant inquiry is whether the defendant unambiguously invoked his miranda rights.berghuis.at.here,we conclude he did not as a preliminary matter,it is undisputed that plugh did not expressly state that he wanted to remain silent or that he wanted to consult with an attorney.see plugh,d at the defendant never specifically requested an attorney,nor did he ever specifically indicate that he did not want to speak with law enforcement.berghuis.at had the defendant made either of those simple,unambiguous statements,he would have invoked his rights.here he did neither,so he did not invoke his right s.internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,plugh only statements i am not sure if i should be talking to you and i do know if i need a lawyer were appropriately deemed ambiguous by the plugh i majority.plugh i,at.those facts alone give us strong reason to doubt that plugh successfully invoked his rights in a manner sufficient to cut off all further questioning.davis,at.unless the suspect actually requests an attorney,questioning may continue.emphasis added see also berghuis.at sotomayor,dissenting characterizing berghuis as announcing a rule.
plugh instead argues that he invoked his miranda rights through his unequivocal refusal to sign a waiver of rights form.we disagree.while we do not question the plugh i majority conclusion that plugh gave an unequivocally negative answer with respect to the waiver form,plugh i,at,as this case amply demonstrates,a refusal to waive rights,however unequivocal,is not necessarily equivalent to an unambiguous decision to invoke them.indeed,the supreme court has made clear that i nvocation and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries,and the two must not be blurred by merging them together.smith illinois,d per curiam.accordingly,invocation and waiver are governed by different standards,see,berghuis.at,and carry critically different consequences,compare davis,at.if the suspect waives his right to counsel after receiving the miranda warnings,law enforcement officers are free to question him,with edwards,at.w e now hold that when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation he can not be subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him see also smith,at.the importance of keeping the two inquiries distinct is manifest.
consistent with miranda,all crimin
