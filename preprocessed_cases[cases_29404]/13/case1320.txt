the new york civil liberties union nyclu appeals from a september,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska,dismissing as moot its complaint against david grandeau,in his capacity as executive director of the new york temporary state commission on lobbying grandeau and the commission.see civil liberties union grandeau,d.this case arises out of the commission inquiry into whether the nyclu incurred reportable lobbying expenses in connection with a billboard promoting awareness of free speech issues in private shopping malls erected near the crossgates mall in albany,new york.after receiving the commission request for additional information on its billboard expenses,the nyclu filed a complaint alleging that the commission demand for reporting on expenses for advocacy activity violates the first amendment.although the commission ultimately abandoned its demand for additional reporting by the nyclu on the billboard,we can not agree with the district court finding that this case moot because the nyclu complaint challenged an alleged commission policy beyond the specific billboard controversy.nevertheless,we conclude as a prudential matter that the nyclu policy challenge is not ripe for judicial review.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant and dismissal of the complaint.
background 
in,the new york state assembly enacted the lobbying act the act,designed to preserve and maintain the integrity of the governmental process in the state by requiring disclosure of the identity,expenditures,and activities of people or organizations involved in influencing state processes in certain ways.legis.law the act contains a series of restrictions and reporting requirements for individuals and entities that engage in lobbying activities.lobbying activities are defined as any attempt to influence governmental in a variety of forms,including,inter alia,the passage or defeat of any legislation by either house of the state legislature or approval or disapproval of any legislation by the governor.c.the act requires every lobbyist to register with the commission and file regular reports containing detailed information on its lobbying activities.see,b requiring a description of the subject matter and legislative bill numbers associated with lobbying activities.these reports must also list any expenses expended,received or incurred by the lobbyist for the purposes of lobbying,b i,and,except for expenses under dollars,detail those expenses as to amount,to whom paid,and for what purpose,b ii.
the nyclu is a membership organization that engages in a full range of advocacy,including lobbying,litigation,and public education.compl.it routinely files reports with the commission about its lobbying activities.according to the nyclu,o n many issues about which it lobbies,the nyclu also engages in a range of advocacy that is not lobbying that is,does not involve communications with lawmakers or other relevant public officials.that advocacy includes,but is not limited to,public rallies,reports,newsletters,communications through media outlets,pieces,websites,reports,films,and flyers.appellant br.
one such advocacy initiative was the crossgates mall billboard.in march,stephen downs was arrested at the crossgates mall for wearing a bearing the words give peace a chance,in reference to the impending war in iraq,and for refusing to take it off when told to do so by mall security.compl.his arrest triggered a wave of media attention,and the nyclu became involved in challenging what it deemed to be an abridgement of downs free speech rights according to the nyclu,a third party approached it seeking to collaborate on a billboard,to be placed near the crossgates mall,promoting rights at shopping malls.compl.independently and subsequent to that solicitation,a new york state assembly member prepared a bill proposing to entitle new yorkers to exercise certain rights in shopping malls in the state.consistent with its position on this issue and with its longtime participation in legislative advocacy,the nyclu extensively communicated with the assembly member about development of this proposal and publicly endorsed the proposal at a news conference in march.compl.at the same time the nyclu endorsed the legislative proposal,it announced the unveiling of the billboard near crossgates mall.the billboard featured an image of a person who was gagged and included the following text welcome to the mall.you have the right to remain silent.value free speech.www.nyclu.org.the billboard did not mention any legislative proposal or call upon anyone to take action with respect to the proposal.it remained up for one month.compl.
in its report on lobbying activities in july,the nyclu reported all lobbying work done in conjunction with the new york state assembly bill,including its appearance at the march press conference.compl.it did not,however,include information about the billboard or any of nyclu nonlobbying work concerning free speech rights in shopping malls.id.
on october,the nyclu received a letter from a program analyst at the commission stating,in pertinent part,reportable lobbying expenses include the funding of parties,receptions,and all events which are hosted by the client with a special interest in pending legislation the commission is aware of an expense for advertising on a billboard.it appears that certain costs of this event are reportable lobbying expenses and,therefore,must be reported as such.five days later,the nyclu filed its complaint.the complaint was assigned to judge preska as a case related to another matter pending on her docket,summit action network new york temporary state commission on lobbying,wl,which principally involved a first amendment challenge to the commission investigation of certain individuals alleged to be lobbyists but who failed to register with the commission id.the nyclu complaint in the instant action alleged that the commission violated the first amendment by insisting that it report as lobbying advocacy that makes no mention of pending legislation nor exhorts any action with respect to pending legislation,including but not limited to its erection of the billboard outside the crossgates mall.compl.emphasis added.the nyclu sought a declaratory judgment along with a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the commission from forcing the nyclu to report such alleged advocacy activities.
two days after the nyclu filed its complaint,on november,grandeau sent a letter to the nyclu stating that it did not need to respond to the commission request for reporting on the billboard because i t has been determined that the billboard in question was not paid for by nyclu and as such it should not be included as a reportable lobbying expense on your report.the next day,the nyclu sent a letter to assistant attorney general james henly explaining that withdrawal of the commission request does not resolve the controversy that led us to file our federal challenge earlier this week because resolution can not and should not be based on the incorrect conclusion that the nyclu did not incur expenses with respect to the billboard.the nyclu stated that it had incurred expenses on the billboard and therefore any resolution of this dispute must be based on an acknowledgment that the nyclu free speech billboard is not lobbying activity subject to reporting.the attorney general office responded with a letter reiterating that the commission did not seek reporting related to the billboard,and that the office considered the case moot.the nyclu followed with another letter stating its belief that the case was not moot because the commission continued to assert the billboard was part of a lobbying effort.on december,commission counsel ralph miccio sent the nyclu a letter stating that the commission position has never been that the billboard in and of itself constitutes lobbying,but rather,its use as part of a lobbying campaign would make the cost of the billboard a reportable lobbying expense if paid for by a registered lobbyist.miccio stated that the commission investigation revealed that the nyclu had not paid for the billboard.
on december,the commission moved to dismiss the action on younger abstention grounds because a proceeding before the commission was ongoing.in a reply memorandum on december,the commission then took the contradictory position that its inquiry into the b illboard was closed and that the action should be dismissed as moot.see civil liberties union grandeau,d,grandeau ii.the district court denied the commission motion to dismiss the case as moot,citing four factors 
the contradictory positions taken by the commission in this matter the disputed basis on which the commission has withdrawn its for filing regarding the billboard the appearance that the commission withdrawals have been in response to litigation brought by the nyclu and the narrowly drawn present intention declaration provided by the commission in support of the present motion.
civil liberties union grandeau,d,grandeau i.
following this decision,the commission passed a resolution affirming that it did not seek,and would not seek,additional information from the nyclu regarding the crossgates mall billboard.the case also moved forward in the district court with depositions and limited discovery,after which both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment,concluding that the case was moot for two reasons.first,the district court reasoned that the commission resolution indicated that it had closed the billboard inquiry complete ly and irrevocabl y,obviating the concern that it will recur.grandeau ii,d at.second,in response to the nyclu claim that the commission alleged policy of seeking information on activity was likely to recur,the court found that the alleged commission policy is not presented on the facts of this case.id.the court therefore concluded that there is,therefore,no substantial,real,and immediate controversy between the parties,and a ny decision construing the reach of the commission policy would amount to an advisory opinion.id.
the nyclu appeals,urging us to reverse the district court mootness determination and to decide the merits of its first amendment challenge.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all permissible inferences in its favor.niagara mohawk power jones,cir.whether a case is moot presents a legal issue that we also review de novo.white river amusement pub,town of hartford,cir.
the nyclu is not appealing the district court determination that its challenge to the commission billboard inquiry is moot our mootness review therefore encompasses only whether,in the absence of a dispute about the crossgates mall billboard,the nyclu entire case is moot.
the district court mootness determination appears to rest on a premature assumption that certain facts were not in dispute.the court stated that b oth sides are in agreement that expenses incurred as part of the nyclu activities,including placement of the billboard at issue in this case,are not reportable as lobbying expenses unless they are part of a lobbying effort.grandeau ii,d at.the court then stated that t he undisputed facts at the summary judgment stage show that the nyclu billboard effort was separate and apart from its lobbying activity.id.in fact,the parties did not agree on whether the billboard could be deemed part of a lobbying effort.the nyclu maintained that any expenses incurred in erecting the billboard were not reportable because the billboard was advocacy.the commission,however,never agreed that the billboard expenses,if incurred by nyclu,were not reportable its retreat was based on a determination that the nyclu had not paid for the billboard.indeed,the commission assiduously maintained that billboard expenses were reportable if paid for by a registered lobbyist and part of a lobbying effort.in short,the parties were and,as best we can tell on the current record,continue to be in disagreement about what activities are reportable,either because they were lobbying or because they were in support of a lobbying effort.
this ongoing disagreement about what activities are reportable is reflected in the complaint as a challenge to the commission alleged policy of targeting advocacy work for reporting and investigation and supports the nyclu argument that this case is not moot.for example,the complaint alleges,inter alia,that the commission effort to extend the lobbying reporting and disclosure regime to advocacy that makes no mention of any pending legislation and that calls for no action on any such legislation substantially and unnecessarily burdens the first amendment rights of advocacy organizations.compl.the nyclu sought an injunction to prevent the commission from further inquiry into its advocacy work,as well as a preliminary and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from forcing the nyclu to report as lobbying advocacy that makes no mention of pending legislation nor exhorts any action with respect to pending legislation,including but not limited to its erection of the billboard outside the crossgates mall.compl.emphasis added.in addition,the complaint describes the commission investigation of summit action network advocacy activities,compl,and expresses concern about the potential chilling effects of allowing the commission to target advocacy work in the future,compl.the nyclu also asserted in its statement of allegedly undisputed facts,submitted pursuant to rule of the local civil rules of the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of new york rule,that the commission construes the lobbying law to require reporting about all forms of nonlobbying advocacy by an organization also engaged in lobbying if that advocacy addresses a topic about which the organization is engaged in lobbying and the organization believes the nonlobbying advocacy will have some beneficial effect on its lobbying.
these allegations,read in the light most favorable to the nyclu,plainly challenge conduct beyond the commission request for reporting with respect to the crossgates mall billboard they demonstrate the existence of a live controversy between the parties regarding what constitutes reportable activity in support of a lobbying effort,and how broadly the commission may interpret that phrase without running afoul of the first amendment.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in finding that this case was moot.
ii.ripeness 
grandeau argues that even if we read the complaint to challenge a policy of targeting advocacy efforts for reporting and investigation,the alleged policy has not been adopted by the commission,let alone enforced against the nyclu or anyone else.invoking the ripeness doctrine,grandeau contends that this challenge is unfit for judicial review because a court can not coherently rule on a policy constitutionality where,as here,it is at best unclear to what extent an agency has actually adopted a policy or how stringently the agency will enforce it.we agree.
the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d internal quotation marks omitted.a central purpose of this doctrine is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.there are two overlapping threshold criteria for the exercise of a federal court jurisdiction that fall under the term ripeness.simmonds ins,cir.
both criteria are concerned with whether a case has been brought prematurely,but they protect against prematureness in different ways and for different reasons.the first of these ripeness requirements has as its source the case or controversy clause of article iii of the constitution,and hence goes,in a fundamental way,to the existence of jurisdiction.the second is a more flexible doctrine of judicial prudence,and constitutes an important exception to the usual rule that where jurisdiction exists a federal court must exercise it.
these two forms of ripeness are not coextensive in purpose.constitutional ripeness is a doctrine that,like standing,is a limitation on the power of the judiciary.it prevents courts from declaring the meaning of the law in a vacuum and from constructing generalized legal rules unless the resolution of an actual dispute requires it.but when a court declares that a case is not prudentially ripe,it means that the case will be better decided later and that the parties will not have constitutional rights undermined by the delay.it does not mean that the case is not a real or concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns of the parties within the meaning of article iii prudential ripeness is,then,a tool that courts may use to enhance the accuracy of their decisions and to avoid becoming embroiled in adjudications that may later turn out to be unnecessary or may require premature examination of,especially,constitutional issues that time may make easier or less controversial.

despite grandeau arguments to the contrary,there can be little dispute that the nyclu has demonstrated the existence of a case or controversy over the commission alleged reporting requirements sufficient to establish standing and constitutional ripeness.at the time of the complaint,the nyclu was charged with providing additional information on the expenses incurred in connection with the crossgates mall billboard.it argued that to allow the commission to demand reporting on advocacy,including but not limited to the billboard controversy,would greatly increase its administrative burden and would infringe its first amendment rights.these facts demonstrate a concrete dispute affecting cognizable current concerns of the parties sufficient to satisfy standing and constitutional ripeness.ehrenfeld mahfouz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the real issue is one of prudential ripeness whether the alleged policy at this stage is sufficiently definite and clear to permit sound review by this court of the nyclu first amendment challenge.to determine whether a challenge to administrative action is ripe for judicial review,we proceed with a inquiry,requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott,at.
fitness for judicial review 
t he fitness analysis is concerned with whether the issues sought to be adjudicated are contingent on future events or may never occur.simmonds,at internal quotation marks omitted.for example,in isaacs bowen,cir,this court deemed unripe a challenge to a proposed policy change in medicare administration.we explained that plaintiffs challenge was directed at possibilities and proposals only,not at a concrete plan which has been formally promulgated and brought into operation.id.at.we thus drew a distinction between judicial review of specific regulations promulgated by the agency and judicial review of a nonfinal proposed policy.id.at.
similarly,in american savings bank,fsb ubs financial services,cir per curiam,we dismissed a company motion to enforce subpoenas served on a broker former employees under the prudential ripeness doctrine.we held that the case was for judicial resolution principally because the plaintiff had not exhausted its administrative remedies judicial review would only benefit by awaiting the agency views of how best to interpret its own regulations,id.at and it would be unwise to prematurely address the novel issues of first impression,id.in contrast,issues have been deemed ripe when they would not benefit from any further factual development and when the court would be in no better position to adjudicate the issues in the future than it is now.simmonds,at.
the commission policy in this case is vague at best.other than the billboard controversy,the nyclu purports to demonstrate the existence of a policy principally from paragraph of its unopposed rule statement in support of summary judgment,crafted largely from statements grandeau made in a deposition after the nyclu filed this case the commission investigation of nonlobbying advocacy activities relating to the summit action network and certain statements in the commission guidelines on the lobbying law.none of these sources suffices to establish the existence of a commission policy that is fit for judicial review.
first,an opposing party failure to controvert a fact in a rule statement does not absolve the party seeking summary judgment of the burden of showing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,and a rule statement is not itself a vehicle for making factual assertions that are otherwise unsupported in the record.holtz rockefeller,cir.in this case,the summary judgment record itself must support the existence of the commission policy the nyclu alleges.grandeau deposition responses to hypothetical questions about whether certain expenses would be reportable,which form the basis of the nyclu assertion in its rule statement,adopt a view of the commission reach that is troublingly broad,but those deposition statements do not amount to an established commission policy.marchi bd.of coop.educ,cir refusing to rely on deposition statements to establish credible fear of enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional policy when statements were described as personal opinion 
second,the commission investigation of the of summit action network principally concerned who must register and report to the commission as a lobbyist.the plaintiffs first amendment claim in that case emphasized the chilling effect of the commission threats to subpoena,levy fines,and bring criminal charges against entities who were suspected lobbyists because of their public activities,but who had not registered as such.here,the nyclu challenge concerns the extent to which activities may constitute a reportable expense for registered lobbyists when those activities are in support of a lobbying effort.while these two issues overlap to some extent,the nyclu can not establish the existence of a policy regarding when a lobbyist activities are reportable based on the commission investigation into whether certain parties were lobbyists.
the nyclu best effort to demonstrate the alleged policy is the commission guidelines,posted on its website,which state that reportable expenses include 
any expenditure incurred by or reimbursed to the lobbyist for the purpose of lobbying.reportable expenses include,but are not limited to the following advertising,telephone,electronic advocacy,food,beverages,tickets,entertainment,parties,receptions or similar events,advocacy rallies,consultant services,expenses for support staff,and courier services when said expenses are part of a lobbying effort.
new york state commission on public integrity,guidelines to new york state lobbying act,last visited june.we recognize that this reference to electronic advocacy,advocacy rallies,receptions,and advertising creates a basis for concern that the commission will require the nyclu and other organizations to report advocacy that is only loosely related to lobbying.but the potential breadth of reportable expenses depends on how the commission determines what is part of a lobbying effort,and the guidelines offer no indication of a commission policy on this point.nor was the nyclu able to point this court to any evidence,other than in grandeau deposition,of how the commission interprets this principle.
in short,judicial review of the nyclu first amendment challenge would certainly benefit from additional factual development and is in many ways contingent on future events,such as an inquiry by the commission into activity that the nyclu deems advocacy.see simmonds,at see also marchi,at finding first amendment claim unripe when the court would be forced to guess at how the defendant might apply the challenged directive and
