tennessee electric is also irrelevant with respect to prudential standing rules.there,the court declined to reach the merits where private power companies sought to enjoin the federally chartered tennessee valley authority tva from producing and selling electric power,claiming that the statute creating the tva exceeded the national government powers in violation of the tenth amendment.in doing so,the court repeatedly stated that the problem with the power companies suit was a lack of standing or a cause of action,treating those concepts as interchangeable,at.the question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief typically goes to the merits of a case,however,not to the dispute justiciability,steel citizens for better environment,and conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion.this happened with tennessee electric tenth amendment discussion.the statement on which the third circuit relied here,see,at,should be read to refer to the absence of a cause of action for injury caused by economic competition.to the extent the statement might instead be read to suggest a private party does not have standing to raise a tenth amendment issue,it is inconsistent with this court later precedents and should be deemed neither controlling nor instructive on the issue of standing as that term is now defined and applied.
b amicus,appointed to defend the judgment,contends that for bond to argue the national government has interfered with state sovereignty in violation of the tenth amendment is to assert only a state legal rights and interests.but in arguing that the government has acted in excess of the authority that federalism defines,bond seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests.
federalism has more than one dynamic.in allocating powers between the states and national government,federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power,new york united states.it enables states to enact positive law in response to the initiative of those who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times,and it protects the liberty of all persons within a state by ensuring that law enacted in excess of delegated governmental power can not direct or control their actions.see gregory ashcroft.federalism limitations are not therefore a matter of rights belonging only to the states.in a proper case,a litigant may challenge a law as enacted in contravention of federalism,just as injured individuals may challenge actions that transgress,limitations,see,ins chadha.the claim need not depend on the vicarious assertion of a state constitutional interests,even if those interests are also implicated.
the government errs in contending that bond should be permitted to assert only that congress could not enact the challenged statute under its enumerated powers but that standing should be denied if she argues that the statute interferes with state sovereignty.here,bond asserts that the public policy of the pennsylvania,enacted in its capacity as sovereign,has been displaced by that of the national government.the law to which she is subject,the prosecution she seeks to counter,and the punishment she must face might not have come about had the matter been left for pennsylvania to decide.there is no support for the government proposed distinction between different federalism arguments for purposes of prudential standing rules.the principles of limited national powers and state sovereignty are intertwined.impermissible interference with state sovereignty is not within the national government enumerated powers,and action exceeding the national government enumerated powers undermines the states sovereign interests.individuals seeking to challenge such measures are subject to article iii and prudential standing rules applicable to all litigants and claims,but here,where the litigant is a party to an otherwise justiciable case or controversy,she is not forbidden to object that her injury results from disregard of the federal structure of the government.
c the court expresses no view on the merits of bond challenge to the statute validity.

carol anne bond,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether a person indicted for violating a federal statute has standing to challenge its validity on grounds that,by enacting it,congress exceeded its powers under the constitution,thus intruding upon the sovereignty and authority of the states.
the indicted defendant,petitioner here,sought to argue the invalidity of the statute.she relied on the tenth amendment,and,by extension,on the premise that congress exceeded its powers by enacting it in contravention of basic federalism principles.the statute,was enacted to comply with a treaty but petitioner contends that,at least in the present instance,the treaty can not be the source of congressional power to regulate or prohibit her conduct.
the court of appeals held that because a state was not a party to the federal criminal proceeding,petitioner had no standing to challenge the statute as an infringement upon the powers reserved to the states.having concluded that petitioner does have standing to challenge the federal statute on these grounds,this court now reverses that determination.the merits of petitioner challenge to the statute validity are to be considered,in the first instance,by the court of appeals on remand and are not addressed in this opinion.
this case arises from a bitter personal dispute,leading to the criminal acts charged here.petitioner carol anne bond lived outside philadelphia,pennsylvania.after that her close friend was pregnant and that the father was bond husband,bond sought revenge.bond subjected the woman to a campaign of harassing telephone calls and letters,acts that resulted in a conviction on a minor state charge.bond persisted in her hostile acts,placing caustic substances on objects the woman was likely to touch,including her mailbox,car door handle,and front doorknob.bond victim suffered a minor burn on her hand and contacted federal investigators,who identified bond as the perpetrator.
bond was indicted in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania for,among other offenses,two counts of violating.section forbids knowing possession or use of any chemical that can cause death,temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals where not intended for a peaceful purpose.a.the statute was as part of the chemical weapons convention implementation act of,stat,et et.the act implements provisions of the convention on the prohibition of the development,production,stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction,a treaty the united states ratified in.
in the district court,bond moved to dismiss the charges,contending the statute was beyond congress constitutional authority to enact.the district court denied the motion.bond entered a conditional plea of guilty,reserving the right to appeal the ruling on the validity of the statute.she was sentenced to six years in prison.
in the court of appeals for the third circuit,bond renewed her challenge to the statute,citing,among other authorities,the tenth amendment to the constitution.the court of appeals asked for supplemental briefs on the question whether bond had standing to raise the tenth amendment as a ground for invalidating a federal statute in the absence of a state participation in the proceedings.
in its supplemental brief in the court of appeals,the government took the position that bond did not have standing.the court of appeals agreed.
when bond sought certiorari,the government advised this court that it had changed its position and that,in its view,bond does have standing to challenge the constitutionality of on tenth amendment grounds.see brief for united states filed july.the court granted certiorari,and appointed an amicus curiae to defend the judgment of the court of appeals.stephen mcallister,a member of the bar of this court,filed an amicus brief and presented an oral argument that have been of considerable assistance to the court.
to conclude that petitioner lacks standing to challenge a federal statute on grounds that the measure interferes with the powers reserved to states,the court of appeals relied on a single sentence from this court opinion in tennessee power tva.see,at.as the court of appeals noted here,other courts of appeals have taken a similar approach,united states hacker,oregon legal servs,brooklyn legal servs.legal servs,medeiros vincent,united states parker.that approach is in tension,if not conflict,with decisions of some other courts of appeals.see gillespie indianapolis,metrolina family practice group,sullivan,supp.wdnc,aff atlanta gas light united states of energy,see also united states johnson,reserving issue lomont,cadc same nance epa,same.
tennessee electric is the appropriate place to begin.it should be clear that tennessee electric does not cast doubt on bond standing for purposes of article iii requirement.this court long ago disapproved of the case as authoritative respecting article iii limitations.association of data processing service organizations,camp.in the instant case,moreover,it is apparent and in fact conceded not only by the government but also by amicus that article iii poses no barrier.one who seeks to initiate or continue proceedings in federal court must demonstrate,among other requirements,both standing to obtain the relief requested,see lujan defenders of wildlife,and,in addition,an ongoing interest in the dispute on the part of the opposing party that is sufficient to establish concrete adverseness.camreta greene,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.when those conditions are met,article iii does not restrict the opposing party ability to object to relief being sought at its expense.the requirement of article iii standing thus had no bearing upon bond capacity to assert defenses in the district court.as for bond standing to appeal,it is clear article iii prerequisites are met.bond challenge to her conviction and sentence satisfies the requirement,because the incarceration constitutes a concrete injury,caused by the conviction and redressable by invalidation of the conviction.spencer kemna.
to resolve the case,this court must consider next whether tennessee electric is irrelevant with respect to prudential rules of standing as well.the question in tennessee electric was whether a group of private power companies could bring suit to enjoin the federally chartered tennessee valley authority tva from producing and selling electric power.it was conceded that competition from the tva would inflict substantial damage upon the power companies,at.according to the companies,the federal statute authorizing the creation and operation of the tva was invalid because,among other reasons,it exceeded the powers of the national government in violation of the tenth amendment.
declining to reach the merits,the court concluded the power companies lawsuit should be dismissed.it explained that the suit was premised on the principle that a person threatened with injury by conduct which,but for statutory authority for its performance,would be a violation of his legal rights could request an injunction from a court of equity and by this means test the validity of the statute.ibid.but the court concluded that the tva,even if it were shorn of congressional statutory authority,had done nothing more than compete as a supplier of electricity,at.and since state law did not purport to grant any of the power companies a monopoly,there was no basis for a suit in which the tva might be forced to invoke its congressional authorization,at.
in that part of its analysis,and throughout its opinion,the tennessee electric court stated that the problem with the power companies suit was a lack of standing or a cause of action.it treated those concepts as interchangeable,at no standing because no legal cause of complaint at no standing without a cause of action or a right to sue at no standing,no right to sue for an injunction at no tenth amendment standing and no ninth amendment cause of action for same reasons see also bellia,article iii and the cause of action,iowa.
even though decisions since tennessee electric have been careful to use the terms cause of action and standing with more precision,the distinct concepts can be difficult to keep separate.if,for instance,the person alleging injury is remote from the zone of interests a statute protects,whether there is a legal injury at all and whether the particular litigant is one who may assert it can involve similar inquiries.steel citizens for better environment,and noting that statutory standing and the existence of a cause of action are closely connected and sometimes identical questions.
still,the question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief goes to the merits in the typical case,not the justiciability of a dispute,at,and conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion.this is the case with the tenth amendment discussion in tennessee electric.the tennessee electric court noted that a distinct ground upon which standing to maintain the suit is said to rest is that the acts of the authority can not be upheld without permitting federal regulation of purely local matters reserved to the states or the people by the tenth amendment.at.the court rejected the argument,however,concluding the tenth amendment did not give one business a right to keep another from competing,at.the sale of government property in competition with others is not a violation of the tenth amendment 
the court then added the sentence upon which the court of appeals relied in the instant case,the sentence that has been the source of disagreement among courts of appeals 
as we have seen there is no objection to the authority operations by the states,and,if this were not so,the appellants,absent the states or their officers,have no standing in this suit to raise any question under the amendment.ibid.
the quoted statement was in the context of a decision which held that business competitors had no legal injury,and the word standing can be interpreted in that sense.on this reading,the statement reiterated an earlier point.the statement explained that the states in which the tva operated exempted it from their public utilities regulations and that even if the states had not done so and the tva had violated those regulations,the regulations were for the states to enforce.see,at.they conferred no private right of action on business competitors.this reading is consistent with the tennessee
