among the liberties an american citizen enjoys is the right to associate with whomever he or she chooses for whatever purpose.that right,alexis de tocqueville observed in discussing it years ago in his classic book is almost as inalienable in its nature as the right of individual freedom.alexis de tocqueville,democracy in america harvey mansfield delba winthrop eds,chi.press.
peter melzer plaintiff or appellant,a new york city school teacher at bronx high school of science bronx science or school asserts that his constitutional rights to freedom of association and speech were violated when the defendant board of education of the city school district of the city of new york defendant or board terminated his teaching position.he alleges that action was taken in retaliation for his membership in the north american love association nambla or association.
this appeal is from a judgment entered february,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york block,dismissing plaintiff civil rights suit.
background 
facts regarding.teaching record 
plaintiff was a school teacher and an employee of the defendant board,having taught high school science for over years from until his suspension in,and his ultimate termination in.he obtained tenure in as a physics teacher at bronx science,one of three highly selective high schools in new york city.the school actively vies with new york other two prestigious science high schools for the city top students.
during his years at bronx science melzer taught grades nine through.he participated in a number of activities,including a volunteer program to teach physics to area junior high school students.he also served as an advisor to the bronx science physical science journal and its bicycle club,and organized the regional science olympiad.for his school activities and teaching he received several commendations.
membership in nambla 
melzer is a self described pedophile and admits to being sexually attracted to young males up to the age of.despite this proclivity,the record before us reveals no evidence that plaintiff engaged in any illegal or inappropriate conduct at bronx science.plaintiff outlet as a pedophile is his participation in nambla,which he joined in or to discuss with others his attraction to young boys.
nambla stated primary goal is to bring about a change in the attitudes and laws governing sexual activity between men and boys.it advocates the abolition of laws governing the age of consent for such activity and the abolition of laws that limit freedom of expression,including child pornography laws.it seeks to build a support network for men and boys,while educating the public on what it sees as the benevolent nature of its activities,and cooperating with the lesbian,gay,and other movements for sexual liberation.
melzer became very active from early in his membership in nambla and served it in a number of capacities.for over ten years he served intermittently as a member of nambla steering committee,a group that sets the association policy.he also served as the organization treasurer and coordinated its drives.melzer deep interest in the organization is further reflected in his attendance as one of three nambla representatives at the annual international pedophile and youth emancipation conference in amsterdam,the netherlands,a meeting devoted to sharing information about the youth pedophile movement worldwide.melzer nambla publication,the bulletin,and at various times contributed articles and served as editor.
nambla bulletin 
the nambla bulletin is published ten times a year and features articles on topics of interest to members.the bulletin is the voice of nambla.it is distributed by direct mail and sold to the public at select magazine and book stores.
articles appearing in the bulletin offer insight into the organization beliefs and purpose,as well as the extent of melzer involvement.issues of the bulletin where melzer is listed on the masthead as editor included articles like staying safe and happy as a lover,which appeared in october.the article proffered advice developed by nambla activists on how to deal with police,how to store contraband erotica to escape discovery,and how to keep the specifics of a relationship with an underage boy secret from authorities.that advice included never answer police questions,avoid keeping photos of underage boys where police may find them,never discuss the specifics of an illegal relationship with therapists or social workers,and secure legal representation before you need it.another article appearing in the bulletin gave advice on how to identify susceptible children and lure them into sexual acts.melzer stated later that although he did not agree with the article,he did not believe most people would take the advice.
a published letter to the editors of the bulletin,entitled good touches appeared in the december issue.the letter graphically instructed readers on ways to touch specific body parts.in his capacity as editor,melzer sanctioned such pieces in the letters section of the bulletin because he thought they had value.
plaintiff himself wrote several articles.one entitled police infiltrator,appearing in december,recounted the activities of a detective from the manhattan south public morals division,who posed as a nambla ally and arrested at least one nambla member.in a article melzer complained that the officer coerced vulnerable nambla members into mailing copies of melzer bulletin articles to his employer,the defendant board.in the bulletin also reprinted a letter to the editor of newsday melzer had written explaining that nambla believes the ability and the right to experience sexual pleasure is a gift enjoyable by everyone regardless of age or sex.the letter further stated that erotic acts involving young people are not automatically abusive or exploitative.
investigation of plaintiff 
membership in nambla becomes public 
melzer membership in nambla first came to the board attention in via an anonymous letter received by the school then principal.the board office of the inspector general conducted an interview with plaintiff on march,during which melzer declined to confirm or deny whether he was a member of nambla.no administrative action was taken at that time.the investigation was reopened in may by the newly created office of the special commissioner of investigation for the new york city school district commissioner of investigation,an investigative body created to succeed the office of the inspector general.
during the course of the reopened investigation in march,a local television station aired a news story on public school teachers who were members of nambla.the story was broadcast on channel in new york on march,and.it featured a secretly recorded video of a nambla meeting at which melzer could be seen advising a employee of the board to keep his association membership secret until he acquired tenure.the story also featured interviews with students,as well as an attempted interview with melzer himself.other news media soon picked up the story and further disseminated the fact that melzer,a teacher at bronx science,was a nambla member.
response by bronx science high school community 
in the wake of this media attention,melzer became the center of heated discussion in the bronx science community.school principal vincent galasso attempted to prevent the airing of the first segment of the channel series,but was told by an nbc reporter,not on your expletive deleted life.galasso thereupon convened a number of school officials to discuss his concerns about melzer and the attendant publicity.since plaintiff was on sabbatical for the school year,the discussion focused on whether he should be allowed to return the following year.galasso spoke to nearly teachers and school officials,many of whom shared his concerns about whether melzer should be teaching children and the effect the news story would have on student recruitment.
the bronx high school of science parents association met to discuss the issue on march,right after the first installment of the news story was broadcast.many of the or parents in attendance expressed anger at melzer nambla affiliation.they threatened to remove their children and conduct a sitdown strike at the school if melzer were allowed to return.a letter was drafted to the board of education chancellor,the mayor,and other public officials demanding that melzer and any other known member of nambla not be in a position of daily contact with the students at bronx science,or of any other new york city public school.in a personal meeting with the chancellor,parents association representatives strongly urged that melzer not be permitted to return to the classroom,threatening to boycott the school and to call the news media if their views were ignored.
the students themselves held a person assembly on march,where a majority of the students who spoke opposed plaintiff continued employment.a few students,however,expressed the view that a person not convicted of anything illegal should be allowed to practice his profession.school publications ran articles expressing opinions on both sides of the controversy.one stated that no matter how strange an organization may appear,people have the right to express their views,while another said plaintiff actions should be condemned as utterly detestable.galasso estimated that over percent of the student body was unhappy with melzer membership in nambla.
based on these reactions from the school community,galasso decided that allowing melzer to return to the classroom would be detrimental to the school.in september the commissioner of investigation issued its report recommending disciplinary action in melzer case.the report stated that it had examined the issues and concluded that serious disruption,as well as permanent loss of parental confidence is inevitable if melzer is returned to the classroom.the investigation report concluded that articles in the bulletin could serve as an instruction manual for the sexual abuse of children and can reasonably be assumed to have led to such abuse.
disciplinary proceedings 
as a result of this report,the board filed disciplinary charges against plaintiff stating that he had advanced the goals and activities of nambla,and assisted in the publication of the nambla bulletin,including at times editing,writing and raising funds for this publication,all of which promoted illegal sexual activity between male adults and male children under the age of consent.further,the board charged that melzer activities had been widely reported,had caused disruption in his school and the school community,and had undermined his ability to serve as a teacher.melzer requested a hearing pursuant to new york education law to contest the charges.after days of hearings held over the course of three years,the hearing officer recommended that melzer be terminated.the board upon receipt of this recommendation dismissed plaintiff.
prior legal action 
melzer brought the instant action in the eastern district challenging his dismissal by the defendant board.the district court conducted a bench trial,and in affirming the board decision,see melzer bd.of,d,found credible galasso reports of significant disruption at the high school.it concluded that melzer was terminated solely because his employer reasonably believed that the public exposure of melzer associational activities was likely to impair melzer effectiveness as a teacher and cause internal disruption if he were returned to the classroom.id.at.the threat of such disruption,the district court believed,weighed more heavily than melzer rights to speech and association.id.at.
with this factual background in mind,we turn now to a discussion of the legal issues.
discussion 
i pickering test for public employees speecha.in general 
the first amendment protects the speech and association rights of an individual like melzer,no matter how different,unpopular or morally repugnant society may find his activities.nonetheless,it has been established law for over years,since the supreme court decided pickering board of education,that the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general,d.thus,the government may impose restraints on the first amendment activities of its employees that are even when such restraints would be unconstitutional if applied to the public at large.see united states treasury employees union,d treasury union.
under what is now called the pickering balancing test,public employees like plaintiff teacher do not leave their first amendment rights at the schoolhouse door,even though it is plain that those rights are somewhat diminished in public employment.the test requires a court to consider the most appropriate possible balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering,at.hereafter pickering or balancing test.the balancing test allows the government a degree of control over its employees to permit it to provide services to the public efficiently and effectively,see connick myers,d see also waters churchill,d plurality opinion,but ensures that public employers do not use their authority to silence discourse not because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of the employees speech.rankin mcpherson,d.
pickering approach 
the pickering test involves a inquiry first,a court must determine whether the speech which led to an employee discipline relates to a matter of public concern and,second,if so,the balance between free speech concerns is weighed against efficient public service to ascertain to which the scale tips.see rankin,at.
the first part of the inquiry,commonly referred to as the public concern test,serves a gatekeeping function for employee speech claims in federal courts.the first amendment protects an employee only when he is speaking as a citizen upon matters of public concern as opposed to when he speaks only on matters of personal concern.connick,at.if the speech that led to an employee discipline was on a personal example,a complaint about a change in an employee government is granted wide latitude to deal with the employee without any special burden of justification.treasury union,at.connick,at.
when it is shown that the employee speech was on a matter of public concern,the second step,or balancing portion of the test,comes into play.under it the government has the burden of showing that despite first amendment rights the employee speech so threatens the government effective operation that discipline of the employee is justified.see treasury union,at.
for an employee to prevail he or she must also demonstrate that the speech was the motivating factor causing the public employer to take adverse action.heil santoro,cir.even when the government can not show a compelling justification under pickering for infringing on its employee rights,the government still may succeed if it can demonstrate that it would have undertaken the same adverse employment action even absent the protected speech.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.by the same token,when the government prevails in the balancing test,the employee may still carry the day if he can show that the employer motivation for the discipline was retaliation for the speech itself,rather than for any resulting disruption.see sheppard beerman,cir.
ii applicability of pickering to hybrid activities unrelated to employment 
distinction between this case and ordinary speech cases 
the claim before us diverges from the usual line of cases requiring application of pickering,which ordinarily applies in situations involving speech directed at an employer,made at the place of employment or directly concerning the employer in some way.see,knight.dep t of pub.health,cir employee proselytizing clients while on public business hale mann,cir report critical of employer policies clue johnson,cir union faction criticism of management labor policies lewis cowen,cir objections to policies of connecticut gaming board by board employee mcevoy spencer,cir police commissioner criticism of police department sheppard,at law clerk criticism of judge piesco city of new york dep t of personnel,cir senior personnel director truthful testimony before state senate committee lefcourt legal aid soc y,aff,cir legal aid attorney criticism of supervisor policies disrupting internal operations.
the present case is unlike the above cited cases in two ways.one is that melzer termination stems not from something done in the workplace,but from first amendment activities occurring outside the workplace and largely unconnected to it.the second is that the activity which prompted the board to fire melzer was not a specific instance of speech,or particular disruptive statement,but an associational activity of which speech was an essential component.melzer termination did not directly stem from any particular words he said or most inflammatory articles appearing in the bulletin were not written by melzer himself,and most of melzer admissions about his sexual preference were made after and as result of the scandal at bronx science.although the board report cited the foregoing pieces of evidence in support of their decision,it is clear that the board basic justification for firing melzer was the community reaction to the message advocated by nambla,its bulletin,and melzer himself through his active participation in the organization.nonetheless,our view is that pickering remains the applicable test.
applicability of pickering 
several considerations prompt us to believe pickering is the appropriate standard here.addressing the first point of the activity in question took place away from the recognize that the balancing test application is not limited to conduct occurring at or directly relating to the workplace.the supreme court in treasury union applied the pickering test to a law that prohibited honoraria to government employees giving speeches outside their place of work,the content of which was unrelated to the speechmaker employment.at.the court instructed that although the situation fell outside the typical paradigm,the goal of striking an appropriate balance between employee and government interests is activated whenever the government seeks to regulate employees protected speech,regardless of where it occurs or how closely it is related to work.id.attenuation of time,place,or content of speech from the workplace is ultimately accounted for in the balancing part of the process,but those factors will not absolutely preclude government regulation.
we and at least one other circuit have likewise recognized the balancing test applicability to a wider range of issues than just those arising in or concerning speech occurring at the workplace.see pappas giuliani,cir applying pickering to police officer speech made privately,and away from work bieluch sullivan,cir applying balancing test to speech made in course of political community activities unrelated to work flanagan munger,cir applying such test to related speech embodied in pornographic movies purveyed away from work.
taking the second point of divergence from the usual pickering termination did not arise solely out of specific disruptive think the balancing test is nonetheless appropriate.the root of the disruption at bronx science can not be identified discretely as either melzer associational activities or the attendant speech,for the two are dependent on one another.membership in nambla was,surely,an associational activity.however,nambla primary purpose was advocacy,and melzer,by his active participation and his role as editor of the bulletin,furthered this advocacy.thus,interconnecting associational and speech rights are in play.
several circuits,including our own,have labeled such claims involving multiple first amendment rights hybrid claims.see,knight,at balton city of milwaukee,cir cudahy,concurring in the judgment brown hot,sexy safer,cir.our analysis is unaffected by the presence of rights to both association and speech.we have recognized that where multiple branches of first amendment protection are implicated by an employment decision,the affected rights enjoy no more protection than each would receive when viewed separately.see knight,at.thus,we will protect plaintiff interests adequately if we afford a level of constitutional protection warranted for both speech and association.
plaintiff right to speech is undoubtedly amply protected by the pickering test.see treasury union,at.associational rights,when exercised in conjunction with speech,are also sufficiently protected by pickering.we note that in some public employment contexts the right of association is given heightened protection,such as when public employees engage in partisan political activities in opposition to their bosses own political party.see elrod burns,d branti finkel,d.but we have ruled that such heightened protection is limited to the context of partisan political conduct.see mcevoy,at regan boogertman,cir.by contrast,where associational activity involves speech and causes disruption to the workplace,a balance between government and employee rights adequately protects the interests of both.branti,at.noting the importance of balancing government and employee interests,but finding employee interests protected when partisan political affiliation among employees is involved regan,at same see also selzer fleisher,cir kaufman,concurring in part and dissenting in part arguing for application of pickering to associational claim the right to associate freely is not absolute,particularly where its exercise conflicts with the duties and responsibilities of a governmental employee.
moreover,we have found pickering to be the appropriate standard where both expressive and associational activities are involved.in clue,we applied pickering to an adverse employment action arising out of employees pamphleteering and petitioning.at.although describing the claim as a purely associational one,the union activities in question more closely resembled the hybrid speech and association we find in the present case.accordingly,we believe pickering similarly protects plaintiff speech and associational rights in the instant case.
iii applicability of public concern test 
having determined that pickering provides the correct framework for our analysis,we turn to its application here.the first step in the analysis,the public concern threshold to first amendment protection,was set forth in connick,at,as a logical extension of pickering before we afford protection to a discharged employee,the public concern test requires us to find that the employee was speaking as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern.pickering,at.
application of the public concern test is made awkward in this case given the hybrid nature of the rights involved.whether an employee first amendment activity relates to a matter of public concern is ordinarily a question of law decided on the whole record by taking into account the content,form,and context of a given statement.see connick,at.lewis,at luck mazzone,cir per curiam.but,a court making that same decision when examining rights such as those asserted here,faces the fact that an association engaged in advocacy may deliver many different statements at many different times and places and under many different circumstances.what statements,at what locations and in what context are the ones that should be analyzed is shrouded in uncertainty.in rare situations,all of an employee statements may be matters of public concern because they are made away from the workplace and relate to the interchange of ideas.in most situations,some statements are found to be of public concern,while others are not.it would be problematic for a court to determine whether the activity of an speaks and acts in a myriad of different to a matter of public concern.
for this reason,courts have questioned whether the public concern test is appropriate in cases like the present one.see treasury union,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part recognizing no need for public concern test prior to applying pickering balancing test to speech bearing no nexus to government
