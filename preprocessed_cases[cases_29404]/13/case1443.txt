jeffrey johnson johnson is currently serving three years of supervised release,imposed by the united states district court for the northern district of new york thomas mcavoy,judge as part of his sentence for sexual predation against minors.he challenges certain modifications to his conditions of supervised release johnson argues that i mandatory polygraph testing to ensure compliance with the terms of his supervised release is not reasonably related to the purposes of sentencing and is a violation of his fifth amendment rights against ii a bar on direct or indirect contact with minors is unconstitutionally vague and iii a ban on using any computer with internet access is an excessive deprivation of liberty.
background 
johnson criminal history 
johnson is a convicted sex offender.he is also an aerospace engineer and a sophisticated user of computers.between and,johnson used the internet to conduct conversations with minors,and to lure several of them to meetings.he had sex with two minors and was arrested while on his way to have sex with a third.
johnson pleaded guilty and was principally sentenced to months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.conditions governing johnson supervised release were ordered in three waves.at sentencing,the court imposed three conditions that johnson participate in a mental health evaluation treatment program that johnson not associate with any individual under the age of except by permission of his probation officer and that johnson not possess or use a computer to access any computer service except by permission of his probation officer.
on july,the probation department petitioned for several modifications to johnson conditions of supervised release mandatory treatment using polygraph testing to obtain information necessary for risk management and treatment a prohibition on direct or indirect contact with minors and presence in areas in which minors are likely to congregate such as schools,child care centers,and playgrounds and relaxation of the previous total ban on johnson computer use if johnson participated in the computer restriction and monitoring program,which would have allowed the probation office to install software aimed at monitoring his computer use.johnson challenged all of these modifications.
polygraph testing 
johnson objected to polygraph testing on two grounds.first,he argued that,without use and derivative use immunity,he could be deprived of his fifth amendment rights against and face the dilemma of confessing his sins or remaining silent and going to jail for violating a condition of supervised release.second,johnson argued that the district court should not impose polygraph testing because such testing is unreliable and not reasonably related to the purposes of sentencing,and therefore can not be employed in a special condition of supervised release.
the district court agreed with the probation department on the benefits of polygraph testing,but partially accommodated johnson fifth amendment concern by adding certain safeguards.the court limited the scope of examinations to information necessary for supervision,case monitoring,and treatment,and made clear that though johnson would be compelled to answer if a truthful answer would expose him to a prosecution for a crime different from the one on which he was already convicted,he would preserve his right to challenge in a court of law the use of such statements as violations of his fifth amendment rights or,i n other words,johnson must answer the questions posed to him,but,by answering,he will not be waiving his fifth amendment rights with respect to any criminal prosecution unrelated to the conviction for which he is now on supervised release.johnson appeals these rulings.
ban on direct and indirect contact with minors 
the second modification sought by the probation department was to prohibit any direct or indirect contact with a person under age.johnson challenged this proposed modification as both vague and impossible vague,because it provides no notice to him as to what conduct he is prohibited from engaging in impossible,because the possibilities for making inadvertent indirect contact with persons under age are a virtual certainty upon his leaving his house and conducting normal day to day business.
the district court agreed with johnson that the word indirect casts too broad of a net and modified johnson conditions to require that he reasonably avoid remove himself from situations in which he has indirect contact with a minor.the modified conditions also require that johnson shall not have any direct contact with a person under the age of unless it is supervised by a person approved of by the probation officer.the modification also takes into account the indeterminacy of the word indirect by decreeing that johnson shall not have indirect contact with a person under the age of through another person or through a device including a telephone,computer,radio,or other means unless it is supervised by a person approved of by the probation officer.emphasis added.johnson argues that in spite of the district court stated objective,the plain language of the modification still allowed for inadvertent violation.the government supports the ban as worded.
modification banning use of computers with internet access 
johnson objected to computer monitoring his objection became moot when this condition was modified a second time.in december the probation department,in response to the comments of treatment officials,requested a further modification of johnson conditions of supervised release.the government sought to bar johnson from using any computer with internet access,until his progress in treatment reduced his risk of recidivism.the district court ordered an evidentiary hearing to explore the tension between second circuit precedent guaranteeing minimal internet access and the perceived necessity of an outright ban in this case.
at the hearing,johnson probation that johnson was expelled from treatment by the tompkins county mental health clinic treatment agency for failing to agree to refrain from using the internet and for otherwise failing to participate fully in his program.mcbride accused johnson of complying with his treatment program superficially,doing what he was specifically asked to do without acknowledg ing that he needs to make any changes in his.mcbride viewed this generally resistant attitude as a sign that johnson remained a high risk to,and that limits on internet access were needed.
linda riley,a clinic supervisor with the treatment agency,confirmed that an outright ban on internet access was needed for johnson treatment t he internet is an instrument of his offending access to the internet is a risk situation because he does not have the internal controls necessary to not offend.
johnson sponsored the testimony of richard maxwell,a clinical psychologist whose clinical practice centered on depression,anxiety disorders,and marital problems,and who devoted only a small amount of his practice to sex offenders.maxwell opined that access to the internet would allow johnson to develop socially and professionally,but conceded that i do really know at this point whether johnson is a pedophile or somebody with a sexual addiction,and added that his risk assessment of johnson internet use obviously would be wrong i f he a pedophile.
the district court adopted the proposed modification.in so doing,the court distinguished second circuit cases which had held outright internet bans to be overbroad on several grounds use of the internet in the commission of johnson previous offenses the severity of johnson offenses fear that computer circumvent any lesser restriction and the treatment necessity for an outright ban.
discussion 
in reviewing conditions of supervised release imposed by a district court,issues of law are reviewed de novo.united states lifshitz,cir.conditions of supervised release are judged by an abuse of discretion standard,where any error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.united states doe,cir.
polygraph testing 
federal sentencing policy requires that conditions of supervised release impose no greater restraint than reasonably necessary to promote sentencing goals.we have never considered whether polygraph testing is a condition that satisfies this test,nor have we considered whether such a condition offends the fifth amendment right against.
objectives of sentencing 
the district courts may 
impose special conditions of supervised release to the extent that they are reasonably related to i the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,and ii the purposes of sentencing,including the need to afford adequate deterrence,to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,and to provide the defendant with needed training or treatment.
united states germosen,cir citing,inter alia,d.conditions of supervised release may restrict liberty to the extent reasonably needed to achieve the above purposes.see also united states lifshitz,cir.citing the asserted unreliability of the polygraph,johnson argues that the condition is not reasonably related to the pertinent sentencing factors and imposes a greater deprivation on his liberty than is reasonably necessary.
other circuits have concluded that polygraph testing may serve salutary purposes in the supervised release context.see,united states york,cir united states dotson,cir united states lee,cir united states zinn,cir.as lee explained,a polygraph may provide an added incentive for the offender to furnish truthful testimony to the probation officer.such purpose would assist the officer in his or her supervision and monitoring of the appellant.lee,at.obviously,the incremental tendency of polygraph testing to promote such candor furthers the objectives of sentencing by allowing for more careful scrutiny of offenders on supervised release.polygraphs have also been found to assist another sentencing objective ensur ing compliance with probationary terms.zinn,at.the lie detector may deter lying notwithstanding its arguable or occasional unreliability because of the subject fear that it might work,or be credited by others whether it works or not.notwithstanding the preceding case law,johnson contends that an assertedly unreliable technology can not advance honest discussion or compliance with conditions of supervised release.
johnson cites,inter alia,united states scheffer,d,for the proposition that polygraph evidence is unreliable.the scheffer court noted that studies have positioned polygraph reliability between and.id.at.since even the bottom of the range is still,the technology produces an incentive to tell the truth,and thereby advances the sentencing goals.
as johnson points out,polygraph results are inadmissible as evidence.but that does not much bear on the therapeutic value of the tool 
t he polygraph test is inadmissible in nearly every circumstance at trial.obviously,however,evidentiary cases do not govern our evaluation of the use of polygraphs in connection with the treatment of an offender.the use of a polygraph test here is not aimed at gathering evidence to inculpate or exculpate the offender.rather,the test is contemplated as a potential treatment tool upon an offender release from prison 
dotson,at emphasis added internal citation omitted.moreover,the exclusion of polygraph evidence in many cases has been based in part on a risk of prejudicial effect.see,united states kwong,cir see also united states williams,cir.prejudice is not as salient a risk in the absence of a jury generally speaking,sentencing judges are better equipped to decide what weight if any to afford polygraph results.
the case for use of polygraph testing is strong here in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.germosen,at.the district court crafted supervised release conditions for a serial offender who apparently resisted honest.johnson treatment provider labeled johnson attitude superficial and not adequately engaged in the recovery process.he has an increasingly antagonistic attitude featuring an inadequate level of accountability for his offenses.the polygraph can help penetrate deception and encourage an offender to confront his own motivations and behaviors.these outcomes further sentencing objectives such as rehabilitation and deterrence,with reasonably small incremental deprivations of liberty.we therefore conclude that polygraph testing can,and in this case does,further sentencing goals without excessive deprivations of liberty.
fifth amendment challenge 
johnson argues that if he commits future offenses,or is asked about past offenses other than the ones for which he was convicted,he will be put to the choice of incriminating himself by answering polygraph questions truthfully or violating supervised release by answering untruthfully,or not at all.the first question is whether this challenge is ripe.see united states antelope,cir the constitutional component of ripeness is a jurisdictional prerequisite.article iii of the constitution,which limits our jurisdiction to cases and controversies,precludes resolution in the absence of direct and immediate dilemma.marchi bd.of coop.educ,cir.the mere possibility of future injury,unless it is the cause of some present detriment,does not constitute the requisite hardship.simmonds ins,cir emphasis added.
at the moment,johnson has suffered no injury from polygraph testing but he can be injured because he might end up in jail if he truthfully confesses a new offense during testing,falsely denies it,or invokes the fifth amendment to avoid answering.yet,johnson may not have committed offenses in the past other than those for which he was convicted,and he may abstain from criminal activity while on supervised release even if he does not,johnson probation officer may never ask a question sufficiently probing to justify invocation of the fifth amendment,or an incriminating answer may be ignored by prosecutors,or the district court may find no supervised release violation.
although it does not appear that we have previously considered ripeness in the context of a challenge such as that made by johnson,several other circuit courts have considered similar challenges,and all have found them ripe for decision,regardless of whether the defendant had yet suffered penal injury.in antelope,at,for example,the ninth circuit concluded that a defendant who had been incarcerated for a refusal to answer questions that he deemed incriminating while on supervised release could raise a fifth amendment challenge to the revocation of that release.in united states zinn,cir,the eleventh circuit deemed ripe the appeal of a defendant who argued,inter alia,that a condition of supervised release requiring him to submit to polygraph examinations violated the fifth amendment,even though the defendant had not yet been released from prison and therefore had not yet been subject to the challenged condition.the court concluded that although the defendant could not yet challenge the precise implementation of the polygraph condition,id.at,his general challenge to the polygraph exam was neither premature nor speculative.id.at see also united states davis,cir per curiam ruling that although a defendant had not yet been released from prison and therefore was not yet subject to supervised release conditions,his challenge to a polygraph condition was ripe because he faces a sufficiently direct and immediate dilemma as he seeks to determine whether exercising his fifth amendment privilege in response to questions by his probation officer will result in revocation of his supervised release internal quotation marks and citations omitted united states lee,cir without mentioning ripeness,entertaining a challenge to a polygraph condition by a defendant not yet on supervised release.
generally,a challenge lacks ripeness if it concerns abstract regulations or if it presents issues that might never arise.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass new york state of envtl.conservation,cir.a case may be ripe even before formal enforcement if a direct and immediate impact is suffered from the challenged policy.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds,califano sanders,d.ripeness is satisfied by a dire
