on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor may exempt certain assets from the bankruptcy estate.it further provides that exempt assets generally are not liable for any expenses associated with administering the estate.in this case,we consider whether a bankruptcy court nonetheless may order that a debtor exempt assets be used to pay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the debtor misconduct.
background 
chapter of the bankruptcy code gives an insolvent debtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidating his assets to pay his creditors.a.the filing of a bankruptcy petition under chapter creates a bankruptcy estate generally comprising all of the debtor property.a.the estate is placed under the control of a trustee,who is responsible for managing liquidation of the estate assets and distribution of the proceeds.a.the code authorizes the debtor to exempt,however,certain kinds of property from the estate,enabling him to retain those assets postbankruptcy.b.except in particular situations specified in the code,exempt property is not liable for the payment of any prepetition debt or any administrative expense.c,k.
section d of the code provides a number of exemptions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.b,d.one,commonly known as the homestead exemption,protects up to in equity in the debtor residence.d and note following see owen owen.the debtor may elect,however,to forgo the d exemptions and instead claim whatever exemptions are available under applicable state or local law.b a.some states provide homestead exemptions that are more generous than the federal exemption some provide less generous versions but nearly every state provides some type of homestead exemption.see l√≥pez,state homestead exemptions and bankruptcy law is it time for congress to close the loophole rutgers bus,listing state exemptions.
petitioner,stephen law,filed for chapter bankruptcy in,and respondent,alfred siegel,was appointed to serve as trustee.the estate only significant asset was law house in hacienda heights,california.on a schedule filed with the bankruptcy court,law valued the house at and claimed that of its value was covered by california homestead exemption.see cal.civ.proc.code ann.a west supp.he also reported that the house was subject to two voluntary liens a note and deed of trust for in favor of washington mutual bank,and a second note and deed of trust for in favor of lin mortgage associates.law thus represented that there was no equity in the house that could be recovered for his other creditors,because the sum of the two liens exceeded the house nonexempt value.
if law representations had been accurate,he presumably would have been able to retain the house,since siegel would have had no reason to pursue its sale.instead,a few months after law petition was filed,siegel initiated an adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of lin mortgage associates was fraudulent.the deed of trust supporting that lien had been recorded by law in and reflected a debt to someone named lili lin.not one but two individuals claiming to be lili lin ultimately responded to siegel complaint.one,lili lin of artesia,california,was a former acquaintance of law who denied ever having loaned him money and described his repeated efforts to involve her in various sham transactions relating to the disputed deed of trust.that lili lin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaiming any interest in the house.but that was not the end of the matter,because the second lili lin claimed to be the true beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust.over the next five years,this lili lin managed despite supposedly living in china and speaking no english to engage in extensive and costly litigation,including several appeals,contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and siegel subsequent sale of the house.
finally,in,the bankruptcy court entered an order concluding that no person named lili lin ever made a loan to law in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.in re law,bkrtcy.cd cal.the court found that the loan was a fiction,meant to preserve law equity in his residence beyond what he was entitled to exempt by perpetrating a fraud on his creditors and the court.ibid.with regard to the second lili lin,the court declared itself unpersuaded that lili lin of china signed or approved any declaration or pleading purporting to come from her.ibid.rather,it said,the most plausible conclusion was that law himself had authored,signed,and filed some or all of these papers.ibid.it also found that law had submitted false evidence in an effort to persuade the court that lili lin of china rather than lili lin of artesia was the true holder of the lien on his residence.at.the court determined that siegel had incurred more than in attorney fees overcoming law fraudulent misrepresentations.it therefore granted siegel motion to surcharge the entirety of law homestead exemption,making those funds available to defray siegel attorney fees.
the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed.bap no,wl,per curiam.it held that the bankruptcy court factual findings regarding law fraud were not clearly erroneous and that the court had not abused its discretion by surcharging law exempt assets.it explained that in latman burdette,the ninth circuit had recognized a bankruptcy court power to equitably surcharge a debtor statutory in exceptional circumstances,such as when a debtor engages in inequitable or fraudulent conduct.wl.the bankruptcy appellate panel acknowledged that the tenth circuit had disagreed with latman,see in re scrivner,but the panel affirmed that latman was correct.wl.judge markell filed a concurring opinion agreeing with the panel application of latman but questioning whether latman remains good policy.wl.
the ninth circuit affirmed.in re law,fed.appx.per curiam.it held that the surcharge was proper because it was calculated to compensate the estate for the actual monetary costs imposed by the debtor misconduct,and was warranted to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process.at.we granted certiorari.
ii.analysis 
a bankruptcy court has statutory authority to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the bankruptcy code.a.and it may also possess inherent power to sanction abusive litigation practices.marrama citizens bank of.but in exercising those statutory and inherent powers,a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific statutory provisions.
it is hornbook law that a does not allow the bankruptcy court to override explicit mandates of other sections of the bankruptcy code.collier on bankruptcy,ed.section a confers authority to carry out the provisions of the code,but it is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the code prohibits.that is simply an application of the axiom that a statute general permission to take actions of a certain type must yield to a specific prohibition found elsewhere.see morton mancari,ginsberg sons,popkin,courts inherent sanctioning powers are likewise subordinate to valid statutory directives and prohibitions.degen united states,chambers nasco.we have long held that whatever equitable powers remain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be exercised within the confines of the bankruptcy code.norwest bank worthington ahlers,see,raleigh illinois of revenue,united states noland,sec united states realty improvement.
thus,the bankruptcy court surcharge was unauthorized if it contravened a specific provision of the code.we conclude that it did.section by reference to california law entitled law to exempt of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate.b a.and it made that not liable for payment of any administrative expense.k the reasonable attorney fees siegel incurred defeating the lili lin lien were indubitably an administrative expense,as a short march through a few statutory makes plain section b provides that administrative expenses include compensation awarded under a a authorizes reasonable compensation for actual,necessary services rendered by a professional person employed under and a authorizes the trustee to employ one or more attorneys to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee duties under this title.siegel argues that even though attorney fees incurred responding to a debtor fraud qualify as administrative expenses for purposes of determining the trustee right to reimbursement under b,they do not so qualify for purposes of k but he gives us no reason to depart from the normal rule of statutory construction that words repeated in different parts of the same statute generally have the same meaning.see department of revenue of acf industries,quoting sorenson secretary of treasury.
the bankruptcy court thus violated express terms when it ordered that the protected by law homestead exemption be made available to pay siegel attorney fees,an administrative expense.in doing so,the court exceeded the limits of its authority under a and its inherent powers.
siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy court a and inherent powers may not be exercised in contravention of the code.instead,his main argument is that the bankruptcy court surcharge did not contravene.that statute,siegel contends,establish es the procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemptions but contains no directive requiring courts to allow an exemption regardless of the circumstances.brief for respondent.thus,he says,recognition of an equitable power in the bankruptcy court to deny an exemption by surcharging the exempt property in response to the debtor misconduct can coexist comfortably with.the united states,appearing in support of siegel,agrees,arguing that neither gives debtors an absolute right to retain exempt property nor limits a court authority to impose an equitable surcharge on such property.brief for united states as amicus curiae.
insofar as siegel and the united states equate the bankruptcy court surcharge with an outright denial of law homestead exemption,their arguments founder upon this case procedural history.the bankruptcy appellate panel stated that because no one timely oppose d law homestead exemption claim,the exemption became final before the bankruptcy court imposed the surcharge.wl,at.we have held that a trustee failure to make a timely objection prevents him from challenging an exemption.taylor freeland kronz.
but even assuming the bankruptcy court could have revisited law entitlement to the exemption,does not give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions based on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.rather,the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that will render property exempt.see b,d.siegel insists that because b says that the debtor may exempt certain property,rather than that he shall be entitled to do so,the court retains discretion to grant or deny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.but the subject of may exempt in b is the debtor,not the court,so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests discretion.a debtor need not invoke an exemption to which the statute entitles him but if he does,the court may not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid statutory basis for doing so.
moreover,sets forth a number of carefully calibrated exceptions and limitations,some of which relate to the debtor misconduct.for example,c makes exempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition debts,including debts arising from tax fraud,fraud in connection with student loans,and other specified types of wrongdoing.section o prevents a debtor from claiming a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the homestead with nonexempt property in the previous years with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.and q caps a debtor homestead exemption at approximately but does not eliminate it where the debtor has been convicted of a felony that sho
