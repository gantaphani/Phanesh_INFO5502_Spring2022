this case involves the intersection of two federal statutes.the lanham act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.f.to implement the fdca provisions,the food and drug administration fda has promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling,including one concerning juice blends.unlike the lanham act,which,relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors,the fdca and its regulations give the united states nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit private enforcement suits.the fdca also certain state misbranding laws.
petitioner pom wonderful llc,which produces,markets,and sells,inter alia,a juice blend,filed a lanham act suit against respondent company,alleging that the name,label,marketing,and advertising of one of juice blends mislead consumers into believing the product consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices,and that the ensuing confusion causes pom to lose sales.the district court granted partial summary judgment to,ruling that the fdca and its regulations preclude lanham act challenges to the name and label of juice blend.the ninth circuit affirmed in relevant part.
held competitors may bring lanham act claims like pom challenging food and beverage labels regulated by the fdca.
a this result is based on the following premises.first,this is not a case,for it does not raise the question whether state law is by a federal law,see wyeth levine,but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute.principles may nonetheless be instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on the same subject.second,this is a statutory interpretation case and analysis of the statutory text,aided by established interpretation rules,controls.see chickasaw nation united states.while a principle of interpretation may be countered by some maxim pointing in a different direction,circuit city stores,adams,this court need not decide what maxim establishes the proper framework here even assuming that is correct that the court task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied repeal in part of another statute,is incorrect that the best way to do that is to bar pom lanham act claim.
b neither the lanham act nor the fdca,in express terms,forbids or limits lanham act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the fdca.the absence of such a textual provision when the lanham act and the fdca have coexisted for over years is powerful evidence that congress did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling.see wyeth,supra,at.in addition,and contrary to argument,congress,by taking care to only some state laws,if anything indicated it did not intend the fdca to preclude requirements arising from other sources.see setser united states.the structures of the fdca and the lanham act reinforce this conclusion.where two statutes are complementary,it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that congress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the operation of the other.see ag supply,pioneer int l.the lanham act and the fdca complement each other in major respects,for each has its own scope and purpose.both touch on food and beverage labeling,but the lanham act protects commercial interests against unfair competition,while the fdca protects public health and safety.they also complement each other with respect to remedies.the fdca enforcement is largely committed to the fda,while the lanham act empowers private parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a basis.allowing lanham act suits takes advantage of synergies among multiple methods of regulation.a holding that the fdca precludes lanham act claims challenging food and beverage labels also could lead to a result that congress likely did not intend.the fda does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regarding all objectionable labels,preclusion of lanham act claims could leave commercial interests and indirectly the public at large with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in other less regulated industries.
c arguments do not support its claim that preclusion is proper because congress intended national uniformity in food and beverage labeling.first,the fdca delegation of enforcement authority to the federal government does not indicate that congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.second,the fdca express provision applies by its terms to state,not federal,law.even if it were proper to stray from that text,it not clear that national uniformity assertions reflect the congressional design.finally,the fdca and its implementing regulations may address food and beverage labeling with more specificity than the lanham act,but this specificity would matter only if the two acts can not be implemented in full at the same time.here,neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the court is aware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms.
d the government intermediate position that a lanham act claim is precluded to the extent the fdca or fda regulations specifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of the label,and that this rule precludes pom challenge to the name of product is flawed,for the government assumes that the fdca and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling when congress intended the lanham act and the fdca to complement each other with respect to labeling.though the fda rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests,it neither discusses nor cites the lanham act and the government points to no other statement suggesting that the fda considered the full scope of interests protected by the lanham act.even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so,it is a bridge too far to accept an agency statement to justify that result here.an agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.

pom wonderful llc,petitioner v.the company 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
pom wonderful llc makes and sells pomegranate juice products,including a juice blend.app.one of pom competitors is the company.minute maid division makes a juice blend sold with a label that,in describing the contents,displays the words pomegranate blueberry with far more prominence than other words on the label that show the juice to be a blend of five juices.in truth,the product contains but pomegranate juice and blueberry juice.
alleging that the use of that label is deceptive and misleading,pom sued under of the lanham act.stat,as amended.that provision allows one competitor to sue another if it alleges unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that,in the realm of labeling for food and beverages,a lanham act claim like pom is precluded by a second federal statute.the second statute is the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,which forbids the misbranding of food,including by means of false or misleading labeling,stat,as amended.
the ruling that pom lanham act cause of action is precluded by the fdca was incorrect.there is no statutory text or established interpretive principle to support the contention that the fdca precludes lanham act suits like the one brought by pom in this case.nothing in the text,history,or structure of the fdca or the lanham act shows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these suits.quite to the contrary,the fdca and the lanham act complement each other in the federal regulation of misleading food and beverage labels.competitors,in their own interest,may bring lanham act claims like pom that challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated by the fdca.
this case concerns the intersection and of these two federal laws.a proper beginning point is a description of the statutes.
congress enacted the lanham act nearly seven decades ago.see stat.as the court explained earlier this term,it requires no guesswork to ascertain congress intent regarding this federal law,for congress included a detailed statement of the statute purposes.lexmark int l,static control components,slip,at.section of the lanham act provides 
the intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce within the control of congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by state,or territorial legislation to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition to prevent fraud and deception in such commerce by the use of reproductions,copies,counterfeits,or colorable imitations of registered marks and to provide rights and remedies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting trademarks,trade names,and unfair competition entered into between the united states and foreign nations.
the lanham act trademark provisions are the primary means of achieving these ends.but the act also creates a federal remedy that goes beyond trademark protection.dastar twentieth century fox film.the broader remedy is at issue here.
the lanham act creates a cause of action for unfair competition through misleading advertising or labeling.though in the end consumers also benefit from the act proper enforcement,the cause of action is for competitors,not consumers.
the term competitor is used in this opinion to indicate all those within the class of persons and entities protected by the lanham act.competitors are within the class that may invoke the lanham act because they may suffer an injury to a commercial interest in sales or business reputation proximately caused by a defendant misrepresentations.lexmark,supra,at slip,at.the petitioner here asserts injury as a competitor.
the cause of action the act creates imposes civil liability on any person who uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities.a.as the court held this term,the private remedy may be invoked only by those who allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.a consumer who is hoodwinked into purchasing a disappointing product may well have an cognizable under article iii,but he can not invoke the protection of the lanham act.lexmark,at slip,at.this principle reflects the lanham act purpose of protect ing persons engaged in commerce within the control of congress against unfair competition.at slip,at.pom cause of action would be straightforward enough but for contention that a separate federal statutory regime,the fdca,allows it to use the label in question and in fact precludes the lanham act claim.
so the fdca is the second statute to be discussed.the fdca statutory regime is designed primarily to protect the health and safety of the public at large.see cases of jam united states,fdca,stat,agency may issue certain regulations to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers the fdca prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.f.a food or drink is deemed misbranded if,inter alia,its labeling is false or misleading,a,information required to appear on its label is not prominently placed thereon,f,or a label does not bear the common or usual name of the food,if any there be,i.to implement these provisions,the food and drug administration fda promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling,including the labeling of mixes of different types of juice into one juice blend.see cfr.one provision of those regulations is particularly relevant to this case if a juice blend does not name all the juices it contains and mentions only juices that are not predominant in the blend,then it must either declare the percentage content of the named juice or i ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or flavoring,raspberry and cranberry flavored juice drink.d.the government represents that the fda does not preapprove juice labels under these regulations.see brief for united states as amicus curiae in opposition.that contrasts with the fda regulation of other types of labels,such as drug labels,see d,and is consistent with the less extensive role the fda plays in the regulation of food than in the regulation of drugs.
unlike the lanham act,which relies in substantial part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors,the fdca and its regulations provide the united states with nearly exclusive enforcement,including the authority to seek criminal sanctions in some circumstances.a.private parties may not bring enforcement suits.also unlike the lanham act,the fdca contains a provision certain state laws on misbranding.that provision,which congress added to the fdca in the nutrition labeling and education act of,stat,forecloses a state or political subdivision of a state from establishing requirements that are of the type but not identical to the requirements in some of the misbranding provisions of the fdca.a.it does not address,or refer to,other federal statutes or the preclusion thereof.
pom wonderful llc is a grower of pomegranates and a distributor of pomegranate juices.through its pom wonderful brand,pom produces,markets,and sells a variety of pomegranate products,including a juice blend.app.
pom competes in the juice market with the company,under its minute maid brand,created a juice blend containing apple and grape juices,pomegranate juice,blueberry juice,and raspberry juice,at brief for respondent.despite the minuscule amount of pomegranate and blueberry juices in the blend,the front label of the product displays the words pomegranate blueberry in all capital letters,on two separate lines.app.below those words,placed the phrase flavored blend of juices in much smaller type.ibid.and below that phrase,in still smaller type,were the words from concentrate with added ingredients and,with a line break before the final phrase and other natural flavors.ibid.the product front label also displays a vignette of blueberries,grapes,and raspberries in front of a halved pomegranate and a halved apple.ibid.
claiming that label tricks and deceives consumers,all to pom injury as a competitor,pom brought suit under the lanham act.pom alleged that the name,label,marketing,and advertising of juice blend mislead consumers into believing the product consists predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consists predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juices,at.that confusion,pom complained,causes it to lose sales,at.pom sought damages and injunctive relief,at.
the district court granted partial summary judgment to on pom lanham act claim,ruling that the fdca and its regulations preclude challenges to the name and label of juice blend.the district court reasoned that in the juice blend regulations the fda has directly spoken on the issues that form the basis of pom lanham act claim against the naming and labeling of product,but has not prohibited any,and indeed expressly has permitted some,aspects of label.supp,cd cal.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed in relevant part.like the district court,the court of appeals reasoned that congress decided to entrust matters of juice beverage labeling to the fda the fda has promulgated comprehensive regulation of that labeling and the fda apparently has not imposed the requirements on label that are sought by pom.u nder circuit precedent,the court of appeals explained,for a court to act when the fda has not despite regulating extensively in this area would risk undercutting the fda expert judgments and authority.at.for these reasons,and o ut of respect for the statutory and regulatory scheme,the court of appeals barred pom lanham act claim,at.
this court granted certiorari to consider whether a private party may bring a lanham act claim challenging a food label that is regulated by the fdca.the answer to that question is based on the following premises.
first,this is not a case.in cases,the question is whether state law is by a federal statute,or in some instances,a federal agency action.see wyeth levine.this case,however,concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute.so the balance does not frame the inquiry.because this is a preclusion case,any presumption against,at,has no force.in addition,the preclusion analysis is not governed by the court complex categorization of the types of.see crosby national foreign trade council.although the court precedent does not govern preclusion analysis in this case,its principles are instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws that bear on the same subject.
second,this is a statutory interpretation case and the court relies on traditional rules of statutory interpretation.that does not change because the case involves multiple federal statutes.see fda brown williamson tobacco.nor does it change because an agency is involved.see ibid.analysis of the statutory text,aided by established principles of interpretation,controls.see chickasaw nation united states.
a principle of interpretation is often countered,of course,by some maxim pointing in a different direction.circuit city stores,adams.it is thus unsurprising that in this case a threshold dispute has arisen as to which of two competing maxims establishes the proper framework for decision.pom argues that this case concerns whether one statute,the fdca as amended,is an implied repeal in part of statute,the lanham act.see,carcieri salazar.pom contends that in such cases courts must give full effect to both statutes unless they are in irreconcilable conflict,see,and that this high standard is not satisfied here.resists this canon and its high standard.argues that the case concerns whether a more specific law,the fdca,clarifies or narrows the scope of a more general law,the lanham act.see,united states fausto,brief for respondent.the court task,it claims,is to reconcil e the laws,and it says the best reconciliation is that the more specific provisions of the fdca bar certain causes of action authorized in a general manner by the lanham act.
the court does not need to resolve this dispute.even assuming that is correct that the court task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes and not,as pom urges,to enforce both statutes in full unless there is a genuinely irreconcilable conflict,is incorrect that the best way to harmonize the statutes is to bar pom lanham act claim.
beginning with the text of the two statutes,it must be observed that neither the lanham act nor the fdca,in express terms,forbids or limits lanham act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the fdca.by its terms,the lanham act subjects to suit any person who misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of goods or services.a.this comprehensive imposition of liability extends,by its own terms,to misrepresentations on labels,including food and beverage labels.no other provision in the lanham act limits that understanding or purports to govern the relevant interaction between the lanham act and the fdca.and the fdca,by its terms,does not preclude lanham act suits.in consequence,food and beverage labels regulated by the fdca are not,under the terms of either statute,off limits to lanham act claims.no textual provision in either statute discloses a purpose to bar unfair competition claims like pom.
this absence is of special significance because the lanham act and the fdca have coexisted since the passage of the lanham act in.stat.ch,stat.if congress had concluded,in light of experience,that lanham act suits could interfere with the fdca,it might well have enacted a provision addressing the issue during these years.see wyeth,supra,at if congress thought suits posed an obstacle to its objectives,it surely would have enacted an express provision at some point during the fdca history congress enacted amendments to the fdca and the lanham act,see,nutrition labeling and education act of,stat.trademark law revision act of,stat,including an amendment that added to the fdca an express provision with respect to state laws addressing food and beverage misbranding,stat.yet congress did not enact a provision addressing the preclusion of other federal laws that might bear on food and beverage labeling.this is powerful evidence that congress did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling.see wyeth,at.
perhaps the closest the statutes come to addressing the preclusion of the lanham act claim at issue here is the provision added to the fdca in as part of the nutrition labeling and education act.see.but,far from expressly precluding suits arising under other federal laws,the provision if anything suggests that lanham act suits are not precluded.
this provision forbids a state or political subdivision of a state from imposing requirements that are of the type but not identical to corresponding fdca requirements for food and beverage labeling.ibid.it is significant that the complex provision distinguishes among different fdca requirements.it forbids requirements that are of the type but not identical to only certain fdca provisions with respect to food and beverage labeling.see a citing some but not all of the subsections of,stat.codified at,and note following.just as significant,the provision does not refer to requirements imposed by other sources of law,such as federal statutes.for purposes of deciding whether the fdca displaces a regulatory or liability scheme in another statute,it makes a substantial difference whether that other statute is state or federal.by taking care to mandate express of some state laws,congress if anything indicated it did not intend the fdca to preclude requirements arising from other sources.see setser united states,slip,at applying principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.of some state requirements does not suggest an intent to preclude federal claims.
the structures of the fdca and the lanham act reinforce the conclusion drawn from the text.when two statutes complement each other,it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that congress nonetheless intended one federal statute to preclude the operation of the other.see ag supply,pioneer int l,w e can plainly regard each statute as effective because of its different requirements and protections see also wyeth,supra,at.the lanham act and the fdca complement each other in major respects,for each has its own scope and purpose.although both statutes touch on food and beverage labeling,the lanham act protects commercial interests against unfair competition,while the fdca protects public health and safety.compare lexmark,at slip,at,with cases of jam,at.the two statutes impose different requirements and protections.ag supply,supra,at.
the two statutes complement each other with respect to remedies in a more fundamental respect.enforcement of the fdca and the detailed prescriptions of its implementing regulations is largely committed to the fda.the fda,however,does not have the same perspective or expertise in assessing market dynamics that co
