plaintiff appellant brendan cunney appeals from the december,order and the january,amended judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york young,dismissing his complaint against the board of trustees of the village of grand view on hudson the board,the zoning board of appeals for the village the zba,and joseph knizeski,in his capacity as the village building inspector collectively,the village defendants.cunney brought this action against the village defendants alleging a violation of his constitutional rights as a result of the zba denial of his application for a certificate of occupancy co for his home.specifically,cunney asserted that village zoning law,chapter ix,section e section e or the ordinance is void for vagueness and that the village defendants violated his substantive due process rights by denying him a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the village defendants on both claims.cunney bd.of trs.of vill.of grand view,ny,d.the court concluded that cunney vagueness claim failed because a reasonable person could discern that section e prohibited the building of structures that rise more than four and feet above the easterly side of river road.id.at.despite the district court subsequent determination that section e encouraged arbitrary or ad hoc enforcement,it nonetheless found the ordinance constitutional because its application to cunney property coalesced with the ordinance core preserve the remaining views of the hudson river from river road.id.at.the court also determined that cunney substantive due process claim failed because cunney did not possess a legitimate claim of entitlement to a.id.at.
we hold that section e of the village zoning law is unconstitutionally vague as applied to cunney property because it provides inadequate notice of the elevation point on river road from which cunney should measure the height of his house to determine compliance,and because it authorizes arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.furthermore,we hold that the ordinance constitutionality is not otherwise saved by its core meaning because a reasonable enforcement officer could find that the height of cunney house is in compliance with section e restrictions.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the village defendants on cunney claim,and direct the court to enter summary judgment in favor of cunney on this claim.in addition,we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of the village defendants on cunney substantive due process claim,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the following facts are undisputed.cunney owns one half acre of property that lies adjacent to the tappan zee bridge within the village of grand view on hudson in rockland county.the property is bounded by the hudson river to the east and river road to the west,and slopes downward from the road to a flat area where the home in question has been constructed.the elevation of river road varies along its foot shared boundary with the cunney the southern end of the property the elevation is approximately feet above the hudson river,while at the northern end it is approximately feet above the river.
section e of the zoning law sets out the relevant height requirements for certain residential homes in the village 
it being the purpose of this section,among others,to preserve as nearly as 
practicable the remaining views o f the hudson river from river road,no building shall be erected in zone b r which shall rise more than two stories in height nor more than four and feet above the easterly side of river road.where the lot lies substantially at the same level as river road,no building or construction shall rise more than one story or fifteen feet in height.
the village defines easterly side of river road as the point at which the road surface of river road intersects with the easterly curb adjacent to river road.zone b r,where cunney property is located,comprises the area between river road and the mean high water mark of the hudson river running to the village limits.
a.the zba decision 
in,cunney desired to improve his property and applied to the village for the requisite permits.given the house proposed height and floor area ratio,cunney initial site development plan for the construction of a single family residence required variances from the village zoning law.because cunney property is located within zone b r,cunney proposed development triggered section e limiting the highest point of his house to an elevation that is no more than four and feet above the easterly side of river road.a hearing was held before the zba on april,to consider cunney variance requests.
at the hearing,john atzl,cunney surveyor,stated that section e is ambiguous with respect to the elevation point on river road adjacent to the property from which the height of the house should be measured.specifically,he questioned whether the terms of section e required measurement from the road highest or lowest grade.atzl reported that,given the ambiguity,he measured the house highest roof elevation from the middle of the cunney lot adjacent to the east edge of river road.in response,the zba acknowledged that the primary issue concerning the house compliance with section e was from which point on river road should the height of the house be measured.in fact,even the village attorney agreed that section e was ambiguous and that the zba should clarify its terms.
notwithstanding the apparent consensus that section e was vague and required clarification,the zba declined to interpret it.having apparently determined that cunney proposal would require a height variance regardless of where on river road the house height measurement was taken,the zba denied the variance requests finding them substantial,and noted that feasible alternatives existed.
despite the zba refusal to act as a body to interpret section e,three of the five members of the zba nonetheless offered on the record their own interpretations of the proper elevation point on river road from which the height of a house should be measured in determining its compliance with section zba member tom wolzien suggested that any given point above river road can be used as the elevation point from which to measure the height of the house,while zba member david kaliff stated that the ordinance was written to protect the views of the community along river road and thus required the house height to be measured at the lowest point of the road.zba chairperson maria chamberlin hellman opined that the code should be interpreted to require measurement from the lowest point along river road to the highest point of the house so that the maximum variance would be needed.in light of the zba denial of his variance requests and the three members differing interpretations of section e,cunney was forced back to the drawing board to revise his site plan and to speculate how the zba would,in a future proceeding,enforce the height restriction against him.
b.the village approves construction of cunney house 
in september,the village planning board conditionally approved cunney revised site plan.due to the lingering confusion stemming from the zba hearings,this plan included road elevation levels and house height measurements from five different stations,and located in the northern half of cunney lot.at each station on the plan,atzl indicated both the road elevation at a precise point as well as the height of the house at a corresponding point on the roof line from the road.relying upon the difference between height of the house and elevation of the road at these five stations,atzl concluded that the proposed project was in compliance with section 
in measuring the elevation points on river road,atzl used data from both a rockland county topographical map as well as from a field survey his office had completed.he conducted the field survey because he was aware that there frequently were inaccuracies contained in county maps.in drafting the site plan,however,atzl did not substitute his field survey road elevation levels for the county map elevation levels.the site plan cunney submitted to the village thus reflected only the road elevation levels as found on the county map.
in october,joseph knizeski,the village building inspector,issued cunney a building permit.in january,knizeski requested a letter from atzl certifying that the height of cunney house complied with section e restrictions.in response,atzl performed an under construction survey of cunney house and lot.he concluded that the house complied with section e because the highest part of the roof line will not rise more than feet above the easterly side of river road.
some months later stephen collazuol,the village engineer,performed measurements at the site and wrote in a july letter to the village that o ur results determine that the roof ridge of the new dwelling is above the high point of pavement on the easterly side of river road.therefore,the ridge of the building is greater than allowed.collazuol included a drawing with his letter showing that he relied on a single point of reference on river road the high point of pavement from which he measured the height of the house.this reference point did not correspond with any of the five measuring stations atzl relied on in drafting the site plan for the approved construction.
c.the village denies cunney certificate of occupancy application 
following the completion of his house in august,cunney applied to the village for a certificate of occupancy co.knizeski,however,did not process cunney application at that time.rather,in response to complaints from village residents about the height of the house,the village requested that collazuol complete an independent review of the cunney property.in october collazuol wrote,based on the results of his final survey,that the heights of the completed house were somewhat consistent with the site plan except at station.furthermore,he concluded that the elevations of the road surface are inconsistent with the site plan and are lower than previously indicated.despite this finding,collazuol determined that the house was constructed substantially in accordance with the plans because it was no greater in height than as proposed.he noted that the diminimous sic difference in roof height should be neglected as this falls within typical building tolerances,or inches.
the village found collazuol letter perplexing.because collazuol had determined that road elevation levels were lower than previously thought,the village wanted him to explain his results by indicating whether he had conducted a physical survey of the property.a meeting was held on december,to further explore this apparent discrepancy in road elevation levels.at that meeting,atzl informed the parties that he had erroneously relied upon inaccurate county topographical data in drafting the site plan.
less than a week after the meeting,collazuol sent the village a letter and chart indicating the corrected road elevation levels for the five measurement stations included on the site plan that cunney had submitted to the village.although at three of these stations cunney house was in compliance with section e,at station the high point of the house roof line was feet above that corresponding elevation point on river road.at that point,which of all stations yielded the maximum difference between the height of the house and the elevation of river road,the house exceeded section e height restriction by feet.even though collazuol knew the village would deny cunney co application based on his measurements at station,he noted in his letter that the road elevation at the south property line is feet.when measured from this point on river road,he stated,the height of cunney house exceeded section e restrictions by only three inches.
thereafter,on december,knizeski denied cunney co application.in doing so,he relied solely on collazuol third and final compliance determination which stated that at station cunney roof height was greater than allowed.cunney appealed this decision to the zba.
d.the zba decision 
on appeal,cunney requested that the zba interpret the definition of height in section e to clarify the point on river road from which he was to measure the height of the house in determining if it complied with section e requirements.more specifically,he requested the zba to construe section e in his favor by allowing him to measure the height of his house from the southernmost point of his property where the road elevation peaks at approximately feet.under that interpretation,cunney submitted that his house was in fact in compliance with the ordinance.as an alternative,he asked the zba to grant him a height variance.following hearings in february and april,the zba determined that section e was not ambiguous and that cunney was not caused by a misinterpretation of the village zoning law but instead was due to atzl error in measuring road elevation.specifically,the zba determined 
the zoning law is not ambiguous with respect to the manner in which building height is measured in the r zoning district for the reasons that the definition of height in the zoning law states that buildings are measured vertically and,when read together with the definition of easterly side of river road clearly requires that to determine whether a building height exceeds feet above river road,the measurement is taken from the point at which the road surface intersects with the curb vertically to the highest point of the roof.the word vertical in webster new world dictionary is defined as perpendicular,or at a right angle,upright,straight up or down.
after concluding that section e was not ambiguous and that cunney house exceeded its restrictions,the zba considered cunney variance request.the zba granted him a conditional variance requiring him to remove the pool house from its present location prior to the issuance of the co ensure an open and unobstructed view for the entire northerly side yard plus an area running in a diagonal line from the northeasterly corner of the residence through the northeasterly corner of the existing pool and not build any structure at any time in the open and unobstructed view area described in condition.the zba concluded that although the variance was substantial,because the imposed conditions mitigated the negative impact cunney house had on the surrounding views of the river valley,the variance benefits to cunney outweighed the detriment to the community.
e.the district court decision 
cunney filed a complaint in new york state supreme court,rockland county,asserting that section e of the village zoning law was void for vagueness both as applied to his property and on its face,and that the village defendants violated his substantive due process rights by denying his application for a.additionally,cunney brought a negligence claim against atzl,individually,as well as against his engineering firm,atzl,scatassa zigler land surveyors.the village defendants removed the entire action to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.both cunney and the village defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment.
in a december,memorandum and order,the district court granted the village defendants motion for summary judgment on the and substantive due process claims.regarding the vagueness claim,the court first concluded that section e describes,and a person of reasonable intelligence could discern,what activities are prohibited building structures over two stories tall or four and feet above the easterly side of river road.cunney,d at.addressing whether section e authorized arbitrary enforcement and,if so,whether cunney height violation went to the core of the regulation,the district court reasoned as follows because section e does not mandate a particular point of reference on river road from which to measure a house height,the ordinance could authorize potentially arbitrary or ad hoc enforcement.id.at.however,cunney challenge failed because his property lay within the space subject of section e core goal of preserving the remaining views of the hudson river from river road.id.at.as a consequence of this holding,the district court also determined that cunney facial attack failed because cunney could not establish that the ordinance was impermissibly vague in all of its applications.id.at.

the district court entered an amended judgment on january,dismissing the complaint against the village defendants this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,cunney contends that section e is void for vagueness as applied because it does not provide adequate guidance as to the elevation point on river road adjacent to his property from which he should measure the height of his house.to the same end he also argues that because section e is vague,the village defendants are free to pick and choose measurement points along the road that best fit within their compliance decisions.he asserts that in light of this ambiguity in the ordinance and the arbitrary action by the village defendants,the district court erred in characterizing his violation as one barred by the core meaning of section e and that his claim that he was subjected to arbitrary enforcement is not defeated by whatever guidance,if any,may be found in the ordinance core meaning 
additionally,cunney contends that the district court erred in dismissing his substantive due process claim because,in reliance on his receiving a building permit and the village repeated approval of the construction of his house,cunney incurred substantial expenses while improving his property and thus acquired a vested right in a.cunney argues that the village defendants post hoc interpretation of section e to justify the denial of his co constitutes a clear violation of his substantive due process rights.
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo.costello city of burlington,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we agree that,as applied to cunney,section e is unconstitutionally vague,and we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the village defendants on this claim.because the district court grounded its substantive due process analysis in its decision upholding the constitutionality of section e,we also vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of the village defendants on cunney substantive due process claim.
vagueness challenge to village zoning law section e 
the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution provides that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.among the most fundamental protections of due process is the principle that n o one may be required at peril of life,liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of statutes.all are entitled to be informed as to what the state commands or forbids.cramp bd.of pub.instruction,quoting lanzetta new jersey.
supreme court precedent recognizes two independent grounds upon which a statute language may be so vague as to deny due process of law.first,a law violates due process if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits.hill colorado,u.animating this first vagueness ground is the constitutional principle that individuals should receive fair notice or warning when the state has prohibited specific behavior or acts.thibodeau portuondo,cir smith goguen,the doctrine incorporates notions of fair notice or warning.second,a law is unconstitutionally vague if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill,at.statutes must provide explicit standards for those who apply them to avoid resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.grayned city of rockford.in reviewing the ordinance language for vagueness,we are relegated to the words of the ordinance itself,to the interpretations the court below has given to analogous statutes,and,perhaps to some degree,to the interpretation of the statute given by those charged with enforcing it.id.at internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted.
the relevant inquiry under the first vagueness ground is whether the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.rubin garvin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.condemned to the use of words,we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.grayned,at.rather,regulations may embody flexibility and reasonable depth,id.internal quotation marks omitted,and satisfy due process as long as a reasonably prudent person,familiar with the conditions the regulations are meant to address and the objectives the regulations are meant to achieve,has fair warning of what the regulations require,rock of ages sec y of labor,cir.
section e plain language prohibits the building of structures over two stories tall or four and feet above the easterly side of river road.additionally,section e states that its purpose is to regulate building height in order to preserve views of the hudson river.while section e affords a reasonable person adequate notice of what it generally prohibits,buildings will be in violation,it is remarkably unclear with respect to how the four and a half foot limitation is defined.in this latter regard,nowhere does the ordinance describe from what adjacent elevation point on river road the height of a building must be measured to determine the building compliance with section e height restriction.consequently,this shortcoming not only fails to give specific notice of how a permit applicant should design his site plan so that the proposed building complies with that restriction,but it also fails to provide an objective standard that the village itself can apply in determining the project compliance once an application has been submitted and thereafter when an approved project has been built.
enforcement standards 
the second ground for determining unconstitutional vagueness whether the ordinance fails to provide explicit standards for those who apply it,thibodeau,at internal quotation marks omitted involves an inquiry into whether the the ordinance as a general matter provides sufficiently clear standards to eliminate the risk of arbitrary enforcement or even in the absence of such standards,the conduct at issue falls within the core of the ordinance prohibition,so that the enforcement before the court was not the result of the unfettered latitude that law enforcement officers and factfinders might have in other,hypothetical applications of the ordinance.farrell burke,cir.we hold that because section e makes no mention of where on river road elevation is to be measured,the ordinance provides no standard that can be objectively applied to determine if the conduct at issue in this case the construction of cunney house complies with the ordinance restrictions.
although section e has a stated purpose of preserving the remaining views of the hudson river from river road,that alone does not provide sufficient guidance to otherwise save the ordinance from the risk of arbitrary enforcement.united states williams,what renders a statute vague is not the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine whether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved but rather the indeterminancy of precisely what that fact is.thus,we have struck down statutes that tied criminal culpability to whether the defendant conduct was annoying or indecent wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions,narrowing context,or settled legal meanings.
as we have noted,i n addition to an ordinance plain meaning and stated purpose,courts should determine whether the ordinan
