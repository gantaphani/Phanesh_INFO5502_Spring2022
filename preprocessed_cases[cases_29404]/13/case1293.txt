background 
the bpa.the bpa is a entity created in,pursuant to a state statute that authorizes bridgeport to establish a port authority,see,and the city of bridgeport municipal code.the municipal code gives broad definition to the bpa purposes,which include to foster and stimulate the shipment of freight and commerce through the ports,to develop and promote port facilities with the district in order to create jobs,increase the city tax base and provide special revenues to the city,and to work with the city to maximize the usefulness of available public funding.the bpa independent auditors report also describes the bpa purposes broadly,including to develop strategies and initiatives to promote and create port facilities within the district,and participate in the economic development of the harbor and waterfront areas.
the bpa has jurisdiction over a geographic area known as the port district.the port district extends approximately feet inland from the waterways of bridgeport harbor,black rock harbor,and their navigable waters and tributaries,excluding residential property and park lands.the bpa also has jurisdiction over certain lands outside the limit.located within the port district are the water street dock the dock,the cilco shipping terminal,the steel point peninsula,and the bridgeport regional maritime complex brmc,which includes the derecktor shipyard.
the bpa is directed by a board of commissioners,three of whom are appointed by the mayor of bridgeport and two of whom serve by virtue of their positions as the city director of economic development and harbor master.the bpa is managed by an executive director and staff.
when the bpa was created in,the city of bridgeport transferred control over the dock to the bpa under a property management agreement.the dock facilities were in very poor condition prior to the bpa existence.the harbor master at the time described them as deplorable t he dock was just a mishmash of steel plates over various holes,rotted timbers at night,the place was just a haven for people breaking into cars,prostitution.at that time,the terminal consisted of a concrete block building that housed two poorly maintained restrooms and a small office.there were no food facilities or other concessions and no waiting areas for passengers.
with government grant money,the bpa built a new ferry terminal,which was completed in.the district court found that the new terminal building was a dramatic improvement from the preexisting structure.it had two floors the ground floor had a public waiting area,restrooms,information counter,cafeteria,and small office the second floor,which was not open to the public,housed the bpa and the offices of the connecticut world trade association,a reception area,conference room,and several other offices.
since its inception,the bpa has obtained government grants to fund many other development projects in the port district that have contributed to the revitalization of the area.
passenger plaintiffs.rose and zahradka were recruited to be plaintiffs in this case by the ferry company and general manager frederick hall the ferry company paid the legal fees and expenses for both individuals.
the ferry company.the ferry company is a privately owned company that has been providing vehicle and passenger ferry service between bridgeport and port jefferson since.its president,brian mcallister,has owned a percent interest in the ferry company since.currently,the ferry company owns and operates three ferry boats.in,the ferry company transported approximately vehicles and one million passengers.
on the port jefferson side,the ferry company owns most of the dock and terminal facilities and provides all services.neither the ferry company nor its passengers pay a user fee to any government agency in port jefferson.
on the bridgeport side,however,the ferry company does not own the dock or terminal facilities.until,the ferry company leased the use of the dock from the city of bridgeport.when the city transferred control of the dock to the bpa,the ferry company entered a lease to rent the dock from the bpa at an annual rate,which was for the first year and increases to through.
the lease agreement entitles the ferry company to preferential use of the dock.the bpa reserved for itself all other uses of the dock and the premises,except for the following operation of the food concession,which was the subject of another agreement between the parties use of office and waiting room space in the terminal building that the bpa may from make available and use of a few parking spaces for ferry company employees.
before and after the creation of the bpa,the ferry company has been responsible for running daily ferry operations at the dock.the ferry company employs a dock manager and a staff of to to handle all docking and undocking of ferries,staging of vehicles on the roadway to board,directing passengers and vehicles on and off the ferries,shuttling passengers to and from the parking lots,and removing snow on the dock.ferry company employees also perform security functions at the dock.
the passenger fee.since its inception in,the bpa has imposed a passenger fee on all persons and vehicles embarking on,or disembarking from,the ferry company ferries at the dock.the amount of the fee varies depending on whether the passenger is a person,a car,a truck,or a bus.in,the fee for an adult foot passenger was cents and for a vehicle.in,the fee for an adult foot passenger was and for a vehicle including a driver.in february,the bpa began assessing a surcharge to cover the bpa fees and costs in this litigation.
the fee is a relatively a small portion of the total ferry ticket price.for example,in,a ferry ticket for a vehicle with unlimited passengers was,while the corresponding passenger fee was.the fee is added to the ticket price and collected by the ferry company on behalf of the bpa at the time passengers purchase their ferry tickets on board for this service,the bpa pays the ferry company an administrative fee,which was per year until may when it was increased to.after retaining its administrative fees,the ferry company remits the proceeds of the passenger fee to the bpa on a monthly basis,along with a written report of the number of tickets sold and the amounts collected from each type of passenger.
the bpa revenue and expenses.from to,the bpa collected a total of approximately million in passenger fees and more than million in rental revenues from the lease agreements with the ferry company and its food concession subsidiary.the passenger fee and ferry leases are almost the sole source of operating revenue for the bpa.until,the passenger fee and lease revenue exceeded the total operating expenses of the bpa.as the district court noted,t he total amount of passenger fees collected alone from to correlates very closely with the port authority total operating expenses during the same period.the bpa executive director admitted that the bpa has used the revenue from the passenger fee and the dock lease to pay for essentially all of its operating expenses,including all salaries,health benefits,pension payments,payroll taxes,telephone,utilities,office equipment,travel,charitable contributions,and automobile and lease expenses.
the district court decision.the district court,relying on the supreme court dormant commerce clause jurisprudence,see united haulers ass n,solid waste management authority,d,endeavored to apply the test the supreme court has set forth for determining the constitutionality of fees imposed by governmental entities to defray the costs of facilities used by those engaged in interstate commerce.the test was first announced in airport authority district delta airlines,d,involving an airport user fee imposed on commercial airlines.the supreme court stated that 
a charge designed only to make the user of facilities pay a reasonable fee to help defray the costs of their construction and maintenance may constitutionally be imposed so long as the toll is based on some fair approximation of use or privilege for use and is neither discriminatory against interstate commerce nor excessive in comparison with the governmental benefit conferred.
in northwest airlines,county of kent,d,the supreme court reformulated its evansville standard into a test.a levy is reasonable under evansville if it is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities,is not excessive in relation to the benefits conferred,and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.id.at.
in the pending case,the district court ruled that the third criterion was satisfied because the passenger fee did not distinguish between intrastate and interstate travel.however,the court ruled that the fee did not meet either the first or second evansville criteria.
the court stated that the fee was not based on a fair approximation of the ferry passengers use of the port facilities because it was calculated according to a method which ensures the passenger fee revenue will cover all of the port authority operating costs and development projects throughout the port district,and many of the port district activities funded by the fee are not even available to the ferry passengers such as derecktor,brmc,harbor dredging,the barge feeder service,and the foreign trade zone.
the court also ruled that the passenger fee is excessive in comparison with the government benefit conferred and in relation to the costs incurred by the taxing authority.distinguishing the airport user fee upheld in evansville,the court stated that the vast majority of airport development is intended to benefit the passengers traveling on airplanes leaving the airport,or to facilitate their air travel the port district,however,includes many projects beyond the dock that are not functionally related to the ferry operation,and are not intended to benefit the travelers on ferries,or to facilitate their boat travel from connecticut to long island.
to determine whether the revenue from the passenger fee was unreasonably high compared to the benefits that the bpa provided to the ferry passengers,the district court examined separately each activity of the bpa.the court concluded that the following bpa activities benefitted ferry passengers construction and maintenance of a new ferry terminal building,repair of the bulkhead of the dock,construction of the access road,planning of the parking facility for ferry passengers,security for the dock,and daily operations related to the ferry.
on the other hand,the court found that the following activities did not benefit ferry passengers development projects on steel point peninsula development projects on the brmc and the leasing of a portion of the brmc to derecktor shipyards establishing a ferry from bridgeport to stamford and new york city developing a service that would ship containers by barge from the port of new york and new jersey to bridgeport operating a foreign trade zone in bridgeport activities at the cilco commercial shipping terminal located on land near the brmc dredging the bridgeport harbor operating a complimentary service for pleasure boats bpa review of other projects within the port district and some miscellaneous activities,including payment of attorneys to register a new trademark for the bpa and purchasing season tickets to local minor league teams.
having made this analysis of the bpa expenditures,the court determined that the passenger fee revenue collected by the bpa substantially exceeded the amount of money spent by the bpa for those activities that benefitted the ferry passengers.that determination led the court to conclude that the fee violated the commerce clause and the constitutional right to travel,which the parties agreed was subject to the same standards applicable to the commerce clause.
the court also concluded that the excessive nature of the fee,in relation to benefits conferred,rendered the fee in violation of the tonnage clause,which provides that n o state shall lay any duty of tonnage.const.art.i,cl.the court noted that the supreme court in clyde mallory lines alabama,held that the prohibition on all charge s for the privilege of entering,trading in,or lying in a port did not extend to charges for services rendered to and enjoyed by the vessel.the district court concluded that the passenger fee violated the tonnage clause of the constitution because it was used for the impermissible purpose of raising general revenues and for projects which do not and could not benefit the ferry passengers.the passenger fee revenue fund ed projects completely unrelated and unavailable to the fee payers,such as negotiations,legal fees,and development proposals for the brmc,derecktor,the foreign trade zone,the barge feeder service,harbor dredging,and the ferry.as such,it was an impermissible fee of tonnage 
turning to the appropriate remedy,the district court first determined that,although the ferry company could have suffered an economic loss quantifiable in damages,the ferry company had failed to provide any evidence of its damages.the court then found that the passenger plaintiff d d was entitled to,based on the extent to which the passenger fee revenue was excessive compared to the benefits to ferry passengers.finally,the court ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction prohibiting the bpa from collecting a passenger fee in an amount that exceeded what was necessary to pay for benefits to the ferry passengers.
discussion 
initially,we consider the bpa contention that the ferry company lacks standing because it failed to show.incorrectly assuming that requires quantifiable damages,the bpa argues that because the district court did not award the ferry company any compensatory damages,it suffered no injury.but as this court explained in ross bank of america,cir,lack of compensatory damages does not negate standing.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as the ferry company argued,it sustained injuries in the following respects 
the added cost to its passengers reduces both demand for ferry services and the ferry company revenue.although the district court found that the ferry company failed to present sufficient evidence to establish quantifiable damages,the court noted that i t is undisputed that the price elasticity for the ferry service is greater than zero but less than one,indicating on a theoretical level that a change in price at a given point in time would lead to slightly decreased demand.
the fee requirement obliges the ferry company,as a practical matter,to collect the passenger fee and remit the proceeds to the bpa.
the ferry company adequately pleaded that its individual rights under the commerce clause are being violated.see dennis higgins,d noting that the commerce clause creates an individual right see also boston stock exchange state tax commission,d.
the ferry company adequately alleged that it is exposed to future injury,which would entitle it to injunctive relief.
the ferry company also satisfies the requirements of prudential standing because a it sustained its own injury and thus asserts its own rights,not those of the passengers,b it does not assert a general grievance,in view of its special relationship with its customers,and c it operates an interstate ferry service and thus falls within the zone of interest protected by the commerce clause.
the bpa challenge to the ferry company standing is without merit.
