william brody appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,district judge granting summary judgment for the village of port chester the village on plaintiff constitutional challenge to new york eminent domain procedure law.see em.dom.proc.law,et.consol hereinafter edpl.brody claims that the procedures used by the village in condemning his commercial property for use in an urban redevelopment project denied him due process by failing to provide adequate notice about the timing or the significance of the public hearing,which was his sole opportunity to present arguments against the taking of his property.additionally,brody claims a failure of due process in the lack of individual notice that the village had issued a determination and findings,and thereby had triggered,under article of the edpl,an exclusive,period in which a property holder may appeal the decision to take his or her property.see minnich gargano,civ hb,wl.because brody was not aware of the issuance of the determination and findings,he argues that he was denied due process of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment as he was effectively denied access to his opportunity for judicial review of the condemnation decision.his property has since been condemned,the village has formally taken title pursuant to article of the edpl,and the property has been sold to the village of port chester industrial development agency village ida,which has begun to demolish what brody asserts are his buildings.
the district court held that brody claims were barred by res judicata based on its conclusion that he could have asserted them as counterclaims in the article proceeding by the village to take title to his property.on appeal,brody argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on res judicata grounds because edpl allows such claims to be brought only in article proceedings and,therefore,these constitutional challenges could not have been asserted as counterclaims to the village article proceeding.the village,in turn,has moved to dismiss the appeal,arguing as a threshold matter that brody lacks standing to pursue his constitutional challenges.further,the village argues that brody claims are moot because he relinquished his claim to title by accepting an advance payment for the taking of his property,and because the property has since been sold to the village ida,which is not a party to this action,and demolition has begun.
we hold that brody has standing to challenge the lack of individual notice about the publication of the determination and findings and that the failure to raise this constitutional challenge as a counterclaim in response to the village article proceeding can not have res judicata effect because,as a matter of new york law,brody could not have asserted his constitutional challenges in that proceeding.we also hold that brody claims are not moot.we therefore vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
i.the condemnation proceedings 
plaintiff william brody is a commercial property owner in the village of port chester,new york,who acquired the property at issue in this litigation in.as the site was part of a urban development project,the village and project developers later approached brody about purchasing his property.brody refused to sell.
unwilling to take no for an answer,the village sought to condemn the land under the procedures set out in the edpl.consistent with that statute,the village held a public hearing on june,to review the intended public use to be served by the proposed redevelopment.notice of the hearing was published pursuant to edpl a,which requires the condemnor to publish notice of the hearing in newspapers a certain number of days before the hearing,but does not require individual notice to the affected property holders.another tenant alerted brody to the meeting,which brody then attended in order to request that his property not be condemned.brody was allowed four minutes to speak,but also was offered additional time to speak at the end of the hearing.subsequent to the meeting,the village issued and published a formal determination and findings.brody was never given individual notice of either the determination or its publication,as none is required under new york law.consequently,brody claims to have been unaware that the determination and findings were published or that he would have only thirty days after the publication of the determination and findings to challenge them in court.according to brody,after the june hearing,he waited to see what the village would decide to do.although he always intended to fight them if they tried to take his building,brody hoped they would realize that he done a lot of good for port chester and decide not to.
shortly after this initial june hearing,the village discovered that the notice it had published advising the public about the initial hearing had not met all the requirements of the edpl.the village then published notice of a second public use hearing,which was held on july.it is undisputed that the second notice complied with edpl a.brody claims to have received no actual notice of the second hearing,and,consequently,he did not attend.
on july and,the village published a summary of its determination and findings in the local newspaper,as required by edpl,stating that the redevelopment project would serve to rehabilitate certain blighted,substandard and unsanitary areas of the village,as well as enhance public access to the waterfront,protect and encourage uses,promote the development of mixed use and retail commercial uses on the waterfront,remediate environmental problems,and have a positive impact on the existing and continued development of the village waterfront and downtown business areas.under the edpl,this publication triggered the running of an exclusive period in which to appeal the determination to the appellate division.see edpl.there is no requirement in the edpl,however,that the affected property owner be given individual notice of the determination and findings or their publication.see edpl a.
brody claims to have been unaware that the determination and findings were published on july and,or that he had a limited right to appeal within thirty days of the publication.see edpl.according to brody,this explains his failure to seek judicial review in an article proceeding under edpl.brody claims that had he known the findings were published and the legal significance of that publication,he would have challenged the taking of his property within the thirty day window.
on april,the village commenced court proceedings to take title to brody property under article of the edpl.see edpl.on may,brody responded to the article petition and filed,through counsel,a verified answer,which set forth three affirmative defenses the village violated the united states and the new york constitutions,as well as the edpl,when it attempted to take his property without making an offer to compensate him the developer had not negotiated with him in good faith and the village failed to ensure that adequate sums were in place to pay any condemnation award.the court ultimately granted the village petition to take title in october,on the condition that the village make brody an offer for compensation within sixty days as required by article of the edpl.
ii.the federal court proceedings 
on october,brody filed the instant federal action,alleging that the edpl violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,both facially and as applied to him.specifically,brody alleged that due process required the village to provide those persons whose property was subject to condemnation with individual notice of the public use hearing,the village subsequent issuance of the determination and findings,and the time limit on judicial challenges to the determination and findings.
the district court initially granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the village from taking further steps in the condemnation process.minnich gargano,civ.hb,wl.the village took an interlocutory appeal of the injunction and,on august,while the for summary judgment that are the subject of the present appeal were pending before the district court,a panel of this court vacated the preliminary injunction,holding that brody lacked standing to pursue his due process claims and that the district court had failed to balance the public interest against brody personal interests in enjoining the condemnation proceedings.brody village of port chester,cir brody i.the preliminary injunction was vacated and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with that opinion.id.at.
on september,the district court ruled that brody had remedied the lack of standing but went on to grant summary judgment in favor of the village,holding that brody claims were barred by res judicata because they could have been asserted as counterclaims in the action brought by the village under edpl.minnich,wl,at.
iii.events occurring after the lifting of the injunction 
after the preliminary injunction was vacated on appeal,the village went forward with the condemnation proceedings and,on august,acquired title to brody property pursuant to the edpl.on september,the village conveyed brody property and several other parcels to the developer,g s port chester llc g s.g s then conveyed the property to the village ida.in december,hudson united bank was granted in excess of million in mortgage liens over the entire development parcel,which includes brody property.
in may,brody and the village entered into an agreement under article of the edpl whereby brody received an advance payment of million as compensation for his property the advance payment agreement the legal significance of this agreement is tangentially at issue in this appeal.brody subsequently filed a claim for damages against the village on july,seeking million plus interest for the fair market value of the property.see edpl providing that the state supreme court is to determine the compensation due to a condemnee for damages as a result of the acquisition 
in august,brody last remaining tenant was evicted from the property.work has begun on the project and several of the buildings have been demolished.we denied brody motion for stay of further demolition pending appeal because brody failed to demonstrate irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits of his public purpose challenge.see order,cir.
discussion 
introduction 
the village preliminarily urges us to dismiss brody appeal on the grounds that events that have occurred since the entry of judgment now render the appeal moot.specifically,the village argues that by entering into an agreement to accept the advance payment,brody effectively has relinquished any right to dispute the village title to the property.it further argues that no relief is available to brody because the property has been sold,and the current title village not a party to the appeal.in response,brody contends that acceptance of the advance payment in no way compromises his ability to pursue his constitutional challenges to the edpl,and that he can still seek return of his property because the village ida is in privity with the village.
although the village arguments are presented as a motion to dismiss the appeal,we nonetheless begin with the merits of the appeal because the absence of a purportedly necessary party is not jurisdictional,and we would have no occasion to reach the mootness issues now raised by the village if the district court properly granted summary judgment on res judicata grounds.we begin with the issue of standing and hold that brody does have standing to pursue his claim based on the lack of individual notice of publication.contrary to the district court,we hold that this claim is not barred by res judicata.only then do we turn to the village arguments relating to the advance payment agreement and the absence of proper parties,all of which we reject in holding that the appeal is not moot.we conclude with guidance to the district court on remand as to the issues of who are necessary parties and what form of relief may be appropriate.
ii.standard of review 
we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.mario p c food markets,cir.all factual inferences must be drawn in favor of brody as the party,and summary judgment is appropriate only if the village shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.lane capital,lane capital,cir.
iii.standing 
the village argues that the district court erred in concluding that brody had standing to assert his due process claims.it argues that our holding in brody i that brody lacked standing is binding under the law of the case doctrine and,alternatively,that the evidence relied on by the district court in finding standing was insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate that brody suffered any injury in fact.
i n order to meet the minimum constitutional requirements for standing,a plaintiff must allege an actual or threatened injury to himself that is fairly traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct of the defendant and is likely to be redressed by the requested relief.sullivan syracuse hous,cir quoting allen wright,d.as previously noted,in brody i,this court vacated the preliminary injunction because we found that brody lacked standing to assert his claims as he had not alleged any injury in fact 
with regard to the public use hearings,brody had actual notice of the first hearing,on june,and,indeed,attended and presented his views.at the second hearing,on july,the village not only adopted by reference the proceedings of the june,hearing but also expressly considered the comments made therein.brody has not in any way indicated that he would have raised additional objections at the july hearing had he been provided with notice.therefore brody has suffered no injury in fact from not knowing of the july hearing.
with regard to the village publication of its findings and determinations and the concomitant triggering of the limit on appeals therefrom,brody,while complaining of the lack of personal notice,has notably not alleged that he did not receive actual notice,a sine qua non of demonstrating injury.consequently,he has alleged no injury in fact stemming from the lack of personal notice of the findings and determinations.
moreover,even if brody had alleged that he had no such actual knowledge,it would not change the result e ven if brody had had personal notice of the village findings and determinations and had challenged them in the appellate division,his objections could not conceivably have led to a rejection of the putative public purpose.specifically,his objections,as stated at the june hearing,were simply that while he would like to see the project continue and go forward,the laundromat on his property was of substantial value to local residents and thus he would like it to be considered that possibly where my buildings are,there might be a way that they might be able to remain.such not to challenging the public use but to persuading village officials not to include his property in the completely inapposite to the extremely narrow constitutional inquiry into whether the proposed taking served a public purpose.hawaii hous.auth.midkiff,d.
brody i,at.
when it ruled on the for summary judgment that were pending at the time brody i was decided,however,the district court found that brody had standing to pursue these same claims 
brody contends that his deposition testimony cured any standing problem since he made it clear that at the time he did not have an opportunity to fully express his views on the condemnation.when asked whether he intended to say anything at the hearing besides what is reflected in the written record,brody replied,well,you really did have a chance to say what you wanted to say.so,yes,yes,sure.although not crystal clear,i find that this allegation is sufficient to convey standing on this claim.
the circuit also held that brody lacked standing to challenge the village failure to provide him with actual notice of the determination and findings and of the day limitation period in which to appeal because he failed to sufficiently allege lack of knowledge.however,in his declaration in support of this motion,brody states unequivocally that he did not know that the determination and findings existed or that he had a right to appeal within days.see brody decl.at.thus,brody has also remedied this deficiency and,it seems clear,has standing to bring this claim.
minnich,wl,at.
although the village argues that the holding in brody i was the law of the case,it concedes that this court may reconsider its prior holding on the basis of new evidence.appellees br.at.we have observed that the law of the case doctrine is,at best,a discretionary doctrine which does not constitute a limitation on the court power but merely expresses the general practice of refusing to reopen what has been decided.united states martinez,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.an issue decided on a prior appeal is not foreclosed with all the finality of res judicata when the case comes back to this court.although the district court may not change our mind for us,we may ourselves do so.united states fernandez,cir.
the brody i panel holding on standing was based only on the limited record before it on the motion for preliminary injunction.now presented with a fuller record for purposes of the motion for summary judgment,we are free to revisit the issue of standing.see,doctor,distajo,cir in view of our clearer understanding now,after remand,of the nature and scope of prior litigation by the plaintiffs,it would serve no justifiable purpose to adhere blindly to a statement in the first appeal that was based on an incomplete picture of the relevant facts.dilaura power auth.of new york,cir the decision of both the trial and appellate court on whether to grant or deny a temporary injunction does not preclude the parties in any way from litigating the merits of the case.internal quotations omitted.unencumbered by our prior determination of these issues,we now turn to the village argument that brody has not alleged an injury in fact sufficient to support his claims as to the lack of notice of the july meeting and the publication of the determination and findings.
the village argues that because brody nowhere states that he would have said anything at the second hearing,brody can not establish injury in fact from his lack of notice and failure to participate at that hearing.
in his deposition,brody stated as follows 
q when you arrived at the june meeting,did you intend to speak 
q did you intend to say anything other what reflected in the written record 
a well,you really did have a chance to say what you wanted to say.so,yes,yes,sure.
q well,are you saying,sir,that someone cut you off in the middle of your remarks 
a well,they kind of told you that you could ask questions and you were limited to the amount of time you could speak,so it was really like you could really get a feel for what is really going on and say what you want to say,you have three minutes 
q well,i notice,sir,at the end of the transcript on page,you made a statement and then which was finished with,that it,thank you.
q did anyone prompt you to say,that it 
the district court recognized the lack of clarity in this statement,but inferred from this testimony,and specifically the italicized text,that brody had alleged that there were remarks that went unmade at the june meeting that,but for the lack of individual notice,he would have delivered at the july meeting.
the village argues that brody can not allege that he was injured by the lack of notice of the july meeting because he,along with everyone else in attendance at the june meeting,was given an opportunity at the end of the june meeting to add to their previous comments if they have new information or comments or suggestions that they like to bring forth.since brody did not speak at that time,so the village argument goes,he can not allege that he suffered any injury in fact from being unaware of the july meeting.we do not agree with the village that because brody was given a chance to say his piece at the close of the first meeting that it is now impossible for him to allege any injury arising from the lack of notice as to the second.even if brody had no more to say at the close of the first meeting,it is entirely possible that had he been aware of the second,he would have participated and have had information to add in response to remarks made by others during that second meeting.
although we believe it was,therefore,theoretically possible for brody to allege an injury arising out of the failure to receive notice of the july meeting,he nevertheless still has not done so.brody has not alleged what he would have said or responded to had he attended the july meeting indeed,he has not alleged that he would have said anything at all at the july meeting.as a result,the record before us differs in no material way from that before this court in brody see brody i,at brody has not in any way indicated that he would have raised additional objections at the july hearing had he been provided with notice.therefore brody has suffered no injury in fact from not knowing of the july hearing.accordingly,we once again conclude that brody lacks standing to challenge the lack of individual notice of the second hearing.
with respect to brody due process challenge based on the lack of notice of publication of the determination and findings and the lack of notice of the legal consequences of that publication,however,we find that brody has cured the lack of evidentiary showing identified in brody i.the district court relied on brody declaration submitted in support of his motion for summary judgment,in which brody unambiguously states 
i did not see the determination and findings in the newspaper or anywhere else.i did not even know they existed if i had known about the determination and findings and that i had a right to appeal within days,i would definitely have appealed them.i just did even know i had lost anything at that point,let alone that i could challenge it.
brody decl.brody further states in his declaration that he would like to challenge the declaration that his property is blighted,the delegation of power to marina project developers,and the constitutionality of the public purpose of condemning his property to give it to another private developer.in light of this testimony,we hold that the district court properly determined that brody has standing to assert his due process claim 
the village further contends that we are bound by dicta in brody i that suggests that brody could not prevail because even if he had received actual notice of the publication of the determination and findings and had timely filed an appeal challenging the condemnation of his property,his objections could not conceivably have led to a rejection of the putative public purpose.at.although brody likelihood of success on the merits was relevant to this court in deciding whether the preliminary injunction was warranted,we do not read the decision as suggesting that this factor bears on whether brody has standing.
in a procedural due process challenge,the question before the court is whether the process affording the plaintiff an opportunity to participate in governmental before being deprived of his liberty or property was adequate,not whether the government decision to deprive the plaintiff of such liberty or property was ultimately correct.the right to be heard does not depend upon an advance showing that one will surely prevail at the hearing.to one who protests against the taking of his property without due process of law,it is no answer to say that in his particular case due process of law would have led to the same result because he had no adequate defense upon the merits.fuentes shevin,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also kim hurston,cir this case is unusual in that the minimal hearing that procedural due process requires would have done the plaintiff little good since she could not have realistically contested the outcome nevertheless,the procedural due process requirement of a statement of reasons must be observed.
thus,the supreme court held in carey piphus,d,that a plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages upon a showing of a deprivation of procedural due process,even where the plaintiff fails to show that the outcome would have been different had due process been given.e ven if the plaintiffs did not suffer any other actual injury,the fact remains that they were deprived of their right to procedural due process.it is enough to invoke the procedural safeguards of the fourteenth amendment that a significant property interest is at stake,whatever the ultimate outcome of a hearing id.quoting fuentes,at.the court,however,went on to add that compensatory damages would be appropriate only where the plaintiff could demonstrate that he had suffered some injury as a result of the denial of due process,id.at.such as by showing that the outcome would have been different had process been afforded,or that he had suffered emotional distress directly from the denial of due process,rather than from the denial of the liberty or property interest.
regardless of whether or not brody will ultimately be entitled to a return of his property,he seeks declaratory relief that the edpl is unconstitutional and,under supreme court precedent,is entitled at least to nominal damages for any denial of due process,if proven.whether brody has demonstrated that he would have prevailed in the appellate process had he been given notice,therefore,is beside the point for purposes of assessing his standing,and we agree with the district court that brody has alleged sufficient facts to show that he suffered an injury in fact from being denied notice of the publication of the determination and findings and an opportunity to appeal.thus,we hold that brody has standing to assert this due process challenge.
iv.res judicata 
while expressing concern about the seriousness of brody constitutional challenges to the edpl procedures,the district court nonetheless found that brody due process claims were barred by res judicata because it found that brody could have brought these claims as defenses to the village suit under article of the edpl to take title to his property.we hold that brody claims are not barred by res judicata because edpl and provide for exclusive jurisdiction in article proceedings over the types of claims brody asserts in this lawsuit.
edpl provides for judicial review of the condemnor determination and findings in the appellate division of the new york supreme court by filing a petition for review within thirty days of publication of the determination and findings.section b further provides that t he jurisdiction of the appellate division of the supreme court shall be exclusive section c limits the scope of review to whether the proceeding was in conformity with the federal and state constitutions,the proposed acquisition is within the condemnor statutory jurisdiction or authority,the condemnor determination and findings were made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article and with article eight of the environmental conservation law,and a public use,benefit or purpose will be served by the proposed acquisition.edpl c emphasis added.section reiterates the exclusive nature of the appellate division jurisdiction 
except as expressly set forth in section two hundred seven,and except for review by the court of appeals of an order or judgment of the appellate division of the supreme court as provided for therein,no court of this state shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter,case or controversy concerning any matter which was or could have been determined in a proceeding under this article.
edpl emphasis added.
article of the edpl,in contrast,creates a proceeding,distinct from an article challenge to the determination and findings,in which the condemnor petitions to acquire the title to the property.once a petition has been filed by the condemnor under,the condemnee is permitted to file an answer which must contain specific denial of each material allegation of the petition controverted by him,or of any knowledge or information thereof,sufficient to form a belief,or a statement of new matter constituting a defense to the proceeding.edpl b.u pon due proof of service of notice and upon filing of such petition and proof to the supreme court satisfaction that the procedural requirements of this law have been met,the court shall direct the immediate filing and entry of the order granting the petition upon the filing of the order and the acquisition map,the acquisition of the property shall be complete and title to such property shall then be vested in the condemnor.id.b.
under the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in that action.marvel characters,simon,cir.this bar will not apply,however,where the initial forum did not have the power to award the full measure of relief sought in the later litigation.davidson capuano,cir.thus,the only issue before us is whether brody could have asserted his constitutional challenges to the lack of notice in his answer.we answer this question in the negative because the allegedly barred claims are matters that could have been determined in a proceeding and,therefore,fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the appellate division under.
as the phrase could have been determined is used in,it refers to the enumerated categories of claims listed in c,and therefore encompasses brody constitutional challenges to the lack of notice.see edpl c.the district court erred,however,in concluding that these claims could also have been asserted as counterclaims in the proceeding,in light of the unambiguous grant of exclusive jurisdiction in.
in metropolitan transportation authority pinelawn cemetery,cited by the district court and relied on by the village on appeal,the court held that the defendant was not entitled to raise defenses in an article proceeding that could have been raised in an article proceeding 
since pinelawn cemetery raises objections with respect to whether the proposed acquisition is within the mta statutory jurisdiction or authority edpl c,the proper recourse was for it to seek expeditious review by bringing a proceeding in this court under edpl.edpl states that,no court of this state shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter,case or controversy concerning any matter which was or could have been determined in a proceeding under article.having failed to timely raise this objection,pinelawn cemetery may not circumvent the command of the statute with respect to procedures governing judicial review by raising this objection.
id.although the court went on to observe in dicta in a final concluding paragraph that i n any event,we find no evidence in the record to support pinelawn cemetery conclusory allegations that the mta intends to construct an access road,the clear import of the court holding,echoed in every new york state court decision on this issue,is that article claims may not be raised as article defenses or counterclaims.see in re broome,holding that where a property owner failed to make a timely constitutional challenge,barred him from raising those claims in an answer to a petition hydro associates rkdk,holding,in a proceeding,that a ll other issues raised in the answer are within the ambit of edpl and could have been reviewed by the appellate division upon a petition brought within days after completion of publication of the condemnor determination and findings.having failed to timely bring such a petition,the condemnee can not assert those issues in the condemnation court.village of patchogue simon,since appellant raises objections with respect to whether the condemnor determination and findings were made in accordance with the procedures set forth in edpl article,an issue within this court exclusive jurisdiction edpl c,appellant proper recourse was to seek expeditious review by filing a petition in this court pursuant to edpl.having failed to do so,appellant may not circumvent the command of the statute with respect to the procedures governing judicial review by raising his objections within the context of an edpl article vesting proceeding before special term.
de vito city of troy,also relied on by the village in support of its claim that brody could have asserted his untimely claims in defense to the article petition,was an article proceeding.in de vito,the city moved to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiff petition was barred by the thirty day statute of limitations.id.while the court considered and rejected the plaintiffs argument that the limitations period should not apply because the plaintiffs had not received individual notice of the publication of determination,this suggests only that brody might have been able to assert his due process claims in an untimely article proceeding,not that he could have asserted them as counterclaims in the action filed by the village 
the district court also concluded that i f brody had brought the instant challenge in the state proceeding under article,the new york court would have considered it,just as it considered his argument that the government had an obligation to extend to him an offer of compensation for his home,relying on c consol if a court has obtained jurisdiction over the parties,a civil judicial proceeding shall not be dismissed solely because it is not brought in the proper form,but the court shall make whatever order is required for its proper prosecution.minnich,wl,at edpl,however,specifically provides that t he civil practice laws and rules shall apply to practice and procedure in proceedings under this law except where other procedure is specifically provided by this law or rules governing or adopted by the appropriate court.edpl emphasis added see also id.notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of law,general or special,the provisions of this law shall be controlling.we therefore disagree with the district court conclusion that the general cplr provision cited above vested the article court with jurisdiction over brody constitutional claims.
moreover,this interpretation does not,as the district court suggested,necessarily leave property owners such as brody without any means to challenge the constitutionality of new york condemnation procedures.as brody counsel acknowledged at oral argument and as suggested by de vito,brody might have attempted to file an untimely petition before the appellate division,asserting that the statute of limitations should not apply because he did not have adequate notice,was therefore deprived of due process,and should be permitted to raise his challenges as to the purported public use.that he failed to do so,however,has no bearing on whether his claims are barred by the res judicata effect of the article proceeding.
in light of the clear language of,brody could not have asserted his due process claims as counterclaims in the article proceeding,and therefore res judicata does not bar the assertion of the constitutional challenge to the lack of individual notice of the publication of the determination and findings and the lack of notice as to the legal import of such publication.
having found that brody claims are not barred by res judicata,we now turn to the village arguments as to why events that have transpired since the filing of this lawsuit now render the appeal moot.the village contends that brody acceptance of the advance payment renders his challenges to the condemnation moot because title has already passed and that the sale of the property to the developer and then to the village ida makes it impossible to award the relief sought by brody.we conclude that neither of these arguments renders this litigation moot for the reasons set forth below.
advance payment agreement 
the advance payment agreement was entered into on may,pursuant to article of the edpl,which requires the condemnor to make a written offer of what the condemnor believes to be fair compensation for the property.see edpl.under edpl,the condemnee may elect to accept the payment in full,to accept the payment as an advance payment while reserving the right to claim additional compensation,or to reject the payment.section also requires the written offer to state that t he right of the condemnee to the advance payment shall not be conditioned on the waiver of any other right.edpl a emphasis added.
the agreement signed by brody and the village provides that 
first,the owner elects to accept an advance payment in the sum of one million eight hundred thousand and dollars,which payment shall be without prejudice to the rights of either of the parties hereto,and the village agrees to pay such sum as hereinbefore set forth.
third,the parties hereto agree that the title to said property vested in the village on august.
ninth,the owner agrees as a prerequisite to such payment,to execute and deliver,or cause the execution and delivery,to the village of all formal papers which the village deems reasonably necessary to clear any objections to title,and to secure to the village a partial release from the claim as to the amount of the advance payment,including but not limited to an affidavit of title and a partial release as to the amount of the advance payment as provided herein.
ex.i to def.motion to dismiss emphasis added.
the village contends that b y entering into the advance payment agreement and accepting the payment,brody has thus agreed that the village has title to his property and to cooperate with the village in clearing any objections to the village title.accordingly,brody no longer has any cognizable interest in opposing the condemnation of his property.brody sole remaining interest is in pursing his claim for compensation in the state court.def.motion to dismiss,at.there are several flaws in this reasoning.
first,nowhere in the advance payment agreement did brody agree that he will not contest the transfer of title of his property to the village.that agreement simply acknowledged that title to the property had already passed by operation of new york law as soon as the article petition was approved.see edpl b.second,the first paragraph expressly states that the acceptance of payment is without prejudice to the rights of either party.contrary to the village position,brody acceptance of the payment without prejudice to his rights to continue this lawsuit does not render the advance payment agreement meaningless.the advance payment is a statutory creation that allows property owners to receive money while condemnation proceedings are in progress,and the statute expressly provides that acceptance of the advance payment can not be conditioned on the relinquishment of rights.id.a.we further find significant the fact that the statute does not preclude payment of the advance payment before an article petition has been granted,or even before an article challenge has been resolved by the courts.thus,contrary to the village assertion,the statutory scheme does not necessarily contemplate that advance payment will be made only after all challenges to title have been resolved and title has passed to the condemnor.
we also reject the village argument that the agreement requirement that brody deliver all formal papers which the village deems reasonably necessary to clear any objections to title,includes a release of claims in this lawsuit the agreement specifically requires a partial release only as to the amount of the advance payment.in light of this clearly limited language,as well as the broad reservation of rights language,we hold that brody did not relinquish his rights to pursue this litigation by accepting the advance payment.
absent parties 
the village next argues that as the property has been conveyed to the village ida and development is underway,the appeal is moot because i n the absence of necessary parties who control the property in question,restoration is impossible.reply in support of motion to dismiss,at.while brody responds that the village ida is in privity with the village and thus is not necessary to afford complete relief,this issue has not been developed in the record below,and we therefore do not reach it on appeal.we do,however,consider the village argument that the village ida is a necessary party,although we disagree with the village characteriza
