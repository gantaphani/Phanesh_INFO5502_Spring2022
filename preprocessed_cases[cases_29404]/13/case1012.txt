background 
are the representatives of hundreds of americans killed in multiple terrorist attacks,and they have billions of dollars in unpaid compensatory damages judgments against iran stemming from these attacks bank markazi is the central bank of iran,which is wholly owned by the iranian government.the assets at issue in this appeal are billion in cash proceeds of government bonds,currently held in new york by defendant citibank,in an omnibus account for defendant clearstream banking,a financial intermediary.one of the customers for whom clearstream maintains this account is defendant banca ubae,an italian bank whose customer,in turn,is bank markazi.bank markazi concedes that through this chain of parties it has at least a beneficial interest in the assets at issue.plaintiffs seek turnover of these assets to satisfy their judgments.
when plaintiffs first learned of bank markazi interest in the assets in,they obtained restraints against transfer of the assets.in,plaintiffs initiated this action against bank markazi,ubae,clearstream,and citibank to obtain turnover of the assets under section a of the tria,which provides that in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment.terrorism risk insurance act of,pub,a,stat,codified at note satisfaction of judgments from blocked assets of terrorists,terrorist organizations,and state sponsors of terrorism.
in february,while this action was pending,president obama issued executive order,which stated 
i n light of the deceptive practices of bank markazi to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties a ll property and interests in property of the government of iran,including bank markazi,that are in the united states or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any united states person are blocked 
exec.order.the assets at issue which were still under restraint were blocked based on this executive order.plaintiffs then filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their tria claim.
in august,while that motion was pending,congress passed the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of.that act included a section,codified at,which stated that the financial assets that are identified in and the subject of proceedings in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in peterson et islamic republic of iran et,case civ.shall be subject to execution in order to satisfy any judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages awarded against iran for damages for personal injury or death caused by an act of terrorism,stat.plaintiffs then filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment under.
in march,the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs,ordering turnover of the assets on the two independent bases of tria section a and.peterson islamic republic of iran,civ,wl.in july,the district court issued an order directing turnover of the blocked assets and enjoining the parties from initiating a claim to the assets in another jurisdiction.peterson islamic republic of iran,civ.july,ecf,plaintiffs settled with clearstream and ubae,and citibank is a neutral stakeholder,leaving bank markazi as the sole appellant.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the,asking whether there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact and whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.padilla maersk line,cir citing.a.we also review de novo the district court legal conclusions,including those interpreting and determining the constitutionality of a statute,united states stewart,cir,or involving the interpretation of a treaty,swarna al awadi,cir.
bank markazi argues that the assets at issue are not assets of bank markazi as required for turnover under tria section a,and that even if the assets were held to be assets of bank markazi,then they would be the property of a foreign central bank held for its own account and thus immune from attachment and from execution under the foreign sovereign immunities act,b.we need not resolve this dispute under the tria,however,as congress has changed the law governing this case by enacting.bank markazi concedes that plaintiffs have satisfied the statutory elements of their claim but argues that turnover under this provision conflicts with the treaty of amity between the united states and iran violates separation of powers under article iii and violates the takings clause.as we explain below,none of these arguments has merit.we also reject bank markazi challenge to the district court injunction.
treaty of amity 
bank markazi argues that turnover of the assets under would conflict with obligations of the united states under the treaty of amity,which is a treaty between the united states and iran that was signed in.treaty of amity,economic relations and consular rights between the united states and iran,see also mckesson islamic republic of iran,the treaty of amity,like other treaties of its kind,is.but even if there were a conflict,the would still apply the supreme court has held explicitly that legislative acts trump international law,stating that when a statute which is subsequent in time to a treaty is inconsistent with a treaty,the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null.united states yousef,cir alteration in original quoting breard greene,d see also whitney robertson.by the constitution,a treaty is placed on the same footing,and made of like obligation,with an act of legislation and if the two are inconsistent,the one last in date will control the other.indeed,when iran raised a similar argument against turnover under tria section a in a different case,we concluded that even if this provision conflicted with the treaty of amity,the tria would have to be read to abrogate that portion of the treaty.weinstein islamic republic of iran,cir 
in any event,we see no conflict between and the treaty of amity.bank markazi first contends that congress inclusion of bank markazi in its definition of iran in d violates article iii of the treaty,which states that iranian companies shall have their juridical status recognized within the united states.but as bank markazi acknowledges,this argument has been rejected by our court in the context of a similar provision in the tria.see weinstein,at concluding that iran argument was foreclosed by the supreme court analysis of similar provisions in sumitomo shoji america,avagliano,d.
bank markazi also argues that violates articles iv and v,which require that treatment of iranian companies and their property interests be fair and equitable and no less favorable than that accorded nationals and companies of any third country.but the provision of that bank markazi points to contains no discrimination rather,it simply states that n othing in this section shall be construed to affect the availability,or lack thereof,of a right to satisfy a judgment in any other action against a terrorist party in any proceedings other than these proceedings.c.contrary to bank markazi argument,this provision is expressly.
finally,bank markazi argues that turnover under violates article iii,which accords iranian companies freedom of access to court
