appellant garlon reigler appeals from various orders of the tax court,including a may,order concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction to vacate a september,order,which dismissed a suit and entered a decision in favor of the internal revenue service.on appeal,reigler claims that the tax court failed to appoint a tax matters partner tmp to represent the partnership in the litigation prior to entering the september,order,and consequently,reigler was deprived of due process.thus,he contends,this court should reverse the tax court may,order and require vacatur of the september,order.we disagree and hold that,in this case,the tax court was under no duty to appoint a tmp,and hence reigler was not deprived of due process.we therefore conclude that the tax court was without jurisdiction to vacate its september,order.
reigler was a limited partner in cinema,a connecticut limited partnership that was formed to purchase and exploit the rights to a number of films.from to,the tax years at issue,cinema filed information returns with the internal revenue service irs in,the irs audited cinema.at the conclusion of the audits,the irs issued a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaa for,and and determined that adjustments of the partnership tax returns were required.
richard greenberg was the tmp for cinema.a tmp is the partner designated to act as a liaison between the partnership and the internal revenue service in administrative proceedings,and as a representative of the partnership in judicial proceedings.addington comm r,cir.in,greenberg,in his capacity as tmp,filed a petition on behalf of cinema in united states tax court,seeking a redetermination of the adjustments contained in the fpaas.in january,greenberg was placed in involuntary bankruptcy and became disqualified to serve as the tmp.
the tax court attempted to find a successor tmp on a number of occasions.on june,the tax court issued an order explaining,in pertinent part 
some of the individual partners have reached a basis for settlement,but these settlements have not been implemented because of the absence of tax matters partners.the court intends to schedule these cases for a pretrial hearing to consider the appointment of tax matters partners and whether the pending cases will be pursued in the court by any limited partners.in order to ensure that the individual partners are informed of the contents of this order and attached notice,the court is serving a copy of this order and the attached notice on all partners in the partnership to the extent that they have been identified to the court.
the court ordered each partner served to appear at a pretrial hearing on september,and stated,if there is no appearance at this pretrial hearing by any partner of this partnership,unless the case has been disposed of by settlement prior thereto,the court will dismiss this case and enter a decision in accordance with the amount determined by respondent,the commissioner of the irs commissioner.
the notice to partners accompanying the order explained,in part,that as a result of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings filed against the former tmp,the partnership was without any active tmp.the notice warned,there still may be substantial tax liabilities resulting from these proceedings for all direct and indirect partners.in addition,it cautioned 
any partner who does not appear in person or by a duly authorized representative will be deemed by the court to have waived any rights under the internal revenue code or the tax court rules of practice and procedure to the appointment of a tax matters partner and to further notice of proceedings in this case.if there is no appearance by any partner of a partnership,that case will be dismissed.
counsel for the commissioner has advised the court that he has developed a settlement position with regard to this case that he is willing to offer to any partner requesting that settlement before the hearing on september.if a partner has any questions concerning that settlement,you or your representative should immediately contact the commissioner representative.
reigler concedes that the june,order and notice to partners were sent to him and admits that he nonetheless did not attend the september,hearing.no partner at the september,hearing advised the court that he or she desired to be appointed the tmp or to litigate the issues.
on december,the court issued another order,which provided,in part 
the court must now determine which,if any,partners desire to actively participate in this litigation as participating partners,or to be appointed a tax matters partner so that this case may proceed to trial.
this is the partners last chance to advise the court of their desire to participate in this litigation of this case.the failure of any partner to appear who has not settled will constitute a waiver of the right to prosecute this case as to the partner,and may result in the dismissal of this case for failure to properly prosecute and entry of decision in favor of the commissioner for the adjustments set forth in the notice of fpaa.
the court ordered each partner who wished to participate in the proceeding to file a motion for leave to elect to participate by january.in addition,the court required those partners who desired to serve as tmp to file a request with the court by january.another pretrial hearing was scheduled for february.again the court cautioned,if there is no appearance at this pretrial hearing by any partner of this partnership,the court will dismiss this case and enter a decision in accordance with the amount determined by the commissioner.and again the court warned that if a tax matters partner is not identified and selected by the close of the pretrial hearing,the court will dismiss this case and enter a decision in accordance with the amount determined by the commissioner.the clerk of the court was ordered to serve each identified partner with a copy of the order and a notice substantially similar to the notice to partners accompanying the june,order.reigler concedes that,as with the prior order and notice,these materials were sent to him,yet he did not attend the february,hearing.
a number of partners were present or represented at the february,hearing.none of them,however,indicated a desire to prosecute the case or to be appointed tmp.
on july,the commissioner moved to dismiss the case for failure to prosecute.the court held the motion in abeyance while it decided other motions concerning specific partners that were potentially dispositive.
on february,the court ordered yet another pretrial hearing and scheduled it for july.in its order,the court warned if there is no appearance by or on behalf of a partner who will prosecute this matter,the court will dismiss this case for failure to properly prosecute and enter a decision sustaining the commissioner determination in full.this hearing will not be continued for any reason.the court again ordered the clerk of the court to send the order to all identified partners,including reigler.reigler concedes that the order was sent to him,but for a third time,he did not attend the scheduled hearing.
on september,after various settlements were finalized on behalf of a number of partners,the tax court wells,granted the commissioner motion to dismiss the action as to those partners who did not settle.again,the court ordered the clerk to serve the order on all identified partners on the attached list,including reigler.
reigler did not file a motion to vacate or revise the decision.however,one partner,karin locke,did timely appeal to this court on grounds specific to her.we subsequently reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the petition with respect to locke.see generally cinema comm r,cir per curiam.the tax court entered an order dismissing locke from the suit on march.
finally,on december,than eight months after the tax court entered an order dismissing the suit against locke and more than three years after the tax court dismissed the action for failure to filed a number of motions,essentially seeking to vacate the underlying september,dismissal by the tax court.reigler argued that the prior dism
