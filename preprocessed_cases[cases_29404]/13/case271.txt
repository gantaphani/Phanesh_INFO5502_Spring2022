respondent nicastro injured his hand while using a machine that petitioner mcintyre machinery,mcintyre,manufactured in england,where the company is incorporated and operates.nicastro filed this suit in a state court in new jersey,where the accident occurred,but mcintyre sought to dismiss the suit for want of personal jurisdiction.nicastro jurisdictional claim was based on three primary facts a distributor agreed to sell mcintyre machines in this country mcintyre officials attended trade shows in several states,albeit not in new jersey and no more than four mcintyre machines the record suggests only one,including the one at issue,ended up in new jersey.the state supreme court held that new jersey courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer without contravening the fourteenth amendment due process clause so long as the manufacturer knew or reasonably should have known that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to sales in any of the states.invoking this doctrine of jurisdiction,the court relied in part on asahi metal industry superior court of,solano.applying its test,the court concluded that mcintyre was subject to jurisdiction in new jersey,even though at no time had it advertised in,sent goods to,or in any relevant sense targeted the state.
held the judgment is reversed.
justice kennedy,joined by the chief justice,justice scalia,and justice thomas,concluded that because mcintyre never engaged in any activities in new jersey that revealed an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of the state laws,new jersey is without power to adjudge the company rights and liabilities,and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.
a due process protects the defendant right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power.a court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington.freeform fundamental fairness notions divorced from traditional practice can not transform a judgment rendered without authority into law.as a general rule,the sovereign exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla.in cases like this one,it is the defendant purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with fair play and substantial justice notions.no doctrine can displace that general rule for cases.
the rules and standards for determining state jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of questions left open in asahi.the imprecision arising from asahi,for the most part,results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the stream of commerce.that concept,like other metaphors,has its deficiencies as well as its utilities.it refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers,yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.a defendant placement of goods into commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum state may indicate purposeful availment.volkswagen woodson.but that does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.the principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendant activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.see,hanson,supra,at.in asahi,justice brennan concurrence joined by three other justices discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of fairness and foreseeability considerations on the theory that the defendant ability to anticipate suit is the touchstone of jurisdiction,at.however,justice lead opinion also for four justices stated that t he substantial connection between the defendant and the forum state necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.at.since asahi,the courts have sought to reconcile the competing opinions.but justice brennan rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power under this court precedents.today conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment is consistent with justice asahi opinion.
b nicastro has not established that mcintyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at new jersey.the company had no office in new jersey it neither paid taxes nor owned property there and it neither advertised in,nor sent any employees to,the state.indeed,the trial court found that petitioner did not have a single contact with the state apart from the fact that the machine in question ended up there.neither these facts,nor the three on which nicastro centered his jurisdictional claim,show that mcintyre purposefully availed itself of the new jersey market.
justice breyer,joined by justice alito,agreed that the new jersey supreme court judgment must be reversed,but concluded that because this case does not present issues arising from recent changes in commerce and communication,it is unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without fully considering consequences.rather,the outcome of the case is determined by the court precedents.
a based on the record,respondent nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner mcintyre machinery,british manufacturer.the three primary facts the state high court relied on do not satisfy due process.none of the court precedents finds that a single isolated sale,even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here,is sufficient.see volkswagen woodson,asahi metal industry superior court of,solano.here,the relevant facts show no regular flow or regular course of sales in new jersey,at brennan,concurring in part and concurring in judgment,at stevens,concurring in part and concurring in judgment and there is no something more,such as special design,advertising,advice,or marketing,at,opinion of,that would warrant the assertion of jurisdiction.nicastro has shown no specific effort by the british manufacturer to sell in new jersey.and he has not otherwise shown that the british manufacturer purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within new jersey,or that it delivered its goods in the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by new jersey users.volkswagen,supra,at.
b justice breyer would not go further.because the incident at issue does not implicate modern concerns,and because the factual record leaves many open questions,this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.at a minimum,he would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the new jersey supreme court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law,they might be presented in a case unlike the present one in which the solicitor general participates.

justice kennedy announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion,in which the chief justice,justice scalia,and justice thomas join.
whether a person or entity is subject to the jurisdiction of a state court despite not having been present in the state either at the time of suit or at the time of the alleged injury,and despite not having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction,is a question that arises with great frequency in the routine course of litigation.the rules and standards for determining when a state does or does not have jurisdiction over an absent party have been unclear because of questions left open in asahi metal industry superior court of,solano.
here,the supreme court of new jersey,relying in part on asahi,held that new jersey courts can exercise jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer of a product so long as the manufacturer knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.nicastro mcintyre machinery america.applying that test,the court concluded that a british manufacturer of scrap metal machines was subject to jurisdiction in new jersey,even though at no time had it advertised in,sent goods to,or in any relevant sense targeted the state.
that decision can not be sustained.although the new jersey supreme court issued an extensive opinion with attention to this court cases and to its own,the stream of commerce metaphor carried the decision far afield.due process protects the defendant right not to be coerced except by lawful judicial power.as a general rule,the exercise of judicial power is not lawful unless the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla.there may be exceptions,say,for instance,in cases involving an intentional tort.but the general rule is applicable in this case,and the doctrine can not displace it.
this case arises from a suit filed in new jersey state court.robert nicastro seriously injured his hand while using a machine manufactured by mcintyre machinery,mcintyre.the accident occurred in new jersey,but the machine was manufactured in england,where mcintyre is incorporated and operates.the question here is whether the new jersey courts have jurisdiction over mcintyre,notwithstanding the fact that the company at no time either marketed goods in the state or shipped them there.nicastro was a plaintiff in the new jersey trial court and is the respondent here mcintyre was a defendant and is now the petitioner.
at oral argument in this court,nicastro counsel stressed three primary facts in defense of new jersey of jurisdiction over mcintyre.see tr.of oral arg.
first,an independent company agreed to sell mcintyre machines in the united states.mcintyre itself did not sell its machines to buyers in this country beyond the distributor,and there is no allegation that the distributor was under mcintyre control.
second,mcintyre officials attended annual conventions for the scrap recycling industry to advertise machines alongside the distributor.the conventions took place in various states,but never in new jersey.
third,no more than four machines the record suggests only one,see app.to pet.for cert,including the machine that caused the injuries that are the basis for this suit,ended up in new jersey.
in addition to these facts emphasized by petitioner,the new jersey supreme court noted that mcintyre held both united states and european patents on its recycling technology,at,at.it also noted that the distributor structured its and sales efforts in accordance with mcintyre direction and guidance whenever possible,and that at least some of the machines were sold on consignment to the distributor,at,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in light of these facts,the new jersey supreme court concluded that new jersey courts could exercise jurisdiction over petitioner without contravention of the due process clause.jurisdiction was proper,in that court view,because the injury occurred in new jersey because petitioner knew or reasonably should have known that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states and because petitioner failed to take some reasonable step to prevent the distribution of its in this state.at,at.
both the new jersey supreme court holding and its account of what it called t he doctrine of jurisdiction,at,at,were incorrect,however.this court asahi decision may be responsible in part for that court error regarding the stream of commerce,and this case presents an opportunity to provide greater clarity.
the due process clause protects an individual right to be deprived of life,liberty,or property only by the exercise of lawful power.giaccio pennsylvania,the clause protect s a person against having the government impose burdens upon him except in accordance with the valid laws of the land this is no less true with respect to the power of a sovereign to resolve disputes through judicial process than with respect to the power of a sovereign to prescribe rules of conduct for those within its sphere.see steel citizens for environment,jurisdiction is power to declare the law as a general rule,neither statute nor judicial decree may bind strangers to the state.burnham superior court of,county of marin,opinion of scalia,invoking the phrase coram non judice,before a person not a judge meaning,in effect,that the proceeding in question was not a judicial proceeding because lawful judicial authority was not present,and could therefore not yield a judgment 
a court may subject a defendant to judgment only when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the sovereign such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington,quoting milliken meyer.freeform notions of fundamental fairness divorced from traditional practice can not transform a judgment rendered in the absence of authority into law.as a general rule,the sovereign exercise of power requires some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,hanson,at,though in some cases,as with an intentional tort,the defendant might well fall within the state authority by reason of his attempt to obstruct its laws.in cases like this one,it is the defendant purposeful availment that makes jurisdiction consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.
a person may submit to a state authority in a number of ways.there is,of course,explicit consent,of ireland compagnie des bauxites de guinee.presence within a state at the time suit commences through service of process is another example.see burnham,supra.citizenship or domicile or,by analogy,incorporation or principal place of business for corporations also indicates general submission to a state powers.goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,post.each of these examples reveals circumstances,or a course of conduct,from which it is proper to infer an intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit to the laws of the forum state.burger king rudzewicz.these examples support exercise of the general jurisdiction of the state courts and allow the state to resolve both matters that originate within the state and those based on activities and events elsewhere.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,and.by contrast,those who live or operate primarily outside a state have a due process right not to be subjected to judgment in its courts as a general matter.
there is also a more limited form of submission to a state authority for disputes that arise out of or are with the activities within the state.international shoe,supra,at.where a defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws,hanson,supra,at,it submits to the judicial power of an otherwise foreign sovereign to the extent that power is exercised in connection with the defendant activities touching on the state.in other words,submission through contact with and activity directed at a sovereign may justify specific jurisdiction in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.helicopteros,supra,at,see also goodyear,post,at.
the imprecision arising from asahi,for the most part,results from its statement of the relation between jurisdiction and the stream of commerce.the stream of commerce,like other metaphors,has its deficiencies as well as its utility.it refers to the movement of goods from manufacturers through distributors to consumers,yet beyond that descriptive purpose its meaning is far from exact.this court has stated that a defendant placing goods into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum state may indicate purposeful availment.volkswagen woodson,finding that expectation lacking.but that statement does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction.it merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the forum itself an unexceptional proposition as where or distributors seek to serve a given state market,at.the principal inquiry in cases of this sort is whether the defendant activities manifest an intention to submit to the power of a sovereign.in other words,the defendant must purposefully avai l of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson,supra,at insurance,supra,at a ctions of the defendant may amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court sometimes a defendant does so by sending its goods rather than its agents.the defendant transmission of goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum as a general rule,it is not enough that the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum state.
in asahi,an opinion by justice brennan for four justices outlined a different approach.it discarded the central concept of sovereign authority in favor of considerations of fairness and foreseeability.as that concurrence contended,jurisdiction premised on the placement of a product into the stream of commerce without more is consistent with the due process clause,for a s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum state,the possibility of a lawsuit there can not come as a surprise.at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment.it was the premise of the concurring opinion that the defendant ability to anticipate suit renders the assertion of jurisdiction fair.in this way,the opinion made foreseeability the touchstone of jurisdiction.
the standard set forth in justice brennan concurrence was rejected in an opinion written by justice but the relevant part of that opinion,too,commanded the assent of only four justices,not a majority of the court.that opinion stated the substantial connection between the defendant and the forum state necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.the placement of a product into the stream of commerce,without more,is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.at emphasis deleted citations omitted.
since asahi was decided,the courts have sought to the competing opinions.but justice brennan,advocating a rule based on general notions of fairness and foreseeability,is inconsistent with the premises of lawful judicial power.this court precedents make clear that it is the defendant actions,not his expectations,that empower a state courts to subject him to judgment.
the conclusion that jurisdiction is in the first instance a question of authority rather than fairness explains,for example,why the principal opinion in burnham conducted no independent inquiry into the desirability or fairness of the rule that service of process within a state suffices to establish jurisdiction over an otherwise foreign defendant,at.as that opinion explained,t he view developed early that each state had the power to hale before its courts any individual who could be found within its borders.at.furthermore,were general fairness considerations the touchstone of jurisdiction,a lack of purposeful availment might be excused where carefully crafted judicial procedures could otherwise protect the defendant interests,or where the plaintiff would suffer substantial hardship if forced to litigate in a foreign forum.that such considerations have not been deemed controlling is instructive.see,volkswagen,supra,at.
two principles are implicit in the foregoing.first,jurisdiction requires a,or,analysis.the question is whether a has followed a course of conduct directed at the society or economy existing within the jurisdiction of a given sovereign,so that the sovereign has the power to subject the defendant to judgment concerning that conduct.personal jurisdiction,of course,restricts judicial power not as a matter of sovereignty,but as a matter of individual liberty,for due process protects the individual right to be subject only to lawful power.insurance,at.but whether a judicial judgment is lawful depends on whether the sovereign has authority to render it.
the second principle is a corollary of the first.because the united states is a distinct sovereign,a defendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states but not of any particular state.this is consistent with the premises and unique genius of our constitution.ours is a legal system unprecedented in form and design,establishing two orders of government,each with its own direct relationship,its own privity,its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it.term limits,thornton,kennedy,concurring.for jurisdiction,a litigant may have the requisite relationship with the united states government but not with the government of any individual state.that would be an exceptional case,however.if the defendant is a domestic domiciliary,the courts of its home state are available and can exercise general jurisdiction.and if another state were to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case,it would upset the federal balance,which posits that each state has a sovereignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other states.furthermore,foreign corporations will often target or concentrate on particular states,subjecting them to specific jurisdiction in those forums.
it must be remembered,however,that although this case and asahi both involve foreign manufacturers,the undesirable consequences of justice brennan approach are no less significant for domestic producers.the owner of a small florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby distributor,for example,who might then distribute them to grocers across the country.if foreseeability were the controlling criterion,the farmer could be sued in alaska or any number of other states courts without ever leaving town.and the issue of foreseeability may itself be contested so that significant expenses are incurred just on the preliminary issue of jurisdiction.jurisdictional rules should avoid these costs whenever possible.
the conclusion that the authority to subject a defendant to judgment depends on purposeful availment,consistent with justice opinion in asahi,does not by itself resolve many difficult questions of jurisdiction that will arise in particular cases.the defendant conduct and the economic realities of the market the defendant seeks to serve will differ across cases,and judicial exposition will,in fashion,clarify the contours of that principle.
in this case,petitioner directed marketing and sales efforts at the united states.it may be that,assuming it were otherwise empowered to legislate on the subject,the congress could authorize the exercise of jurisdiction in appropriate courts.that circumstance is not presented in this case,however,and it is neither necessary nor appropriate to address here any constitutional concerns that might be attendant to that exercise of power.see asahi,at,nor is it necessary to determine what substantive law might apply were congress to authorize jurisdiction in a federal court in new jersey.see hanson,at the issue is personal jurisdiction,not choice of law a sovereign legislative authority to regulate conduct may present considerations different from those presented by its authority to subject a defendant to judgment in its courts.here the question concerns the authority of a new jersey state court to exercise,so it is petitioner purposeful contacts with new jersey,not with the united states,that alone are relevant.
respondent has not established that mcintyre engaged in conduct purposefully directed at new jersey.recall that respondent claim of jurisdiction centers on three facts the distributor agreed to sell mcintyre machines in the united states mcintyre officials attended trade shows in several states but not in new jersey and up to four machines ended up in new jersey.the british manufacturer had no office in new jersey it neither paid taxes nor owned property there and it neither advertised in,nor sent any employees to,the state.indeed,after discovery the trial court found that the defendant does not have a single contact with new jersey short of the machine in question ending up in this state.app.to pet.for cert.these facts may reveal an intent to serve the market,but they do not show that mcintyre purposefully availed itself of the new jersey market.
it is notable that the new jersey supreme court appears to agree,for it could not find that mcintyre had a presence or minimum contacts in this state in any jurisprudential sense that would justify a new jersey court to exercise jurisdiction in this case.at,at.the court nonetheless held that petitioner could be sued in new jersey based on a theory of jurisdiction.ibid.as discussed,however,the metaphor can not supersede either the mandate of the due process clause or the limits on judicial authority that clause ensures.the new jersey supreme court also cited significant policy reasons to justify its holding,including the state strong interest in protecting its citizens from defective products.at,at.that interest is doubtless strong,but the constitution commands restraint before discarding liberty in the name of expediency.
due process protects petitioner right to be subject only to lawful authority.at no time did petitioner engage in any activities in new jersey that reveal an intent to invoke or benefit from the protection of its laws.new jersey is without power to adjudge the rights and liabilities of mcintyre,and its exercise of jurisdiction would violate due process.the contrary judgment of the new jersey supreme court is

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of new jersey 
justice breyer,with whom justice alito joins,concurring in the judgment.
the supreme court of new jersey adopted a broad understanding of the scope of personal jurisdiction based on its view that t he increasingly globalization of the world economy has removed national borders as barriers to trade.nicastro mcintyre machinery america.i do not doubt that there have been many recent changes in commerce and communication,many of which are not anticipated by our precedents.but this case does not present any of those issues.so i think it unwise to announce a rule of broad applicability without full consideration of the consequences.
in my view,the outcome of this case is determined by our precedents.based on the facts found by the new jersey courts,respondent robert nicastro failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that it was constitutionally proper to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner mcintyre machinery,british manufacturer,a british firm that manufactures machines in great britain and sells them through an independent distributor in the united states american distributor.on that basis,i agree with the plurality that the contrary judgment of the supreme court of new jersey should be reversed.
in asserting jurisdiction over the british manufacturer,the supreme court of new jersey relied most heavily on three primary facts as providing constitutionally sufficient contacts with new jersey,thereby making it fundamentally fair to hale the british manufacturer before its courts the american distributor on one occasion sold and shipped one machine to a new jersey customer,namely,nicastro employer,curcio the british manufacturer permitted,indeed wanted,its independent american distributor to sell its machines to anyone in america willing to buy them and representatives of the british manufacturer attended trade shows in such cities as chicago,las vegas,new orleans,orlando,san diego,and san francisco.at,at.in my view,these facts do not provide contacts between the british firm and the state of new jersey constitutionally sufficient to support new jersey assertion of jurisdiction in this case.
none of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale,even if accompanied by the kind of sales effort indicated here,is sufficient.rather,this court previous holdings suggest the contrary.the court has held that a single sale to a customer who takes an product to a different state where the accident takes place is not a sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction.see volkswagen woodson.and the court,in separate opinions,has strongly suggested that a single sale of a product in a state does not constitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over an defendant,even if that defendant places his goods in the stream of commerce,fully aware and hoping that such a sale will take place.see asahi metal industry superior court of,solano,opinion of,requiring something more than simply placing a product into the stream of commerce,even if defendant is awar e that the stream may or will sweep the product into the forum state at brennan,concurring in part and concurring in judgment jurisdiction should lie where a sale in a state is part of the regular and anticipated flow of commerce into the state,but not where that sale is only an edd y,an isolated occurrence,at stevens,concurring in part and concurring in judgment indicating that the volume,the value,and the hazardous character of a good may affect the jurisdictional inquiry and emphasizing asahi regular course of dealing 
here,the relevant facts found by the new jersey supreme court show no regular flow or regular course of sales in new jersey and there is no something more,such as special design,advertising,advice,marketing,or anything else.nicastro,who here bears the burden of proving jurisdiction,has shown no specific effort by the british manufacturer to sell in new jersey.he has introduced no list of potential new jersey customers who might,for example,have regularly attended trade shows.and he has not otherwise shown that the british manufacturer purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within new jersey,or that it its goods in the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by new jersey users.volkswagen,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.
there may well have been other facts that nicastro could have demonstrated in support of jurisdiction.and the dissent considers some of those facts.see post,at opinion of ginsburg,describing the size and scope of new jersey business.but the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction,and here i would take the facts precisely as the new jersey supreme court stated them.insurance of ireland compagnie des bauxites de guinee,blakey continental airlines,see,at,at app.to pet.for cert.trial court reasoning and finding s 
accordingly,on the record present here,resolving this case requires no more than adhering to our precedents.
i would not go further.because the incident at issue in this case does not implicate modern concerns,and because the factual record leaves many open questions,this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.
the plurality seems to state strict rules that limit jurisdiction where a defendant does not inten d to submit to the power of a sovereign and can not be said to have targeted the forum.ante,at.but what do those standards mean when a company targets the world by selling products from its web site and does it matter if,instead of shipping the products directly,a company consigns the products through an intermediary say,who then receives and fulfills the orders and what if the company markets its products through popup advertisements that it knows will be viewed in a forum those issues have serious commercial consequences but are totally absent in this case.
but though i do not agree with the plurality seemingly strict rule,i am not persuaded by the absolute approach adopted by the new jersey supreme court and urged by respondent and his amici.under that view,a producer is subject to jurisdiction for a action so long as it knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.at,at emphasis added.in the context of this case,i can not agree.
for one thing,to adopt this view would abandon the heretofore accepted inquiry of whether,focusing upon the relationship between the defendant,the forum,and the litigation,it is fair,in light of the defendant contacts with that forum,to subject the defendant to suit there.shaffer heitner,emphasis added.it would ordinarily rest jurisdiction instead upon no more than the occurrence of a accident in the forum state.but this court has rejected the notion that a defendant amenability to suit travel s with the chattel.volkswagen,at.
for another,i can not reconcile so automatic a rule with the constitutional demand for minimum contacts and purposefu l avail ment,each of which rest upon a particular notion of fairness,at,internal quotation marks omitted.a rule like the new jersey supreme court would permit every state to assert jurisdiction in a suit against any domestic manufacturer who sells its products made anywhere in the united states to a national distributor,no matter how large or small the manufacturer,no matter how distant the forum,and no matter how few the number of items that end up in the particular forum at issue.what might appear fair in the case of a large manufacturer which specifically seeks,or expects,an distributor to sell its product in a distant state might seem unfair in the case of a small manufacturer say,an appalachian potter who sells his product cups and saucers exclusively to a large distributor,who resells a single item a coffee mug to a buyer from a distant state hawaii.i know too little about the range of these or possibilities to abandon in favor of the more absolute rule what has previously been this court less absolute approach.
further,the fact that the defendant is a foreign,rather than a domestic,manufacturer makes the basic fairness of an absolute rule yet more uncertain.i am again less certain than is the new jersey supreme court that the nature of international commerce has changed so significantly as to require a new approach to personal jurisdiction.
it may be that a larger firm can readily alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,passing the expected costs on to customers,or,if the risks are too great,severing its connection with the state.volkswagen,supra,at.but manufacturers come in many shapes and sizes.it may be fundamentally unfair to require a small egyptian shirt maker,a brazilian manufacturing cooperative,or a kenyan coffee farmer,selling its products through international distributors,to respond to tort suits in virtually every state in the united states,even those in respect to which the foreign firm has no connection at all but the sale of a single allegedly defective good.and a rule like the new jersey supreme court suggests would require every product manufacturer,large or small,selling to american distributors to understand not only the tort law of every state,but also the wide variance in the way courts within different states apply that law.see,of justice,bureau of justice statistics bulletin,tort trials and verdicts in large counties,reporting percentage of plaintiff winners in tort trials among populous counties,ranging from worcester,to milwaukee.
at a minimum,i would not work such a change to the law in the way either the plurality or the new jersey supreme court suggests without a better understanding of the relevant contemporary commercial circumstances.insofar as such considerations are relevant to any change in present law,they might be presented in a case unlike the present one in which the solicitor general participates.tr.of oral arg.in goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,government declining invitation at oral argument to give its views with respect to issues in this case.
this case presents no such occasion,and so i again that i would adhere strictly to our precedents and the limited facts found by the new jersey supreme court.and on those grounds,i do not think we can find jurisdiction in this case.accordingly,though i agree with the plurality as to the outcome of this case,i concur only in the judgment of that opinion and not its reasoning.

mcintyre uk representatives attended every isri convention from through,at.these annual expositions were held in diverse venues across the united states in addition to las vegas,conventions were held in new orleans,orlando,san antonio,and san francisco.ibid.mcintyre uk president,michael pownall,regularly attended isri.ibid.he attended isri las vegas convention the year csm owner first learned of,and saw,the shear,at.mcintyre uk exhibited its products at isri trade shows,the company acknowledged,hoping to reach anyone interested in the machine from anywhere in the united states.at.
although mcintyre uk sales figures are not in the record,it appears that for several years in the,earnings from sales of mcintyre uk products in the united states ha d been good in comparison to the rest of the world.at letter from sally johnson,mcintyre uk managing director,to gary and mary gaither,officers of mcintyre uk exclusive distributor in the united states.in response to interrogatories,mcintyre uk stated that its commissioning engineer had installed the company equipment in several states illinois,iowa,kentucky,virginia,and washington,at.
from at least until,mcintyre uk retained an company,mcintyre machinery america,mcintyre america,as its exclusive distributor for the united states.nicastro mcintyre machinery america,super,app.though similarly named,the two companies were separate and independent entities with no commonality of ownership or management.at,at.in invoices and other written communications,mcintyre america described itself as mcintyre uk national distributor,america link to quality metal processing equipment from england.app.
in a november,letter to mcintyre america,mcintyre uk president spoke plainly about the manufacturer objective in authorizing the exclusive distributorship all we wish to do is sell our products in the united states and get paid at.notably,mcintyre america was concerned about litigation involving mcintyre uk products,in which the distributor had been named as a defendant.mcintyre uk counseled mcintyre america to respond personally to the litigation,but reassured its distributor that the product was built and designed by mcintyre machinery in the uk and the buck stops here if there something wrong with the machine.at.answering jurisdictional interrogatories,mcintyre uk stated that it had been named as a defendant in lawsuits in illinois,kentucky,massachusetts,and west virginia,at.and in correspondence with mcintyre america,mcintyre uk noted that the manufacturer had products liability insurance coverage,at.
over the years,mcintyre america distributed several mcintyre uk products to customers,including,in addition to the shear,mcintyre uk niagara and tardis systems,wire strippers,and can machines,at.in promoting mcintyre uk products at conventions and demonstration sites and in trade journal advertisements,mcintyre america looked to mcintyre uk for direction and guidance.ibid.to achieve mcintyre uk objective,to sell its machines to customers throughout the united states,at,at,the two companies were acting closely in concert with each other,ibid.mcintyre uk never instructed its distributor to avoid certain states or regions of the country rather,as just noted,the manufacturer engaged mcintyre america to attract customers from anywhere in the united states.app.
in sum,mcintyre uk regular attendance and exhibitions at isri conventions was surely a purposeful step to reach customers for its products anywhere in the united states.at least as purposeful was mcintyre uk engagement of mcintyre america as the conduit for sales of mcintyre uk machines to buyers throughout the united states.given mcintyre uk endeavors to reach and profit from the united states market as a whole,nicastro suit,i would hold,has been brought in a forum entirely appropriate for the adjudication of his claim.he alleges that mcintyre uk shear machine was defectively designed or manufactured and,as a result,caused injury to him at his workplace.the machine arrived in nicastro new jersey workplace not randomly or fortuitously,but as a result of the connections and distribution system that mcintyre uk deliberately arranged on what sensible view of the allocation of adjudicatory authority could the place of nicastro injury within the united states be deemed off limits for his products liability claim against a foreign manufacturer who targeted the united states including all the states that constitute the nation as the territory it sought to develop 
a few points on which there should be no genuine debate bear statement at the outset.first,all agree,uk surely is not subject to general jurisdiction in new jersey courts,for that corporation is hardly at home in new jersey.see goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,post,at.the question,rather,is one of specific jurisdiction,which turns on an affiliatio n between the forum and the underlying controversy.goodyear dunlop,post,at quoting von mehren trautman,jurisdiction to adjudicate a suggested analysis,harv,hereinafter von mehren trautman internal quotation marks omitted see also goodyear dunlop,post,at.
second,no issue of the fair and reasonable allocation of adjudicatory authority among states of the united states is present in this case.new jersey exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign manufacturer whose dangerous product caused a workplace injury in new jersey does not tread on the domain,or diminish the sovereignty,of any sister state.indeed,among states of the united states,the state in which the injury occurred would seem most suitable for litigation of a products liability tort claim.see volkswagen woodson,if a manufacturer or distributor endeavors to develop a market for a product in several states,it is reasonable to subject it to suit in one of those states if its allegedly defective product has there been the source of injury a b in suits,whether resting on diversity or jurisdiction,venue is proper in the judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred 
third,the constitutional limits on a state court adjudicatory authority derive from considerations of due process,not state sovereignty.as the court clarified in insurance of ireland compagnie des bauxites de guinee,
the restriction on state sovereign power described in volkswagen must be seen as ultimately a function of the individual liberty interest preserved by the due process clause.that clause is the only source of the personal jurisdiction requirement and the clause itself makes no mention of federalism concerns.furthermore,if the federalism concept operated as an independent restriction on the sovereign power of the court,it would not be possible to waive the personal jurisdiction requirement individual actions can not change the powers of sovereignty,although the individual can subject himself to powers from which he may otherwise be protected.at.
see also shaffer heitner,and recognizing that the mutually exclusive sovereignty of the states is not the central concern of the inquiry into personal jurisdiction but see ante,at plurality opinion asserting that sovereign authority,not fairness,is the central concept in determining personal jurisdiction.
finally,in international shoe itself,and decisions thereafter,the court has made plain that legal fictions,notably presence and implied consent,should be discarded,for they conceal the actual bases on which jurisdiction rests.see,at,hutchinson chase gilbert,hand,nothing is gained by resort to words that concea l what we do t he relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation determines whether due process permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant,shaffer,at,and fictions of implied consent or corporate presence do not advance the proper inquiry,at.see also burnham superior court of,county of marin,plurality opinion international shoe cast aside fictions of consent and presence 
whatever the state of academic debate over the role of consent in modern jurisdictional doctrines the plurality notion that consent is the animating concept draws no support from controlling decisions of this court.quite the contrary,the court has explained,a forum can exercise jurisdiction when its contacts with the controversy are sufficient invocation of a fictitious consent,the court has repeatedly said,is unnecessary and unhelpful.see,burger king rudzewicz,due process clause permits forum to assert specific jurisdiction over an defendant who has not consented to suit there mcgee international life,t his court has abandoned consent,doing business,and presence as the standard for measuring the extent of state judicial power over corporations.
this case is illustrative of marketing arrangements for sales in the united states common in today commercial world a manufacturer engages a company to promote and distribute the manufacturer products,not in any particular state,but anywhere and everywhere in the united states the distributor can attract purchasers.the product proves defective and injures a user in the state where the user lives or works.often,as here,the manufacturer will have liability insurance covering personal injuries caused by its products.see cupp,redesigning successor liability,noting the ready availability of products liability insurance for manufacturers and citing a study showing,between and,such insurance cost manufacturers,on average,only sixteen cents for each of product sales app.
when industrial accidents happen,a statute in the state where the injury occurs generally permits assertion of jurisdiction,upon giving proper notice,over the foreign manufacturer.for example,the state statute might provide,as does new york statute,for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over any who 
commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state,if he expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state and derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce.civ.prac.law ann.a ii west 
or,the state might simply provide,as new jersey does,for the exercise of jurisdiction consistent with due process of law.rule b 
the modern approach to jurisdiction over corporations and other legal entities,ushered in by international shoe,gave prime place to reason and fairness.is it not fair and reasonable,given the mode of trading of which this case is an example,to require the international seller to defend at the place its products cause injury do not litigational and considerations point in that direction on what measure of reason and fairness can it be considered undue to require mcintyre uk to defend in new jersey as an incident of its efforts to develop a market for its industrial machines anywhere and everywhere in the united states is not the burden on mcintyre uk to defend in new jersey fair,a reasonable cost of transacting business internationally,in comparison to the burden on nicastro to go to nottingham,england to gain recompense for an injury he sustained using mcintyre product at his workplace in saddle brook,new jersey 
mcintyre uk dealt with the united states as a single market.like most foreign manufacturers,it was concerned not with the prospect of suit in state x as opposed to state y,but rather with its subjection to suit anywhere in the united states.see hay,judicial jurisdiction over corporate defendants comments on recent case law,hereinafter hay.as a mcintyre uk officer wrote in an to mcintyre america american law who needs it app.dated april,from sally johnson to mary gaither.if mcintyre uk is answerable in the united states at all,is it not perfectly appropriate to permit the exercise of that jurisdiction at the place of injury see hay degnan kane,the exercise of jurisdiction over and enforcement of judgments against alien defendants,hastings,noting that i n the international order,the state that counts is the united states,not its component states and that the fair place of suit within the united states is essentially a question of venue.
in sum,mcintyre uk,by engaging mcintyre america to promote and sell its machines in the united states,purposefully availed itself of the united states market nationwide,not a market in a single state or a discrete collection of states.mcintyre uk thereby availed itself of the market of all states in which its products were sold by its exclusive distributor.th e purposeful availment requirement,this court has explained,simply ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts.burger king,at.adjudicatory authority is appropriately exercised where actions by the defendant himself give rise to the affiliation with the forum.ibid.how could mcintyre uk not have intended,by its actions targeting a national market,to sell products in the fourth largest destination for imports among all states of the united states and the largest scrap metal market see supra,at.but see ante,at plurality opinion manufacturer purposeful efforts to sell its products nationwide are not relevant to the personal jurisdiction inquiry.
courts,both state and federal,confronting facts similar to those here,have rightly rejected the conclusion that a manufacturer selling its products across the usa may evade jurisdiction in any and all states,including the state where its defective product is distributed and causes injury.they have held,instead,that it would undermine principles of fundamental fairness to insulate the foreign manufacturer from accountability in court at the place within the united states where the manufacturer products caused injury.see,tobin astra pharmaceutical,uberti leonardo,
while this court has not considered in any prior case the pattern presented here a manufacturer enlisting a distributor to a market in the united states for the manufacturer products none of the court decisions tug against the judgment made by the new jersey supreme court.mcintyre contends otherwise,citing volkswagen,and asahi metal industry superior court of,solano.
volkswagen concerned a new york car dealership that sold solely in the new york market,and a new york distributor who supplied retailers in three states only new york,connecticut,and new jersey,at.new york residents had purchased an audi from the new york dealer and were driving the new vehicle through oklahoma en route to arizona.on the road in oklahoma,another car struck the audi in the rear,causing a fire which severely burned the audi occupants,at.rejecting the oklahoma courts assertion of jurisdiction over the new york dealer and distributor,this court observed that the defendants had done nothing to serve the market for cars in oklahoma,at.jurisdiction,the court held,could not be based on the customer unilateral act of driving the vehicle to oklahoma,at see asahi,at opinion of,volkswagen rejected the assertion that a consumer unilateral act of bringing the defendant product into the forum state was a sufficient constitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over the defendant 
notably,the foreign manufacturer of the audi in volkswagen did not object to the jurisdiction of the oklahoma courts and the importer abandoned its initially stated objection,at,and.and most relevant here,the court opinion indicates that an objection to jurisdiction by the manufacturer or national distributor would have been unavailing.to reiterate,the court said in volkswagen that,when a manufacturer or distributor aims to sell its product to customers in several states,it is reasonable to subject it to suit in any one of those states if its allegedly defective product has there been the source of injury.at.
asahi arose out of a motorcycle accident in california.plaintiff,a california resident injured in the accident,sued the taiwanese manufacturer of the motorcycle tire tubes,claiming that defects in its product caused the accident.the tube manufacturer against asahi,the japanese maker of the valve assembly,and asahi contested the california courts jurisdiction.by the time the case reached this court,the injured plaintiff had settled his case and only the indemnity claim by the taiwanese company against the japanese manufacturer remained.
the decision was not a close call.the court had before it a foreign plaintiff,the taiwanese manufacturer,and a foreign defendant,the japanese maker,and the indemnification dispute concerned a transaction between those parties that occurred abroad.all agreed on the bottom line the japanese manufacturer was not reasonably brought into the california courts to litigate a dispute with another foreign party over a transaction that took place outside the united states.
given the confines of the controversy,the dueling opinions of justice brennan and justice were hardly necessary.how the court would have estimate d the inconveniences,see international shoe,at internal quotation marks omitted,had the injured californian originally sued asahi is a debatable question.would this court have given the same weight to the burdens on the foreign defendant had those been counterbalanced by the burdens litigating in japan imposed on the local california plaintiff calder jones,a plaintiff contacts with the forum may be so manifold as to permit jurisdiction when it would not exist in their absence 
in any event,asahi,unlike mcintyre uk,did not itself seek out customers in the united states,it engaged no distributor to promote its wares here,it appeared at no tradeshows in the united states,and,of course,it had no web site advertising its products to the world.moreover,asahi was a manufacturer with little control over the final destination of its products once they were delivered into the stream of commerce.uberti,at,at.it was important to the court in asahi that those who use asahi components in their final products,and sell those products in california,would be subject to the application of california tort law.at majority opinion.to hold that asahi controls this case would,to put it bluntly,be dead wrong 
the court judgment also puts united states plaintiffs at a disadvantage in comparison to similarly situated complainants elsewhere in the world.of particular note,within the european union,in which the united kingdom is a participant,the jurisdiction new jersey would have exercised is not at all exceptional.the european regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments provides for the exercise of specific jurisdiction in matters relating to tort in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.council reg,the european court of justice has interpreted this prescription to authorize jurisdiction either where the harmful act occurred or at the place of injury.see handelskwekerij bier mines de potasse,
the commentators who gave names to what we now call general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction anticipated that when the latter achieves its full growth,considerations of litigational convenience and the respective situations of the parties would determine when it is appropriate to subject a defendant to trial in the plaintiff community.see von mehren trautman.litigational considerations include the convenience of witnesses and the ease of ascertaining the governing law.at.as to the parties,courts would differently appraise two situations cases involving a substantially local plaintiff,like nicastro,injured by the activity of a defendant engaged in interstate or international trade and cases in which the defendant is a natural or legal person whose economic activities and legal involvements are largely,entities without designs to gain substantial revenue from sales in distant markets.see,at as the attached appendix of illustrative cases indicates,courts presented with von mehren and trautman first scenario a local plaintiff injured by the activity of a manufacturer seeking to exploit a multistate or global market have repeatedly confirmed that jurisdiction is appropriately exercised by courts of the place where the product was sold and caused injury.
for the reasons stated,i would hold mcintyre uk answerable in new jersey for the harm nicastro suffered at his workplace in that state using mcintyre uk shearing machine.while i dissent from the court judgment,i take heart that the plurality opinion does not speak for the court,for that opinion would take a giant step away from the notions of fair play and substantial justice underlying international shoe,at internal quotation marks omitted.
illustrative cases upholding exercise of personal jurisdiction over an alien or corporation that,through a distributor,targeted a national market,including any and all states 
clune alimak ab,action against the swedish manufacturer of a construction hoist that allegedly caused a workplace death in missouri holding the manufacturer amenable to suit in missouri,the eighth circuit stated although we can imagine a case where a foreign manufacturer selects discrete regional distributors for the purpose of penetrating the markets in some states to the exclusion of others,that situation is not before us.in this case,the foreign manufacturer had successfully employ ed one or two distributors to cover the entire united states,intend ing to reap the benefit of sales in every state where those distributors market.were the court to conclude that the manufacturer did not intend its products to flow into missouri,the court would be bound to the conclusion that the manufacturer did not intend its products to flow into any of the united states.
kernan,products liability action against the japanese manufacturer of an allegedly defective stamping press that caused a workplace injury in new york holding the manufacturer amenable to suit in new york,the second circuit stated that an exclusive sales rights agreement between the japanese manufacturer and a pennsylvania distributor contemplates that the distributor will sell the manufacturer machines in north america and throughout the world,serv ing as evidence of the manufacturer attempt to serve the new york market,albeit indirectly

tobin astra pharmaceutical,products liability action against the dutch pharmaceutical manufacturer of a drug alleged to have caused kentucky resident heart disease holding the manufacturer amenable to suit in kentucky,the sixth circuit reasoned defendant argues that it has done nothing in particular to purposefully avail itself of the kentucky market as distinguished from any other state in the union.if we were to accept defendant argument on this point,a foreign manufacturer could insulate itself from liability in each of the fifty states simply by using an independent national distributor to market its products.
