in a kansas highway patrol khp trooper stopped a car along a highway in kansas and discovered cocaine and other evidence after one of the defendants in the car,michael webster,consented to a search.both defendants were arrested,eventually made inculpatory statements,and were indicted.after a hearing,the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,issued an order suppressing both the physical evidence seized during the car search and the defendants statements on the grounds that the trooper had illegally stopped the car,the subsequent consent to search the car was tainted by the illegal stop,the defendants were not properly informed of their rights under miranda arizona,d,and neither defendant waived those rights.
relying principally on a videotape recording of the encounter,the government appeals from the district court order,arguing that the defendants car was never seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment and,alternatively,that the subsequent consent to search was untainted by the initial seizure.it also maintains that the miranda warnings given to the defendants were valid.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
factual background 
the following facts are taken from the district court findings of fact and the record developed during the suppression hearing,including the videotape and audiotape recordings that were introduced as evidence.
the mvr equipment 
in june,khp trooper david stahl stopped a car driven by webster,with defendant michael murphy as a passenger.much but not all of the episode was recorded by a mobile recording mvr unit installed between the front windshield and dashboard of trooper stahl patrol car mvr units continuously capture and record footage to a dvd whenever a recording is started.there are various ways to start a recording activation of the patrol car emergency lights or emergency siren,activation of the trooper wireless microphone,or a collision involving the patrol car.mvr units are configured also to provide automatic recording,so that whenever an even t happens,the footage actually recorded to the dvd will include what happened for approximately thirty seconds before the event that triggered the automatic recording.although a trooper can stop the mvr recording by turning off the patrol car emergency lights,sirens,and wireless microphone,the parties agree that a trooper can also manually stop the mvr recording function while leaving the patrol car emergency lights on.
the seizure and search of the car 
on the day of the stop,trooper stahl put ruse drug checkpoint signs on the eastbound side of interstate i in kansas,so that they were visible to cars approaching exit the exit.he then parked his patrol car in a turnaround lane connecting i eastbound and westbound lanes.from this position,stahl could see the eastbound traffic approaching the exit through his rearview mirror.
during the suppression hearing,trooper stahl provided contradictory testimony about what he did after pulling into the turnaround lane.he first testified that he turned his back lights on so that traffic coming along,when they see the signs,they see my lights up ahead emphasis added.he later testified that he turned on his front emergency lights as he pulled into the turnaround.in any event,the dvd from the mvr unit in stahl patrol car contains a second segment that was automatically recorded because stahl activated his emergency lights after pulling into the turnaround.stahl explained that he manually turned off the mvr unit after activating his emergency lights to avoid wasting film while he waited in the turnaround.
shortly after parking in the turnaround,trooper stahl saw the defendants car slow as it approached the ruse signs traveling eastbound,exit i by the eastbound exit ramp,and then turn and begin driving up the opposite,westbound entrance ramp to the highway.stahl followed the defendants car onto the westbound ramp,at which point the car stopped on the side of the ramp.
precisely why the defendants car stopped when it did remains the subject of heated dispute.webster testified that he stopped the car because he noticed the lights on the patrol car front grill e were flashing,and he believe d the lights on the top of the vehicle were flashing.in contrast,trooper stahl testified that webster stopped voluntarily and that the patrol car rear emergency lights which would not have been visible to webster,rather than its front emergency lights,were activated.
during the roughly fifteen minutes after the car stopped,trooper stahl asked the defendants for proof of identification and other documents and asked the khp to conduct record checks of the defendants,which revealed that over pounds of marijuana were seized nine months earlier from a car in which murphy was a passenger.in addition,according to stahl,webster appeared tense and nervous throughout the stop.stahl also smelled fresh possible sign,he testified,that the car had recently been modified to conceal drugs.moreover,murphy provided contradictory information regarding the defendants travel route,variously suggesting that they had traveled from los angeles and from las vegas.
the videotape recording of the stop,which we have reviewed,begins with the defendants car,a honda,already stopped on the entrance ramp,and trooper stahl patrol car parked behind it.reflections of white flashing lights are visible in the rear bumper of the honda.stahl is seated in the patrol car,apparently awaiting the khp record checks,while the defendants remain in the honda.while waiting,stahl recorded an audio narrative of the events leading to that point,during which he clearly states that he s topped this vehicle at i.stahl testified that he initiated this recording by activating the mvr with his belt microphone when he returned to his patrol car after obtaining the defendants identification and other papers 
after the record checks were completed,trooper stahl walked to the passenger side of the honda,returned the defendants papers,placed his hands on the car door,and told webster that he was just going to give him a warning on the failure to signal.webster asked stahl about getting gasoline,and stahl answered that a gasoline station was miles away.stahl then took one step away from the honda and began to turn toward his patrol car but,after not more than two seconds,he leaned back into the honda and asked the defendants if they would mind answering a few other questions,explaining that there had been a lot of problems with illegal narcotics in the area.the defendants denied having drugs,but webster consented to a search of the honda.
we note that on the videotape,trooper stahl remained standing by the car door from the time he approached the honda to return the defendants paperwork until he obtained webster consent for the search.throughout,he kept his hands on the door except for the second or so when he turned toward the patrol car.at the hearing,stahl called his maneuver the kansas two step,which,consistent with the videotape depiction of what occurred,he described as follows you break contact,give them their information back,tell them they are free to leave and then immediately come back to continue questioning them.he explained that troopers are trained to break contact with the car momentarily b ecause by law drivers have to feel free to leave to give consent to search.
after obtaining webster consent,trooper stahl asked the defendants to get out of the honda.stahl and another officer,who had by then joined him,quickly found a false compartment in the trunk.the defendants were arrested and forced to sit on the side of the entrance ramp near the front of the honda they waited there,handcuffed,while the officers continued their search of the compartment,which eventually yielded kilograms of cocaine,multiple cellular phones,and other evidence.
the miranda warnings 
approximately minutes after placing the defendants under arrest,trooper stahl gave them the following warnings 
okay,just so you guys understand,you have the right to remain silent,anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.you have the right to an attorney,if you can not afford an attorney one will be presented for you by the court.you can decide at anytime to give up these rights,and not talk to us,okay.you understand that 
murphy responded i understand and,when asked if he was willing to talk,said that stahl could go ahead and ask me a question,if i can answer it i will.webster,by contrast,never indicated that he understood or even heard stahl warnings.nonetheless,both defendants responded to stahl subsequent questions by denying knowledge of the compartment or the cocaine.both defendants later made additional statements to a different officer after they were transported to a police station 
procedural history 
the defendants were charged with conspiring to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine,in violation of a and b a.before trial,they moved to suppress the cocaine as well as the statements they made to the police.they argued that their car was unlawfully stopped without cause,their consent to the car search was involuntary because it was tainted by the prior unlawful stop,and trooper stahl miranda warnings were improper and invalid.
after a suppression hearing,the district court granted the motions to suppress.first,it found that the honda was seized when trooper stahl activated his front top emergency lights and webster pulled over in response to those lights.united states murphy,d,second,it refused to credit stahl testimony that he had observed the honda commit a traffic violation,and it ultimately concluded that the government had offered no objectively reasonable basis to justify the stop.id.at.third,it found that the defendants subsequent consent to search remained tainted by the initial unlawful seizure.id.at.as for the statements,the district court concluded that neither defendant had knowingly waived his miranda rights.id.at.
the government appealed.
discussion 
in evaluating the grant of a motion to suppress evidence,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.united states awadallah,cir quotation marks omitted.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.when,as here,credibility determinations are at issue,we give particularly strong deference to a district court finding.united states iodice,cir citations,quotation marks,and alteration omitted.where a defendant motion to suppress is granted,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant.see awadallah,at see also united states moore,cir the record should be viewed in the light most favorable to the government only w hen reviewing a district court decision in the government favor on a motion to suppress emphasis added.
with these general principles of review in mind,we conclude that the district court finding that trooper stahl stopped and thereby seized the honda was not clearly erroneous,the taint of the unlawful seizure had not dissipated at the time webster consented to the search of the car,and the district court did not err in concluding that neither defendant waived his miranda rights.
a.the unlawful seizure of the honda 
the government submits that the district court erred in finding that trooper stahl stopped and therefore seized the honda when he activated his front top emergency lights.both sides rely on evidence in the form of the mvr videotape recordings,as well as testimony or affidavits from webster,stahl,and others.
during the suppression hearing,trooper stahl testified,and the government argued,that he pulled out of the turnaround to intercept the defendants car because he observed it exit without signaling,in violation of a kansas law that requires drivers to signal within a hundred feet of a lane change or turn.webster testified,however,that he signaled as he approached the exit.the district court resolved this factual dispute in favor of the defendants,finding stahl testimony incredible in light of the overwhelming physical evidence demonstrating that trooper stahl could not have actually observed webster fail to signal.murphy,d at.the government has not pursued this argument on appeal,and we are left to accept that stahl had no legal basis to conduct a traffic stop.
instead,on appeal,the government contends that trooper stahl did not actually conduct a traffic stop and that the defendants car stopped voluntarily,without prompting from the patrol car.although the mvr did not capture the moment the honda actually stopped,based on our review of the record evidence we can not say that the district court clearly erred in finding that stahl conducted an unjustified traffic stop of the honda by activating the patrol car front top emergency lights.indeed,we would be hard pressed to do so given webster testimony,which the district court credited,that stahl flashing lights forced him to stop the honda,the videotape confirming the reflection of white flashing lights on the honda rear bumper shortly after it pulled over,stahl testimony that his patrol car front emergency lights caused the reflection,and stahl descriptions of the encounter as a traffic stop in his audio narrative and related paperwork.w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.bennett united states,cir quoting anderson bessemer city,d.
the district court made its factual findings after hearing from all the witnesses and making credibility determinations.the government argues that we can nevertheless find clear error because it is physically impossible,given the video recording,for events to have transpired as the district court found.more specifically,the government contends that it is impossible for the patrol car front emergency lights to have been activated without also activating the mvr feature and generating footage of the honda in motion,or causing visible red and blue reflections from the patrol car top emergency lights to be visible in either the patrol car windshield wipers or hood.it argues that the absence of any footage of the honda in motion or red and blue reflections on the windshield wiper or hood demonstrates that the front emergency lights were off.these arguments fail for two reasons.first,trooper stahl testified that khp troopers have the ability to turn off the mvr while leaving the patrol car emergency lights on,and that just before stopping the honda he had to turn it off to sit with my lights going without wasting film.if the patrol car front emergency lights were already on when he pulled out of the turnaround,the mvr recording feature would not have been activated prior to the stop see gov t app x at.second,the videotapes of the incident involving the honda,as well as other videotapes designed to show the reflective effect of activated patrol car emergency lights in various conditions and on various surfaces,are either inconclusive or squarely contradict the government argument,since several show no red or blue reflections even when a patrol car emergency lights are activated.given these ambiguities in the record,we reject the government contention that the videotape is conclusive.
accordingly,we discern no clear error in the district court factual findings regarding trooper stahl seizure of the defendants car,and we proceed on the understanding that the honda was unlawfully seized.
b.the taint of the unlawful seizure 
the government next argues that,even if the honda was unlawfully stopped,the physical evidence that the troopers found is admissible because webster consent to search constituted an intervening independent act of free will unconnected to the stop.we disagree.when consent to search is preceded by an unlawful government seizure,the evidence obtained from the search must ordinarily be suppressed unless the government shows both that the consent was voluntary and that the taint of the initial seizure has been dissipated.united states snype,cir quoting united states oguns,cir.t he question of whether
