plaintiff appellant natural resources defense council nrdc appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,granting summary judgment to defendants the food and drug administration fda,kathleen sebelius,and margaret hamburg collectively,the government.at issue is whether nrdc has standing under article iii of the constitution to bring this action to compel fda to finalize its regulation of triclosan and triclocarban,two chemicals used in antiseptic antimicrobial soap.
we hold that nrdc has presented evidence of standing sufficient to withstand summary judgment as to the regulation of triclosan,but not as to the regulation of triclocarban nrdc has presented sufficient evidence of standing as to triclosan because standing may be based on exposure to a potentially dangerous product,and nrdc evidence establishes that triclosan is potentially dangerous and that at least one of its members is frequently exposed to triclosancontaining soap.as to triclocarban,nrdc presented no evidence of members direct exposure but relied on evidence that the proliferation of triclocarban may contribute to the development of bacteria.this evidence does not establish an injury sufficiently particularized to satisfy the requirement of article iii standing.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
regulatory framework 
this case concerns fda regulation of otc topical antiseptic antimicrobial chemicals.under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,et ffdca,a new drug may not enter interstate commerce unless fda determines that it is generally recognized as safe and effective for the particular use described in its product labeling.see p defining a new drug as one that is not generally recognized,among experts as safe and effective for use under the conditions noted in the drug labeling id.a prohibiting a new drug from entering interstate commerce without fda approval.
triclosan and triclocarban are undisputedly drugs within the meaning of the ffdca.fda determination of triclosan and triclocarban status is pending as part of fda comprehensive over the counter drug review process otc drug review.commenced in,the otc drug review established fda monograph system for regulating drugs.see.may.while fda must generally approve drugs as individually,the monograph system allows manufacturers to bypass individualized review.see.under this system,fda issues a detailed regulation a monograph for each therapeutic class of otc drug products.like a recipe,each monograph sets out the active ingredients for a given therapeutic class of otc drugs and provides the conditions under which each active ingredient is.fda excludes from its monographs any active ingredients or uses of active ingredients that it has determined either not to be or for which there is insufficient data to confirm whether they are.manufacturers desiring to market otc drugs that are excluded from the monograph may not do so without obtaining individualized fda approval.
through the otc drug review,fda determines the status of each otc drug product and issues monographs for each category.according to fda evidence submitted to the district court,as of december,fda had published final rules through the otc drug review,including final monographs and amended final monographs.the monograph for topical antiseptic antimicrobial drugs,in which triclosan and triclocarban are to be included,has not yet been finalized.in the exercise of its enforcement discretion,however,fda permits drugs whose monograph is still pending under the otc review process to stay on the market,provided that fda has not determined that the drug is a potential health hazard.fda compliance policy guide.
over the course of the otc drug review,fda has issued two tentative final monographs for topical antiseptic antimicrobials,once in and again in,but has not finalized either monograph.see.june,ganley declaration.both tentative monographs would have excluded triclosan because fda had not determined that triclosan was for any use at the time it issued the tentative monographs.
ii.proceedings before the district court 
nrdc brings this action under the administrative procedure act,et apa,which authorizes those adversely affected or aggrieved by an agency inaction to file suit to compel an agency to take action unreasonably delayed,nrdc alleges that fda is unreasonably and unlawfully failing to regulate potentially dangerous substances,triclosan and triclocarban,and seeks to compel fda to finalize its regulation of triclosan and triclocarban by issuing the final monograph regulating topical antimicrobial drug products.
before the district court,nrdc moved for summary judgment on the merits,and the government for summary judgment on the ground that nrdc lacked standing.
nrdc evidence of standing 
as evidence of standing,nrdc submitted declarations executed by two of its members and documents discussing the risks posed by triclosan and triclocarban.
nrdc member declarations 
nrdc submitted the declarations of its members diana owens,a veterinary technician owens declaration,and megan schwarzman,a physician,describing their exposure to triclosan in their places of work.
in her declaration,diana owens avers that she is exposed to triclosan in her work as a veterinary technician at an animal clinic,where she has worked for nearly twenty years.as a necessary part of her work,she washes her hands more than fifty times in the course of a single work day.the soap that she uses is that provided by the clinic an antibacterial soap that contains triclosan.the clinic also uses dish soap that owens uses to clean animals food and water dishes,one of owens job duties.
owens avers that she has a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer and is concerned about the effects of triclosan.she also expresses general concern regarding triclosan potential to increase antibiotic resistance.owens has attempted to raise the issue of triclosan dangers with the clinic owner,who is responsible for providing the soap clinic employees use in their work and purchases the soap from the wholesale store,sam club.owens reports that she has discussed her concern about triclosan exposure with the clinic owner and with her coworkers,but to no avail t hey listen but because they do not really know about the health risks,nothing is done to limit our exposure.beyond these discussions,owens does not describe having taken further action to have the soaps changed at the clinic.she explains that she does not feel comfortable asking the clinic owner,who is her supervisor,to spend extra time looking at the labels on soap bottles or to spend more money to purchase natural products.she does not want to be the employee who is pushy and creates problems.
because we conclude,see discussion infra,that the owens declaration is sufficient to establish nrdc standing,we do not discuss the declaration of schwarzman.we observe,however,that while nrdc seeks to compel fda to finalize its regulation of both triclosan and triclocarban,its member declarations establish the members direct exposure only to triclosan nrdc submitted no evidence that any of its members is directly exposed to triclocarban,and instead relies on evidence that its members are injured by triclocarban potential,along with other antiseptic antimicrobial chemicals,to hasten the development of bacteria.
evidence of risks posed by triclosan and triclocarban 
nrdc principally relied on three documents to evidence the risks posed by triclosan and triclocarban an expert declaration by sarah janssen,janssen declaration,a letter from fda to representative edward markey,of the house subcommittee on energy and environment,regarding regulation of topical antiseptic drug products markey letter,and a consumer notice about triclosan posted by fda on its web site fda consumer notice.
janssen declaration 
sarah janssen,is a doctor,the author of scholarly articles and book chapters on the subject of chemicals,and an expert on effects of chemicals on human health.according to her declaration,triclosan is rapidly absorbed into the human bloodstream,which means that it bypass es liver metabolism,and therefore ha s a greater potential to cause toxicity to many organs in the body.the declaration primarily addresses triclosan association with endocrine disruption.janssen explains that triclosan is associated with a unique type of endocrine disruption.endocrine disruption can affect the reproductive system.in particular,recent studies on female rats show that triclosan interacts with estrogen to increase uterine weight at doses of triclosan that would not have an effect if not for the interaction with estrogen.this potential for triclosan to amplify hormone action raises concerns that triclosan may stimulate the growth of cancers.in addition,triclosan can lead to abnormal menstrual cycles in women and infertility in both women and men.moreover,even exposure to triclosan interferes with the activity of hormones essential to the normal growth and function of reproductive systems,and animal studies have shown low doses to interfere with sex hormone synthesis.
in addition to triclosan properties,janssen notes that older studies previously reviewed in the fda otc drug review linked triclosan with organ damage,brain and spleen changes,testicular damage,liver damage,and the blood disorder,methemoglobinemia.finally,janssen avers that n umerous studies have suggested that triclosan fosters antibiotic resistance in bacteria,and that a t least one study has associated triclocarban with promoting such resistance.
overall,janssen opines that u se of topical antimicrobial products containing triclosan and triclocarban contributes to individuals total body burden and may be both significant and harmful.she continues,the best available science indicates that exposures to triclosan and triclocarban,especially during critical periods of development,may harm human health.thus,i n janssen scientific opinion,delaying finalization of the antimicrobial antiseptics monograph will prolong exposures that may cause irretrievable medical injury to those exposed.
markey letter 
in the markey letter,fda states that it shares markey concern over the potential effects of triclosan and triclocarban as endocrine disruptors that have emerged since fda issued its most recent tentative final monograph in.the letter reports on studies in several different animal species including mammals,that suggest triclosan may interfere with the thyroid system and have other effects.fda thus concludes that existing data raise valid concerns about the effects of repetitive daily human exposure to these antiseptic ingredients.
the markey letter also acknowledges a lack of data regarding the effects of triclosan,including dermal application,reproductive and developmental toxicity,and its potential as an endocrine disruptor,and reports that a study of triclosan by the national center for toxological research is underway pursuant to fda request.
finally,regarding the concern that proliferation of antiseptic antimicrobial hand soaps will lead to the development of bacteria,fda reported that numerous laboratory studies suggest that it is relatively easy for bacteria to develop altered susceptibilities to both antiseptics and antibiotics in the laboratory setting,but that there was no definitive correlation between altered susceptibility to antibacterial active ingredients and antibiotics.based on the data,the fda concluded that the possibility that antiseptics contribute to changes in antibiotic susceptibility warrants further evaluation.
consistent with the markey letter,in a declaration submitted by fda,fda witness charles ganley,director of the office of drug evaluation and research iv at fda center for drug evaluation and research,attributes fda delay in issuing the final monograph for antiseptic antimicrobial chemicals to the need for further evaluation of concerns raised by new data,including that antiseptic active ingredients may act as endocrine disruptors,that antimicrobial products including triclosan and triclocarban may play a role in the development of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance,and that the proliferation of antimicrobial products raises concerns about the health effects of higher levels of exposure to these substances.
fda consumer notice 
similarly,the fda consumer notice informs consumers that fda does not have evidence that soap provides extra health benefits over soap and water.it acknowledges that a nimal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation,but cautions that data showing effects in animals do always predict effects in humans,and reassures consumers that triclosan is not currently known to be hazardous to humans.it advises consumers who may be concerned to wash with regular soap and water instead of soaps.
decision of the district court 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fda and dismissed the suit for lack of standing.assuming without deciding that exposure to triclosan was cognizable as an injury for standing purposes,the district court concluded that nrdc lacked standing because its members could avoid their workplace exposure to triclosan by purchasing soap for use at work.
discussion 
t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing derives from article iii,section of the constitution,which limits federal judicial power to cases and controversies.const.art.iii,lujan defenders of wildlife,d.to establish that a case or controversy exists so as to confer standing under article iii,a plaintiff must satisfy three elements a the plaintiff must suffer an injury in fact,b that injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action,and c the injury must be likely to be redressed by a favorable decision of the federal court.id.at alteration omitted.a membership organization like nrdc may assert the standing of its members if,among other requirements not at issue here,it establishes that at least one of its members has standing to sue individually.summers earth island,d.
we review de novo both a district court grant of summary judgment and its determination of standing.cacchillo insmed,cir schick berg,cir.a grant of summary judgment is proper only if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in considering the evidence,the court must resolve all ambiguities,and credit all factual inferences that could rationally be drawn,in favor of the party opposing summary judgment,brown henderson,cir quotation marks omitted,even if contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn,kaytor boat,cir.the party asserting jurisdiction,here nrdc,bears the burden of proof as to standing.lujan,at.to defend against summary judgment for lack of standing,a plaintiff must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts supporting standing,as is generally required under rule.id.internal quotation marks omitted.c.
this appeal requires us to determine whether nrdc has presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment for lack of standing as to triclosan and triclocarban.the inquiry as to triclosan concerns two elements of article iii standing the requirement and the requirement that the injury be fairly traceable to the challenged conduct.first,we must determine whether nrdc evidence establishes a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether at least one of its members exposure to triclosan at the workplace satisfies the requirement.at issue is whether exposure to triclosan constitutes an injury under article iii notwithstanding the scientific uncertainty as to whether triclosan is harmful to human health.we hold that nrdc evidence is sufficient to satisfy the requirement notwithstanding the scientific uncertainty as to triclosan harmfulness to humans.
we must next determine whether the injury of triclosan exposure is fairly traceable to the challenged action here,fda alleged delay in finalizing its regulation of topical antiseptic antimicrobial drugs.at issue is whether the potential avoidability of triclosan exposure at the workplace either by purchasing soap or by advocating with employers to supply soap renders the exposure so as to vitiate the causal link between fda alleged regulatory delay and nrdc members triclosan exposure.we hold that neither the availability of soap for purchase nor the possibility that nrdc members employers might be willing to supply soap prevents nrdc from establishing that the triclosan exposure is fairly traceable to fda alleged unreasonable delay in regulating triclosan.
the inquiry as to triclocarban requires us to determine whether the existence of a chemical that may contribute to the development of antimicrobial or bacteria satisfies the requirement.we hold that it does not.
since nrdc need only show that at least one of its members has standing to sue individually in order to establish representational standing,we focus exclusively on the declaration of diana owens because it is sufficient to satisfy this requirement as to triclosan.
injury in fact 
we begin by considering whether nrdc presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment as to whether at least one of its members workplace exposure to triclosan satisfies the requirement of article iii standing.nrdc argues that at least one of its members suffers an injury in fact because its evidence shows that its members are exposed to triclosan in the workplace and that triclosan may be dangerous to human health.the government responds principally that nrdc evidence is insufficient to establish an injury in fact because there is no evidence that triclosan actually harms human health and because nrdc has not produced quantitative evidence of the risk that triclosan may harm human health.
establishing injury in fact based on exposure to a potentially harmful product 
injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.here,the ffdca establishes an interest in the public being protected from products not proven to be safe and effective for their alleged uses.united states diapulse of,cir.owens declaration,which we accept as true,establishes that,in her work as a veterinary technician,she is frequently exposed to soap that contains triclosan a chemical that has not been proven to be safe and effective for use in soap.nrdc evidence shows that triclosan has properties and may cause cancer and other health problems.fda argues that this alleged injury is not sufficiently actual or imminent to satisfy article iii because there is scientific uncertainty as to whether triclosan is actually harmful to humans.
this court leading case on injury is baur veneman,cir.in baur,this court held that exposure to potentially harmful products may satisfy the requirement of article iii standing in the specific context of food and drug safety suits.id.at.this court explained that,in such cases,the relevant injury for standing purposes may be exposure to a sufficiently serious risk of medical harm not the anticipated medical harm itself.id.at.that is,the injury contemplated by exposure to a potentially harmful product is not the future harm that the exposure risks causing,but the present exposure to risk.
to establish injury in fact based on exposure to a potentially harmful product,a plaintiff must show a credible threat of harm due to that exposure.id.at.t he analysis is highly,and the risk of harm necessary to support standing can not be defined according to a universal standard.id.citation omitted.under baur,whether a plaintiff has established a credible threat of harm sufficient to confer standing based on exposure to a potentially harmful product is a qualitative inquiry in which the court should consider both the probability of harm and the severity of the potential harm.id.
exposure to triclosan as injury in fact 
there is no genuine dispute that triclosan is potentially harmful and that nrdc member owens is exposed to triclosan at her workplace whether nrdc has presented sufficient evidence regarding injury in fact thus turns on whether,under baur,nrdc has demonstrated a credible threat of harm due to owens triclosan exposure.under baur,to determine whether there is evidence of a credible threat of harm,we consider the probability of harm in relation to its severity.
as to the severity of the harm triclosan could cause,the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to nrdc,shows that triclosan has properties,easily absorbs into the human bloodstream,and may contribute to the growth of cancer.owens avers that she is at a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.there is also evidence that triclosan can disrupt thyroid regulation,and earlier fda studies cited concerns about liver damage.
regarding the probability of harm,owens declaration establishes that she washes her hands with soap more than fifty times in a typical workday.the evidence is silent,however,as to the precise likelihood that such frequent exposure to triclosan harms humans.in considering how this uncertainty as to triclosan harmfulness affects the standing inquiry,this court analysis in baur is instructive.in baur,plaintiff baur satisfied the requirement so as to withstand a motion to dismiss his suit challenging regulations that permitted beef from downed cattle to enter the food supply baur alleged that downed cattle were particularly likely to be infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse and that eating beef from cattle would put consumers at risk of contracting variant creutzfeldt jakob disease vcjd,a deadly and incurable disease transmissible to humans by cattle with bse.baur,at.baur alleged that he was a regular eater of beef and argued that he was injured for standing purposes because the presence in the market of beef from downed cattle put him at risk of eating beef and thereby contracting vcjd.
the baur court concluded that baur had established a credible threat of harm even though the likelihood that baur would contract vcjd by eating beef from a food supply that included beef from downed cattle was uncertain.id.at.baur did not allege that bse was present in the united states,nor did he quantify the risk that bse was present in the united states or allege that there was a particular likelihood that bse had entered the united states.moreover,even assuming bse had entered the united states,baur made no allegations as to the likelihood that he would consume beef from downed cattle.instead,baur alleged only that bse may be present in the united states and argued that,if it were,the government would be unable to detect it.id.at.
this court nonetheless concluded that baur had established a credible threat of harm sufficient to remove his claimed injury from the realm of speculation due to his exposure to a beef market that included beef from downed cattle.we reached this decision based primarily on baur allegations that a form of bse may already have been present in the united states,available testing methods did not adequately detect bse in downed cattle,and the challenged federal regulations allowed meat from downed cattle to enter the food stream.id.at.it was significant,too,that the government itself raised concerns about the inadequacy of the testing methods in place.see id.at.
considering nrdc evidence in light of the analysis in baur,we conclude that nrdc has established a credible threat notwithstanding the uncertainty as to triclosan harmfulness to humans.just as plaintiff baur was able to establish a credible threat based on allegations that bse may be present in the united states and that the challenged regulatory regime in place would be unable to detect it,nrdc evidence shows that triclosan may be harmful,that fda is unable to determine whether it is,and that fda failure to regulate allows triclosan to enter the market without its safety having been confirmed.moreover,just as in baur,the government own report confirmed the plaintiff concerns as to the inadequacy of testing methods.here,fda has stated that triclosan presents valid concerns,and fda has nominated triclosan for a toxicology study,including a study of its carcinogenicity.further,the record evidence shows that fda admits that it has insufficient data on triclosan health effects and that fda itself is concerned about the e
