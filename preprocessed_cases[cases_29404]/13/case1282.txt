angela spinelli and olinville arms,collectively spinelli appeal from a judgment of the district court richard casey,judge,granting summary judgment to city of new york and new york city police sergeant pasquale carabella collectively the city dismissing plaintiffs fourth amendment,due process,and tortious interference with business relations claims that were based on the city confiscation of spinelli firearms inventory and suspension of her dealer license.on appeal,spinelli argues that the existence of material issues of fact on the fourth amendment and due process claims preclude summary judgment,and that the district court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over her tortious interference claim.
we conclude that the district court properly dismissed spinelli fourth amendment claim because the city warrantless search of olinville arms was objectively reasonable and performed pursuant to established regulations.however,the city violated due process by denying spinelli constitutionally sufficient notice and the opportunity for a hearing.therefore,we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city on the due process claim,and remand to the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of spinelli and determine damages on that claim.we also remand for further consideration of plaintiffs tortious interference claim.
background 
olinville arms,olinville is a gun shop,shooting range,and travel agency located in bronx county,new york,owned and operated by angela spinelli.olinville license was issued by the new york city police department nypd license division the license division or the division.the license is conditioned upon compliance with regulations under title of the rules of the city of new york rules that require gun dealers to adhere to certain security restrictions and provide that the licensee premises and firearms shall be subject to inspection at all times by members of the police department.see rcny a.if a gun dealer fails to comply with the rules,the division may suspend or revoke the dealer license for good cause by the issuance of a notice of determination letter to the licensee,which shall state in brief the grounds for the suspension or revocation and notify the licensee of the opportunity for a hearing.rcny l.
in the wake of the september,terrorist attacks,the precinct of the nypd was tasked with providing enhanced security to sensitive locations within its boundaries,known as omega posts or omega watches.the omega post program extended through october,and olinville was an omega post.
on october,captain charles mcsherry,an officer from the precinct,entered olinville under the omega post program without a warrant or spinelli permission and searched the premises.the search revealed the security at olinville to be grossly inadequate.security issues included an unwatched counter area,a large hole in olinville backyard fence,and two unlocked safes.
on october,the license division advised spinelli by letter that,as a result of failure to provide adequate security for olinville,her dealer license was suspended.the letter directed spinelli to surrender all firearms pending the conclusion of the license division investigation,which would determine whether olinville license would be continued,suspended,or revoked.the letter told spinelli that sergeant michael kaplon was assigned to her case and provided kaplon contact number,but did not notify spinelli of the opportunity for a hearing,as required by the rules.see rcny f.officers from the precinct seized approximately weapons from olinville,many of which,according to spinelli,had already been sold to customers who later demanded a refund.
spinelli hired attorney john chambers,who had experience in gun licensing matters,to help retrieve her license and firearms.according to chief inspector benjamin petrofsky of the license division,a dealer license is normally suspended for the duration of the investigation.that the norm.instead of requesting a formal hearing,which chambers believed could take months to years to decide,chambers contacted members of the license division on an informal basis through negotiations and conversations that included letters to the division requesting the immediate return of spinelli property chambers also was imminently prepared to file a lawsuit against the police department to retrieve spinelli property.
after retaining chambers,spinelli received a second letter from the license division,dated october,that suspended olinville shooting range license pending investigation of the october incident report.chambers promptly met with the license division,and argued that there were no sufficient stay or security issues that he saw,the gun range.one day later,the shooting range license was reinstated.
on november,sergeant kaplon olinville,but found that there was nothing done to repair the deficiencies with the lack of security within the store.according to kaplon,olinville exhibited total disregard for the rules and regulations of maintaining a gun dealer license.on the same day,chambers sent a letter to the license division,informing the division of planned security improvements at olinville.these improvements were tailored to remedy mcsherry specific complaints,and they included assurances by spinelli that she would restore the fences in the backyard area,install video surveillance in the store,renovate olinville counter area,and build a large concrete room where her gun safes are housed.
on november,chief inspector petrofsky recommended the reinstatement of olinville license that,c onsidering olinville has been years,it was in the best interests of fairness to return spinelli property immediately and allow her thirty days to make the required security improvements.on november,license division deputy inspector thomas galati concurred in recommending the return of olinville license and firearms.on december,the division sent spinelli a letter advising her of the license reinstatement,thereby permitting her to reopen her gun shop.according to spinelli,defendants actions resulted in plaintiffs loss of approximately two months of sales and profits that included the unexplained time lag between the recommendation of license reinstatement on november and the official notice of reinstatement on december.
on november,spinelli filed the instant suit against the city pursuant to.spinelli alleged that defendants confiscation of plaintiffs licenses and weapons was illegal and violated plaintiffs due process and fourth amendment rights.specifically,spinelli alleged that defendants had violated due process by seizing olinville weapons and suspending its license without providing the required notice or hearing,and the fourth amendment by performing a search of olinville premises without probable cause or justification.spinelli also claimed that b y reason of their acts and omissions,defendants intentionally interfered with plaintiffs business relationships in violation of new york state law.
after both parties moved for summary judgment,the district court granted the city motion.first,the district court concluded that the city search of olinville premises,seizure of the firearms,and suspension of olinville license were reasonable due to the apparent security lapses at olinville,and therefore did not violate the fourth amendment,which prohibits only unreasonable seizures.
with respect to spinelli due process claim,the district court,citing sanitation recycling industry city of new york,cir,concluded that spinelli did not have a protectable property interest in her gun dealer license.the district court further determined that,in any event,spinelli had received all the process that was due through notice and an opportunity to be heard,despite,as the court noted,the absence of a formal hearing and the failure of the city letters to explain what rules and regulations olinville had violated.although the district court found that spinelli had a protected property interest in the seized firearms,it concluded that,under the balancing test articulated in mathews eldridge,d,there was no due process violation in light of the opportunity to be heard and exigent circumstances.finally,having dismissed spinelli constitutional claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over spinelli tortious interference state law claim 
spinelli appealed to this court.
discussion 
legal standards 
on appeal,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.golden pac.bancorp fdic,cir.the district court may grant summary judgment only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
this standard requires that courts resolve all ambiguities,and credit all factual inferences that could rationally be drawn,in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.brown henderson,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.once the moving party demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact,the nonmoving party must come forth with evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find in its favor.id.at internal citation omitted.thus,a nonmoving party can defeat a summary judgment motion only by coming forward with evidence that would be sufficient,if all reasonable inferences were drawn in its favor,to establish the existence of an element at trial.grain traders,citibank,cir citing celotex catrett,d and.c.
ii.the fourth amendment claim 
first,spinelli claims that the october warrantless search of olinville premises by captain mcsherry violated the fourth amendment the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend iv.our prior cases have established that the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches applies to administrative inspections of private commercial property.united states gordon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,in the case of a closely regulated industry,such as gun dealerships,the traditional fourth amendment standard of reasonableness for a government search lessens as the privacy interests of the owner are weakened and the government interests in regulating particular businesses are concomitantly heightened palmieri lynch,cir quoting new york burger,d.thus,warrantless inspection s of commercial premises may well be reasonable within the meaning of the fourth amendment.id.the baseline test for all fourth amendment claims is one of objective reasonableness.bryant city of new york,cir quoting graham connor,d.
here,spinelli alleges that the october search of olinville premises was objective ly un reasonable,and thus violated the fourth amendment.spinelli says that the search was unreasonable because officer mcsherry only conducted it in order to find an excuse to shut down olinville so as to reduce the precinct staffing burdens imposed by the,citywide omega watch program,and because officer carabella,who planned to open his own gun shop,wanted to eliminate the competition.even if we were to assume such a malicious motivation for which there is no record support,it would be of no moment.the relevant inquiry is whether the officers actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.graham,at.see bryant,at extending graham,an excessive force case,to pretrial detentions following warrantless arrests kerman city of new york,cir same,as to warrantless searches.t he subjective motivations of the individual officers ha ve no bearing on whether a particular seizure is unreasonable under the fourth amendment.graham,at.an officer evil intentions will not make a fourth amendment violation out of objectively reasonable conduct,nor will an officer good intentions make objectively unreasonable conduct constitutional.see also scott united states,d collecting cases.spinelli claim that one or more officers had an ulterior motive for the search is irrelevant to the issue of whether the search itself violated the fourth amendment.
spinelli also argues that because the search was warrantless and not conducted pursuant to established regulations,it was necessarily unreasonable.spinelli claims that the only applicable regulation that permits the police to search a gun store premises in new york city is rcny i,which creates a cooperative inspection program whereby gun store owners can set up a time for a voluntary police inspection.spinelli,however,overlooks a separate provision of the applicable regulations,rcny a,that provides that the gun dealer premises and firearms shall be subject to inspection at all times by members of the police department.emphasis added.spinelli allegations that the regulations make no provision for warrantless searches,and that mcsherry ignored the available procedure,are belied by a.
nor does the warrantless search authority created by a violate the fourth amendment.the supreme court has held that warrantless administrative searches are justified where the burden of obtaining a warrant would be likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.camara mun.of san,d.under certain circumstances,like those presented here,an effective inspection of a gun dealer premises requires that searches be unannounced in order to discover potential security infractions.see united states biswell,d see also id.when a dealer chooses to engage in this pervasively regulated business and to accept a federal license,he does so with the knowledge that his business records,firearms,and ammunition will be subject to effective inspection.united states streifel,cir concluding that gun dealers have a greatly reduced expectation of privacy because they know that they are subject to a full arsenal of governmental regulation quoting marshall barlow,d.we hold that the warrantless search of spinelli store,conducted pursuant to established regulatory authority,was objectively reasonable and did not violate the fourth amendment.
iii.the due process claim 
spinelli also alleges that,contrary to the district court conclusion,the city conduct did not provide her with the process that was due.spinelli argues that the city,advising her that olinville license had been suspended for failure to provide adequate security,did not adequately apprise her of the grounds for the suspension,and that simply providing her with the contact information for the investigating officer was insufficient to afford her a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
a.did spinelli have a protected property interest in her gun dealer license 
to succeed on a claim of procedural due process deprivation under the fourteenth is,a lack of adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be plaintiff must first establish that state action deprived him of a protected property interest.sanitation,at.property interests that are protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment are not created by that amendment they are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.bd.of regents roth,d.when alleging a property interest in a public benefit,the plaintiff must show a legitimate claim of entitlement to such interest that is grounded in established law.id.
the district court believed that,because the city had broad discretion over whether to grant or deny olinville gun dealership license,spinelli had no protected property interest in the license,and thus her due process claim could not succeed.we do not agree.while a person does not have a protected interest in a possible future business license,sanitation,at,the situation changes once the license is obtained,see dwyer regan,cir.while a possible future license involves a purely speculative property interest,once the government has granted a business license to an individual,the government can not depriv e the individual of such an interest without appropriate procedural safeguards.arnett kennedy,d powell,concurring in part.see bell burson,d once licenses are issued,their continued possession may become essential in the pursuit of a livelihood.
although there may be no protected property interest where the licensor has broad discretion to revoke the license,see bach pataki,cir,here,such discretion was carefully constrained.the relevant regulations provided that,under specific circumstances,the city could revoke or suspend spinelli gun dealer license,rcny l,but the city did not have unfettered discretion to do so.unlike the gun carrier permits in the cases cited by the district court,see bach,potts city of,d,over which the government had considerable discretion to suspend or revoke a license,bach,at,the city discretion in this case was cabined by the regulations good cause requirement,see rcny l.see,dwyer,at plaintiff employment could only be terminated for incompeten ce or misconduct.where a license can be suspended only upon a satisfactory showing of misconduct,the licensee has a property interest in his license sufficient to invoke the protection of the due process clause.barry barchi,d see richardson town of eastover,cir a license for the continued pursuit of the licensee livelihood,renewable periodically on the payment of a fee and revocable only for cause,creates a property interest in the licensee.thus,the district court erred in holding that spinelli did not have a property interest in her gun dealer license that could be protected by the due process clause.
was spinelli denied due process 
the district court also concluded that spinelli received all the process that was due when the city deprived her of her gun dealer license and firearms.the touchstone of due process,of course,is the requirement that a person in jeopardy of serious loss be given notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.mathews,at.quoting joint comm.mcgrath.frankfurter,concurring see also goldberg kelly,d requiring an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner internal quotation marks and citations omitted.however,due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.morrissey brewer,d.the timing and nature of the required hearing will depend on appropriate accommodation of the competing interests involved.krimstock kelly,cir quoting logan zimmerman brush,d.in determining how much process is due,a court must weigh the private interest affected,the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures used and the value of other safeguards,and the government interest.mathews,at.
applying the mathews test to this case,the district court found that although spinelli had some private interest in the vouchered guns taken by the city,the city gave spinelli an adequate notice and opportunity to be heard by negotiating with her counsel over the deprivation,which resulted in the reinstatement of her license and return of her firearms.the district court also found that there were exigent circumstances justifying the city conduct,which argued strong ly in favor of the public interest.thus,the district court concluded that the mathews factors weighed in favor of the city,and dismissed spinelli due process claim.
on appeal,spinelli challenges the district court mathews analysis,arguing that she had a strong interest in retaining her license and firearms,there was a high risk of erroneous deprivation because the city provided her with neither a meaningful opportunity for a hearing nor adequate notice of the grounds for her suspension,and the city claim of an urgent need to seize the firearms and suspend her license was insufficient to justify denying her a hearing,much less a one.
due process 
we disagree with spinelli contention that she was entitled to due process.a lthough notice and a pre deprivation hearing are generally required,in certain circumstances,the lack of such pre deprivation process will not offend the constitutional guarantee of due process,provided there is sufficient post deprivation process.catanzaro weiden,cir.n ecessity of quick action by the state or the impracticality of providing any meaningful pre deprivation process,when coupled with the availability of some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the state action at some time after the initial taking,can satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,exigent circumstances necessitating very prompt action on the part of the city were sufficient to justify the city failure to provide spinelli with notice or a hearing.united states all assets of statewide auto parts,cir citing fuentes,at.the city and the public have a strong interest in ensuring the security of gun shops,which was heightened further in the days immediately following the september terrorist attacks,when the dimensions of the terrorist threat were unknown.additionally,the search and the suspension were taken pursuant to the city regulatory authority the search was conducted pursuant to rcny a,and the suspension was authorized by rcny f.see all assets,at.
the record demonstrates that the city had sufficient cause to take prompt action to address the security infractions at olinville observed by officer mcsherry.spinelli,while downplaying these infractions,has never disputed them,and indeed,took strong measures to remedy them.were we to conclude that prompt action was not required,we would tie the hands of police faced with obvious security lapses at gun stores until a hearing could be held,and thereby substantially undermine the state interest in public safety.mackey montrym,d.under the circumstances presented to the police on october,the city was not required to provide spinelli with due process before suspending her license and seizing her firearms.however,our inquiry does not end there.
due process 
spinelli primary argument on appeal is that the city never provided her with the opportunity for a meaningful notice and hearing despite her entitlement to one under the city own regulations.spinelli further alleges,and the city essentially concedes,that in practice the city does not provide licensees with notice or an opportunity for a formal hearing until after the police investigation is completed,which the city acknowledges can take months or years.again,we turn to the mathews factors,now in the context.
a.the first mathews factor 
first,the private interest implicated in this case is strong.spinelli private interest is the interest in operating a business and,stated more broadly,pursuing a particular livelihood.see tanasse city of george,cir citing dixon love,d.the supreme court has repeatedly recognized the severity of depriving someone of his or her livelihood.fdic mallen,d.moreover,b ecause of the nature of this interest,a licensee erroneously deprived of a license can not be made whole simply by reinstating the license.tanasse.in fact,the interim period between erroneous deprivation and reinstatement can be financially devastating to the licensee.id.the district court conclusion that the extent of spinelli interest in her deprived property is not entirely clear to the court,led it to erroneously discount spinelli interest in both her gun dealer license and her seized firearms.without firearms to sell,spinelli could not do business as a gun dealer at all,whether or not she had a dealer license.the first mathews factor favors spinelli.
b.the second mathews factor 
next,we consider the risk of an erroneous deprivation under the procedures used by the city,along with the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.mathews,at.spinelli argues that the procedures used by the city did not adequately afford her due process because they failed to provide either adequate notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard in a sufficiently timely manner.we agree.
notice,to comply with due process requirements,must set forth the alleged misconduct with particularity.in re gault,d internal quotation marks omitted.the particularity with which alleged misconduct must be described varies with the facts and circumstances of the individual case however,due process notice contemplates specifications of acts or patterns of conduct,not general,conclusory charges unsupported by specific factual allegations.the degree of required specificity also increases w
