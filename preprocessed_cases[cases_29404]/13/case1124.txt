plaintiff,mes,claims that the army corps of engineers corps unfairly terminated three of its contracts.after its administrative challenges to these terminations were dismissed without prejudice to allow mes and its insurer to determine which of them would manage those proceedings mes and its president,george makhoul,filed this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york laura taylor swain,judge.invoking bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d,mes and makhoul sued named corps personnel in their individual capacities,alleging that their contracts were terminated in retaliation for criticism by mes of the corps mismanagement of construction projects,that these terminations negatively impacted mes business,and that,as a result,they were deprived of their constitutionally protected rights to free speech and substantive due process.mes and makhoul now appeal from a judgment entered on march,dismissing their complaint.see,snell,civ.lts,wl.they contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling that their bivens action was precluded by the contract disputes act of cda,see et.

although this court has not previously considered the preclusive effect of the cda on bivens claims,two of our sister circuits have done so and concluded that the statute complex procedural and substantive framework is comprehensive,precluding bivens claims by aggrieved government contractors that relate to or derive from contract disputes.see evers astrue,cir janicki logging mateer,cir.district courts appear uniformly to have reached the same conclusion in published and unpublished decisions.see aryai forfeiture support,llc,civ.lap,dist.lexis,at,kesler,dep t of,cv blw,wl,at,research air,norton,rmc,wl,at,teel dileonardi,c,wl,at,information networks dep t of hhs,advanced materials,burgess,wl,at,aff,cir unpublished table decision.we agree with these courts analysis of the cda,as well as with the district court application of that reasoning to mes bivens claims in this case.accordingly,we affirm the challenged judgment of dismissal.
background 
termination of mes contracts 
mes is a new york corporation that specializes in building complex structures such as laboratories,weapons testing facilities,and warehouses for munitions and explosives.since,it has performed construction work for the united states department of defense,specifically for the army corps of engineers.between september,and september,the corps awarded mes three contracts for work to be performed at the picatinny arsenal in dover,new jersey arsenal contracts.
the first contract,awarded to mes as part of a joint venture,related to the construction of a high energy propellant formulation facility,requiring the design and erection of thirteen new buildings and the renovation of three existing structures at a price of.the second contract,concerning the construction of an explosive research and development loading facility,required mes to design and erect three new buildings and to renovate one existing building for a sum of.the third contract,relating to development of a pyrotechnics research and technology facility,called on mes to construct a pyrotechnics research center and flare tunnel for.each of these contracts incorporated the disputes provision of the federal acquisition regulations,which subjected the agreements to the contract disputes act of,as amended.a.
it is undisputed that none of the arsenal contracts was performed according to its specifications.thus,between march and december,the corps provided mes with written notice that,as a result of significant and unacceptable delays,it was terminating each of the contracts for default.each notice stated that it constitute d the final decision of the contracting officer in accordance with the disputes clause of the contract,and advised mes that,pursuant to the cda,it could appeal to the armed services board of contract appeals or bring an action directly in the united states court of federal claims,notice of termination,notice of termination,notice of termination.
mes cda challenges to the contract terminations 
invoking the cda,mes challenged the terminations of its arsenal contracts before the armed services board of contract appeals asbca.see a,a.there,mes asserted that the corps was responsible for the delays attending each contract due to myriad specifications defects and demands for additional unfunded work beyond that required by the original agreements.mes charged the corps with breaching each of the arsenal contracts,claimed that the terminations were arbitrary and improper,and asked that all three terminations for default be converted to terminations for convenience.
while these asbca proceedings were pending,safeco insurance company of america safeco,mes surety on the three arsenal contracts,filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,alleging that mes had breached the parties indemnity agreements and that safeco was thus entitled to assume ownership of mes affirmative claims relating to the arsenal contracts,including those before the asbca.after the district court awarded safeco partial summary judgment a decision we affirmed,see safeco ins.of am,jv,app x cir summary order mes requested that the asbca stay the administrative proceedings pending resolution of the rights and intentions of safeco,which mes feared might not vigorously press its claim that the corps had breached the arsenal contracts.instead,but for the same purpose,on september,the asbca dismissed mes appeals without prejudice.see asbca effective may,authorizing dismissal without prejudice in board discretion,which shall be deemed with prejudice if neither party seeks reinstatement within three years.
district court proceedings 
mes did not seek to reopen proceedings before the asbca.rather,on december,mes and makhoul commenced this action in the southern district of new york against defendants ella snell,a contracting officer in the corps new york district raynette gurney,the corps chief of contracting for the north atlantic division christopher nastasi,an administering contracting officer in the new york district and anthony levesanos,a corps program manager.in the second amended complaint,the pleading pertinent to this appeal,mes and makhoul claimed that by terminating the arsenal contracts for default,these defendants had deprived plaintiffs of substantive due process under the fifth amendment by causing permanent injury to mes reputation and the complete loss of mes as a going concern,compl.infringed mes and makhoul first amendment rights to free speech by using the terminations to retaliate for makhoul complaints that the corps had violated the anti deficiency act in demanding that mes perform additional unfunded work,see a and subjected makhoul to injurious falsehood under new york law.plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees.
by opinion and order dated march,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see,snell,wl,at.the district court held that plaintiffs could not maintain a bivens action based on allegations that termination of the arsenal contracts violated their rights to free speech and due process,because the cda afforded them a comprehensive remedial scheme for complaints relating to the termination of government contracts.see id.at citing bush lucas,d declining to recognize bivens action for alleged first amendment violation where plaintiff claim arose out of employment relationship governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive scheme affording meaningful remedies against united states.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
courts appear divided on whether preclusion of a bivens action by the cda warrants dismissal for lack of jurisdiction under.b,see evers astrue,at information networks dep t of hhs.at,or for failure to state a claim under.b,see janicki logging mateer,at.we need not decide that question here,as the result would be the same under either approach.in both cases,we review the district court legal determination de novo,accepting as true all material factual allegations in the complaint,see gibbons malone,cir failure to state claim ford union local,cir per curiam lack of jurisdiction under rule b,we are permitted to rely on,statements outside the pleadings,see ex rel.attica cent,cir,which we can not consider under rule b unless they are incorporated within or integral to the complaint,see roth jennings,cir.here,although mes submitted a sworn declaration by makhoul further detailing the circumstances surrounding his claim,those additional facts make no difference to the pure question of law as to whether the cda precludes a bivens claim relating to a federal contract.we turn to that question.
implying constitutional claims under bivens 
in bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d bivens,the supreme court recognized as implicit in certain constitutionally protected rights a federal claim for money damages against federal officials,sued in their individual capacities,for violations of those rights.precisely because bivens is a judicially created remedy,however,federal courts have been reluctant to recognize such implied relief.see arar ashcroft,cir en banc characterizing bivens remedy as extraordinary thing that should rarely if ever be applied in new contexts and observing that,after bivens,supreme court has recognized implied constitutional causes of action only twice internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court recently explained,consideration of a bivens request follows a familiar sequence that involves two inquiries whether there is any alternative,existing process for protecting the affected interest that amounts to a convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing a new damages remedy and whether,even in the absence of such an alternative,any special factors counsel hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.wilkie robbins,d internal quotation marks omitted accord arar ashcroft,at.
with respect to the first of these inquiries,the supreme court has stated that if the conduct at issue already is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions of law giving meaningful remedies against the united states,then it is inappropriate for courts to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy.bush lucas,at.the fact that such a remedial scheme does not provide complete relief for the plaintiff warrants no different conclusion.id.at.indeed,in such circumstances,courts will generally assume that congress omission of the particular relief sought by the plaintiff has not been inadvertent.schweiker chilicky,d explaining that assumption derives from appropriate judicial deference to considered congressional inaction see also dotson griesa,cir construing civil service reform act of to evince congress decision to exclude judicial branch employees from statutory review procedures.nor will allegations of illegitimate motives support recognition of a bivens claim for conduct subject to a comprehensive remedial scheme.western radio servs.forest,cir.in sum,in the face of a comprehensive scheme,federal courts will decline to infer new substantive legal liability without legislative aid,mindful that congress is in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be served by creating it.bush lucas,at internal quotation marks omitted.
c.the cda creates a comprehensive scheme for reviewing claims relating to federal contracts that precludes mes bivens action 
in conferring original jurisdiction on federal district courts to hear civil claims against the united states,congress expressly excluded any civil action or claim against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states that is subject to review under the cda.a.congress thereby identified the cda review process as the sole means for resolving contract disputes against the federal government.to be sure,does not speak to civil actions that contractors might bring against united states employees in their individual capacities for alleged constitutional violations relating to government contracts nevertheless,where,as here,a plaintiff constitutional claims originate in contract obligations for which the comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions of the cda afford meaningful and exclusive remedies against the united states,we conclude that it would be inappropriate for us to supplement that regulatory scheme with new judicial remedies against united states employees pursuant to bivens.bush lucas,at.
in reaching that conclusion,we begin with the cda itself,which by its terms applies broadly to any express or implied contract made by an executive agency for the procurement of construction,alteration,repair,or maintenance of real property.a.this language certainly reaches the arsenal contracts that mes complains defendants wrongfully terminated.the cda provides for persons aggrieved in connection with such contracts to submit e ach claim against the federal government to a contracting officer,id.a,who shall issue a decision in writing,id.d.a contracting officer decision on a claim is final and conclusive and is not subject to review by any forum,tribunal,or federal government agency,except as authorized by the cda itself.id.g.the cda provides that within days of receipt of a contracting officer decision,an aggrieved contractor may either appeal to the asbca,see id.a,or bring an action directly on the claim in the united states court of federal claims,id.b.in each instance,further review may be had in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.see id.a a.
courts have characterized this remedial scheme as the paradigm of a precisely drawn,detailed statute,which purports to provide final and exclusive resolution of all disputes arising from government contracts that fall within its ambit.a s council oil lader,accord evers astrue,at campanella commerce exch.bank,cir see also janicki logging mateer,at observing that cda embodies precisely the kind of complex procedural and substantive remedial scheme referenced by supreme court and ninth circuit in identifying circumstances not warranting recognition of bivens action.
mes does not quarrel with the general comprehensiveness of the cda.it nevertheless insists that constitutional claims against federal employees in their individual capacities fall outside the purview of a statute that affords relief only as against the federal government itself.supreme court precedent defeats this argument.
in bush lucas,a federal employee who alleged that he was demoted for publicly criticizing the agency for which he worked successfully used the elaborate,comprehensive civil service review scheme to secure reinstatement and full back pay from the united states.at.thereafter,he filed a bivens action against his supervisor to recover for uncompensated first amendment injuries.see id.at.
