town of berlin berlin and denise mcnair appeal from a july,opinion and order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,judge preliminarily enjoining them from enforcing section of the berlin code of ordinances against vip of berlin,llc vip.the district court granted the injunction at issue here because it concluded that vip had shown a clear likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that the ordinance definition of an adult oriented store was unconstitutionally vague as applied to a zoning application that vip submitted on march.
berlin ordinance defines any establishment having a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in adult books,adult videos or adult novelties as an adult oriented store.berlin code of ordinances emphases in original.the district court did not find the ordinance definitions of adult books,adult videos or adult novelties unconstitutionally vague.rather,the district court held that vip had shown a clear likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that the phrase substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade was unconstitutionally vague.in sum,the district court concluded that the ordinance,as applied to vip march zoning application,failed to provide clear enforcement standards and adequate notice that the amount of vip proposed adult inventory would qualify vip as an adult oriented store.the issue before us,therefore,is whether,as applied to vip march zoning application,the phrase substantial or significant portion of a business stock in trade is unconstitutionally vague.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the district court exceeded its allowable discretion by concluding that vip has shown a clear likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that this phrase,as applied to vip march zoning application,is unconstitutionally vague.
factual and procedural background 
vip owns an approximately commercial building located at berlin turnpike in berlin,connecticut.the property is presently zoned for retail use.because the property is located within feet of a residentially zoned area,however,vip may not operate a retail store at that location if it is classified as an adult oriented store under berlin sexually oriented business sob ordinance.
berlin current ordinance and vip march zoning application 
berlin current sob ordinance defines an adult oriented store as any establishment having a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in adult books,adult videos or adult novelties or any combination thereof.berlin code of ordinances emphases in original.an adult oriented store falls into the category of a sexually oriented business,which requires an sob license to operate in berlin and which may not be located within feet of any residentially zoned land.id,c.the stated purpose of berlin sob ordinance is to 
promote the health,safety and general welfare of the residents of the town and,reduce or eliminate the adverse secondary effects of such sexually oriented businesses,protect residents from increased crime,preserve the quality of life,preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses,deter the spread of blight,and protect against the threat to public health from the spread of communicable and social diseases.
on march,vip submitted an application for a zoning permit,along with a proposed inventory list and proposed floor plan.according to this march application,twelve percent of the stock in trade at vip berlin store would consist of books,magazines,dvds,and novelties or products that could be defined as adult videos,adult books,or adult novelties collectively,adult products under the berlin sob ordinance of vip total inventory of products,vip represented that of those items could be classified as adult products such as dvds for rent,dvds for sale,magazines,sex positive lubricants,and sex positive toys.
on may,berlin chief zoning enforcement officer,hellyn riggins,denied vip zoning application on the ground that the berlin town manager,denise mcnair,had determined that vip proposed use would require an sob license,which vip lacked.
ii.vip prior zoning applications and berlin prior ordinance 
although the district court determined only that berlin current ordinance is unconstitutionally vague as applied to vip march zoning application,the district court considered the parties prior dealings in making that determination.before submitting the march zoning application that is at issue here,vip previously had applied for a certificate of zoning compliance,in an application dated july,seeking to open an adult bookstore,including books,magazines,videos,clothing,presentation of any materials sold.in a letter accompanying this application,vip stated that less than a majority of its stock and trade would consist of items of an adult nature.under berlin sob ordinance in place at the time of vip first zoning application,the definition of an adult bookstore or adult video store was an establishment having a majority of its stock and trade in adult books,magazines,videos,and the like.the ordinance additionally defined an adult novelty store as any establishment having a substantial or significant portion of its stock and trade in adult novelty products.berlin zoning officer denied vip july application on the ground that vip was an sob and did not have the appropriate license.vip subsequent appeal to the berlin board of zoning appeals was denied.
in the meantime,on october,the berlin town council amended its sob licensing ordinance to create a single category of business known as an adult oriented store,which is defined as any establishment having a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in adult books,adult videos or adult novelties or any combination thereof.berlin code of ordinances emphases in original.it is the language in this version of the ordinance that the district court held unconstitutionally vague and that is before us on appeal.
after berlin rejected vip july application and amended its ordinance,vip filed a new application for a zoning permit on march,along with a proposed inventory list,representing that none of its proposed items for sale could be construed as adult use,including adult novelty or adult video as defined in the berlin sob ordinance.berlin chief zoning enforcement officer,hellyn riggins,apparently disagreed with vip characterization of its inventory.in response to vip march application,riggins stated i have carefully reviewed the list of items that you propose to sell and have personally viewed these items at your other locations in the state.riggins concluded that a significant or substantial portion of these items constitute adult novelties under the current definitions found in our sob ordinance.
in june,vip resubmitted its zoning application with a revised inventory list that eliminated some of the items that were of concern to the town zoning officer.after submitting that application,the zoning officer indicated orally to vip principal,dominick demartino,that she intended to deny that application for the same reason that she denied the march application.as a result,vip withdrew its june zoning application on june.
iii.district court proceedings and decision 
in november,after its first zoning application was denied,vip brought an action in the district court pursuant to,alleging that berlin sob zoning ordinance was unconstitutional.subsequently,after its march zoning application was also denied,vip sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendants from enforcing berlin sob ordinance against vip.in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction,vip argued that the berlin ordinance definition of an establishment with a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in adult vague as applied to vip march application because it does not provide sufficiently clear notice or guidance about what portion of merchandise would allow vip to operate as a.
on june,the district court heard oral argument,as well as testimony from demartino and mcnair.demartino,vip principal,testified that he eventually wishes to open an adult store in berlin pending the outcome of another segment of this litigation.however,he testified that currently he is attempting to comply with the sob ordinance and does not understand what he needs to do to avoid being classified as an sob under the ordinance.mcnair,berlin town manager,testified that she reviews zoning applications on an individual basis and that,in her view,the phrase substantial or significant means meaningful to either the business or the town of berlin it would have import to the business.when asked why she denied vip march zoning application,mcnair stated,by the list that i saw,there were over items that the applicant had said were adult products which to me is substantial.mcnair stated,portion to me means an amount.a portion of something is an amount,a part of something.mcnair further stated that t he ordinance,in the way i asked to apply it,is to assist in the goals of the town,the security of its people,the health,welfare,and i believe it necessary to look at the cases individually,not be arbitrary but to really understand and take a look at each application as applied.
on july,the district court granted vip motion for a preliminary injunction see vip of berlin,llc town of berlin,d.specifically,the district court concluded that vip showed that it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction because it is being prohibited from exercising its first amendment rights and a clear or substantial likelihood of success on its claim that the berlin ordinance definition of an sob is unconstitutionally vague as applied to vip march zoning application.with regard to the likelihood of success on the merits,the district court reasoned that the statute does not give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what portion of stock in trade would not qualify as substantial or significant or provide explicit standards for those who apply it.
discussion 
we review a district court decision to grant or withhold a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.vincenty bloomberg,cir.a district court exceeds its allowable discretion if its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or if its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the ultimate question remains whether,in light of the applicable standard,the court has abused its discretion and i f the underlying constitutional question is close,therefore,we should uphold the injunction.id.quoting ashcroft,at.where a party seeks a preliminary injunction that challenges government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme and that would alter,rather than maintain,the status quo,the moving party must demonstrate irreparable harm and a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits.jolly coughlin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons set forth below,the district court exceeded its allowable discretion when it held that vip demonstrated a clear likelihood of success on the merits of its as applied vagueness challenge.
vagueness doctrine 
as one of the most fundamental protections of the due process clause,the doctrine requires that laws be crafted with sufficient clarity to give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and to provide explicit standards for those who apply them.thibodeau portuondo,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.a statute can be impermissibly vague for either of two independent reasons.first,if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits.second,if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado.
in reviewing a statute language for vagueness,we are relegated to the words of the ordinance itself,to the interpretations the court below has given to analogous statutes,and perhaps to some degree,to the interpretation of the statute given by those charged with enforcing it.grayned city of rockford,internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted.the degree of vagueness tolerated in a statute varies with its type economic regulations are subject to a relaxed vagueness test,laws with criminal penalties to a stricter one,and laws that might infringe constitutional rights to the strictest of all.rubin garvin,cir.when a statute is capable of reaching expression sheltered by the first amendment,the vagueness doctrine demands a greater degree of specificity than in other contexts.farrell burke,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
berlin sob ordinance survives an as applied vagueness challenge 
the first way that a law may be unconstitutionally vague as applied to the conduct of certain individuals is if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits.hill,at.animating this first vagueness ground is the constitutional principle that individuals should receive fair notice or warning when the state has prohibited specific behavior or acts.thibodeau,at.the relevant inquiry is whether the language conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.rubin,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.condemned to the use of words,we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.grayned,at see also id.at,rejecting a facial vagueness challenge to an ordinance that implicated first amendment rights and prohibited certain demonstrations adjacent to schools that disturb or tend to disturb the peace or good order of such school session or class thereof.for this reason,we respectfully disagree with the dissent that it is constitutionally problematic that mcnair testified that she was unable to supply a mathematical definition or a percentage to quantify the cutoff point for the amount of adult materials in a store stock in trade that would qualify it as an sob.see dissent,infra,at.and,in any event,although the zoning officer understanding of the ordinance terms is relevant perhaps to some degree,grayned,at,our inquiry begins with the text of the ordinance.
in the present case,berlin ordinance defines a sexually oriented business,or sob,as an establishment that has a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in adult merchandise.vip asserts that this definition is so vague that it fails to provide vip with notice that its proposed inventory of adult twelve percent of its total inventory of qualify it as an sob.vip further argues that,because the statute uses the words substantial or significant portion,it would be inappropriate to look at the absolute number of adult items being sold,as opposed to the proportion of the store that is,when determining whether a business is an sob.such a reading,however,ignores the common,ordinary meaning of the ordinance words.see generally perrin united states,a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.one of the common definitions of the term substantial is of ample or considerable amount or quantity.oxford english dictionary ed see also webster third new int l dictionary defining substantial as considerable in amount.similarly,one common definition of the term significant is of a noticeably or measurably large amount.online dictionary,http last visited,see also webster third new int l dictionary defining significant as important,weighty,notable.portion simply means a part of something.webster third new int l dictionary.applying these definitions to the present case,vip proposed adult section clearly falls under the ordinance because the part of its stock in trade devoted to adult merchandise is of considerable quantity and of a noticeably or measurably large amount.
congress has used similar phrasing in many other statutory contexts,including various portions of the patent laws,securities laws,environmental laws,and civil rights laws the civil rights act,for example,applies to a business if,inter alia,a substantial portion of the food which it serves has moved in commerce.c emphasis added.despite repeated attacks on the civil rights act validity under the commerce clause,it appears that no litigant ever thought to challenge the phrase substantial portion of the food which it serves as unconstitutionally vague.although these statutes do not regulate first amendment activity,and are thus subject to a lower required level of specificity in the face of a vagueness challenge,it is nonetheless worth noting that the legislature has used the phrase substantial portion to organize our society in a wide variety of contexts.
in addition to the plain meaning of the ordinance wording,which has been used in a wide variety of statutory contexts,the ordinance stated the adverse secondary effects associated with the presence of sob provides additional clarity and guidance.see grayned,at noting that a lthough the prohibited quantum of disturbance is not specified in the ordinance,it is apparent from the statute announced purpose that the measure is whether normal school activity has been or is about to be disrupted emphases added.given the ordinance stated purpose,as well as the plain meaning of the ordinance words,the phrase substantial or significant portion clearly encompasses not only the percentage of adult items sold,but also the absolute number of adult items sold.it would make little sense to allow this store with an adult section to operate as a when a similarly located store devoted solely to adult merchandise would be required to obtain an sob license and locate itself elsewhere.the neighborhood is no less likely to experience detrimental effects if the adult items were sold through a small business rather than through a large store adult department equally substantial in size.
despite the ordinance plain meaning and stated purpose,the district court agreed with vip that the ordinance was impermissibly vague.specifically,the district court noted that the language substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade suggests that a retail establishment could have something more than zero percent adult media and adult products without being classified as an adult oriented store.vip of berlin,llc town of berlin,d.the district court concluded that it is not readily apparent from the face of the ordinance what amount of stock in trade would qualify as a substantial or significant portion.id.we have previously noted that,t he evaluation of whether a statute is vague as applied to a litigant must be made with respect to the litigant actual conduct and not with respect to hypothetical situations at the periphery of the statute scope.perez hoblock,cir see also rubin garvin,cir because we must examine the complainant conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law,we turn first to his challenge.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to be clear,a court may analyze whether a reasonable person would understand that the litigant conduct was prohibited.see hill,at.however,in the context of an vagueness challenge,a court analysis should be confined to the litigant actual conduct,and a court should not analyze whether a reasonable person would understand that certain hypothetical conduct or situations violate the statute.see perez,at see also farrell,at.
here,although its decision related only to vip vagueness challenge,the language and logic of the district court at times slipped into hypothetical analysis,questioning where in general the line between adult and businesses is drawn.the pertinent issue,however,is not whether a reasonable person would know what amount of adult merchandise,in general,would qualify a business as adult oriented.rather,the issue in this particular challenge is whether a reasonable person would know that a proposed inventory of adult items would qualify vip as an adult oriented store.whether or not the ordinance provides a bright line rule about the specific amount of adult media that would qualify a store as adult oriented in hypothetical applications,there is no doubt that,as applied to vip,the language of the sob ordinance covers vip march zoning application as noted earlier,the portion of vip proposed retail establishment that would be devoted to adult so substantial that it potentially eclipses the size of a store whose sole purpose is to provide adult merchandise.one could analogize vip to a department store,such as macy,whose individual shoe department is so large that it exceeds the size of many shoe stores.even if macy shoe department constituted only twelve percent of macy total stock in trade,one would hardly call it an insubstantial or insignificant portion of the macy store.accordingly,even if there were a hypothetical situation that would fall under the ordinance gray area,the ordinance is sufficiently clear to provide vip with notice that the proposed inventory in its march zoning application qualifies it as an sob 
in addition to slipping into hypothetical analysis in the midst of determining whether the ordinance was vague as applied to vip march zoning application,the district court relied on several inapposite cases in reaching its conclusion.in particular,of the three state supreme court cases relied upon by the district court,two involved language different from the language at issue here.in floyd road,crisp county,the issue was whether the phrase substantial business purpose was unconstitutionally vague.the court noted that n umerous courts have upheld statutory language against vagueness challenges where substantial has modified matters such as stock in trade or interior business.id.at emphasis added.specifically distinguishing those decisions,the court then found the phrase substantial business purpose unconstitutionally vague because it does not look to stock in trade,gross sales,floor space or some other readily quantifiable standard.id.at emphases added.similarly,the issue in city of columbia video,was whether the phrase principal business purpose was unconstitutionally vague.because the language at issue here is substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade,these two state supreme court cases are of limited applicability.furthermore,one of the primary federal cases relied upon by the district court,wisconsin vendors,lake county,d,wisconsin vendors i,is also of limited persuasive value.see id.finding that plaintiff had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its and facial vagueness challenge to the phrase substantial or significant portion of its business.shortly after wisconsin vendors i was issued,the seventh circuit held in pleasureland museum,beutter,cir,that the language significant or substantial portion of its was not unconstitutionally overbroad on its face.after the seventh circuit decided pleasureland,the same district court that decided wisconsin vendors i issued a new decision that rejected plaintiff facial and vagueness challenges i n light of pleasureland.wisconsin vendors,lake county,c,wl,at.
in sum,the plain meaning and stated purpose of berlin ordinance,as applied to vip march zoning application,provide adequate notice that the size of vip proposed inventory would qualify it as an store under the ordinance.in concluding to the contrary,the district court decision at times slipped into hypothetical analysis ill suited for analyzing an vagueness challenge and failed to consider that the plain meaning of the ordinance encompasses not only the percentage of adult inventory items,but also the absolute number of adult inventory items.
sufficiently clear enforcement standards 
the second way in which a statute can be found unconstitutionally vague is if the statute does not provide explicit standards for those who apply it.thibodeau portuondo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.when analyzing this issue,a court may determine that a statute provides adequate guidance if either the statute as a general matter provides sufficiently clear standards to eliminate the risk of arbitrary enforcement or even in the absence of such standards,the conduct at issue falls within the core of the statute prohibition,so that the enforcement before the court was not the result of the unfettered latitude that law enforcement officers and factfinders might have in other,hypothetical applications of the statute.farrell burke,cir.
for the same reasons that it gave vip adequate notice regarding its march application,the language here,which defines an sob as an establishment that has a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade in adult merchandise,does not encourage or authorize arbitrary enforcement.the plain meaning of the ordinance,as discussed earlier,is not vague and clearly applies to vip because the adult merchandise portion of vip proposed retail establishment is so substantial that it potentially exceeds the size of some stores.
in addition to a statute plain meaning and stated purpose,courts should determine whether a statute provides sufficiently clear enforcement standards by analyzing perhaps to some degree the interpretation of the statute given by those charged with enforcing it.grayned city of rockford.in the present case,mcnair,berlin town manager,testified that she reviews zoning applications on an individual basis and that,in her view,the phrase substantial or significant means meaningful to either the business or the town of berlin it would have import to the business.when asked why she denied vip march zoning application,mcnair stated,by the list that i saw,there were over items that the applicant had said were adult products which to me is substantial.mcnair stated,portion to me means an amount.a portion of something is an amount,a part of something.mcnair further stated that t he ordinance,in the way i asked to apply it,is to assist in the goals of the town,the security of its people,the health,welfare,and i believe it necessary to look at the cases individually,not be arbitrary but to really understand and take a look at each application as applied.mcnair testimony is consistent with the stated purpose and plain meaning of the ordinance as described earlier in this opinion.mcnair statement that she reviews zoning applications on an individual basis and that the ordinance terms do not necessarily trigger a specific percentage of stock in trade or a specific absolute number of trade items does not alter that conclusion.see grayned,at noting that enforcement requires the exercise of some degree of judgment.
furthermore,even if,as the dissent asserts,berlin ordinance did not provide sufficiently clear enforcement standards,vip vagueness challenge still fails.as noted earlier,even if a statute does not include clear enforcement standards,it may still survive a challenge if the conduct at issue falls within the core of the statute prohibition.farrell,at.in farrell,a convicted sex offender challenged a condition of his supervised release that prohibited him from possessing pornography,arguing that the term pornography was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to him.although we did not disagree with farrell argument that the term pornography is inherently vague,and a lthough the actors in farrell case had divergent views on what constituted pornography and why,id.at,we nevertheless rejected farrell vagueness challenge,id.at.we reasoned that w hether or not the term pornography is inherently vague,the items possessed by farrell fit within any reasonable understanding of the term,id.at,and n o reasonable officer could have doubted that farrell possession violated the terms of his parole agreement,id.at.
here,because the portion of vip business devoted to adult merchandise is so substantial,vip proposed retail establishment falls under the core of the ordinance prohibition.for the reasons discussed above,vip proposed adult inventory,which constitutes twelve percent of its stock in trade,falls within any reasonable understanding of the ordinance language.id.at.accordingly,even if the ordinance did not provide clear enforcement standards,the decision to classify vip as an sob was not the result of unfettered latitude that law enforcement officers and factfinders might have in other,hypothetical applications of the statute.id.at.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,the preliminary injunction order of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
my dissent is prompted by my opinion that vip is likely to succeed on its claim that berlin ordinance was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the zoning application that vip submitted on march.
i accept the proposition that the phrase substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.this is so because that phrase generally does not fail to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits and because it does not authorize or even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado.the phrase may be unconstitutional as applied,however,because 
there may be instances where an adult bookstore would be unsure of whether its stock,floorspace,or revenue is made up of a significant or substantial portion of adult material,and there are myriad instances in which it would not.if,for example,victoria secret sold a few copies of an adult magazine along with its regular stock of lingerie,it certainly would not wonder if the ordinance applied to it.or,if the store chose to carry nothing but adult videos and toys,it would have no doubt that it was required to obtain an sob sexually oriented business license to do so.in short,in many situations,people of ordinary intelligence would clearly understand whether or not the ordinance applied to them.
doctor john,city of roy,cir emphasis supplied.many is not all,and the situation at hand lies somewhere in between the examples given in the quoted excerpt vip may have adult items on hand,but that number represents but of its stock in trade.
continuing with its analysis of the facial validity of an ordinance similar to the one at hand,the tenth circuit opined 
in the same way,in many cases the ordinance can not be said to permit arbitrary enforcement there may be occasions where arbitrary enforcement might occur,but the standard given to officials satisfies this court that such a risk is not present to such a degree as to justify facial invalidation.
id.emphasis supplied.
this is a case in which a person of ordinary intelligence would not clearly understand whether the ordinance applied to him and where arbitrary enforcement has occurred,all due to the manner in which the treated vip application.in examining the vagueness challenge before us,we are constrained to determine whether the ordinance gives a reasonable opportunity to one of ordinary intelligence to know what is required and to consider whether the ordinance provides explicit standards that govern its application.see rubin garvin,cir.
in applying the ordinance to vip,the,denise mcnair,town manager for the town of berlin,reworked the ordinance so as to provide her own spin to the phrase substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade,resulting in a decision having no reference to the ordinance itself.her testimony also demonstrated considerable confusion about the meaning of the ordinance.for example,she testified as follows 
i think that substantial or significant means meaningful to someone,the town of berlin,i should say,not myself.but meaningful to either the business or the town of berlin.i think of a significant other.i think i said that in my deposition.when i hear these words,it somebody who is meaningful to the other person it not just a friend so it would have some meaning.it would have import to the business.it would have meaning to the town under the ordinance.
to mcnair,meaningful entails a subjective judgment.indeed,it is a word that is vitalized only in the eye of the beholder.the dictionary defines it as having a meaning or purpose capable of being understood or interpreted requiring or done with understanding and intent.webster third new int l dictionary.having a meaning or purpose surely does not illuminate the phrase in question.moreover,meaningful does not serve as a synonym for substantial or significant as a modifier of a portion of its stock
