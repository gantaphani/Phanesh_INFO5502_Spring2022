the corruption of elected officials undermines public confidence in our democratic institutions.the government has a wide berth to combat it.one of the government more recent public corruption targets was david rosen,the former chief executive officer of medisys health network medisys and its associated hospitals,whom the government charged with participating in bribery schemes involving three new york state legislators former assemblyman anthony seminerio,assemblyman william boyland,and former senator carl kruger.rosen was convicted,after a bench trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,of honest services mail and wire fraud and honest services fraud conspiracy,in violation of,and,as well as conspiracy to commit bribery and violate the travel act,in violation of.at trial,there was evidence that rosen bribed the three legislators in exchange for their commitment to perform official acts as specific opportunities arose within the new york state legislature and state agencies.
on appeal,rosen makes three principal arguments.first,he disputes the government as opportunities arise theory of prosecution he contends that his conduct was not criminal and that the federal bribery and honest services fraud statutes are unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct.second,he asserts that the trial evidence against him was insufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted with any corrupt intent.third,he challenges the district court refusal to compel the government to immunize a potential defense witness.we reject all three arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
because rosen appeals from a judgment of conviction following trial,we view the facts,which are drawn from the trial evidence,in the light most favorable to the government.see united states pica,cir.
david rosen 
rosen was the ceo of medisys,a company that managed several hospitals in the new york city area,and of three new hospitals in the medisys network jamaica hospital medical center and flushing hospital medical center in queens,and brookdale university hospital and medical center brookdale hospital in brooklyn.because the medisys hospitals served primarily underinsured and indigent patients,they depended significantly on funding from new york state and on new york medicaid reimbursement rates.the medisys network likewise depended on state support to acquire other hospitals.rosen actively promoted medisys with state officials,lobbying new york state and its agencies to advance medisys interests.
anthony seminerio 
anthony seminerio served as an assemblyman for new york state st assembly district from through,and as an assemblyman for the assembly district from through,when he resigned.as an assemblyman,seminerio supported jamaica hospital by securing state financial assistance for the hospital.for example,in seminerio sponsored legislation that created a capital financing program through which jamaica hospital obtained over million to construct a new facility.
in the late,pursuant to two consulting contracts,medisys hired marc consultants marc,a consulting company founded and controlled by seminerio.at rosen request,medisys entered the first contract with marc in the contract provided that neighborhood health providers nhp,a managed care entity partially owned by medisys,would hire marc for a monthly fee of.during the contract negotiations,george kalkines,a partner at medisys outside general counsel,kalkines arky zall bernstein,falsely told nhp ceo that the consulting agreement had been or soon would be reviewed by new york state legislative ethics committee the lec.the second contract,signed by david rosen on behalf of jamaica hospital and by marc in april,was essentially identical to the nhp marc contract but required higher monthly payments of to marc.ultimately,from to,medisys paid marc over in fees under both contracts.while the contracts required marc to provide assistance with respect to marketing,public relations and contractual relationships,including appearing before or meeting with governmental agencies or units and private parties,each contract also explicitly prohibited marc from providing any consulting services in respect of any unit or agency of the state of new york,including the state legislature.
as the district court observed,t hese contracts,on their face,were not necessarily unlawful.indeed,after april,seminerio appears to have provided some appropriate assistance to medisys under the contracts.for example,using his relationships in the private sector and in the local and federal governments,seminerio petitioned the new york city fire department to expand the number of ambulance districts that medisys hospitals could cover,facilitated medisys application to the united states department of housing and urban development for mortgage financing,and notified medisys when various properties in which it might be interested became available for purchase.
however,seminerio also violated the contracts prohibition against lobbying state entities by directly exploiting his official position and assisting medisys before the state legislature and various state agencies.in march,for example,seminerio wrote a letter on state assembly letterhead stationery to the new york state senate majority leader asking him to restore millions of dollars in funding to the hospital indigent care pool,an important source of funding for jamaica hospital.in seminerio legislation in the assembly specifically to allow jamaica hospital to restructure its debt so that medisys could acquire more hospitals.in addition,seminerio lobbied the speaker of the assembly regarding medisys participation in a managed care program,and set up a meeting between rosen and the governor chief of staff to discuss debt relief for certain medisys hospitals.in seminerio submitted a funding letter request for the medisys hospitals,sought approval for medisys to acquire two financially ailing hospitals,and urged the speaker of the assembly to reject budget cuts that would have disadvantaged the medisys hospitals.
at every relevant turn,rosen concealed medisys consulting arrangements with seminerio.he did not tell joann ariola,medisys director of intergovernmental affairs,that seminerio had been hired as a consultant,even though ariola served as a liaison with government officials and agencies for medisys.he failed to tell medisys board of directors about the nhp marc contract.nor did rosen disclose the existence of either contract on disclosure forms that medisys was required to complete in order to be eligible to enter into contracts with new york city and new york state.new york city vendor information exchange system vendex questionnaire explicitly asked,are there any individuals now serving in a managerial or consulting capacity who now serve,or within the past five years have served as an elected or appointed official or officer rosen falsely answered no to that question on the vendex questionnaire that he completed on behalf of jamaica hospital in october.again,in,rosen falsely stated on the same form that the only individual connected to medisys who fit that description was ariola,a former assistant commissioner in the office of the new york city mayor.
william boyland.
boyland has served in the new york state assembly since february.prior to and after his election,he was employed as a marketing assistant and outreach coordinator at urban strategies,an ambulatory care clinic at brookdale hospital.urban strategies expected that,given his family stature in the community boyland could use his presence i n the community to try and bring in more patients.however,boyland miss ed quite a number of days,it was unclear what he was doing outside in the community,and he generally was very productive.
nevertheless,at rosen urging,urban strategies continued to pay boyland and,after he was elected to the assembly,changed boyland pay structure so that he would be paid the same amount as a consultant that he had been paid as a employee.in an email exchange in september with medisys chief financial officer and medisys general counsel,rosen stated that boyland needs to come off the payroll of medisys and we will pay him the same money as a consultant.rosen added that he would develop a consulting agreement and reiterated that boyland should come off the payroll so he does have to punch in.by april medisys was paying boyland approximately per year as a community outreach consultant and recruiter for brookdale hospital.
yet from to,boyland failed to provide any material community outreach or recruiting services.indeed,none of the medisys or brookdale hospital employees who testified were able to identify any consulting work boyland had performed or were aware that he was even affiliated with the hospital during that period.although boyland performed little or no consulting work under his contract,he assisted medisys and brookdale hospital in his official capacity as an assemblyman.in february boyland wrote a letter to the speaker of the assembly requesting that be allocated to programs supporting brookdale hospital.three years later,boyland made a similar funding request to the assembly to benefit jamaica hospital,which was not in his assembly district.
as with seminerio,rosen failed to disclose the consulting arrangement between brookdale hospital and boyland in the required disclosure forms submitted to new york city and new york state.in,for example,rosen completed a vendex form on which he falsely denied that any elected or appointed officials were working for brookdale hospital in a consulting or managerial capacity.in rosen completed an updated vendex form on which he finally disclosed that boyland was a consultant for brookdale hospital.but even there,rosen misrepresented that the consulting arrangement had not begun until.boyland,too,lied repeatedly about his arrangement with brookdale hospital on his annual disclosure forms filed with new york state.
carl kruger 
from to carl kruger served as a senator in the new york state senate for the senate district.during that period,kruger was a partner in a consulting company,adex management adex,together with michael and gerard turano and solomon kalish.in kruger began pressuring rosen to award a contract to compassionate care hospice,a company that had hired adex to help it obtain hospice contracts.while medisys was evaluating the potential compassionate care contract,kruger began exploiting his official position and his ties to state government officials to benefit medisys.in november,for example,kruger secured in state funding for brookdale hospital,which he referenced in a letter to rosen as phase i of his relationship with medisys.in kruger secured a equipment grant for jamaica hospital and actively supported medisys attempt to take control of two financially failing hospitals.at trial,a compassionate care employee testified that she spoke with kalish about kruger efforts to help compassionate care get the contract with medisys by doing favors for rosen.
because of kruger interest in compassionate care,rosen ultimately agreed to award it the contract despite objections from other medisys employees,including medisys chief operating officer coo.rosen told the coo that he was getting a lot of pressure from kruger,and that he ha d to do this.in september rosen ordered the contract finalized and instructed the coo to sign it and give it to kruger.
procedural history 
as relevant to this appeal,in connection with the bribes paid to seminerio,boyland,and kruger,rosen was charged with honest services mail fraud count five and honest services wire fraud count six,in violation of,and.rosen was also charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and violate the travel act,in violation of counts seven and nine,in connection with the bribes paid to seminerio and boyland,and with honest services fraud conspiracy,in violation of count eight,in connection with the bribes paid to boyland.
during an bench trial,rosen sought to show,among other things,that he relied on the advice of counsel kalkines regarding the legality of the consulting agreements with seminerio and marc.kalkines had been named as an unindicted in the indictment and had informed rosen that he would assert his fifth amendment right not to testify if rosen called him as a witness at trial.rosen moved for an order compelling the government to immunize kalkines or for dismissal of the pending charges.the district court denied rosen motion.
in september the district court issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.those findings of fact reflected,among other things,the district court assessment of the demeanor and reliability of each of the witnesses and the court drawing of reasonable inferences from the testimony it found credible and persuasive.the district court first addressed the evidence relating to seminerio,finding that b oth from the way the consultancy was initially handled and from subsequent events,the consulting arrangement was a disguised bribe,necessary to assure seminerio legislative support for medisys.it further found that the principal purpose of the nhp marc and jamaica hospital marc contracts was to provide a plausible cover for the bribes rosen intended to funnel to seminerio.after finding that virtually every service seminerio rendered for medisys was undertaken in his capacity as an assemblyman,the district court determined that seminerio never rendered any material consulting services to medisys at any time here relevant,and rosen well knew this.the district court also found that,g iven rosen intimate knowledge of the arrangements with seminerio,rosen failure to disclose the consulting agreements w as intentional and bespeak s an effort on rosen part to conceal arrangements with seminerio that he knew could not bear scrutiny because they were bribes.
turning to the charges relating to boyland,the district court found that boyland,did not perform any material community outreach or recruitment services for urban strategies,that boyland had instead earned the bribe being approved by rosen by assisting medisys through official acts taken in his capacity as assemblyman,and that rosen had improperly failed to disclose the relationship.as for kruger,the district court found that rosen fully agreed to what he clearly knew was a solicitation of a bribe,an offer of kruger official assistance in exchange for rosen promise that he would get the compassionate care contract done.furthermore,the court referred to rosen decision to stop trying to execute the compassionate care contract immediately following seminerio arrest as an act itself reflecting his consciousness of guilt.
the district court concluded that the evidence has shown,beyond any reasonable dispute,that rosen conferred benefits,or sought to confer benefits,on seminerio,boyland,and kruger in return for acts to be taken in their official capacities,thus satisfying the quid pro quo requirement of each of the charges against rosen at issue on appeal.it found that e ach of these arrangements,involved a corrupt agreement or conspiracy,into which rosen entered knowingly,willfully,and with a specific intent to bribe the legislators and thereby deprive their constituents of their honest services.based on these extensive factual findings,the district court convicted rosen of all the remaining charges and,in may,sentenced rosen principally to a term of months imprisonment.
discussion 
rosen appeal raises three primary issues.first,we consider rosen argument that the federal bribery and honest services fraud statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutionally vague as applied to his conduct second,we review whether the government evidence was legally sufficient to prove the existence of the requisite quid pro quo arrangements and to support rosen convictions beyond a reasonable doubt.third,we consider whether the district court erred when it denied rosen motion to compel the government to provide defense witness immunity to kalkines.
void for vagueness 
rosen argues that the government theory of bribery was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment because it included conduct that is lawful.specifically,he urges that the boundaries of the as opportunities arise theory are unclear,the new york state public officers law permitted the consulting contracts,and the legislators engaged in routine official acts.
t he doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.united states morrison,cir quotation marks omitted see skilling united states,d.the doctrine addresses concerns about fair notice and arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions.skilling.at.although a law has to provide minimal guidelines in the form of explicit standards regarding what conduct is unlawful,it need not achieve meticulous specificity,which would come at the cost of flexibility and reasonable breadth.mannix phillips,cir quotation marks omitted.the need for flexibility is especially important in the context of criminal laws aimed at public corruption.in determining whether a statute satisfies the fair notice prong,we ask whether the statute,either standing alone or as construed,made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant conduct was criminal.id.quotation marks omitted.
quid pro quo agreements 
here,each of the crimes of conviction could be proven by evidence of an illegal quid pro quo agreement,which we have previously defined as a government official receipt of a benefit in exchange for an act he has performed,or promised to perform,in the exercise of his official authority.united states ganim,cir see pub.off.law a prohibiting exchanges intended to influence a state legislator in his official duties.to establish the corrupt intent necessary to a bribery conviction,the government must prove that the defendant had a specific intent to give something of value in exchange for an official act,united states alfisi,cir emphasis in original quoting united states sun diamond growers of,d,which generally includes any act taken under color of official authority,ganim,at.we have made it crystal clear that the federal bribery and honest services fraud statutes that rosen was convicted of violating criminalize scheme s involving payments at regular intervals in exchange for specific official acts as the opportunities to commit those acts arise,even if the opportunity to undertake the requested act has not arisen,id.at,and even if the payment is not exchanged for a particular act but given with the expectation that the official will exercise particular kinds of influence,united states coyne,cir.once the quid pro quo has been established,the specific transactions comprising the illegal scheme need not match up this for that.ganim,at.
with these principles in mind,we conclude that rosen had notice that paying state legislators to take official action on his or medisys behalf as the opportunities for those actions arose was plainly unlawful.here,the boundaries of the as opportunities arise theory are well established,and rosen conduct was clearly unlawful under the statutes that he was convicted of violating.indeed,it has always been as plain as a pikestaff that bribes and kickbacks are prohibited.skilling.at quotation marks omitted.the illegality of an as opportunities arise quid pro quo agreement has been established in this circuit for more than two decades.see coyne,at.and,critically,the requirement that the government prove a defendant specific intent to bribe eliminates the possibility that he will be prosecuted for bribery without fair notice.see skilling.at.we therefore reject rosen vagueness challenge to the extent he attacks the as opportunities arise theory as a general matter.
new york state public officers law 
more specifically,we reject rosen argument that he lacked fair notice that his activities were unlawful because the consulting agreements with seminerio were authorized by the new york state public officers law.to be sure,the public officers law permits members of the state legislature,whose elected positions are technically,to maintain outside employment.but the same statute also clearly prohibits legislators from doing what rosen understood seminerio was doing,namely,accepting compensation for services related to state legislative activity or matters before any state agency,see pub.off.law,or accepting anything of more than nominal value under circumstances in which it could reasonably be inferred that the gift was intended to influence him in the performance of his official duties or was intended as a reward for any official action,id.a.similarly,new york code of conduct for public officers provides that n o member of the legislature should accept other employment which will impair his independence of judgment in the exercise of his official duties.id.a.
rosen asserts that the nhp marc and jamaica hospital marc consulting agreements were lawful because they called for seminerio to consult only on matters.both contracts explicitly stated that marc shall not provide any consulting services in respect of any unit or agency of the state of new york,including the state legislature,and it may well be true that consulting services provided in accordance with the agreements would have been lawful under the public officers law.having determined that rosen bribed seminerio to help the medisys hospitals obtain or attempt to obtain important state funding emphasis added,however,the district court properly rejected rosen urged conclusion and explicitly found that the agreements were a sham intended to provide a plausible cover for the bribes.it also found that rosen entered into the quid pro quo agreements with a specific intent to bribe the legislators,making clear that rosen acted with the requisite mens rea.see skilling.at.although rosen insists that this finding was clearly erroneous,we disagree.based on the trial record,we can not say that the district court factual finding of specific intent to bribe a legislator in exchange for illegal conduct in violation of the public officers law constituted clear error.we therefore reject the challenge to rosen convictions relating to seminerio.
in urging a contrary conclusion,rosen argues that,where state law might be regarded as permitting at least part of a defendant conduct,we should repudiate the government as opportunities arise theory of prosecution and require proof of an explicit promise to perform official acts in exchange for the promised benefit.outside the unique context of campaign contributions,see mccormick united states,d,we have not,in the context of bribery cases,required proof of an express promise regarding the specific official acts to be undertaken as part of the exchange.for one thing,our reluctance to require such proof is consistent with providing the government significant flexibility in its efforts to prosecute political corruption.it also reflects our view that donors and recipients engaged in ongoing bribery schemes do not always spell out in advance the specific match between gift and act.ganim,at.for that reason,we have held that a promise to perform such acts as the opportunities arise is sufficient,united states bruno,cir quotation marks omitted,and the existence of such an agreement may be implied from the defendant words and actions,ganim,at.we decline rosen invitation to expand mccormick by requiring proof of an express promise in this case.see united states garcia,cir.
routine official acts 
rosen also contends that he lacked fair notice that his conduct was illegal because we have sanctioned the as opportunities arise theory of quid pro quo bribery only in cases involving intrinsically corrupt acts,not routine legislative acts that are consistent with the interests of the official constituents.we disagree.payments to state legislators may constitute bribes even if the legislator resulting actions are otherwise routine such as voting in a certain manner or supporting grants to certain businesses.indeed,rosen acknowledged at oral argument that state officials are not permitted to receive compensation to influence a vote.tr.of oral arg.at.moreover,the corrupt intent that is central to an illegal quid pro quo exchange persists even thou
