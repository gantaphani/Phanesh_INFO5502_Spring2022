plaintiffs daniel and patricia defabio appeal from a september,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york bianco,granting defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs claims brought pursuant to alleging violations of daniel rights to freedom of speech,freedom of association,due process and equal protection under the first and fourteenth amendments,as well as related state law claims.we hold that in a case involving a student assertion of a first amendment right to return to school and make a statement disavowing a racial slur attributed to him,the school officials alleged to have violated the student rights were entitled to qualified immunity from such claims where the record demonstrates a significant probability that the student would be assaulted were he permitted to return to school and deliver his message.
i.the facts 
drawing all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the appellants,as we must when reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment,see,city of n,cir,the events that follow took place in the spring and summer of in east hampton,new york.on friday,april,andres felipe,a hispanic student at east hampton high school,was killed in a motorcycle accident.the following monday,april,was a day of mourning in the school.remorse among friends turned to outrage when a rumor spread through the school that daniel defabio,a tenth grader at the school,had commented to a friend in reference to ethnic background one down,forty thousand to go.students were openly hostile toward daniel throughout the day,some threatening to kill him and bomb his house.in the cafeteria during eighth period a group of four or five hispanic students confronted daniel and yelled that he was a racist.one of the students threw something at him.ralph naglieri,a school psychiatrist,physically removed daniel from the cafeteria after hearing from a distraught student a report of the comment attributed to daniel and the resulting commotion.daniel did not resist being removed from the lunch room.
naglieri took daniel to the nurse office.soon thereafter a crowd of agitated students assembled outside,yelling at daniel and threatening to kill him.daniel was uncomfortable and afraid.the school principal,scott farina,arrived in the nurse office,asked daniel what had transpired that day,and called the police to assist in escorting daniel out of school.a police officer arrived in the nurse office,daniel put on his backpack,and,flanked by the police officer and one school administrator,daniel ran out of the school.as daniel departed,students yelled at him in spanish.farina informed daniel mother,patricia defabio,that daniel was being sent home for his own protection and that daniel should stay home for a few days until the atmosphere in the school had calmed down.
the following day daniel mother asked principal farina to read over the school public address system a letter from daniel declaring his innocence.she requested,in the alternative,that the school permit daniel to read the statement during a school assembly or that the school distribute the statement to the students in written form.principal farina denied all of these requests,citing the risk that any statement could further aggravate tensions in the school.in the days following april,daniel received a number of threatening phone calls at his house as well as a threatening message in spanish on his cell phone.in light of threats heard by farina that students were planning to burn daniel house,police were assigned to patrol outside of the defabio household for the remainder of the week.
on april,patricia defabio and her partner,michael rusinsky daniel parents,met with farina,assistant principal michael burns,and guidance counselor caryn lieber to discuss the events of the past days.farina advised daniel parents that daniel could not immediately return to school in light of concerns for his safety.daniel parents disagreed and argued strenuously that the best course of action would be to allow daniel to return to school to address the rumor.farina denied their request citing the need to preserve order and calm in the school.daniel wanted in some way to return to school,but was also pretty scared.daniel parents acknowledged during this meeting that they felt intimidated in their home.
the next morning,april,an attorney hired by daniel parents contacted the school to inquire when daniel would be readmitted to school.that afternoon daniel received a letter from principal farina informing him that he would be suspended for five days,that daniel was entitled to an informal hearing and that he had hours to inform farina if he wanted a hearing.the letter also noted that,because of the seriousness of the infraction,a superintendent meeting might be held,and that if so,daniel would receive notice from the superintendent office.
a week later a superintendent meeting was held.daniel attended the meeting,venturing out of his house for the first time since the day of the incident.two students testified against daniel.superintendent raymond gualtieri found that daniel had made the comment alleged and suspended daniel for the remainder of the school year.daniel received home tutoring for that time period.
following the meeting,principal farina accompanied daniel to a meeting with twelve student representatives of the latin american community in east hampton high school.at the meeting,daniel told the students that he did not originate the offending statement but that he had merely repeated the comment to a friend,stating preliminarily that you would not believe the terrible thing that i just heard someone say in the hallway.at this meeting with the twelve students,daniel also distributed the written statement that he had earlier requested the school to read or otherwise distribute most of the students told daniel that they did not believe him.their conclusion was informed in part by daniel failure to return to school following the found his absence and silence consistent with guilt.farina informed the students that he had not allowed daniel back in school and had denied daniel request to distribute his statement.
on may,daniel appealed superintendent gualtieri adverse decision to the board of education,which upheld the decision.daniel further appealed to the new york commissioner of education.the commissioner of education annulled daniel suspension and overturned the superintendent finding.the incident was expunged from daniel record.the commissioner found that the record contained insufficient evidence that daniel had been the originator of the offending comment.
during the summer of,various individuals of hispanic background threatened daniel at the marina where he worked.one of them attempted to get onto a boat where daniel was working to fight him but was stopped by the first mate.on two or three occasions while daniel was riding in a car various individuals cursed at him and threatened his life.once while at a gas station a hispanic individual confronted daniel and told daniel that he was lucky he did get pop ped.in august of,daniel and his family decided that for daniel safety he would attend school in california the following year.daniel never returned to east hampton high school.
ii.procedural history 
in april daniel and patricia defabio filed a civil rights action against east hampton union free school district the district,and principal farina,superintendent gualtieri,and the members of the east hampton union free school district board of education in their individual and official capacities the individual defendants.the complaint alleged that the district and the individual defendants had violated daniel rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association under the first amendment,and to due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.appellants also asserted claims under new york state law.following discovery,the district and the individual defendants the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the defendants motion.
the district court addressed daniel first amendment claims on the merits and concluded that they were unavailing in light of controlling supreme court and second circuit precedent.the court held in the alternative that even if daniel had shown that his free speech rights were violated,the district could not be found liable because the plaintiffs had adduced no evidence of a policy or custom resulting in any putative violation.see monell dep t of soc,holding that municipalities may not be held liable under for the constitutional torts of employees under a theory of respondeat superior,but may be found liable when employees act pursuant to a policy or custom established by the municipality.the court also held the individual defendants were sheltered from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity.see harlow fitzgerald,holding that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.insofar as daniel claimed that his rights to freedom of association,equal protection and due process were violated,the district court considered the merits of these claims and found them unpersuasive.having determined that daniel federal claims were without merit,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over daniel state law claims.
iii.daniel claims against the district 
to the extent appellants maintain their claims under asserting constitutional violations against the district on appeal,they have failed to address the district court rationale that any alleged violation of daniel rights did not occur pursuant to a policy or custom established by the district.monell,u.at.we find the district court reasoning on this point to be persuasive.appellants have thus waived any appeal from the district court decision dismissing the claims against the district on that basis.see norton sam club,cir issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.furthermore,nothing in the record suggests that the district has in place any policy or custom that would have subverted daniel constitutional rights.
iv.daniel claims against the individual defendants 
first amendment claims 
in light of the record in this case,we hold that the individual defendants have qualified immunity with respect to appellants first amendment claims.qualified immunity is available to the individual defendants with respect to the limitations on daniel speech and his removal from school if either their conduct did not violate clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known,or it was objectively reasonable to believe that their acts did not violate these clearly established rights.young county of fulton,cir.assuming arguendo that daniel had a clearly established right under the first amendment to return to school following april,or to be permitted to address his classmates on school property regarding the events of that day,although we doubt that such a right existed under the circumstances presented here,it was objectively reasonable for the individual defendants to believe that they were acting within constitutional and statutory bounds,wilkinson russell,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted,in prohibiting daniel return to east hampton high school in light of repeated and serious threats to daniel physical safety.
student speech 
the maxim that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,is and with limitations.speech that can reasonably be regarded as encouraging illegal drug use may be restricted by school administrators.morse frederick.schools may impose sanctions upon students for vulgar and lewd speech that serves to undermine the school basic educational mission.bethel sch.dist.fraser.speech that could be perceived as affirmatively promoted by the school,as opposed to merely tolerated,may be further restricted so long as the school limitation is reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier.student speech that does not fall within any of the above exceptions remains governed by the standard announced in tinker it may be restricted if the speech will materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.tinker,at.to the extent that a school is in most instances a forum,the school limitations on student speech need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.make the by walking,turner,cir 
ii.daniel individual speech 
with respect to the statement that daniel wished to make on his own,without the assistance of the school,it did not involve drugs,was not lewd or vulgar,and could not have been perceived to be.the rule announced in tinker,therefore,delineates our review of the individual defendants alleged violation of daniel first amendment rights.applying tinker,the relevant inquiry is whether the record demonstrate s facts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.tinker,at.
appellants assert that there was nothing on the face of daniel message which could lead to a determination that its dissemination would risk a material disruption at the school,and that the district court erred in focusing on the atmosphere at school,not the speech being prohibited.appellants br.at.appellants misread tinker.the court focus in tinker was not on the contours of the specific message the petitioners sought to convey by wearing black arm message itself was simple and opposition to the war in vietnam.tinker,at.the court focus was on the extent to which the speech would be accompanied by disorder or disturbance on the part of the petitioners.id.at.in contradistinction to the facts presented in tinker,the supreme court cited blackwell issaquena county board of education,cir,where the fifth circuit upheld the enforcement of a similar ban because the students wearing freedom buttons harassed students who did not wear them and created much disturbance.tinker,at.the court explained that in order for a school to suppress student speech on the grounds of preventing material disruption in the school,administrators must have more than an undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance and must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.id.at.
appellants also cite governor wentworth regional school district hendrickson,d in support of their argument that the district court was required to undergo an review of the context of daniel speech.the court in hendrickson confronted a school prohibition on students wearing an patch and struggled with the question of how and where to draw the line between a reasonable and legally sufficient fear of disturbance,and one that is merely undifferentiated.hendrickson,d at.here,however,we do not face any difficulty in line drawing.there is no question that daniel mere presence in the school,with or without his speech,would likely result in violence or the threat of violence and would therefore materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.tinker,at see guiles marineau,cir explaining that while tinker was not entirely clear as to what constitutes substantial interference,violence or the threat of violence would undoubtedly qualify.the record shows,inter alia,that police were assigned to protect the defabio home,daniel parents felt intimidated in their home,daniel received death threats,and he admitted he was scared to return to school.the fact that hostility towards daniel continued throughout the summer of also speaks to the danger that daniel faced were he to return to school in the months following the incident.
