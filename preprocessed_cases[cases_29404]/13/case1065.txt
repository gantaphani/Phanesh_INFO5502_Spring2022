plaintiff jane doe,on behalf of herself and her three children the doe children and,jointly with doe,plaintiffs,brought this action against defendants andrew whelan,david williams,and kenneth mysogland,three employees of the connecticut department of children and families dcf.plaintiffs allege that the removal of the doe children from doe home without a court order violated their rights to due process of law and to freedom from unreasonable seizures under the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the united states district court for the district of connecticut tucker melan√ßon,judge,of the western district of louisiana,sitting by designation granted summary judgment to the defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.plaintiffs appealed.
we now hold,based on undisputed facts in the record,that the defendants decision to remove the children without parental consent or a court order was justified by an objectively reasonable belief that there was an imminent threat to the children safety.the defendants are therefore protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity and,accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the events giving rise to this litigation began on april,when richard roe roe,the doe children father,was arrested after assaulting a pregnant jane doe in their residence.red.the children then aged seven years,four years,and months old were at home during the assault.the dcf report of the incident authored by defendant williams noted that the f ather seriously physically hurt the mother by punching her in the face multiple times causing significant injuries to the week pregnant mother.joint app x.the report also noted that there had been previous assaults,and that actions taken thus far were not adequate in regards sic to protecting the children.id.

on june,defendant whelan,a social work supervisor at dcf,learned that the case was being assigned to him.whelan spoke with prior dcf workers and reviewed the case files.at that time,the previous two service plans governing arrangements between richard roe,jane doe,and the doe children had expired,but the protective order of the superior court directed at roe remained in effect 
on june,whelan went to doe home in new canaan,connecticut,accompanied by two new canaan police officers,to conduct a dcf welfare check.joint app x.upon arrival,whelan noticed that roe car was in the driveway and his personal items were in the house.in response to questioning,doe eventually admitted that she had permitted roe to accompany her and the children to her home in violation of the superior court protective order so that roe could tuck the children into bed.while at the home,whelan also observed roe run into the nearby woods with no shirt or shoes,likely having jumped out of a window.
whelan promptly sought and received authorization from defendant mysogland,a program supervisor at dcf,to remove the children pursuant to connecticut general statute f,which authorizes dcf to remove children from the custody of their parents for up to hours if dcf has probable cause to believe that the child or any other child in the household is in imminent risk of physical harm from the child surroundings and that immediate removal from such surroundings is necessary to ensure the child safety.e.the children were removed at and transported to the home of richard roe sister in branford,connecticut.

ii.discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.appellant br.we review de novo an order granting summary judgment and resolv e all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.burg gosselin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we affirm when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
as we have explained,in emergency circumstances,a child may be taken into custody by a responsible state official without court authorization or parental consent.southerland city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.such a state official is entitled to qualified immunity from actions under unless the official conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right.pearson callahan,d.where the law is clearly established,a caseworker is entitled to qualified immunity if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the legality of the action at issue in its particular factual context.southerland,at internal quotation marks omitted accord malley briggs,d.
although this inquiry is known as the objective reasonableness test,see lennon miller,cir,qualified immunity does not require application of a single reasonable person standard as that concept is understood in the law of torts rather,qualified immunity shields from liability state officials tasked with choosing between interrupting parental custody or risking injury to the child provided that there is an objectively reasonable basis for their decision,whichever way they make it.tenenbaum williams,cir emphasis added.
after reviewing the record de novo,we agree with the district court that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.in the circumstances presented here,it was objectively reasonable within the meaning of the law of qualified immunity for the defendants to believe that there was an immediate threat to the safety of the doe children and a risk that the doe children would be left bereft of care and supervision.doe,wl,at see also id.given the record before the court as to the history between jane doe and richard roe,at a bare minimum,dcf officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the legality of defendants decision emphasis in original.
at the time of removal,the defendants were aware of the contentious history between roe and doe.do
