background 
kirk,a canadian citizen,is a veterinarian who,prior to december,was living and working in the united states pursuant to a trade nafta visa tn visa,which allowed him to stay and work in the united states temporarily because kirk was neither a united states citizen nor a permanent resident alien,under new york law he was not eligible for a veterinarian license.specifically,new york state education law,provides that t o qualify for a license as a veterinarian,an applicant shall be a united states citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the united states.however,effective july,kirk obtained a temporary waiver of requirements because there was a shortage of qualified applicants to fill existing vacancies in veterinary medicine.educ.law mckinney.thus,the state of new york granted kirk a limited license,which allowed him to practice veterinary medicine in new york for four years the license expired in july and could not be extended.had kirk met the requirement of,he would have received a permanent veterinary license,which,unlike the limited license,had no expiration date.
in january,seven months before his limited license was set to expire,kirk sued in the united states district court for the western district of new york pursuant to and challenging the constitutionality of permanent residency and citizenship requirement.specifically,kirk alleged that the law requirement violated the equal protection and supremacy clauses of the united states constitution.the parties filed for summary judgment.in june,the district court held that restriction was unconstitutional and granted summary judgment to kirk.
thereafter,kirk moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to b.while kirk application was pending in the district court,the department appealed and also sought a stay pending appeal from the district court.the department argued that absent a stay of enforcement of the district court determination that was unconstitutional,the department would have no grounds for denying permanent lifetime licensure to kirk,a result that would irreparably injure the department because the license could not be revoked even if the district court decision were overturned on appeal except if kirk committed an act of professional misconduct.see frank mu√±oz,ja.unpersuaded,the district court denied the stay.consequently,the department was required to issue kirk a permanent license,which was the objective of his lawsuit,and which,because of the vagaries of new york education law,could not be revoked by a reversal of the district court judgment.in january,the district court concluded that kirk was a prevailing party under and awarded him in attorney fees and disbursements.
at some point prior to the end of,kirk applied for and received permanent resident status effective december.because he was now a permanent resident,no longer precluded him from obtaining a permanent veterinary license.accordingly,on june,in response to a motion by the department,this court dismissed the appeal as moot and vacated the judgment.
after that dismissal,the department moved in the district court to also vacate the award of attorney fees,arguing that because the judgment had been vacated,kirk had lost his status as a prevailing party for purposes of.the district court denied the motion,holding that because kirk obtained a,material alteration of the parties legal relationship on the merits,which was not later reversed on the merits,kirk is a prevailing party under b.kirk,wl at.

under,when a party succeeds on a claim,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b.p laintiffs may be considered prevailing parties for attorney fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.farrar hobby,d internal quotation marks omitted.to qualify for attorney fees,there must be a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon bd.care home,at.
it is undisputed that kirk initially succeeded on the merits of his claim because the district court found new york state education law unconstitutional.it is equally clear that the district court order brought about a judicially sanctioned change in the parties legal relationship because it required the department to issue kirk a license in july.see texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d the touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which congress sought to promote in the fee statute.accordingly,the department does not dispute that,at some point,kirk received prevailing party status.instead,the department argues that kirk lost that status when we dismissed the appeal as moot and vacated the judgment.
the department urges us to look to language in sole wyner,d,as support for their position that prevailing party status,once achieved,can be subsequently lost.in sole,the supreme court held that a plaintiff who achieves a transient victory at the threshold of an action can gain no award under if,at the end of the litigation,her initial success is undone and she leaves the courthouse emptyhanded.id.at.although the court explicitly limited its holding to a plaintiff who gains a preliminary injunction,but later loses on the merits of his or her case,id.at,the department urges us to apply sole holding here where the appeal on the merits was dismissed as moot and the district court judgment was vacated.in other words,the department contends that under the rule announced in sole,kirk lost his prevailing party status because,when we vacated the judgment that entitled him to attorney fees,his legal victory was reversed,dissolved,or otherwise undone.id.at.we disagree.
in sole,an organizer of an event in which participants were to engage in a naked peace protest at a state beach,brought a first amendment action challenging the state regulation governing clothing in state parks and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.id.at.a day before the event,the organizer moved for and obtained a preliminary injunction.when the district court eventually reached the merits after the event occurred,it denied the organizer a permanent injunction.nonetheless,the court awarded her attorney fees on the theory that she had prevailed because she had initially obtained the preliminary injunction.ultimately the supreme court reversed,holding that p revailing party status does not attend achievement of a preliminary injunction that is reversed,dissolved,or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.id.at.
