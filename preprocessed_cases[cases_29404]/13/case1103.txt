labor organizations and state employees,brought this action in the united states district court for the district of connecticut alfred covello,judge,contending that state officials violated their first amendment right to freedom of association by discriminatorily laying off only union members when reducing the state work force.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants in their official capacities based on a stipulated factual record and dismissed plaintiffs claims the court also dismissed plaintiffs claims against defendants as individuals on the pleadings defendants not having joined the stipulation in their individual capacities.we conclude that,on the stipulated facts,defendants violated plaintiffs rights by targeting union employees for firing based on their union membership.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants and remand to the district court with instructions to grant summary judgment to plaintiffs on their first amendment claim and to craft appropriate equitable relief.we also reverse the district court dismissal on the pleadings of plaintiffs claims against defendants in their individual capacities and remand those claims for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the following facts are drawn from the parties joint rule statement,in which defendants,in their official capacities,and plaintiffs stipulated to certain undisputed material facts defendants did not stipulate to any of these facts in their individual capacities.
state employees bargaining agent coalition sebac is a coalition of thirteen state public employee unions representing approximately connecticut state employees sebac has been designated by connecticut board of labor relations as the exclusive bargaining agent for its constituent unions for the purpose of negotiating and entering into a collective bargaining agreement cba covering certain terms of employment,including health care and pension benefits.in,sebac entered into a cba with connecticut covering all of its constituent unions.the constituent unions also had separate,cbas that covered other terms of employment.all of those cbas were in effect in november december and were scheduled to be in effect for a period of years thereafter.
at all times relevant to the complaint,john rowland was governor of connecticut,and marc ryan was secretary of connecticut office of policy and management.rowland and ryan defendants are sued in both their official and individual capacities.defendants had responsibility under connecticut law for managing connecticut work force and negotiating cbas with state employees.
in november,defendants met with sebac and its constituent unions together with the individual plaintiffs,plaintiffs and sought approximately million in concessions under plaintiffs cbas.at that time,the state of connecticut employed approximately individuals.approximately of these employees were members of sebac constituent unions,and approximately were not union members defendants advised plaintiffs that unless they agreed to these concessions,defendants would fire approximately unionized state employees.although all state employees receive the same health care and pension benefits,defendants intentionally directed their demands for health care and pension concessions and their corresponding threats of termination if the concessions were not granted solely to state union employees.joint local rule a statement.
plaintiffs did not agree to all of the proposed concessions,but instead offered alternative concessions in december,defendants ordered the firing of approximately unionized state employees.these firings were effectuated in the firings and were limited to unionized state employees.no workers were fired.while the fired employees were told that they were being laid off due to economic necessity caused by the state fiscal year budget deficit,the firings in fact had minimal effect on the state fiscal year expenses and were ordered as a means of trying to compel the plaintiff unions to agree to the concessions demanded.id.defendants advised plaintiffs that the firings would be rescinded if plaintiffs agreed to the proposed concessions.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiffs filed the instant action in connecticut district court in february seeking damages against defendants in their personal capacities and injunctive relief against defendants in their official capacities.plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in may,alleging that the firings violated their rights under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,as well as the contract clause.
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on,inter alia,legislative immunity and eleventh amendment sovereign immunity grounds.the district court held that sovereign immunity barred plaintiffs claims for money damages,but not plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief and further discovery was required to determine whether legislative immunity would bar plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief.state emps.bargaining agent coal.rowland,civ,wl.defendants filed an interlocutory appeal.
on appeal,we largely affirmed the district court holdings and sent the case back to the district court for discovery.state emps.bargaining agent coal.rowland,cir.plaintiffs then moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of the claims against defendants in their individual capacities,which the district court denied as untimely.plaintiffs were granted class certification in march.
in june,the parties for summary judgment as to liability,agreeing to brief remedial questions only after the resolution of liability issues.plaintiffs sought summary judgment on the following claims that defendants violated plaintiffs right to free association by a conditioning plaintiffs right to continued public employment on their waiver of their right to join a union,b retaliating against plaintiffs for engaging in union activity and asserting union rights,and c targeting plaintiffs for layoff based on their union membership that defendants violated the contract clause by a conditioning plaintiffs right to continued public employment on plaintiffs waiver of their contract rights under the cba,and b retaliating against plaintiffs for refusing to give up these rights by ordering layoffs of plaintiffs in an effort to compel such a waiver and that defendants violated the equal protection clause by targeting plaintiffs for layoffs based on their union membership defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims,arguing that the district court should reject plaintiffs effort to transform a labor dispute into a constitutional case.defs.mot.for summ.emphasis omitted.as noted above,the parties submitted a joint rule statement,and stipulated that the facts therein would govern the for summary judgment.
in june the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,granted defendants summary judgment,and entered judgment in favor of defendants.plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of their claims against defendants in their individual capacities the denial of their motion for reconsideration of this dismissal and the grant of summary judgment to defendants.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,see nagle marron,cir,and will affirm only if,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.here,there are no disputed issues of fact,as the parties expressly stipulated to the above facts as the basis for adjudicating the summary judgment motions.
first amendment claim 
plaintiffs allege that defendants violated their first amendment right to freedom of association by targeting union employees for termination based on their union membership.plaintiffs concede that defendants have the right to manage the size of the state work force,and may lay off employees based on determinations of work force needs and budgetary constraints.but plaintiffs argue that defendants can not single out members of a constitutionally protected group for termination unless defendants can establish a compelling interest for doing so,and that they utilized the least restrictive means to accomplish those ends,which they argue defendants have not done.appellants br.citation omitted.
the right to free association is a right closely allied to freedom of speech and a right which,like free speech,lies at the foundation of a free society.shelton tucker,see also smith.state highway,noting that first amendment protects the right of an individual to associate with others.the public employee surely can associate and speak freely and petition openly,and he is protected by the first amendment from retaliation for doing so.smith,at.
included in this right to free association is the right of employees to associate in unions.see thomas collins,holding that the rights of assembly and discussion of a union and its members are protected by the first amendment see also smith,at holding that the first amendment does not impose an affirmative obligation on government to recognize and bargain with a union,but suggesting that reasoning might be different if government had tak en steps to prohibit or discourage union membership or association.we ourselves have stated that it can not be questioned that the first amendment protection of speech and associational rights extends to labor union activities.state fed of teachers bd.of educ.members,cir see also int longshoremen ass waterfront comm of harbor,cir the first amendment protection of the right of association extends to labor union activities.
however,we have never articulated a standard for determining whether,and under what circumstances,a public entity employment decisions violate this right to associate in unions.with respect to a public employee right to associate with political parties,the supreme court stated in rutan republican party of illinois that government employers may not condition hiring decisions on political belief and association unless the government has a vital interest in doing so,see also branti finkel,holding that termination of public defenders because they were not affiliated with democratic party violated first amendment elrod burns,holding that public employees who alleged they were discharged because they were not members of sheriff political party stated a first amendment claim keyishian bd.of regents,invalidating state university system prohibition on membership in communist party.the supreme court was concerned that the government would wield its power to interfere with its employees freedom to believe and associate,rutan,at,and noted that conditioning public employment on the provision of support for the favored political party unquestionably inhibits protected belief and association,id.at,quoting elrod,at.it therefore held that hiring based on political party affiliation was subject to strict scrutiny and must be narrowly tailored to further vital government interests.rutan,at see also branti,at requiring an overriding interest of vital importance to fire a public employee solely for his private beliefs citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
conditioning public employment on union membership,no less than on political association,inhibits protected association and interferes with government employees freedom to associate.it is therefore subject to the same strict scrutiny,and may be done only in the most compelling circumstances.rutan,at.the supreme court suggested as much albeit in dicta in smith,when it contrasted the state refusal to recognize and bargain with a union,which did not implicate the first amendment,with taking steps to prohibit or discourage union membership or association,which would likely infringe on first amendment rights.at far from taking steps to prohibit or discourage union membership or association,all that the commission has done in its challenged conduct is simply to ignore the union.that it is free to do.see also collins,at holding that government regulation of unions must not trespass upon the domain set apart for free speech and free assembly.
defendants argue that i n terms of their impact on core political beliefs and association,layoffs based on union membership are not even remotely comparable to layoffs and hiring decisions based on political party affiliation.appellees br.but the first amendment does not protect speech and assembly only to the extent it can be characterized as political,united mine workers of am.state bar ass,and the supreme court first amendment jurisprudence has not distinguished between political parties and other associations.in naacp alabama ex rel.patterson,the supreme court held that state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny,and that it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political,economic,religious or cultural matters.
labor unions are well within this protection.as the supreme court has stated,the constitution protects the associational rights of the members of the union precisely as it does those of the naacp.of trainmen virginia ex rel.state bar.labor unions advocate the economic interest of their members,and historically,unions and their members have also been associated with political advocacy.not only do unions engage directly in partisan electoral politics but labor unions have been predicated on ideas of worker solidarity that are as much political as economic opposition to labor unions,similarly,has at times been based not only on the perceived economic interests of employers,consumers,and workers,but on the perception that unions advocate radical political ideas 
defendants cite elrod assertion that political belief and association constitute the core of those activities protected by the first amendment,at,as indicating that political association is different from union association.but in union cases,the supreme court has emphasized that f ree discussion concerning the conditions in industry and the causes of labor disputes is indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government to shape the destiny of modern industrial society.collins,at,quoting thornhill alabama.further,even if the rule extended only to political organizations,which we have noted above it does not,it would not be easy to classify unions as falling outside the universe of political organizations,given the supreme court recognition that their collective bargaining positions necessarily have powerful political and civic consequences.knox.at.indeed,knox effectively precludes defendants from arguing that cases holding it unconstitutional to fire or refuse to hire union members are distinguishable because defendants here acted not out of hostility to union membership per se,but as a tactic to put pressure on the union in labor negotiations.as knox recognizes,a public employee union positions on wages effectively are positions on public policy.defendants attempt to place this case outside the rutan line of cases is therefore unavailing.
given the principle that union activity is protected by the first amendment,and the applicability of the reasoning in the political patronage cases to union membership,we hold that rutan heightened scrutiny requirement applies to employment decisions based on union membership as defendants concede that they intentionally fired only union members in we now examine whether the terminations were narrowly tailored to further vital government interests.rutan,at.
defendants argue that the state needed to reduce the cost of its work force,and that since plaintiffs refused the proposed cba concessions defendants were forced to lay off union workers to do so.but the stipulated facts make clear that the firings were not tailored to reduce the cost of the state work force.to the contrary,defendants have stipulated that the firings had minimal effect on the state fiscal year expenses,and that the savings realized from the firings did not correlate to the concessions requested from the unions.joint local rule a statement.indeed,the firings were not included in rowland balanced budget plan,which was issued at the same time that the lay
