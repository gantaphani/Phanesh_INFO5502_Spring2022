on january,parole officer spearman received a phone call from a complainant that barner had fired a weapon at him.in response to this information,at of the same day,spearman and several other parole officers attempted to visit barner at his home,but found no one present.the officers remained at the house for about minutes,and spearman sought to call both barner cellphone and that of his mother,to no avail.based on the apparent violation of barner parole conditions,spearman applied for and obtained a parole violation arrest warrant.
on the morning of january,barner reported for his weekly parole office appointment,where he was handcuffed and taken into custody.officer spearman then informed him of the allegations she had received regarding the firearm violation of his parole conditions.barner denied having any firearms and responded no when the parole officers asked if he had a problem with them conducting a search of his residence.although no search had yet been undertaken,barner also signed a property receipt form,which is used by parole officers to inventory property obtained during a search,and which spearman testified was used in this case to document barner consent to the search.at spearman request,barner gave her a key ring with three keys,including one to the outside door of the apartment house,a key to his apartment within,and,what turned out to be,a key to a storage area adjacent to his apartment.barner was taken to his residence by the officers for the search.
during the search,barner was seated in his apartment kitchen.while in the apartment,the officers seized various items,including a quarter bottle of brandy,a switchblade knife without a blade,and a baggie containing crack cocaine.while searching the apartment,an officer noticed a storage room door across the hallway,approximately ten feet away from the entrance to barner apartment,and asked another officer to hand him the key ring.using one of the keys on the ring,the officer entered the storage room where he found four firearms,a bulletproof vest,two loaded magazines of ammunition,a scale,and some marijuana.the firearms and ammunition served as the basis for the charge in the indictment.
following his indictment,barner filed a motion to suppress the items seized from the storage room,arguing that his parole conditions did not include a condition,and even if they did,the search of the storage area exceeded the scope of any such consent.the pretrial proceedings were referred to a magistrate judge,who held an evidentiary hearing.after the hearing,barner further argued that,because he had been placed under arrest prior to the search,he was no longer released to parole when the search took place,and,as a result,the release conditions were no longer in effect.the magistrate judge agreed,and issued a report,recommendation,and order on may,recommending that the suppression motion be granted because at the time of the search,defendant release to parole supervision had been revoked.report,recommendation,and order at,united states barner,cr.may,rro.as to the oral and written consent purportedly given by barner on the day of the search,the magistrate judge concluded that the scope of any such consent extended only to barner apartment proper,and not to the adjacent storage room.
over the government objections,the district court entered a text order adopting the rro,thereby granting barner motion to suppress.on september,the government timely filed this interlocutory appeal seeking review of the suppression order,contending that the evidence ordered suppressed was substantial proof of a material fact in the proceeding,which,if suppressed,would end the government case against barner.
