this appeal concerns the availability of a qualified immunity defense for defendant james abromaitis,the commissioner of the connecticut department of economic and community development decd,who allegedly violated the constitutional rights of plaintiffs african trade information center,mohamoud ahmed,and alan gates by retaliating against them for exercising their free speech rights and by denying them equal protection of the laws.plaintiffs allege that abromaitis violated these rights when he refused to consider their application to serve as connecticut trade representatives to countries on the continent of africa.that refusal,according to plaintiffs,was intended to punish them for speaking out against abromaitis.
abromaitis brings this interlocutory appeal from the february,order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,district judge denying his motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.for the reasons discussed below,we uphold abromaitis claim of qualified immunity on both the free speech and equal protection claims.we therefore reverse and remand with directions to dismiss the complaint to the extent it seeks compensatory and punitive damages from abromaitis.
background 
viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the facts alleged by the plaintiffs,which we accept only for purposes of this appeal,are set forth below.
plaintiffs are international marketing specialists with particular expertise in africa and the middle east.in,largely as a result of their efforts,the connecticut general assembly passed,and the governor of connecticut signed into law,public act,for the purpose of developing trade relations between connecticut and countries on the continent of africa abromaitis opposed this legislation at the time it was being considered by the connecticut legislature.
abromaitis subsequently became commissioner of the decd,and in that capacity he and his staff sought to undermine the effective implementation of the african trade statute.in response,plaintiffs publicly exposed and opposed abromaitis and his staff.see complaint compl.plaintiffs actions took the form of public communications and communications to public officials within the state of connecticut.id.these communications included a meeting on july,with abromaitis and a member of his staff,at which plaintiffs criticized the decd inaction.
because of their expertise in matters of african trade,plaintiffs sought to be appointed by abromaitis as connecticut trade representative to african countries.however,in early september,abromaitis entered into personal service agreements with the connecticut world trade association cwta and equator,equator,to act as connecticut trade representatives to such countries.abromaitis never gave serious consideration to plaintiffs application.rather,to punish them for engaging in protected speech he sought a waiver of connecticut competitive bidding process and rejected their application,despite his knowledge that they were far better qualified for the position than cwta and equator.by doing so,plaintiffs allege,abromaitis violated their free speech rights guaranteed by the first amendment and denied them a fair and equal opportunity to compete for the position,in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the complaint was filed on april.abromaitis moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.by order entered on february,the district court denied the motion.with respect to the equal protection claim,the court concluded that plaintiffs had come forward with sufficient evidence to permit a jury to conclude that abromaitis failed to consider plaintiffs application on an equal footing with the others who sought the contracts,and that he acted with discriminatory intent to retaliate against plaintiffs because of their speech.see ruling on defendant motion for summary judgment,african trade info,abromaitis,cv sru,at.with respect to the first amendment claim,the district court rejected abromaitis defense of qualified immunity.the fact that plaintiffs had no preexisting commercial relationship with the government did not,the court held,affect their right not to be subject to retaliation based on speech.
on march,abromaitis filed the instant interlocutory appeal from the district court ruling.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
plaintiffs contend that we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.we disagree.
ordinarily,an appeal lies only from a final judgment of a district court,since federal law limits appellate jurisdiction to review of final decisions of that court.locurto safir,cir citing.however,a public official qualified immunity is not merely a shield against liability it is also a right not to be forced to litigate the consequences of official conduct.see mitchell forsyth,d.the improper denial of that right is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment,because the right is lost if the case is erroneously allowed to proceed to trial.see id.at.accordingly,under the collateral order doctrine,a denial of a claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable to the extent it turns on an issue of law.see id.at.see also locurto,at.
this appeal turns solely on issues of law.abromaitis concedes,for the purposes of the appeal,the truth of plaintiffs allegations,and contends only that the conduct alleged did not violate a clearly established constitutional right.in such circumstances,an interlocutory appeal from an order denying qualified immunity is permitted.see,munafo metro.transp,cir.
b.the merits 
the first amendment claim 
the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for civil damages when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.see harlow fitzgerald,d.the better approach to resolving such claims is to first determine whether the plaintiffs have alleged a violation of a constitutional right,and then,if they have,to determine whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.see county of sacramento lewis,d.however,this approach is not mandatory.we may,in an appropriate case,decline to rule on the question whether an asserted right exists where,as here,we conclude that it was not clearly established at the relevant time.see horne coughlin,cir.
this is such a case.as discussed below,it squarely raises an issue that was expressly reserved by the supreme court in board of county commissioners umbehr,d whether applicants for new government contracts who have no commercial relationship with the government are protected by the first amendment from retaliation based on speech.however,the merits of this issue are scarcely mentioned in the briefs on appeal,let alone adequately briefed.plaintiffs brief,which devotes barely more than a page to the issue,simply assumes the point,and cites none of the various supreme court decisions on which the right they assert would be based.this cursory briefing would make it all the more perilous for us to render an advisory opinion on the issue.see horne,at.moreover,the issue is not likely to evade judicial review if we do not address it now.see id.declining to decide whether asserted right exists where there was no reason to believe that the issue will repeatedly,or over a substantial time,escape judicial review by reason of qualified immunity.indeed,if standing objections can be met,the issue might be addressed in this very case on remand,as plaintiffs seek injunctive relief as well,and qualified immunity is not a defense when such relief is sought.see id.accordingly,we think the more prudent approach in the circumstances of this case is to refrain from deciding whether the asserted right exists.
three factors are considered in evaluating whether a right was clearly established at the time a defendant acted whether the right in question was defined with reasonable specificity whether the decisional law of the supreme court and the applicable circuit court support the existence of the right in question and whether under preexisting law a reasonable defendant official would have understood that his or her acts were unlawful.shechter comptroller of new york,cir citing francis coughlin,cir.
the chronic difficulty of articulating the right at issue with the appropriate specificity,labounty coughlin,cir,does not afflict this case,as it has been articulated for us by the supreme court in umbehr.for many years before umbehr,the court had consistently held that while the government enjoys significantly greater latitude when it acts in its capacity as an employer than when it acts as sovereign,the first amendment nonetheless prohibits it from punishing its employees in retaliation for the content of their protected speech.locurto,at in branti finkel,d,the court addressed whether a government worker whose political affiliation is not a job qualification was constitutionally protected from dismissal based on his affiliation with a particular party,answering it in the affirmative.see id.at.in rutan republican party of illinois,d,the court expanded that rule by endorsing the right of applicants for public employment not to be rejected based on political affiliation.see id.at.umbehr addressed and answered yet another the protections enjoyed by government employees against termination based on protected speech should be extended to the termination of contracts with independent contractors who do business with the government.see at.the supreme court held that it should,id.at,and in a case decided the same day it also extended to such independent contractors the protection against termination based on political affiliation that branti had conferred on government employees.see truck,city of northlake,d.
in extending first amendment protection to independent contractors with ongoing commercial relationships with the government,umbehr expressly reserved the question whether the right exists absent such a relationship.it did so with the following caveat,which anticipates the first amendment claim in this case w e emphasize the limited nature of our decision today.because umbehr suit concerns the termination of a commercial relationship with the government,we need not address the possibility of suits by bidders or applicants for new government contracts who can not rely on such a relationship.at.thus,the question before us is whether,as of september,a bidder or applicant for a new government contract who lacked a preexisting commercial relationship with the government had a clearly established right not to be denied the contract in retaliation for his or her protected speech.
neither the supreme court nor this court has yet addressed that question,and thus the right asserted by plaintiffs has not been established by decisions of those courts.this is not necessarily an insurmountable barrier to a finding that the right exists,as the supreme court has left open the possibility that a right may be clearly established by decisions of other lower courts.see harlow fitzgerald,at.citing procunier navarette,d.although we have consistently held that our own decisions may support the existence of the right in question,as we recently observed in poe leonard,cir,our decisions send conflicting signals as to whether the decisions of other circuits may do so as well.see id.at citing cases.we need not resolve the issue in this case because the right has not been clearly established by any court.
the only circuit court of appeals that has addressed the question left open by umbehr refused to extend first amendment protection to contractors who do not have an ongoing relationship with the government.see mcclintock eichelberger,cir need for judiciary to avoid intrusion into government contract awards,and risk that such intrusion might discourage political activity,contribute to a principled reason to limit umbehr and to situations in which the retaliatory act is the termination of an ongoing commercial relationship.the district court discounted the significance of mcclintock,asserting that it expressly refused to address the issue reserved by umbehr and now before us.see ruling on defendant motion for summary judgment,african trade info,abromaitis,cv sru,at.we disagree.while the third circuit indeed rejected mcclintock claim on a procedural ground as well,see at,it obviously rejected,as an alternative ground for its existence of the asserted right.we note that lower courts within the third circuit read mcclintock as we do,and have followed it by dismissing claims where plaintiffs did not have the requisite ongoing relationship with the government.see prisma zona exploratoria de puerto rico,calderon,d,allstate transp.southeastern pennsylvania transp,no.civ.a,wl,at.march,halstead motorcycle safety,d.in any event,even if this aspect of mcclintock were mere dicta,as the district court implied,the third circuit rejection of the right asserted by plaintiffs here would weigh against their claim that the right had been clearly established in.
the limited treatment of the issue in the lower courts in this circuit also undermines plaintiffs claim.as late as,the existence of the right was identified as an open question in the circuit.see housing works,turner,d,noting that this court has yet to address whether umbehr may properly be extended to a contractor lacking a preexisting contractual relationship with the government,and reserving judgment on that issue because plaintiff had such a relationship.the only decision within the circuit that extends umbehr to bidders with no preexisting relationship with the government is enterprises,new york city school construction authority,cv,wl,which agrees with the dissent in mcclintock.even if a district court decision could establish a right for the purpose of the qualified immunity inquiry,enterprises would not assist plaintiffs,as they must demonstrate that the right was clearly established in september,three years before that case was decided.
the third factor to consider in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether,under preexisting law,a reasonable official in abromaitis position would have understood that his acts were unlawful.a right may be considered clearly established if the decisions of the supreme court or this court clearly foreshadow a ruling in plaintiff favor.see shabazz coughlin,cir.we doubt that the existence of a constitutional right could ever be considered clearly foreshadowed where,as here,the supreme court has expressly reserved the issue for future decision and not a single circuit court of appeals had addressed it at the time the official acted.in any event,we conclude that a reasonable official in abromaitis position would not have understood from existing case law that it was unconstitutional to refuse to contract with plaintiffs because they had criticized his performance of his official duties 
in sum,we have no doubt that the right asserted here by plaintiffs,if it exists at all,was not clearly established when abromaitis engaged in the challenged conduct.
the equal protection claim 
plaintiffs also assert that abromaitis violated their fourteenth amendment rights by depriving them of equal protection of the laws.abromaitis asserts that he is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim as well because it ultimately depends on the existence of the first amendment right addressed above.we agree with abromaitis.
the equal protection clause requires the government to treat all similarly situated people alike.see harlen assocs.incorporated vill.of mineola,cir citing city of cleburne cleburne living,d.as the supreme court has recently reaffirmed,equal protection claims can be brought by a class of one where a plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam citations omitted.in olech,the plaintiff sought to connect her property to a municipal water supply,but the village of willowbrook the village conditioned its approval on her granting it a easement,which was feet longer than the easements required of other property owners seeking access to the water supply.see id.at.ol
