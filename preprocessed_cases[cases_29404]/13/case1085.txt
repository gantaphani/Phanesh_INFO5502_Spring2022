this appeal concerns a defamation,negligence,and reckless conduct suit by dongguk university of south korea against yale university over a bogus.dongguk university hired shin as an art history professor after yale mistakenly confirmed her doctoral degree.what started out as a straightforward correspondence between universities about a student who sought to teach at one school and claimed she had graduated from the other school,now requires that we determine whether the mistaken answer given by yale is entitled to heightened constitutional protections under the first amendment.dongguk,a prominent korean university,claims that yale acted negligently and engaged in reckless and wanton conduct when responding to an inquiry about whether jeong ah shin had received a from yale.
background 
dongguk initial correspondence with yale 
in august,shin applied for a position as an art history professor at dongguk university in south korea.dongguk,which was founded in is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.app.dongguk is well regarded throughout korea for its buddhist studies curriculum,basic sciences,literature,and cultural programs,and has produced nobel authors and poets.app.the university alumni hold important and prestigious positions in korean business,cultural,and governmental organizations.app.
in her application,shin stated that she had served as the curator for two korean museums and was a lecturer at several well respected korean universities.she also submitted a document to dongguk on yale university letterhead purportedly certifying that she had received a from yale in art history in may the certification.the certification contained an exact reproduction of yale associate dean pamela schirmeister signature but misspelled both schirmeister typed name as schirmestr and the word century in her listed concentration twentieth centry art.app.nevertheless,dongguk hired shin on september.four days later,dongguk sent yale a letter with the certification attached,seeking to verify its authenticity the inquiry letter.the inquiry letter reached schirmeister who responded by fax on september,stating,i am confirming that the attached letter the certification was issued by the yale graduate school and signed by me the schirmeister fax.app.
dongguk requests for clarification from yale 
in early june,nearly two years after hiring shin,dongguk learned that shin may have plagiarized the dissertation that she provided to dongguk.consequently,cho euiyon,director of dongguk office of management and supervision,emailed an inquiry to a yale librarian who responded that yale had no record of shin dissertation.director cho then emailed an inquiry to the graduate registrar for yale art history department mentioning that shin had identified a yale professor as her dissertation advisor.the registrar informed cho that shin had not received a from yale and forwarded the correspondence to the purported advisor who in turn responded to cho that she neither advised shin nor knew of her.
by,the korean press began reaching out to yale regarding shin degree.one reporter told the registrar that i f shin is lying mentioning yale,it would be problematic for yale reputation in korea.app.the registrar forwarded the reporter inquiry to others at yale,noting that she found it very distressing and seem ed to have litigation written all over it.app.thereafter,yale deputy general counsel susan carney and yale dean edward barnaby began referring all media inquiries to yale office of public affairs.in light of the scandal surrounding her credentials,shin resigned from dongguk in late june,and the korean media began reporting that shin may have lied about receiving a yale.
in july,dongguk president youngkyo oh wrote yale president richard levin to determine if shin had received a from yale.president oh noted the contradictory answers dongguk had received from yale on that question in the past and attached the schirmeister fax that had validated shin purported certification.app.deputy general counsel carney prepared a response to oh letter and sought edits from dean barnaby.carney expressed concern about the apparent fax lines on the schirmeister fax transmittal sheets,and the apparent receipt within the dean office of the inquiry but queried whether that is false,too.app.carney was also forwarded an email from a korean museum official that had initially been sent to gila reinstein,assistant director of yale public affairs office who was responsible for shin media inquiries.the email drew attention to the fax number of the associate dean office on the schirmeister.carney commented to the yale president assistant that she and barnaby were troubled about the fax line at the top of the schirmeister fax but noted that it pretty easy to make up fake documents including such lines these days.app.nonetheless,she found it troubling that she had not previously seen the inquiry letter from dongguk,and she referenced the email reinstein had forwarded,pointing out that the schirmeister fax contained indicia of authenticity that seemed to have come from the yale graduate school.app.still,carney did not ask schirmeister if she had sent the fax.instead,she asked yale police department sergeant peter bruno to look into the matter and to determine if shin had an accomplice at yale.the record on appeal does not reflect that the yale police department ultimately conducted any further investigation or interviewed any witnesses on the matter.app.
on july,carney responded to president oh letter and stated that shin was never a student at yale and that the documents that dongguk had provided yale,including shin purported certification and the schirmeister fax,were not authentic.app.she emphasized that she had no knowledge how the documents were issued or if they were provided to dongguk and that yale was investigating the matter.app.dongguk office of management and supervision director cho repeatedly followed up with carney on the results of yale investigation,and carney responded that i nvestigators here are examining the documents and will be making further inquiries.app.
in late august,director cho informed carney that dongguk had learned that the inquiry letter had been delivered on september,to an individual at yale named michael moore,and she provided carney with a postal service tracking record indicating that the letter was signed for by m moore ycm in new haven.app.carney responded that neither ycm nor a michael moore was affiliated with the graduate school office where schirmeister worked.app.cho then responded with a link to the yale central mailroom website,listing michael moore as a staff member.after much correspondence,cho provided carney with the mailing label and receipt for dongguk inquiry letter,but carney never answered cho questions about whether the inquiry letter was ultimately delivered to schirmeister.
media response to shin scandal 
by july,following shin resignation from dongguk,the korean media began reporting extensively on the shin scandal.there were numerous media inquiries directed at yale,and reinstein from the office of public affairs was responsible for responding.on july,reinstein drafted a statement that said that a ny document purporting to support shin claim is false and was not issued from yale,and she sought its approval from public affairs director helaine klasky.app.klasky asked if there was language cleared by the gc office for reinstein to use.id.between july and,carney had sent and received privileged emails related to dongguk,including two that copied reinstein.after reinstein responded to the media inquiries,she was quoted in articles published on july and july as saying that the schirmeister fax was a fake,falsified,and that yale had never received the original inquiry letter.app.dongguk responded to reinstein statements by releasing its internal investigation report,which concluded that dongguk had sent the inquiry letter to yale and received the schirmeister fax,which validated shin doctorate degree,in response.
after receiving additional media inquiries about the schirmeister fax,on july,schirmeister reached out to reinstein about a media inquiry schirmeister had received and schirmeister reached out to carney on whether to reply.following an exchange of privileged emails between carney and reinstein,reinstein told a reporter 
i t is clear that jeong ah shin was never a student at yale.yale has no record of her.
neither pam schirmeister nor any other yale official signed documents affirming that she earned a degree.the phone and fax numbers on the false documents are correct,but that information is public knowledge.if yale had received a request to confirm that shin earned a degree from the graduate school,yale would have responded that she did not.
the documents shin supplied are clearly false the fax that supposedly came from associate dean pamela schirmeister bears no resemblance to the letter her office sends to confirm a degree.in addition,the fax misspells schirmeister,among other errors.
app.emphasis added.
in early august,a south korean television program reported at length about the shin scandal,in which a reporter criticized dongguk for so loosely conducting shin verification.app.the narrator described dongguk receipt of the schirmeister fax as all the action dongguk university had taken to verify shin academic degree and said the fax was a fake.app.reinstein appeared in the program and responding to queries about the schirmeister fax claimed yale would not send out a document like that t his is a false document.i do know how it came into existence.but it not from yale.app.the narrator said that yale disclosed that it had never received a letter requesting verification from dongguk university in september and did not sen d a reply by fax to dongguk university.id.throughout september,reinstein continued responding to reporters questions,repeatedly denying the schirmeister fax authenticity and stating that it bears no resemblance to the letter that dean pamela schirmeister sends when she is actually confirming someone degree.app.
ultimately,the shin scandal was exacerbated by media reports that shin had had an affair with byeon,a senior south korean government official.the scandal included reports that byeon had pressured a dongguk board member to cover up shin fraud and had arranged for government funding of the private temple of dongguk board chairman.while initial stories focused on whether dongguk had done enough to verify shin degree,by the fall of,the korean media focus shifted to byeon and whether he had pressured dongguk to hire shin and thereafter to cover up her false degrees.in late,articles emerged that reported dongguk significant increase in government grants after it hired shin.dongguk alumni and former professors began calling on dongguk president and chairman to resign,contending that their handling of the shin incident denigrate d the members of the community and that the current chaos,triggered by the shin jeong ah scandal,has no end in sight.app.
south korean criminal investigation and yale response 
meanwhile,during the summer of,dongguk filed a criminal complaint against shin for business interference with the korean prosecutor office.but by september,the prosecutor investigation shifted toward dongguk,and they conducted a search of the dongguk campus,including the offices of president oh and the chairman of the board of trustees,and seized documents related to government grant programs and investigations on faculty employment.the investigation resulted in evidence of corruption involving byeon and led to shin arrest in early october.
throughout this time,yale monitored media stories on the korean prosecution,and yale public affairs director klasky observed that yale name was getting dragged through the mud and asked if yale should issue another statement and sen d it to all the korean papers.app.accordingly,public affairs assistant director reinstein drafted a statement in late september that she sent to the media and published on yale website,reasserting that shin never enrolled at yale and that any document stating otherwise is false and was not issued by yale university.app.the korean media reported yale statement with the headline rare statement by yale university,all shin documents forgeries.app.
on october,the attorney office for the district of connecticut,at the request of korean prosecutors,subpoenaed yale for answers on the following questions whether shin was ever enrolled at yale graduate school whether the certification of shin degree was issued by yale whether yale received dongguk inquiry letter in september whom the inquiry letter was delivered to whether and when the inquiry letter was answered and what answer was given.the next day,harold rose,yale associate general counsel,began investigating whether yale had in fact received the inquiry letter.using the postal tracking information for the inquiry letter that deputy general counsel carney had received previously and was enclosed with the subpoena,the yale mailroom quickly confirmed its receipt of the letter and subsequent delivery to the graduate school in september.schirmeister then asked her assistant to look for the inquiry letter.on october,the assistant found dongguk inquiry letter in a file with other correspondence,along with the schirmeister fax that was sent in response.schirmeister provided these documents to rose,who in turn responded to the doj subpoena,stating that yale had received the inquiry letter in september,that schirmeister had responded by fax and confirmed that the certification was issued by yale and signed by her,but that schirmeister now believe d that this answer was an error.app.it is unclear if or when doj provided the response to the korean prosecutor office or if that information was ever provided to dongguk.
on november,over one month after yale discovery of its receipt of the inquiry letter and of its response by fax,carney wrote president oh to correct her misstatement regarding the authenticity of the schirmeister fax in the july letter.she stated that the schirmeister fax was indeed authentic despite her earlier inadvertent statement that it was not authentic and did not follow graduate school format.app.carney reinforced,though,that shin had not received a yale degree and that shin purported certificate was inauthentic.on december,dongguk informed the korean media that yale had confirmed that the schirmeister fax was genuine.as a result,a reporter who had previously spoken with reinstein reached out to her,noting her surprise given reinstein previous statements to the contrary.app.the reporter told reinstein that the focus of his story had shifted to why schirmeister sent the fax,which reinstein had previously said was of a totally different format from what yale would send.app.after reinstein forwarded the email to carney,yale released a statement that,r espond ing quickly to what appeared to be a routine request,yale staff mistakenly relied on the letterhead and signature on the certification and failed to recognize it as fabricated.app.the statement emphasized that yale initial review suggested that the schirmeister fax had not been sent by the graduate school but that a more thorough investigation and document search concluded that yale indeed erroneously verified the certification as a result of an administrative error.id.
dongguk contends that as a result of the shin scandal,the university suffered a substantial financial loss.dongguk applications for government grant funding were rejected,which dongguk asserts was due to yale false statements,the widely covered reports of dongguk wrongdoing,and the korean prosecutors investigation of dongguk and the ministry of education.app.additionally,numerous individuals who had pledged donations to dongguk as part of president oh substantial fundraising campaign revoked their pledges.finally,dongguk contends that it was publicly humiliated and deeply shamed in the eyes of the korean population as a result of the shin scandal and that its reputational injury affected its dignity and credibility as a university.app.the wall street journal reports that shin ultimately served months in prison for embezzlement and falsifying academic records.jaeyon woo,disgraced curator returns with her memoirs,wall.
ii.procedural history 
in march,dongguk filed a complaint against yale in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alleging defamation,negligence,and reckless and wanton conduct claims under connecticut state law.the defamation claim was based on statements by yale to the korean media that it never received the inquiry letter and never sent the schirmeister fax.the negligence claim was based on schirmeister incorrect statement in the schirmeister fax,carney incorrect statement in her july letter to oh that the schirmeister fax was inauthentic,and yale statement on its website that the schirmeister fax was not issued by yale.the reckless and wanton conduct claim was based on schirmeister failure to accurately verify shin degree,carney failure to determine the authenticity of the schirmeister fax,and yale statements to third parties that it never received the inquiry letter or sent the schirmeister fax.
in february,the district court granted summary judgment for yale on the reckless and wanton conduct claim but allowed the defamation and negligence claims to go forward,while limiting the defamation claim to certain damages and the negligence claim to statements made directly to dongguk.dongguk yale,cv tlm,wl.yale moved for reconsideration,and in june,the district court granted the motion and entered judgment for yale on all counts.dongguk yale,d.dongguk appealed.
defamation claim 
dongguk defamation claim is premised on yale communications with the korean media during three different time frames its statements in july,its statements in august and september,and its failure to expeditiously correct its misstatements after it discovered its error in october.for the first and second time frames,dongguk appeal is limited to carney conduct in approving and crafting reinstein statements.for the third time frame,dongguk claim involves numerous yale employees actions,including carney,reinstein,and klasky.dongguk concedes that the defamatory statements addressed public figures and matters of public concern.app.dongguk university is one of the most important academic institutions in korea.see also oral arg,dongguk counsel conceding that as of,carney could certainly say it foreseeable that we know this is a matter of national importance in korea.
under connecticut law,each statement is a separate cause of action and requires proof of each of the elements for defamation.cweklinsky mobil chem.to make out a defamation claim,dongguk must prove that yale was responsible for the publication of a defamatory statement identifying dongguk to a third person and that dongguk suffered injury as a result of the statement.see id.additionally,when a defamatory statement is allegedly made about a public figure,the plaintiff has a heightened burden and must prove that the statement was published with actual malice.curtis publ g butts,d see also young am.mini theatres,d recognizing that under new york times sullivan,d,the first amendment places limitations on the states power to enforce their libel laws.
actual malice standard 
we evaluate whether a party is a public figure based on clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community,and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society.gertz robert welch,d.if we determine that the party is such a public figure,then the plaintiff has the added burden of proving that the allegedly defamatory statement was published with actual malice,that is with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times,at.this includes when a defendant acts with a high degree of awareness of the statement probable falsity or if the defendant entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.harte hanks commc ns,connaughton,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.actual malice can be established using circumstantial evidence.celle filipino reporter enters,cir.
under connecticut law,actual malice must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.dacey.bar ass n.the supreme court requires proof of actual malice by convincing clarity,new york times,at,which the connecticut supreme court has interpreted as requiring that the the probability that the facts asserted are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist.dacey,at.clear and convincing proof is highly probable and leaves no substantial doubt.holbrook casazza,citing gertz,at.
when there are multiple actors involved in an organizational defendant publication of a defamatory statement,the plaintiff must identify the individual responsible for publication of a statement,and it is that individual the plaintiff must prove acted with actual malice.see new york times,at t he state of mind required for actual malice would have to be brought home to the persons in the defendant organization having responsibility for the publication of the statement.see also holbrook harman,cir w here,as here,the defendant is an institution rather than an individual,the question is whether the individual responsible for the statement publication acted with the requisite culpable state of mind.
failure to investigate as actual malice 
generally,mere proof of failure to investigate,without more,can not establish reckless disregard for the truth.gertz,at holding no actual malice by defendant failure to investigate.in new york times,the supreme court held that a defendant reliance on a responsible source negates a finding of the recklessness that is required for a finding of actual malice.at.similarly,this court has held that where reporters false statements in an article were based on reliable sources,the defendants could hardly be accused of gross negligence,much less actual malice.miller news syndicate,cir.
but evidence of an intent to avoid the truth can be sufficient to satisfy the actual malice standard.harte hanks,at.while a publisher who does not already have obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of a story is not required to initiate an investigation that might plant such doubt,o nce doubt exists,the publisher must act reasonably in dispelling it.masson new yorker magazine,cir.thus,when there is evidence that the defendant acted with a high degree of awareness of a statement probable falsity,garrison louisiana,d,or that the defendant entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication,amant thompson,d,or that the defendant acted with the purposeful avoidance of the truth,harte hanks,at,then the defendant failure to investigate can demonstrate actual malice.
application of actual malice standard to yale statements and conduct 
in the instant action,dongguk alleges that yale made defamatory statements in july and during august and september and that it failed to correct its defamatory statements after october.as stated,the parties concede that the actual malice standard applies to these statements.in applying this standard,we will only consider whether the individual at yale who was responsible for publication of the defamatory statement acted with the state of mind required for actual malice.for the affirmative statements,dongguk limits its argument to carney state of mind and concedes that if it fails to prove that carney was responsible for the publication,then it can not succeed on its defamation claim based on these statements.oral arg.
the allegedly defamatory statements at issue during july include the following public affairs assistant director reinstein statements between july and to the korean press denying the authenticity of the schirmeister fax reinstein statement around july that any document purporting to support shin yale degree was not issued by yale and reinstein quotes in articles published on july and that yale never received the inquiry letter,that she looked for the inquiry letter but did not find it,and that schirmeister never signed a document affirming shin degree.the august and september statements are the following reinstein statements during a television interview airing on august that yale never received the inquiry letter from dongguk reinstein statement on september that the schirmeister fax did not look like something schirmeister would send and reinstein statement on september that any document supporting shin claim to a yale degree was false and not issued by yale.
no showing of actual malice by carney 
assuming without deciding that deputy general counsel carney was responsible for the publication of reinstein statements dongguk has failed to demonstrate that carney acted with actual malice.dongguk argues that because carney failed to investigate the truthfulness of reinstein statements despite her serious doubts,carney acted with actual malice.dongguk points to two statements by carney,which it argues indicate carney suspicions regarding the authenticity of the schirmeister fax and yale receipt of the inquiry letter.first is carney july email to barnaby mentioning her concern about the apparent fax lines on the schirmeister fax and the apparent receipt within the dean office of the inquiry letter,and carney comment that maybe that is false,too.app.the second is carney email the next day that barnaby and i were troubled about the fax line although it pretty easy to make up the fake documents including such lines these days.app.dongguk also points to the correspondence on august between carney and the yale police investigator looking into the shin matter to ask whether the investigator knew what ycm was.app.
throughout,carney noted her skepticism about whether the fax line was manufactured.despite dongguk argument that carney never investigated the authenticity of the schirmeister fax,mere proof of failure to investigate,without more does not establish actual malice.gertz,at.here,there is nothing more.the failure to discover a misstatement may demonstrate negligence but it does not establish actual malice.even the failure to review one own files is inadequate to demonstrate malice by the party responsible for publishing a statement.new york times,at.there is no evidence that carney entertained serious doubts as to the truth of reinstein statements,amant,at,or that her decision not to further investigate constitutes the purposeful avoidance of the truth,harte hanks,at.thus,dongguk has failed to provide sufficient clear and convincing proof of actual malice on the part of carney to withstand summary judgment.
b.the significance of yale failure to correct earlier statements 
dongguk also contends that yale failure to expeditiously retract its earlier misstatement can be relevant to establishing yale actual malice at the time the earlier statements were made.thus,dongguk asserts that yale failure to immediately correct its earlier misstatements after schirmeister discovery that she received and responded to the inquiry letter can constitute proof of actual malice.though schirmeister,carney,and reinstein discovered in october that reinstein earlier statements to the press had been incorrect,yale did not inform dongguk of its error until november and did not release a public statement confirming its receipt of the inquiry letter and sending of the schirmeister fax until december.
the actual malice inquiry generally considers the state of mind of the defendant at the time the statement was made.woodcock journal publ g.connecticut courts have held that the failure to correct an earlier misstatement may be relevant to the actual malice inquiry,but this holding has only been applied in circumstances where there was some evidence of actual malice at the time the statements were made.see,holbrook casazza,finding that the refusal to retract a false statement might be relevant to the defendant mental state when there was substantial evidence of animus and the defendant disregard of the probable falsity at the time of the statement torosyan boehringer ingelheim,finding a refusal to retract a statement was relevant to the actual malice inquiry when the defendant was notified it was false when coupled with the finding that the defendant made the statement with improper motives.
here,however,there was no evidence that carney,schirmeister,or reinstein was aware of the probable falsity of the statements at the time they were made or acted with improper motives.furthermore,dongguk never requested a retraction from yale after yale had discovered its error.thus,dongguk evidence of yale failure to expeditiously correct its earlier misstatements fails to provide any further support that any officials at yale acted with actual malice at the time reinstein statements were made.accordingly,we conclude that dongguk has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with regard to actual malice.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to dongguk,we hold that dongguk has failed to present any evidence that any individual at yale who was responsible for publication of a defamatory statement acted with actual malice.for these reasons,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in yale favor on the defamation claim.
negligence claim 
for dongguk to establish a negligence claim against yale under connecticut law,it must establish duty breach of that duty causation and actual injury.sturm harb,llc.on appeal,dongguk challenges three sets of conduct and direct communications by yale as negligent yale erroneous validation of the certification in the schirmeister fax in september yale erroneous statements in july that the schirmeister fax was inauthentic and yale delay in correcting its misstatements after discovering its error in october.the district court dismissed the negligence claims,holding that under hustler magazine,falwell,d,a public figure can not circumvent defamation heightened actual malice standard by calling the claim by another tort name.dongguk,d at.under the district court extension of hustler magazine,if a plaintiff seeks damages for reputational injury from speech,then the plaintiff must prove the defendant acted with actual malice.id.
extension of actual malice standard outside of defamation context 
in hustler magazine,the supreme court extended the new york times actual malice standard for defamation claims about public officials to tort claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress for recovery of damage to reputation caused by speech.at.there,the defendant had published a parody about the plaintiff,jerry falwell and the plaintiff had sued for libel,invasion of privacy,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.at.after a jury awarded damages on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,the supreme court reversed the judgment,noting that while bad motives generally control for the purpose of tort liability,the first amendment prohibits such a result in the area of public debate about public figures.id.at.
the court recently faced this issue again in snyder phelps,d.in snyder,the father of a deceased soldier sued a church that had picketed outside of his son funeral to protest government policy on homosexuality in the military.id.at.after the jury awarded the father damages on an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and a privacy claim,the fourth circuit reversed,concluding that the speech at issue in both claims was protected under the first amendment.id.at.the supreme court,relying on hustler magazine,held that absent actual malice,the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was not actionable because the subject matter of the speech addressed matters of public concern.id.at.the court reasoned that speech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values,and is entitled to special protection.id.at.on the other hand,where matters of purely private significance are at issue,first amendment protections are often less rigorous because restricting such speech does not implicate the same constitutional concerns as limiting speech on matters of public interest.id.at.while the boundaries of the public concern test are not well defined,the supreme court noted that s peech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,or when it is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public.id.at internal quotation marks and citations o
