background 
in may of,the university of connecticut appointed amir faghri to a term of five years as dean of the school of engineering.his letter of appointment stated that he was a management employee,and serve d at the pleasure of the chancellor.the position of chancellor has since been replaced by the position of provost.the letter noted that,as dean,faghri would have a leadership role and must blend that administrative function with the mandates of the strategic plan.
five years later,the university appointed faghri to a second term as dean.this time,his reappointment letter,dated may,did not include a serve at the pleasure of clause.faghri claims that when he and the provost negotiated over his reappointment as dean,he insisted that the letter not contain such a clause.in september of,provost fred maryanski appointed faghri also to a chaired professorship.
during his second term as dean,faghri was an outspoken critic of many university policies.his complaint highlights his criticism of six such policies.first,in february,after serving as a member of a university delegation to dubai to explore the possibility of establishing a regional campus there,he began speaking out against the proposed campus in emails and at university meetings.in those communications,he argued that the dubai government was manipulating the university and that the project was inappropriate.
second,beginning in october,in university meetings and an email sent to the other deans,he opposed a university plan to close the school of allied health,the school of family studies,and the college of continuing education.nicholls,who was then the university provost,claims that in one such meeting faghri verbally attacked him,saying,i do know how any of us can trust you again.faghri made similar complaints in his email to the deans,in which he accused those supporting the plan of being either dishonest or blinded by their own self interests.
third,during deans meetings in and he called for an investigation into the university alleged mismanagement of construction funds related to an initiative entitled uconn.he expressed these concerns in at least four meetings.
fourth,in,he sent a letter to a state senator,opposing funding,which the university supported,for the connecticut center for advanced technology ccat,an independent entity established to research fuel cell technology.faghri letter stated that the leadership of the school of engineering believes the bill funding ccat is fatally flawed for a number of reasons including that ccat lacks the experience,personnel,facilities or the credibility to perform the funded activities.austin also heard that faghri made similar comments to the of a local congressman,which nicholls believed would jeopardize future funding opportunities for the university.
fifth,beginning in december,in emails,meetings,and conversations,faghri criticized the university handling of a federal audit,which resulted in a fine based on the billing practices at the school of engineering.he argued that the university had not defended itself properly and should not pay the fine.he also defended the role of the school of engineering,claiming that it was being singled out for blame.
finally,beginning in faghri complained,in university meetings and emails to various administrators and faculty members,about inadequate university support for faculty researchers.he complained that this lack of support was causing the university to lose top researchers to other institutions.he also warned about declining morale among the engineering faculty.
defendants nicholls and austin claim that during this period they began receiving complaints about faghri.austin explained that he was constantly having to mediate disputes between faghri and different people and that the cost of and frustration and irritation of interacting with faghri deterred interdisciplinary programs.austin also stated that faghri attitude was causing faculty to leave,or consider leaving,the university.
in the fall of,faghri initiated plans to merge two departments within the school of engineering.on february,austin and nicholls met with professors harris marcus and ross mackinnon to hear their concerns about the merger.in this and other meetings austin and nicholls learned that members of the faculty were dissatisfied with faghri leadership.on april,a petition was circulated noting the decline in the school of engineering national ranking between and and asking the university administration to restore us to a path of success.marcus and professor doug cooper presented the petition to nicholls and told nicholls that their objective was to remove faghri.when nicholls pointed out to them that the petition did not call for faghri removal,the professors said they would circulate a second petition with clearer language.they drafted a second petition and circulated it among those professors they believed would be supportive.this petition stated simply,with this memo based on a wide range of issues,we cast a vote of no confidence in amir faghri to continue as dean of the school of engineering and request his immediate replacement.signatures appeared on the petition.the faculty of the school of engineering included over people.marcus also delivered to austin and nicholls sixteen letters,ten from former faculty,expressing criticism of faghri.most of the faculty did not learn about the petition until may.faculty members later sent letters to austin and nicholls expressing concern about the petition and supporting faghri.
on june,nicholls called faghri to a meeting and asked him to resign.nicholls told faghri about the two petitions,and advised him that much of the faculty was no longer supportive of his continued leadership.according to nicholls,faghri launched into a tirade regarding many of the university policies he had complained about previously.faghri asked nicholls to show him the complaints,but nicholls refused.
faghri refused to resign and was removed the next day.in a letter to the faculty and staff,nicholls explained,faghri management has created an untenable climate within the school of engineering and among his campus peers.faghri retained his chaired professorship.
faghri filed suit against the university,austin,and nicholls.he asserted claims under alleging retaliation for his exercise of his first amendment right to free speech and deprivation of property without due process of law as required by the fourteenth amendment.he also asserted a claim under,which imposes liability on an employer for certain violations of constitutional rights.defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that faghri speech was not protected by the first amendment and that he did not have a property interest in his deanship protected by the fourteenth amendment.they also argued that they were protected by qualified immunity.
the district court denied their motion.faghri of,d.it determined that summary judgment was inappropriate on faghri free speech claim because of issues of material fact as to whether defendants had adequate justification to demote faghri and whether any protected speech caused his demotion.the court denied summary judgment on the due process claim because of questions of fact as to whether faghri had a protected property interest in his deanship.finally,it refused summary j
