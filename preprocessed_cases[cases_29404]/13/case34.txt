the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa or act aims to eliminate abusive debt collection practices,a d,by,as relevant here,barring false,deceptive,or misleading representation s in connection with the collection of any debt,governing debt collectors,the act excludes from the definition of that term any officer of any state to the extent that collecting any debt is in the performance of his official duties.c.
under ohio law,overdue debts owed to agencies and instrumentalities are certified to the state attorney general for collection or disposition.carrying out this responsibility,the attorney general appoints,as independent contractors,private attorneys,naming them special counsel to act on the attorney general behalf.the attorney general requires special counsel to use the attorney general letterhead in communicating with debtors.among the special counsel appointed by the attorney general in were petitioners mark sheriff and eric jones.consistent with the attorney general direction,sheriff law firm and jones sent debt collection letters on the attorney general letterhead to respondents hazel meadows and pamela gillie,respectively.the signature block of each letter contained the name and address of the signatory as well as the designation special or outside counsel to the state attorney general.each letter also identified the sender as a debt collector seeking payment for debts to a state institution.meadows and gillie filed a putative class action in federal district court,alleging that defendants had,by using the attorney general letterhead,employed deceptive and misleading means to attempt to collect consumer debts,in violation of the fdcpa.the ohio attorney general intervened,seeking a declaratory judgment that special counsel use of the attorney general letterhead is neither false nor misleading,and urging that special counsel be deemed officers of the state exempted from the act.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants,holding that special counsel are officers of the state and,in any event,their use of the attorney general letterhead is not false or misleading.the sixth circuit vacated that judgment,concluding that special counsel,as independent contractors,are not entitled to the fdcpa exemption.the appeals court remanded for trial the question whether use of the attorney general letterhead would mislead a debtor into believing that it is the attorney general who is collecting the debt.
held assuming,arguendo,that special counsel do not rank as state officers within the meaning of the act,petitioners use of the attorney general letterhead,nevertheless,does not offend.
special counsel use of the attorney general letterhead at the attorney general direction does not offend general prohibition against false or misleading representation s.the letterhead identifies the principal ohio attorney general and the signature block names the agent a private lawyer hired as outside counsel to the attorney general.the character of the relationship between special counsel and the attorney general bolsters the court determination.special counsel work closely with attorneys in the attorney general office,providing legal services on the attorney general behalf in furtherance of the attorney general debt collection responsibilities for the state.a debtor impression that a letter from special counsel is a letter from the attorney general office is thus scarcely inaccurate.
special counsel use of the attorney general letterhead is also consistent with specific prohibition against falsely represent ing that a communication is authorized,issued,or approved by a state.because the attorney general authorized indeed required special counsel to use his letterhead,special counsel create no false impression in doing just that.nor did special counsel use an untrue name in their letters,in violation of.special counsel do not employ a false name when they use the attorney general letterhead at his instruction,for special counsel act as the attorney general agents in matters.the court sees no reason,furthermore,to construe the fdcpa in a manner that would interfere with the attorney general chosen method of fulfilling his statutory obligation to collect the state debts.
the sixth circuit raises the specter of consumer confusion and the risk of intimidation from special counsel use of the attorney general letterhead,but its exposition is unconvincing.
