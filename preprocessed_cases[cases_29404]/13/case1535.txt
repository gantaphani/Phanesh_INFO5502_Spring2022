now deceased,sheila pouliot suffered profound physical and mental disabilities since infancy and was never competent to make her own medical treatment decisions.in december,incapacitated and terminally ill,she was admitted to the state university of new york suny upstate medical center at syracuse.aware of her condition,her family,her treating physicians,and other hospital personnel all agreed that only palliative invasive,or resuscitative appropriate.several days later,the new york attorney general office intervened.it advised hospital officials that this course of care was contrary to new york law,that no third party was competent to direct the withdrawal of measures from a patient who had never been competent and who,consequently,had never consented to such steps,and that the administration of artificial nutrition,hydration,and antibiotics was required.
this treatment was instituted.shortly thereafter,the attorney general office went to state court seeking and obtaining the appointment of a guardian for pouliot,although it insisted that the guardian could not consent to the withdrawal of measures.after some initial disagreement,the parties and the guardian agreed to the continued administration of hydration and nutrition,and this was done for approximately two months.it became apparent,however,that this course of treatment caused pouliot intense suffering with no corresponding medical prolonging her life.she died after this treatment was terminated pursuant to a court order,which was entered over the objections of the attorney general office.
following pouliot death,blouin returned to state court and,on her sister behalf,sued eliot spitzer,the new york attorney general ag,and winthrop thurlow,the assistant ag who had handled the matter collectively,the ag office,asserting claims under state and federal law.the ag office removed the case to federal court,where it eventually obtained summary judgment.the district court concluded that,although spitzer and thurlow were not entitled to absolute immunity,they were entitled to qualified immunity because their intervention violated no clearly established constitutional right of pouliot.because we agree that they were entitled to qualified immunity,although for reasons somewhat different from the district court,we affirm.
background 
sheila pouliot became profoundly physically and mentally handicapped after contracting encephalitis during infancy.as a consequence,throughout her life she suffered mental retardation and fairly severe cerebral palsy,which was manifested by incomplete quadriparesis.she was completely dependent on others for assistance with basic life functions and resided during her life at a residential group home in syracuse.
by,pouliot,in her early forties,had become chronically ill as a result of complications from cerebral palsy,including a seizure disorder,osteoporosis,the dislocation of various joints,and widespread flexion contractures involving her elbows,knees,and hips.she also lost the ability to eat,and nutrition was artificially administered through a feeding tube.she began suffering from serious illness relating to failing gut function,characterized by recurrent aspiration pneumonia,episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding,and chronic,severe constipation.
when she reached the hospital in december,pouliot was acutely ill and,by all accounts,near death.she was experiencing low oxygen levels and a high fever.she was suffering from hypotension,aspiration pneumonia,internal bleeding,severe abdominal pain,and a intestine.pouliot family,medical staff,suny hospital ethics committee,and clergy met on december and decided that her condition was terminal and that the appropriate treatment was the provision of palliative care,involving mainly the intravenous delivery of morphine.it was also decided that neither artificial nutrition and hydration nor antibiotics would be administered.this decision was reflected in the contemporaneous notes of catherine caldicott,one of pouliot treating physicians 
after hour discussion with team,family,social worker,nursing staff,chaplain and ethics consultant,we are in full agreement that this may be pouliot terminal illness.we agree that the most humane course is to provide comfort in the way of morphine sulfate as needed and to refrain from invasive resuscitative and recovery measures.
this course of treatment commenced while arrangements were made to return pouliot to the group home for hospice care.after recording some early discomfort,caldicott notes of december indicate that,by late in the day,pouliot was resting comfortably with her family by her side.on december,however,after observing that pouliot appeared dehydrated,caldicott wrote 
i have been ordered by the state of to provide resuscitative measures.this is against the family wishes and is causing much strife.however,i will proceed with iv fluids and iv antibiotics even though they are of questionable benefit in cases of aspiration pneumonia.she is comfortable and in no respiratory distress.
blouin contends that this note documents the ag office intervention into pouliot care,and she characterizes this intervention as a unilateral direction.the ag office,on the other hand,maintains that it merely rendered legal advice following inquiries from hospital officials about the appropriate treatment for pouliot.to the extent there is a factual dispute,on the ag office summary judgment motion,blouin version must be credited it is the state blouin attributes to the ag the previously course of final care for pouliot that gave rise to this lawsuit.blouin central constitutional claim is that this intervention,without the consent of her sister or a surrogate decisionmaker,caused unwarranted and unnecessary pain and suffering and violated her sister right to bodily integrity,protected by the fourteenth amendment.
the modified treatment measures resulted in more discomfort and deterioration.on december,for example,caldicott noted that although pouliot appears less comfortable,she would continue to administer fluids and antibiotics as ordered by counsel.the next day she noted that pouliot appears very mostly with occasional grunts and that she w ill need to utility or futility of continued antib iotics,fluids and oxygen for this condition.on the,caldicott wrote,although i believe continued antib iotics are futile,i am directed to continue them by other authorities.pouliot family was traumatized by this shift in her medical treatment.
throughout her life,pouliot was never legally competent to make medical decisions,so they were made by her mother until she contracted alzheimer disease and no longer had the capacity to do so.under new york law,for persons years of age or older lacking capacity to consent to medical treatment,informed consent to such treatment shall be obtained from a guardian lawfully empowered to give such consent,an actively involved spouse,an actively involved parent,an actively involved adult child,a surrogate decisionmaking committee or a court of competent jurisdiction.b.after pouliot mother became incapacitated,since pouliot did not have a spouse,other parent,adult child,or other individual authorized to make treatment decisions on her behalf,no one was authorized to make them.
recognizing this,the ag office commenced a proceeding on december in supreme court,onondaga county,seeking the appointment of a temporary guardian ad litem pending the appointment of a permanent guardian that same day,the court appointed gerald neri,guardian ad litem.notwithstanding neri appointment,however,the ag office took the position that no one other than a competent patient could decide to withhold nutrition and hydration and that,consequently,both neri and the court were without authority to terminate or direct the termination or the continued withholding of nutrition and hydration.tr.of,at.on january,after hearing argument over the appropriate course of care,the court ordered that all medical treatment for sheila pouliot be terminated,except for nutrition as tolerated,and palliative hydration care,based on the best interest of the patient.order of,at.
the next day,blouin commenced a proceeding in state court on behalf of pouliot and her family seeking permanently to enjoin the state and the ag office from providing additional nutritional sustenance to pouliot.an attending physician,karen heitzman,averred in support of this application that pouliot condition was terminal and that death was imminent.heitzman also stated that nutritional sustenance would require invasive medical procedures caus ing increased pain and suffering,along with the risk of infection,fractured bones,and thrombosis,without any measurable medical benefit,and,finally,that such efforts will not improve her state of health or prolong her life.this assertion was uncontradicted.the court enjoined the hospital from providing nutrition unless approved by neri.
a few days later,following a meeting at the hospital attended by thurlow,neri,and pouliot physicians and family members,including blouin,a new agreement was reached that provided for the administration of fluid and intravenous nutrition by dextrose solution.blouin,who was represented by counsel at the meeting and who agreed at the time to artificial nutrition and hydration for her sister,now claims to have been subjected at the meeting to extraordinary pressure and duress from the state lawyers,including express and specific importuning by thurlow that she accede to the administration of some kind of caloric feeding to pouliot.on january,the parties appeared in state court to vacate the tro on the basis of the agreement,which was reviewed and approved by the court.the treatment was initiated the next day and continued through january and february.
by late february,however,it was apparent to pouliot physicians that this treatment was causing her intense pain without medical benefit and was,in fact,worsening her condition.one of pouliot physicians,david lehman,wrote in a progress note 
the intravenous fluids promote that the patient is kept alive for her own body to itself.therefore,this current plan of iv hydration promotes an increase in patient suffering,does not promote life quality and maintains her capacity only.and,indeed,therefore this current treatment is clearly outside of acceptable medical bounds,in effect worsening her condition since she is consuming herself calorically.it is thus,not medically indicated emphasis in original.
as a result,pouliot family returned to court on march,seeking to revisit the treatment plan previously agreed to and,in particular,to stop the intravenous hydration pouliot was being provided the ag office continued to oppose this request,despite uncontroverted testimony that pouliot care was medically inappropriate and was causing her significant pain.during this period,its position continued to be that,since pouliot was never competent to express her intentions,no one had the authority to instruct that the administration of nutrition hydration be stopped.
after noting that the applicable law was unclear and expressing frustration about the unavailability of a surrogate decisionmaking committee envisioned by new york law the court determined that it was in pouliot best interest to have the treatment modified to terminate hydration but to continue intravenous pain medication.the court thereby authorized the treatment that pouliot physicians had previously testified was medically appropriate,but which the ag office had opposed.indeed,throughout these proceedings the ag office has never asserted that the treatment it insisted upon was medically,as opposed to legally,appropriate.the court requested the ag office to not immediately appeal the would trigger an automatic its personal observations of the pain that pouliot was experiencing,but an appeal was filed nevertheless.
on march,the appellate division temporarily vacated the automatic stay,pending a march hearing on a motion to vacate it.on march,the hospital ceased hydration.on march,pouliot died.
blouin sued in new york supreme court,onondaga county,under alleging violations of pouliot rights under the first,fourth,fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments,as well as claims of negligence,unlawful practice of medicine,assault and battery,and infliction of emotional distress the ag office removed the action to the northern district of new york and moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court converted the motion into one for summary judgment.the ag office argued that spitzer and thurlow were entitled to absolute immunity and,if not,qualified immunity,since their conduct violated no clearly established federal law.
the district court granted the motion.it denied spitzer and thurlow absolute immunity because 
their actions began prior to the commencement of any judicial proceeding and they were not pursuant to any statutory obligation.additionally,defendants initial legal advice to university neither part of a prosecutor traditional functions nor are they closely associated with the judicial process.
blouin spitzer,d.the court did,however,determine that they were entitled to qualified immunity,because plaintiff has failed to allege a violation of a clearly established right.assuming arguendo that the court found a violation,it could not be concluded that such a right was so clearly established that it was objectively unreasonable for defendants to believe that their actions did not violate the law.id.the court also granted judgment for the ag office on blouin claims.this appeal from the dismissal of the claim and the battery claim followed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.schnabel abramson,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c burt rigid box,travelers prop.cas,cir.in assessing whether the moving party has made this demonstration,we review all evidence and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the party.byrnie town of cromwell,bd.of,cir.
absolute immunity 
the ag office argues that spitzer and thurlow are entitled not simply to qualified immunity but to absolute immunity under,because their challenged actions all involved their functions and conduct as government advocates representing their state clients.appellee br.at.we are not persuaded that absolute immunity extends this far under federal law.
a bsolute immunity is of a rare and exceptional character.barrett united states,cir quotation marks omitted.it involves a historical inquiry some officials perform special functions which,because of their similarity to functions that would have been immune when congress enacted,deserve absolute protection from damages liability.buckley fitzsimmons,d quoting butz economou,d.in determining whether state officials are entitled to absolute immunity,courts employ a functional approach,see,burns reed,d,looking at the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.forrester white,d.accordingly,state prosecutors are absolutely immune from claims arising from conduct intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.imbler pachtman,d.
an official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is warranted for the function in question,against a presumption that qualified immunity affords sufficient protection.burns,at.in considering whether this showing has been made,we look first to whether there is historical or support for cloaking the challenged actions with absolute immunity.see id.at.the absence of such support is generally determinative.since on its face does not provide for any immunities,we would be going far to read into it an absolute immunity for conduct which was only accorded qualified immunity in,when the statute was enacted.malley briggs,d emphasis in original see also tower glover,d we do not have a license to establish immunities from actions in the interests of what we judge to be sound public policy.if historical or support exists,we proceed to consider whether absolute immunity is warranted by factors,notably the risks to the performance of important governmental functions posed in its absence by vexatious litigation.see burns,at.
as previously observed,blouin seeks to hold the ag office liable for intervening into pouliot medical care by directing the administration of invasive procedures.spitzer and thurlow have not carried their burden of identifying any historical or support for an extension of absolute immunity to such actions.as noted,this absence of support is dispositive.see,buckley,at.denying absolute immunity for state actor for fabrication of evidence because there is no tradition of immunity for it.
the ag office suggests that the support for the absolute immunity of prosecutors,recognized in imbler,is sufficient.but,under the functional approach,the critical inquiry is not the official position of the person seeking absolute immunity,but the specific action for which that person seeks immunity.here,the challenged intervention was not prosecutorial,nor was it intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.imbler,at.see also parkinson cozzolino,cir.in other words,in intervening,spitzer and thurlow were not performing functions analogous to those of a prosecutor.butz,at.nor are we persuaded that they are entitled to absolute immunity because,as they allege,they were merely providing advice to state officials.even in the investigative phase of a criminal case,advice by state prosecutors warrants only qualified immunity.see burns,d.since it would be anomalous to extend absolute immunity to advice in the civil context,but not the criminal context,we decline to take that step 
the ag office also argues that,even if spitzer and thurlow initial actions were not entitled to absolute immunity,they are entitled to it once they commenced guardianship proceedings,a form of judicial proceedings.but none of the court proceedings in which they participated were criminal,nor did they require spitzer and thurlow to act in a prosecutorial capacity.mitchell forsyth,d because the attorney general was not acting in a prosecutorial capacity in this case,the situations in which we have applied a functional approach to absolute immunity questions provide scant support for blanket immunization of his performance of the national security function.nor were spitzer and thurlow engaged as advocates for the state in adversarial proceedings,at least in the traditional sense.barrett,at.in seeking the appointment of a guardian for pouliot,their principal objective was the protection of her.while the public had an undeniable interest in her treatment,pouliot interests were the paramount ones,and the state were derivative.
in short,spitzer and thurlow challenged after proceedings sufficiently distinct from traditional prosecutorial or even adversarial functions that they are required to show independent historical support for their entitlement to absolute immunity.but they have not done so.the unavailability of absolute immunity in this context does not impose a particularly onerous burden on governmental officials,nor does it inappropriately expose them to vexatious litigation.it simply means that,when considering an intervention into the medical treatment of a gravely ill patient,the ag office may have to pause to consider whether a proposed course of action can be squared with the constitution and laws of the united states.mitchell,at.
ii.qualified immunity 
we now consider qualified immunity,which shields a government official acting in an official capacity from suit for damages under unless the official violated clearly established rights of which an objectively reasonable official would have known.kinzer jackson,cir.the determination generally involves a inquiry do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right,and,if so,was the right in question clearly established saucier katz,d.
the district court bypassed saucier first step.it did not make clear whether it believed blouin failed to allege the violation of a constitutional right.instead,it concluded that,even if she had,the right was not sufficiently established to make spitzer and thurlow actions objectively unreasonable.blouin,d at.but,as elaborated below,it reached the correct result.
fourteenth amendment liberty interest 
although blouin presents several bases for liability,her central and strongest claim asserts a violation of pouliot liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.she argues that it is axiomatic that a person has constitutional interests in avoiding medical intrusions that would needlessly prolong the dying process.while blouin is right to assert that the constitution supports a right to reject medical treatment as a function of the fundamental right to bodily integrity under the due process clause,cruzan.dep t of health,d,it does not follow from this,as blouin argues,that an incompetent person whose death is imminent has a constitutional right to have a surrogate make critical medical decisions,including a decision to withdraw life support.while the former proposition finds support in case law,the latter does not and,as a consequence,is not clearly established.
in cruzan,the supreme court held that a state could constitutionally condition the withholding of treatment of an incompetent patient on whether or not the patient,when competent,had manifested a clear and convincing intention that such treatment be withheld.cruzan,at.indeed,if the patient intention had never been made clear,a state may properly decline to make judgments about the quality of life that a particular individual may enjoy,and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life.id.at.as a corollary,where a patient intention is unclear or,a state may properly disregard the wishes of a patient family simply because there is no automatic assurance the view of close family members would necessarily be the same as the patient would have been had she been confronted with the prospect while competent.id.at.furthermore,the court noted that we do not think the due process clause requires the state to repose judgment on these matters with anyone but the patient herself.id.
washington glucksberg,d,shed additional light on cruzan.there,the court held that the constitution did not prevent a state from banning medical professionals and others from assisting in the suicide of terminally ill patients.id.at.in so holding,the court was careful to cabin cruzan,explaining that that case did not guarantee a right to die,but rather clarified that cruzan only guaranteed competent persons a constitutionally protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.it would be wrong,therefore,to characterize cruzan,as blouin does,as reflecting a general tradition of.id.at.citation omitted.on the contrary 
the right assumed in cruzan was not simply deduced from abstract concepts of personal autonomy.given the rule that forced medication was a battery,and the long legal tradition protecting the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment,our assumption was entirely consistent with this nation history and constitutional traditions.the decision to commit suicide with the assistance of another may be just as personal and profound as the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment,but it has never enjoyed similar legal protection.
id.at.in sum,t hat many rights and liberties protected by the due process clause sound in personal autonomy does not warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important,intimate,and personal decisions are so protected.id.at.
in vacco quill,d,the companion case to glucksberg,the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of a new york law banning assisted suicide.in so doing,the court again held that a right to refuse medical treatment does not rest upon a general and abstract right to hasten death,but on,traditional rights to bodily integrity and freedom from unwanted touching.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.that is,the right is squarely grounded in the act of consent everyone,regardless of physical condition,is entitled,if competent,to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment id.at.emphasis added.
through these subsequent decisions,cruzan has been narrowly confined.the supreme court has taken pains to avoid expanding cruzan beyond the context of the right of a competent person to refuse lifesaving medical treatment.the court has explicitly refused to recognize any personal right to an assisted suicide and has noted that the personal autonomy rationale employed here does not create new substantive rights entitled to protection under the due process clause.
blouin notes that nancy cruzan was a formerly competent patient mired in a permanently unconscious state her condition had been stabilized,her life was preservable for years,and she was insensate and therefore not subject to pain and suffering facts far different from sheila pouliot.appellant br.at emphasis in original.blouin asserts that sheila imminent death implicated a right to avoid unwanted treatment that prolongs a tortuous dying process.appellant br.at.we find this rationale unconvincing.while cruzan is the only decision that comes even close to recognizing the federal constitutional right that blouin must show to be clearly established to defeat the defense of qualified immunity,cruzan rests neither on the imminence of death nor on whether nancy cruzan was suffering great pain.as we have seen,it rests solely on the patient capacity to express her intention regarding the course of her medical treatment a capacity that nancy cruzan once possessed but that sheila pouliot never did.we therefore do not accept blouin assertion that pouliot fundamental liberty interest entitled her to shape the course of medical intervention in her dying decide how much bodily invasion to tolerate,how much to suffer,and how much to struggle against unavoidable,imminent death.appellant br.at.sheila pouliot simply lacked the capacity to do any of these things.further,blouin arguments supporting a right to a surrogate decisionmaker are based on a number of state decisions.whatever their merits,they have no bearing on whether such a right exists as a matter of federal constitutional law.in sum,blouin has not demonstrated that clearly established federal law barred the defendants from effectuating the state interest in prolonging the life of one of its citizens,whatever its quality.
therefore,we hold that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to blouin claim.
remaining federal claims 
blouin also asserts a violation of pouliot first amendment right to privacy,her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures,and her fourteenth amendment rights to equal protection and procedural due process.we conclude that spitzer and thurlow are entitled to qualified immunity on these claims as well,for blouin has failed to allege facts showing any constitutional violations.see saucier,at.
blouin argues that the ag office violated pouliot first amendment right to make important decisions concerning her medical treatment,citing the supreme court observation in whalen roe,d,that the first amendment right to privacy includes the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.id.at.although numerous state courts have relied on a generalized right to privacy in finding a right to refuse treatment,see,in re grant,sup t of belchertown state sch.saikewicz,in re quinlan,the supreme court has made clear that claims concerning unwanted medical treatments are properly analyzed in terms of a fourteenth amendment liberty interest,rather than in terms of a privacy interest.cruzan,at.the district court,therefore,properly granted the ag office judgment on this claim.
blouin argues that the ag office violated pouliot fourth amendment rights when they willfully and unreasonably seized and detained her in order to physically subject her to unconsented invasive medical treatment,without a guardian or court order in place to do so.appellant br.at.in order to prevail on such a claim,she must establish both that there was a seizure and that the seizure was unreasonable.brower county of inyo,d.
blouin has not established that pouliot was seized.in brower,the case upon which she principally relies,the supreme court stated that a seizure occurs only when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied.id.at.emphasis removed see also united states madison,cir same.blouin has identified no seizure under the facts alleged.pouliot presence in the confined environment in this case was not the result of the ag office actions,madison,at,nor were its actions intended to restrain pouliot freedom of movement.medeiros,cir.the ag office neither compelled pouliot presence in the hospital nor administered the challenged treatment for any reason other than to prolong pouliot life.accordingly,we conclude the district court properly dismissed this claim.
blouin makes two equal protection claims.first,she argues that pouliot,as a mentally disabled individual,was treated differently while receiving palliative care than she would have been if mentally competent.more specifically,blouin claims that pouliot was not permitted to have artificial nutrition,hydration,and antibiotics withdrawn as part of her palliative care,an option she would have had if she had been mentally competent.this argument,however,is essentially foreclosed by the supreme court rejection of a similar claim in cruzan 
petitioners also adumbrate in their brief a claim based on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the effect that missouri has impermissibly treated incompetent patients differently from competent ones,citing the statement in cleburne cleburne living center,d,that the clause is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.the differences between the choice made by a competent person to refuse medical treatment,and the choice made for an incompetent person by someone else to refuse medical treatment,are so obviously different that the state is warranted in establishing rigorous procedures for the latter class of cases which do not apply to the former class.
cruzan,at.emphases in original.
blouin second equal protection claim is that the ag office has acted inconsistently in obtaining consent for medical treatment of mentally disabled individuals.she alleges that although it did not seek consent in this case before directing the treatment,it has sought consent in other situations in which incompetent patients required major medical treatment.in support,she points to in re dreythaler,misc d,which arose after the ag office had sought judicial consent to administer a dental procedure to a mentally incompetent patient in state care.but,as the district court observed,t here is a tremendous difference between decisions involving dental treatment and those involving the termination of treatment.blouin,d at.again,the equal protection clause does not prevent a state from handling these very different circumstances differently.see cruzan,at.accordingly,the district court properly granted judgment to the ag office on blouin equal protection claims.
blouin also makes a procedural due process claim,relying on a line of supreme court decisions involving the liberty interest of inmates in avoiding disciplinary confinement.citing hewitt helms,d,and washington harper,d,in which the court held that states could create a protected liberty interest by enacting regulations us ing language of an unmistakably mandatory character,hewitt,at.harper,at.quoting hewitt,blouin contends that pouliot constitutional rights were violated by the state failure to follow its own statutory procedures for obtaining consent.the hewitt framework,however,is not applicable to blouin.first,it was largely abandoned by the supreme court in sandin conner,d,in which the court observed that,although states may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the due process clause,id.at,such interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint that imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,id.at.see also holcomb lykens,cir.
in any event,blouin procedural due process claim has a more fundamental flaw.she argues that state procedure
