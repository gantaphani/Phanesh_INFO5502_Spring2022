david michael leja appeals from his conviction for health care fraud,mail fraud,and obstruction of justice in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.he contends that his sixth amendment constitutional right to a jury trial was violated because his purported waiver of his right to a jury trial was legally insufficient.while the jury waiver should have included leja signature,we have carefully examined the record and are satisfied that leja waived his right to a jury trial and that his waiver was knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.
background and facts 
on july,a grand jury indicted leja in a superceding indictment with counts of mail fraud,in violation of nine counts of making material false statements in connection with the payment of health care benefits,in violation of one count of obstructing justice,in violation of and one count of witness tampering,in violation of b.leja attorney purported to waive a jury trial on his behalf the validity of that waiver is the issue on appeal here,and,after a bench trial,leja was convicted on december,of counts of mail fraud,nine counts of making false statements,and obstruction of justice.the court found leja not guilty of witness tampering.on may,the court,departing downward from a guideline sentencing range of to months,sentenced leja to months imprisonment to be followed by three years supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment.leja filed a timely appeal,and in that appeal he now argues that he never adequately waived his right to a jury trial.
prior to his bench trial,leja and the government,on september,filed a document entitled a joint notice re jury waiver,informing the district court that the parties had agreed to waive a jury and have the case heard by the court.the waiver was filed electronically and contained the electronic signatures of both the attorney for the government and leja counsel,who had authorized the government to include her electronic signature on the waiver on behalf of leja.
the above waiver was submitted approximately seven weeks after the district court had discussed with leja counsel,in leja presence,the possibility that leja might wish to waive a jury.the discussion took place on july,at a hearing the court held on leja motion to continue the trial date so that he could secure expert testimony regarding the loss stemming from his alleged fraud.leja and the court both took the position that the government had to prove the loss amounts associated with any specific offense enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt.during the hearing,the court spoke of the complexities of the parties competing theories of financial loss and the possible difficulties the parties might have in educating a potentially unsophisticated jury on those matters.in light of the complexities,the court suggested that the parties consider whether they wanted to waive the jury.in suggesting this approach,the court emphasized that it was not pressuring either party to waive a jury and noted that it was reluctant to take on the role of rendering the verdict 
i have two question and one suggestion.the question is how long is it going to take to put the evidence on in this case and put the defense on in this case what was the estimate 
and,two,have you thought of waiving jury in this case is there any consideration of waiving jury in this case because of course i going to do everything i can to instruct the jury properly.but i can tell you of the fourteen people,the twelve jurors and two alternates,that will be sitting on that jury,we be lucky to have two people who have any college.that my expectation with regard to the jury.or we probably be lucky to have two people who graduated from a college,maybe one,and maybe we will have two or three people who have associate degrees or rns or something of that nature.
so you guys are going to have your hands full trying to educate the jury about the concept that we have been discussing for the last half hour or minutes.and i not not pushing anybody.i not interested in having to take responsibility for this case,but i just wondering whether this might not be the sort of case that would be tried from both sides points of view a lot more comfortably to the court rather than a jury.
i do even know if it is proper for me to suggest that and i certainly do want to appear in any way to be pressuring anybody.i love juries.i like jury trials.that what i do all day.it saves me having to deal with the moral pressure of actually having to make the call in a situation where somebody liberty might be at stake.so that not something that i have a huge appetite to take on where it not necessary,but i think that that something you might really want to consider in a case that so technical.
towards the end of the hearing,the court reiterated its request that the parties consider the possibility of jury waiver 
i going to urge both of hope i not committing reversible error by even doing this,but i guess i will say it seems to me that this is a situation where you at least should give careful consideration to the possibility of waiving jury and trying the case to the court.i let you each think about that and talk to each other about it and see if there something you will be willing to do,and there we are.
in any event,so i would urge you to think about that.i do have any relish for it because it does make my work harder but i think it something to consider.
the court then told the parties that the case would be heard by a jury absent some action by the parties 
we going to start the trial on october.but unless there a thermonuclear attack targeted at springfield specifically,we will be picking the jury on october and that when we will get started.
at the conclusion of the july,hearing,the district court ordered the parties to report on whether they wished to try the case without a jury,stating 
let me put it this way.i do want to appear to be pressuring either the defendant or the government.to the extent that you wish to waive jury,you will tell me so by september.
as noted,leja was present in the courtroom throughout the above hearing.on july,the court issued an order,in which it required the parties to report to the court,in writing,by september,as to whether they will be waiving jury in this highly complex case.on september,the parties filed the written waiver document leja now challenges.
during a hearing on september,the court confirmed on the record the filing of the parties september written jury waiver 
the court the case has been considerably simplified,at least i think,by agreement of both parties to waive jury in this case.do i have that correct 
quigley yes 
defense counsel 
the court both of you are nodding.
goodwin yes.
prosecution 
leja was again present in the courtroom during this exchange and offered no objection.
on october,the beginning of the trial,the district court,at the request of the government,again inquired of defense counsel whether leja intended to waive jury 
goodwin just one more housekeeping matter.i had filed on behalf of the defendant and myself that waiver of jury.i filed it electronically.it was not actually signed by defense counsel,and the defendant himself has not signed anything waiving his right to a jury.i thought it might be appropriate to put on the record here that there is a waiver of jury certainly from the government perspective but also from the defendant.
the court well,let me make that clear on the record so that there is any confusion on that point at all.we here without jury following a waiver by both sides of jury trial.you just confirmed that goodwin from the government point of view.quigley,do you also confirm that 
quigley yes,your honor.
the court and you discussed that with leja and he agrees with that 
quigley yes,he does.
the court for the record,leja is here and is not indicating any disagreement 
the trial proceeded without a jury and lasted about three weeks.the evidence at trial established that leja had engineered a complex and sophisticated fraud followed by an elaborate and scheme to obstruct justice.leja graduated from boston college.he was a licensed insurance and securities broker with a great deal of experience in insurance and other fields.he used his expertise to deceive clients,other brokers,and insurance companies bidding on his business.when the scheme began to unravel,leja gave false explanations and fabricated documents in order to deflect blame from himself.
leja testified in his own defense at trial.the court found his explanation to lack credibility entirely on practically every crucial point of evidence.at trial,leja denied sending out the forged documents,but,the court noted,the cover letters associated with those documents often referred to conversations with leja or invited a response,making the defendant testimony almost ridiculous and certainly incredible.similarly,the court found that the defendant testimony that he was absent from the office during critical time periods was simply not believable and wholly unsupported by the record.
testimony in the case concluded on november.the court then gave the parties three weeks to submit written closing arguments to be followed by oral argument in december.at the conclusion of oral argument,the court convicted leja,finding,among other things,that he carried out his scheme to defraud with extraordinarily elaborate planning and resourcefulness.
on february,leja filed a motion for a new trial,claiming,among other things,that his jury waiver was invalid because he had not personally signed it and the court had not conducted an colloquy with him on the subject.on march,the district court denied the motion,finding that leja jury waiver was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.as a basis for its ruling,the district court noted that leja was intelligent and articulate and that he was present throughout his trial and was clearly attentive and engaged.the district court also noted that counsel referred to the defendant own notes taken during trial as support for her arguments and conferred with him virtually every time before completing direct or cross examination of a witness.
the district court recalled having a clear memory of turning to leja at the start of the trial on october,and confirming with him that he did not disagree with his attorney representation that he had decided to waive jury after discussing the matter with counsel.the court noted that although leja did not provide an audible reply,his facial expression confirmed his assent to his lawyer representation and that the court received no reaction by the defendant that would have indicated his disagreement or lack of understanding regarding the waiver.the court also noted that at no time during the trial did leja express the slightest discomfort or hesitation in proceeding without a jury.although it recognized that the receipt of a written waiver signed by the defendant himself is obviously the better practice,the district court observed that no other conclusion can be drawn but that the defendant had a full opportunity to confer with his counsel,did in fact confer,and made a knowing,intelligent,and affirmative decision to waive his right to a jury trial.
discussion 
on appeal,leja argues that his jury waiver was not valid because,he claims,the law requires both that he personally sign the waiver and that the district court ask him questions concerning his understanding of his jury trial right and the ramifications of his waiver.the government argues that the case law has no such stringent requirements and that a reversal is not warranted where the record establishes that the defendant waiver was knowing,voluntary,and intelligent,which the government argues it was here.

procedural default 
as a preliminary matter,the government argues that the defendant procedurally defaulted on his sixth amendment claim by not raising it prior to the commencement of trial and thus that this court should review the denial of the motion for new trial for harmless error.the government claims that where leja gave his admittedly nonverbal assent to the jury waiver,he was not entitled subsequently to raise the issue because he had himself invited the error.see united states page,cir a defendant can not complain on appeal of alleged errors invited or induced by himself,particularly where,as here,it is not clear that the defendant was prejudiced thereby.citation omitted.page differs somewhat from the instant case,however,in that in page,the defendant himself first suggested waiving a jury,whereas here the district court initiated the idea.leja argues that the sixth amendment right to a jury trial is too fundamental to be dismissed on procedural grounds,relying on united states proctor,cir,where we refused to review for abuse of discretion a claim regarding appointment of counsel because of confusion over what went on at the hearing in question.given the significance of the constitutional right at issue here and its relationship to the inquiry of how the district court handled the issue of waiver,we will conduct a plenary review.
c.the waiver 
a criminal defendant has the fundamental right to a jury trial under the sixth amendment to the constitution.duncan louisiana,d.a defendant,however,may waive that constitutional right.adams united states ex rel.mccann.citing patton united states.abrogated on other grounds by williams florida,d united states.architects,cir.not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved,but the maintenance of the jury as a body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions,that,before any waiver can become effective,the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had,in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant.patton,at.federal rule of criminal procedure a states that a defendant is entitled to a trial by jury unless the defendant waives a jury trial in writing the government consents and the court approves.
leja argues that the waiver is invalid because he did not personally sign it instead,leja counsel electronic signature was attached to the waiver document by government counsel,with the former authorization.leja observes that the bench book for district court judges states that a written waiver of jury trial must be signed by the defendant.federal judicial center,fourth edition,with march revisions.though the bench book merely provides guidance for district judges and is not legally binding,the district court here wrote that w hile rule a is silent as to whether the written waiver must be signed by the defendant personally,the receipt of a written waiver signed by the defendant himself is obviously the better practice,and one which the court will not overlook in the future.for purposes of this motion the court will assume that its failure to obtain a written waiver personally signed by the defendant constituted a violation of the strict requirements of rule emphasis in original.we agree entirely with the district court that,where otherwise possible,the correct practice is to secure a written waiver signed personally by the defendant.the district court should have seen that that practice was followed here.the question remains,however,whether the failure to observe that practice,in the circumstances of this case,amounted to a violation of the sixth amendment or otherwise to reversible error.we find that it does not.
the government argues that leja waiver of the jury was made knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently despite the absence of a personally signed waiver.the first circuit has not previously addressed this issue directly.the ninth and tenth circuits have stated that oral waivers of jury trial can be valid,provided there are
