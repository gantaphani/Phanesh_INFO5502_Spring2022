on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
this case addresses whether a federal statute requires payment of increased compensation to certain automobile dealership employees for overtime work.the federal statute in question is the fair labor standards act flsa,et,enacted in to protect all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours.barrentine freight system.among its other provisions,the flsa requires employers to pay overtime compensation to covered employees who work more than hours in a given week.the rate of overtime pay must be not less than one and times the regular rate of the employee pay.a.
five current and former service advisors brought this suit alleging that the automobile dealership where they were employed was required by the flsa to pay them overtime wages.the dealership contends that the position and duties of a service advisor bring these employees within b a,which establishes an exemption from the flsa overtime provisions for certain employees engaged in selling or servicing automobiles.the case turns on the interpretation of this exemption.
automobile dealerships in many communities not only sell vehicles but also sell repair and maintenance services.among the employees involved in providing repair and maintenance services are service advisors,partsmen,and mechanics.service advisors interact with customers and sell them services for their vehicles.a service advisor duties may include meeting customers listening to their concerns about their cars suggesting repair and maintenance services selling new accessories or replacement parts recording service orders following up with customers as the services are performed for instance,if new problems are discovered and explaining the repair and maintenance work when customers return for their vehicles.see app.see also brennan deel motors,cfr c.partsmen obtain the vehicle parts needed to perform repair and maintenance and provide those parts to the mechanics.see c.mechanics perform the actual repair and maintenance work.see c.
in,congress enacted a blanket exemption from the flsa minimum wage and overtime provisions for all automobile dealership employees.fair labor standards amendments of,stat.in,congress repealed that broad exemption and replaced it with a narrower one.the revised statute did not exempt dealership employees from the minimum wage requirement.it also limited the exemption from the overtime compensation requirement to cover only certain employees in particular,any salesman,partsman,or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,trailers,trucks,farm implements,or aircraft at a covered dealership.fair labor standards amendments of,stat.congress authorized the department of labor to promulgate necessary rules,regulations,or orders with respect to this new provision,at.
the department exercised that authority in and issued a regulation that defined the statutory terms salesman,partsman,and mechanic.fed.reg.codified at cfr c.the department intended its regulation as a mere interpretive rule explaining its own views,rather than a legislative rule with the force and effect of law and so the department did not issue the regulation through the procedures of the administrative procedure act.see fed.reg.see also b a exempting interpretive rules from notice and comment.
the interpretive regulation defined salesman to mean an employee who is employed for the purpose of and is primarily engaged in making sales or obtaining orders or contracts for sale of the vehicles or farm implements which the establishment is primarily engaged in selling.cfr c.by limiting the statutory term to salesmen who sell vehicles or farm implements,the regulation excluded service advisors from the exemption,since a service advisor sells repair and maintenance services but not the vehicle itself.the regulation made that exclusion explicit in a later subsection employees variously described as service manager,service writer,service advisor,or service salesman are not exempt under the statute.this is true despite the fact that such an employee principal function may be disagnosing sic the mechanical condition of vehicles brought in for repair,writing up work orders for repairs authorized by the customer,assigning the work to various employees and directing and checking on the work of mechanics.c.
three years later,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit rejected the department conclusion that service advisors are not covered by the statutory exemption.deel motors,supra.certain district courts followed that precedent.see yenney cass county motors,cch lc brennan north.ford,cch lc ed,aff sub nom.dunlop north.ford,table brennan import volkswagen,cch lc.
in the meantime,congress amended the statutory provision by enacting its present text,which now sets out the exemption in two subsections.fair labor standards amendments of,stat.the first subsection is at issue in this case.it exempts any salesman,partsman,or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,trucks,or farm implements at a covered dealership.b a.the second subsection exempts any salesman primarily engaged in selling trailers,boats,or aircraft at a covered dealership.b b.the statute thus exempts certain employees engaged in servicing automobiles,trucks,or farm implements,but not similar employees engaged in servicing trailers,boats,or aircraft.
in,the department issued an opinion letter departing from its previous position.taking a position consistent with the cases decided by the courts,the opinion letter stated that service advisors could be exempt under b a.of labor,wage hour,opinion letter,transfer binder cch administrative rulings.the letter acknowledged that the department new policy represent ed a change from the position set forth in section c of its regulation.in,the department confirmed its interpretation by amending its field operations handbook to clarify that service advisors should be treated as exempt under b a.it observed that some courts had interpreted the statutory exemption to cover service advisors and it stated that,as a result of those decisions,it would no longer deny the overtime exemption for such employees.of labor,wage hour,field operations handbook,insert,k,online at all internet materials as last visited june.the department again acknowledged that its new position represented a change from its regulation and stated that the regulation would be revised as soon as is practicable.ibid.
years later,in,the department at last issued a notice of proposed rulemaking.fed.reg.the notice observed that every court that had considered the question had held service advisors to be exempt under b a,and that the department itself had treated service advisors as exempt since,at.the department proposed to revise its regulations to accord with existing practice by interpreting the exemption in b a to cover service advisors.
in,however,the department changed course yet again.it announced that it was not proceeding with the proposed rule.fed.reg.instead,the department completed its rulemaking by issuing a final rule that took the opposite position from the proposed rule.the new final rule followed the original regulation and interpreted the statutory term salesman to mean only an employee who sells automobiles,trucks,or farm implements,at codified at cfr c.
the department gave little explanation for its decision to abandon its practice of treating service advisors as exempt under b a.it was also less than precise when it issued its final rule.as described above,the regulation included a separate subsection stating in express terms that service advisors are not exempt under the relevant provision.cfr c.in promulgating the regulation,however,the department eliminated that separate subsection.according to the united states,this change appears to have been an inadvertent mistake in drafting.tr.of oral arg.
petitioner is a automobile dealership in the los angeles area.respondents are or were employed by petitioner as service advisors.they assert that petitioner required them to be at work from to at least five days per week,and to be available for work matters during breaks and while on vacation.app.respondents were not paid a fixed salary or an hourly wage for their work instead,they were paid commissions on the services they sold,at.
respondents sued petitioner in the united states district court for the central district of california,alleging that petitioner violated the flsa by failing to pay them overtime compensation when they worked more than hours in a week,at.petitioner moved to dismiss,arguing that the flsa overtime provisions do not apply to respondents because service advisors are covered by the statutory exemption in b a.the district court agreed and granted the motion to dismiss.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part.it construed the statute by deferring under chevron natural resources defense council,to the interpretation set forth by the department in its regulation.applying that deference,the court of appeals held that service advisors are not covered by the b a exemption.the court of appeals recognized,however,that its decision conflicted with cases from a number of other courts,at citing,inter alia,walton greenbrier ford,deel motors,thompson billion.this court granted certiorari to resolve the question.
the full text of the statutory subsection at issue states that the overtime provisions of the flsa shall not apply to 
any salesman,partsman,or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles,trucks,or farm implements,if he is employed by a nonmanufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the business of selling such vehicles or implements to ultimate purchasers.b a.
the question presented is whether this exemption should be interpreted to include service advisors.to resolve that question,it is necessary to determine what deference,if any,the courts must give to the department interpretation.
in the usual course,when an agency is authorized by congress to issue regulations and promulgates a regulation interpreting a statute it enforces,the interpretation receives deference if the statute is ambiguous and if the agency interpretation is reasonable.this principle is implemented by the analysis set forth in chevron.at the first step,a court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if so,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.if not,then at the second step the court must defer to the agency interpretation if it is reasonable.at.
a premise of chevron is that when congress grants an agency the authority to administer a statute by issuing regulations with the force of law,it presumes the agency will use that authority to resolve ambiguities in the statutory scheme.see,at united states mead.when congress authorizes an agency to proceed through rulemaking,that relatively formal administrative procedure is a very good indicator that congress intended the regulation to carry the force of law,so chevron should apply.mead,supra,at.but chevron deference is not warranted where the regulation is procedurally defective that is,where the agency errs by failing to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation,at long island care at home,coke,rejecting challenge to procedures by which regulation was issued and affording chevron deference.of course,a party might be foreclosed in some instances from challenging the procedures used to promulgate a given rule,jem broadcasting fcc,cadc also auer robbins,party can not challenge agency failure to amend its rule in light of changed circumstances without first seeking relief from the agency.but where a proper challenge is raised to the agency procedures,and those procedures are defective,a court should not accord chevron deference to the agency interpretation.respondents do not contest the manner in which petitioner has challenged the agency procedures here,and so this opinion assumes without deciding that the challenge was proper.
one of the basic procedural requirements of administrative rulemaking is that an agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions.the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins,internal quotation marks omitted.that requirement is satisfied when the agency explanation is clear enough that its path may reasonably be discerned.bowman,freight system.but where the agency has failed to provide even that minimal level of analysis,its action is arbitrary and capricious and so can not carry the force of law.see a state farm,supra,at.
agencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.see,national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,chevron,at.when an agency changes its existing position,it need not always provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy created on a blank slate.fcc fox television stations.but the agency must at least display awareness that it is changing position and show that there are good reasons for the new policy.ibid.emphasis deleted.in explaining its changed position,an agency must also be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.see also smiley citibank south dakota.in such cases it is not that further justification is demanded by the mere fact of policy change but that a reasoned explanation is needed for disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the prior policy.fox television stations,supra,at.it follows that an u nexplained inconsistency in agency policy is a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.brand x,supra,at.an arbitrary and capricious regulation of this sort is itself unlawful and receives no chevron deference.see mead,supra,at.
applying those principles here,the unavoidable conclusion is that the regulation was issued without the reasoned explanation that was required in light of the department change in position and the significant reliance interests involved.in promulgating the regulation,the department offered barely any explanation.a summary discussion may suffice in other circumstances,but here in particular because of decades of industry reliance on the department prior policy the explanation fell short of the agency duty to explain why it deemed it necessary to overrule its previous position.
the retail automobile and truck dealership industry had relied since on the department position that service advisors are exempt from the flsa overtime pay requirements.see national automobile dealers association,comment letter on proposed rule updating regulations issued under the fair labor standards act,online at documentdetail.dealerships and service advisors negotiated and structured their compensation plans against this background understanding.requiring dealerships to adapt to the department new position could necessitate systemic,significant changes to the dealerships compensation arrangements.see brief for national automobile dealers association et as amici curiae.dealerships whose service advisors are not compensated in accordance with the department new views could also face substantial flsa liability,see b,even if this risk of liability may be diminished in some cases by the existence of a separate flsa exemption for certain employees paid on a commission basis,see i,and even if a dealership could defend against retroactive liability by showing it relied in good faith on the prior agency position,see a.in light of this background,the department needed a more reasoned explanation for its decision to depart from its existing enforcement policy.
the department said that,in reaching its decision,it had carefully considered all of the comments,analyses,and arguments made for and against the proposed changes.fed.reg.and it noted that,since,it had treated service advisors as exempt in certain circumstances,at.it also noted the comment from the national automobile dealers association stating that the industry had relied on that interpretation.ibid.
but when it came to explaining the good reasons for the new policy,fox television stations,supra,at,the department said almost nothing.it stated only that it would not treat service advisors as exempt because the statute does not include such positions and the department recognizes that there are circumstances under which the requirements for the exemption would not be met.fed.reg.it continued that it believes that this interpretation is reasonable and sets forth the appropriate approach.ibid.although an agency may justify its policy choice by explaining why that policy is more consistent with statutory language than alternative policies,long island care at home,at internal quotation marks omitted,the department did not analyze or explain why the statute should be interpreted to exempt dealership employees who sell vehicles but not dealership employees who sell services that is,service advisors.and though several public comments supported the department reading of the statute,the department did not explain what if anything it found persuasive in those comments beyond the few statements above.
it is not the role of the courts to speculate on reasons that might have supported an agency decision.w e may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.state farm,at citing sec chenery.whatever potential reasons the department might have given,the agency in fact gave almost no reasons at all.in light of the serious reliance interests at stake,the department conclusory statements do not suffice to explain its decision.see fox television stations,at.this lack of reasoned explication for a regulation that is inconsistent with the department longstanding earlier position results in a rule that can not carry the force of law.see a state farm,supra,at.it follows that this regulation does not receive chevron deference in the interpretation of the relevant statute.
for the reasons above,b a must be construed without placing controlling weight on the department regulation.because the decision below relied on chevron deference to this regulation,it is appropriate to remand for the court of appeals to interpret the statute in the first instance.mead,at.the judgment of the court of appeals is vacated,and th
