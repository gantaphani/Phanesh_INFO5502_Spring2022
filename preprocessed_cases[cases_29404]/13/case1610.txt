background 
the record before us discloses the following.in january,dougherty purchased shares entitling him to occupy a cooperative unit in the beacon hill bungalow association development located in port washington,new york.shortly after purchase,dougherty began renovating and replacing portions of his bungalow unit.soon after,dougherty received a cease and desist order from the town of north hempstead hereafter the town according to defendants,the bungalow units in the beacon hill development are nonconforming dwellings under the town building code.
after receiving the cease and desist order,dougherty applied to the town for a permit.in may,the town building department denied dougherty application,stating that he had violated f of the town code,which prohibits enlargement of a nonconforming dwelling a few weeks later,dougherty appealed to the town board of zoning appeals hereafter the board,claiming that his construction had not increased and would not increase the existing nonconformity.the board held a hearing in august,at which it decided that dougherty had to submit a draft environmental impact statement eis to the town planning department.
in september,dougherty commenced an article proceeding in the new york supreme court challenging the board determination.in june,that court found no rational basis for the board requirement of an eis and remanded the case to the board to consider the merits of dougherty application.the board appealed,and in may the appellate division,second department affirmed.
in august,dougherty again applied for a building permit but received no immediate response.in october,the board held a to the state court remand on dougherty first determine whether dougherty alterations violated f.in prior correspondence with the board and in the state court action,dougherty had argued that he had not increased the existing footprint of the dwelling.but during the october board hearing,dougherty conceded that he had constructed an additional by expansion to the bungalow.in a decision apparently issued orally in december and published the following month,the board upheld the denial of a permit based upon dougherty admitted violation of f.the board nevertheless noted that,should dougherty be so advised,he should seek variance relief from this board.
dougherty,however,had already filed this action in the eastern district alleging,among other things,that defendants had violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and procedural due process,and his substantive due process right to be free from arbitrary and capricious government action.dougherty also alleged a taking of his property under the fifth amendment.he requested compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief directing the board to grant him a permit.in january,defendants moved to dismiss the eastern district complaint,arguing that plaintiff claims were not ripe and also that the complaint failed to state a cause of action.
on february,the town building department nevertheless granted dougherty second application and issued a permit enabling him to proceed with his renovations.on february,dougherty architects met with the town building inspector matthew cardone to discuss the proposed construction.cardone approved the plans,and in the following weeks,substantial work was done on the property and dougherty incurred significant expense.
dougherty claims that on march,he served papers by mail opposing the town motion to dismiss.by letter dated march,the town revoked dougherty permit,stating that it had been issued in error.thereafter,dougherty moved in the eastern district for leave to amend his complaint to include a first amendment claim,alleging that the board revoked his permit in retaliation for his continued pursuit of the eastern district action.
in an opinion filed in january,the district court granted the board motion to dismiss the complaint and denied dougherty motion to amend his complaint,holding that the claims in the complaint were not ripe under williamson county regional planning comm hamilton bank,d,and that dougherty proposed amendments to the complaint would be futile for the same reason.this appeal followed.

ripeness of the constitutional claims in the initial complaint 
dougherty argues that the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss his initial complaint on the ground of lack of ripeness.
the key issue before us on this aspect of dougherty appeal is whether the ripeness test announced in williamson applies to his equal protection and due process claims.in williamson,plaintiff owner of a tract of land sued a tennessee regional planning commission alleging that the commission application of various zoning laws and regulations to the plaintiff property amounted to an unconstitutional taking under the fifth amendment.williamson,at.the court held that plaintiff claim was not ripe for federal court review.id.at.the court stated that to meet the ripeness requirement,a plaintiff alleging a fifth amendment taking of a property interest must satisfy a test and show that the state regulatory entity has rendered a final decision on the matter,and the plaintiff has sought just compensation by means of an available state procedure.id.at.although plaintiff development plan had been rejected by the commission,plaintiff could have sought a variance from the zoning ordinance that would have resolved many of the commission objections.id.at.since plaintiff in williamson did not apply for such a variance,he had not received a final,definitive decision regarding how the commission will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question.id.at.
dougherty makes two arguments to us on this aspect of the case.he first contends that the district court should not have applied the williamson test to the equal protection and procedural due process claims,because that test applies only to a takings claim he next argues that even if williamson does apply to these constitutional claims,he satisfied the ripeness requirement because he applied for and was denied a variance,which constituted a final decision.
defendants counter that williamson ripeness test does apply to dougherty claims,and dougherty applied only for a permit,not a variance,an
