as director of community intensive training for youth city,a program for underprivileged youth operated by central alabama community college cacc,petitioner edward lane conducted an audit of the program expenses and discovered that suzanne schmitz,an alabama state representative on city payroll,had not been reporting for work.lane eventually terminated schmitz employment.shortly thereafter,federal authorities indicted schmitz on charges of mail fraud and theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.lane testified,under subpoena,regarding the events that led to his terminating schmitz.schmitz was convicted and sentenced to months in prison.meanwhile,city was experiencing significant budget shortfalls.respondent franks,then cacc president,terminated lane along with other employees in a claimed effort to address the financial difficulties.a few days later,however,franks rescinded all but of the terminations those of lane and one other employee.lane sued franks in his individual and official capacities under,alleging that franks had violated the first amendment by firing him in retaliation for testifying against schmitz.
the district court granted franks motion for summary judgment,holding that the claims were barred by qualified immunity and the claims were barred by the eleventh amendment.the eleventh circuit affirmed,holding that lane testimony was not entitled to first amendment protection.it reasoned that lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen because he acted pursuant to his official duties when he investigated and terminated schmitz employment.

b lane testimony is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.
sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of citizen speech for the simple reason that anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation,to the court and society at large,to tell the truth.that obligation is distinct and independent from any separate obligations a testifying public employee might have to his employer.the eleventh circuit read garcetti far too broadly in holding that lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified simply because he learned of the subject matter of that testimony in the course of his employment.garcetti said nothing about speech that relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of that employment.the critical question under garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee duties,not whether it merely concerns those duties.indeed,speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.
whether speech is a matter of public concern turns on the content,form,and context of the speech.connick myers.here,corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds obviously involve matters of significant public concern.see garcetti,at.and the form and context of the speech sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding fortify that conclusion.see united states alvarez.
c turning to pickering second step,the employer side of the scale is entirely empty.respondents do not assert,and can not demonstrate,any government interest that tips the balance in their favor for instance,evidence that lane testimony was false or or that lane unnecessarily disclosed sensitive,confidential,or privileged information while testifying.
franks is entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against him in his individual capacity.the question here is whether franks reasonably could have believed that,when he fired lane,a government employer could fire an employee because of testimony the employee gave,under oath and outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities.see ashcroft.at the relevant time,eleventh circuit precedent did not preclude franks from holding that belief,and no decision of this court was sufficiently clear to cast doubt on controlling circuit precedent.any discrepancies in eleventh circuit precedent only serve to highlight the dispositive point that the question was not beyond debate at the time franks acted.
the eleventh circuit declined to consider the district court dismissal of the claims against respondent burrow in her official capacity as cacc acting president,and the parties have not asked this court to consider them here.the judgment of the eleventh circuit as to those claims is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
almost years ago,this court declared that citizens do not surrender their first amendment rights by accepting public employment.rather,the first amendment protection of a public employee speech depends on a careful balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering board of ed.of township high school dist,will.in pickering,the court struck the balance in favor of the public employee,extending first amendment protection to a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper criticizing the school board that employed him.today,we consider whether the first amendment similarly protects a public employee who provided truthful sworn testimony,compelled by subpoena,outside the course of his ordinary job responsibilities.we hold that it does.
in,central alabama community college cacc hired petitioner edward lane to be the director of community intensive training for youth city,a statewide program for underprivileged youth.cacc hired lane on a probationary basis.in his capacity as director,lane was responsible for overseeing city operations,hiring and firing employees,and making decisions with respect to the program finances.
at the time of lane appointment,city faced significant financial difficulties.that prompted lane to conduct a comprehensive audit of the program expenses.the audit revealed that suzanne schmitz,an alabama state representative on city payroll,had not been reporting to her city office.after unfruitful discussions with schmitz,lane shared his finding with cacc president and its attorney.they warned him that firing schmitz could have negative repercussions for him and cacc.
lane nonetheless contacted schmitz again and instructed her to show up to the huntsville office to serve as a counselor.schmitz refused she responded that she wished to continue to serve the city program in the same manner as she had in the past.lane central.community college,fed.appx,per curiam.lane fired her shortly thereafter.schmitz told another city employee,charles foley,that she intended to get lane back for firing her.wl,nd.she also said that if lane ever requested money from the state legislature for the program,she would tell him,y ou fired.ibid.
schmitz termination drew the attention of many,including agents of the federal bureau of investigation,which initiated an investigation into schmitz employment with city.in november,lane testified before a federal grand jury about his reasons for firing schmitz.in january,the grand jury indicted schmitz on four counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.see united states schmitz.the indictment alleged that schmitz had collected in federal funds even though she performed virtually no services,generated virtually no work product,and rarely even appeared for work at the city program offices.at.it further alleged that schmitz had submitted false statements concerning the hours she worked and the nature of the services she performed,at.
schmitz trial,which garnered extensive press coverage commenced in august.lane testified,under subpoena,regarding the events that led to his terminating schmitz.the jury failed to reach a verdict.roughly six months later,federal prosecutors retried schmitz,and lane testified once again.this time,the jury convicted schmitz on three counts of mail fraud and four counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds.the district court sentenced her to months in prison and ordered her to pay in restitution and forfeiture.
meanwhile,city continued to experience considerable budget shortfalls.in november,lane began reporting to respondent steve franks,who had become president of cacc in january.lane recommended that franks consider layoffs to address the financial difficulties.in january,franks decided to terminate probationary city employees,including lane.shortly thereafter,however,franks rescinded all but of the terminations those of lane and one other employee because of an ambiguity in those other employees probationary service.brief for respondent franks.franks claims that he did not rescind lane termination because he believed that lane was in a fundamentally different category than the other employees he was the director of the entire city program,and not simply an employee.ibid.in september,cacc eliminated the city program and terminated the program remaining employees.franks later retired,and respondent susan burrow,the current acting president of cacc,replaced him while this case was pending before the eleventh circuit.
in january,lane sued franks in his individual and official capacities under stat,alleging that franks had violated the first amendment by firing him in retaliation for his testimony against schmitz lane sought damages from franks in his individual capacity and sought equitable relief,including reinstatement,from franks in his official capacity 
the district court granted franks motion for summary judgment.although the court concluded that the record raised genuine issues of material fact concerning franks true motivation for terminating lane employment,wl,it held that franks was entitled to qualified immunity as to the damages claims because a reasonable government official in franks position would not have had reason to believe that the constitution protected lane testimony,the district court relied on garcetti ceballos,which held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment.wl,quoting garcetti,at.the court found no violation of clearly established law because lane had learned of the information that he testified about while working as director at city,such that his speech could still be considered as part of his official job duties and not made as a citizen on a matter of public concern.wl.
the eleventh circuit affirmed.fed,at.like the district court,it relied extensively on garcetti.it reasoned that,e ven if an employee was not required to make the speech as part of his official duties,he enjoys no first amendment protection if his speech owes its existence to the employee professional responsibilities and is a product that the employer himself has commissioned or created.at quoting walker.the court concluded that lane spoke as an employee and not as a citizen because he was acting pursuant to his official duties when he investigated schmitz employment,spoke with schmitz and cacc officials regarding the issue,and terminated schmitz.fed,at.that lane testified about his official activities pursuant to a subpoena and in the litigation context,the court continued,does not bring lane speech within the protection of the first amendment.ibid.the eleventh circuit also concluded that,even if a constitutional violation of lane first amendment rights occurred in these circumstances,franks would be entitled to qualified immunity in his personal capacity because the right at issue had not been clearly established,at.
we granted certiorari,to resolve discord among the courts of appeals as to whether public employees may be fired or suffer other adverse employment consequences for providing truthful subpoenaed testimony outside the course of their ordinary job responsibilities.compare fed,at case below,with,reilly atlantic city.
speech by citizens on matters of public concern lies at the heart of the first amendment,which was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people,roth united states.this remains true when speech concerns information related to or learned through public employment.after all,public employees do not renounce their citizenship when they accept employment,and this court has cautioned time and again that public employers may not condition employment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights.see,keyishian board of regents of of state of,pickering,at connick myers.there is considerable value,moreover,in encouraging,rather than inhibiting,speech by public employees.for g overnment employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work.waters churchill,plurality opinion.the interest at stake is as much the public interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee own right to disseminate it.san diego roe,per curiam.
our precedents have also acknowledged the government countervailing interest in controlling the operation of its workplaces.see,pickering,at.government employers,like private employers,need a significant degree of control over their employees words and actions without it,there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services.garcetti,at.
pickering provides the framework for analyzing whether the employee interest or the government interest should prevail in cases where the government seeks to curtail the speech of its employees.it requires balanc ing the interests of the public employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.at.in pickering,the court held that a teacher letter to the editor of a local newspaper concerning a school budget constituted speech on a matter of public concern,at.and in balancing the employee interest in such speech against the government efficiency interest,the court held that the publication of the letter did not imped e the teacher proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or interfer e with the regular operation of the schools generally.at.the court therefore held that the teacher speech could not serve as the basis for his dismissal,at.
in garcetti,we described a inquiry into whether a public employee speech is entitled to protection 
the first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.if the answer is no,the employee has no first amendment cause of action based on his or her employer reaction to the speech.if the answer is yes,then the possibility of a first amendment claim arises.the question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.at citations omitted.
in describing the first step in this inquiry,garcetti distinguished between employee speech and citizen speech.whereas speech as a citizen may trigger protection,the court held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.at.applying that rule to the facts before it,the court found that an internal memorandum prepared by a prosecutor in the course of his ordinary job responsibilities constituted unprotected employee speech,at.
against this backdrop,we turn to the question presented whether the first amendment protects a public employee who provides truthful sworn testimony,compelled by subpoena,outside the scope of his ordinary job responsibilities we hold that it does.
the first inquiry is whether the speech in question lane testimony at schmitz trials is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.it clearly is.
truthful testimony under oath by a public employee outside the scope of his ordinary job duties is speech as a citizen for first amendment purposes.that is so even when the testimony relates to his public employment or concerns information learned during that employment.
in rejecting lane argument that his testimony was speech as a citizen,the eleventh circuit gave short shrift to the nature of sworn judicial statements and ignored the obligation borne by all witnesses testifying under oath.see fed,at finding immaterial the fact that lane spoke pursuant to a subpoena and in the litigation context sworn testimony in judicial proceedings is a quintessential example of speech as a citizen for a simple reason anyone who testifies in court bears an obligation,to the court and society at large,to tell the truth.see,criminalizing false statements under oath in judicial proceedings united states mandujano,plurality opinion perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concept of judicial proceedings when the person testifying is a public employee,he may bear separate obligations to his employer for example,an obligation not to show up to court dressed in an unprofessional manner.but any such obligations as an employee are distinct and independent from the obligation,as a citizen,to speak the truth.that independent obligation renders sworn testimony speech as a citizen and sets it apart from speech made purely in the capacity of an employee.
in holding that lane did not speak as a citizen when he testified,the eleventh circuit read garcetti far too broadly.it reasoned that,because lane learned of the subject matter of his testimony in the course of his employment with city,garcetti requires that his testimony be treated as the speech of an employee rather than that of a citizen.see fed,at.it does not.
the sworn testimony in this case is far removed from the speech at issue in garcetti an internal memorandum prepared by a deputy district attorney for his supervisors recommending dismissal of a particular prosecution.the garcetti court held that such speech was made pursuant to the employee official responsibilities because w hen the employee went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform,he acted as a government employee.the fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean that his supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his performance.at.
but garcetti said nothing about speech that simply relates to public employment or concerns information learned in the course of public employment.the garcetti court made explicit that its holding did not turn on the fact that the memo at issue concerned the subject matter of the prosecutor employment,because t he first amendment protects some expressions related to the speaker job.at.in other words,the mere fact that a citizen speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee rather than citizen speech.the critical question under garcetti is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee duties,not whether it merely concerns those duties.
it bears emphasis that our precedents dating back to pickering have recognized that speech by public employees on subject matter related to their employment holds special value precisely because those employees gain knowledge of matters of public concern through their employment.in pickering,for example,the court observed that t eachers are the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent.accordingly,it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.at see also garcetti,at recognizing that t he same is true of many other categories of public employees most recently,in san diego roe,at,the court again observed that public employees are uniquely qualified to comment on matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large.
the importance of public employee speech is especially evident in the context of this case a public corruption scandal.the united states,for example,represents that because t he more than prosecutions for federal corruption offenses that are brought in a typical year often depend on evidence about activities that government officials undertook while in office,those prosecutions often require testimony from other government employees.brief for united states as amicus curiae.it would be antithetical to our jurisprudence to conclude that the very kind of speech necessary to prosecute corruption by public officials speech by public employees regarding information learned through their employment may never form the basis for a first amendment retaliation claim.such a rule would place public employees who witness corruption in an impossible position,torn between the obligation to testify truthfully and the desire to avoid retaliation and keep their jobs.
applying these principles,it is clear that lane sworn testimony is speech as a citizen.
lane testimony is also speech on a matter of public concern.speech involves matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest that is,a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public.snyder phelps,slip,at citation omitted.the inquiry turns on the content,form,and context of the speech.connick,at.
the content of lane testimony corruption in a public program and misuse of state funds obviously involves a matter of significant public concern.see,garcetti,at exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance and the form and context of the speech sworn testimony in a judicial proceeding fortify that conclusion.unlike speech in other contexts,testimony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her statements will be the basis for official governmental action,action that often affects the rights and liberties of others.united states alvarez,slip,at plurality opinion.
we hold,then,that lane truthful sworn testimony at schmitz criminal trials is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.
this does not settle the matter,however.a public employee sworn testimony is not categorically entitled to first amendment protection simply because it is speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern.under pickering,if an employee speaks as a citizen on a matter of public concern,the next question is whether the government had an adequate justification for treating the
