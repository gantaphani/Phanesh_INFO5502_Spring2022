biosig filed this patent infringement suit,alleging that nautilus,without obtaining a license,sold exercise machines containing biosig patented technology.the district court,after conducting a hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent claims,granted nautilus motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claim term in spaced relationship with each other failed,definiteness requirement.the federal circuit reversed and remanded,concluding that a patent claim passes the,threshold so long as the claim is amenable to construction,and the claim,as construed,is not insolubly ambiguous.under that standard,the court determined,the patent survived indefiniteness review.

the federal circuit standard,which tolerates some ambiguous claims but not others,does not satisfy the statute definiteness requirement.the court of appeals inquired whether the patent claims were amenable to construction or insolubly ambiguous,but such formulations lack the precision,demands.to tolerate imprecision just short of that rendering a claim insolubly ambiguous would diminish the definiteness requirement function and foster the zone of uncertainty,united carbon,at,against which this court has warned.while some of the federal circuit fuller explications of the term insolubly ambiguous may come closer to tracking the statutory prescription,this court must ensure that the federal circuit test is at least probative of the essential inquiry.hilton davis chemical.the expressions insolubly ambiguous and amenable to construction,which permeate the federal circuit recent decisions concerning,fall short in this regard and can leave courts and the patent bar at sea without a reliable compass.

the patent in dispute,patent patent,issued to gregory lekhtman in and assigned to respondent biosig instruments,concerns a monitor for use during exercise.previous monitors,the patent asserts,were often inaccurate in measuring the electrical signals accompanying each heartbeat electrocardiograph or ecg signals.the inaccuracy was caused by electrical signals of a different sort,known as electromyogram or emg signals,generated by an exerciser skeletal muscles when,for example,she moves her arm,or grips an exercise monitor with her hand.these emg signals can mask ecg signals and thereby impede their detection.app.
lekhtman invention claims to improve on prior art by eliminating that impediment.the invention focuses on a key difference between emg and ecg waveforms while ecg signals detected from a user left hand have a polarity opposite to that of the signals detected from her right hand emg signals from each hand have the same polarity.the patented device works by measuring equalized emg signals detected at each hand and then using circuitry to subtract the identical emg signals from each other,thus filtering out the emg interference.
as relevant here,the patent describes a monitor contained in a hollow cylindrical bar that a user grips with both hands,such that each hand comes into contact with two electrodes,one live and one common.the device is illustrated in figure of the patent,at,reproduced in the appendix to this opinion.
claim of the patent,which contains the limitations critical to this dispute,refers to a heart rate monitor for use by a user in association with exercise apparatus exercise procedures.at.the claim comprise s,among other elements,an elongate member cylindrical bar with a display device electronic circuitry including a difference amplifier and,on each half of the cylindrical bar,a live electrode and a common electrode mounted in spaced relationship with each other.ibid the claim sets forth additional elements,including that the cylindrical bar is to be held in such a way that each of the user hands contact s both electrodes on each side of the bar,at.further,the emg signals detected by the two electrode pairs are to be of equal magnitude and phase so that the difference amplifier will produce a substantially zero emg signal upon subtracting the signals from one another.ibid.
the dispute between the parties arose in the,when biosig allegedly disclosed the patented technology to stairmaster sports medical products.according to biosig,stairmaster,without ever obtaining a license,sold exercise machines that included biosig patented technology,and petitioner nautilus,continued to do so after acquiring the stairmaster brand.in,based on these allegations,biosig brought a patent infringement suit against nautilus in the district court for the southern district of new york.
with biosig lawsuit launched,nautilus asked the patent and trademark office pto to reexamine the patent.the reexamination proceedings centered on whether the patent was anticipated or rendered obvious by prior art principally,a patent issued in to an inventor named fujisaki,which similarly disclosed a monitor using two pairs of electrodes and a difference amplifier.endeavoring to distinguish the patent from prior art,biosig submitted a declaration from lekhtman.the declaration attested,among other things,that the patent sufficiently informed a person skilled in the art how to configure the detecting electrodes so as to produce equal emg signals from the left and right hands.at.although the electrodes design variables including spacing,shape,size,and material can not be standardized across all exercise machines,lekhtman explained,a skilled artisan could undertake a trial and error process of equalization.this would entail experimentation with different electrode configurations in order to optimize emg signal cancellation,at,in,the pto issued a determination confirming the patentability of the patent claims.
biosig thereafter reinstituted its infringement suit,which the parties had voluntarily dismissed without prejudice while pto reexamination was underway.in,the district court conducted a hearing to determine the proper construction of the patent claims,see markman westview instruments,claim construction is a matter of law reserved for court decision,including the claim term in spaced relationship with each other.according to biosig,that spaced relationship referred to the distance between the live electrode and the common electrode in each electrode pair.nautilus,seizing on biosig submissions to the pto during the reexamination,maintained that the spaced relationship must be a distance greater than the width of each electrode.app.the district court ultimately construed the term to mean there is a defined relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on one side of the cylindrical bar and the same or a different defined relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on the other side of the cylindrical bar,without any reference to the electrodes width.app.to pet.for cert.
nautilus moved for summary judgment,arguing that the term spaced relationship,as construed,was indefinite under.the district court granted the motion.those words,the district court concluded,did not tell the court or anyone what precisely the space should be,or even supply any parameters for determining the appropriate spacing,at.
the federal circuit reversed and remanded.a claim is indefinite,the majority opinion stated,only when it is not amenable to construction or insolubly ambiguous.quoting datamize,llc plumtree software,ca fed.under that standard,the majority determined,the patent survived indefiniteness review.considering first the intrinsic evidence the claim language,the specification,and the prosecution history the majority discerned certain inherent parameters of the claimed apparatus,which to a skilled artisan may be sufficient to understand the metes and bounds of spaced relationship.at.these sources of meaning,the majority explained,make plain that the distance separating the live and common electrodes on each half of the bar can not be greater than the width of a user hands that is so because claim requires the live and common electrodes to independently detect electrical signals at two distinct points of a hand.ibid.furthermore,the majority noted,the intrinsic evidence teaches that this distance can not be infinitesimally small,effectively merging the live and common electrodes into a single electrode with one detection point.ibid.the claim functional provisions,the majority went on to observe,shed additional light on the meaning of spaced relationship.surveying the record before the pto on reexamination,the majority concluded that a skilled artisan would know that she could attain the indicated functions of equalizing and removing emg signals by adjusting design variables,including spacing.
in a concurring opinion,judge schall reached the majority result employing a more limited analysis.at.judge schall accepted the majority recitation of the definiteness standard,under which claims amenable to construction are nonetheless indefinite when the construction remains insolubly ambiguous.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.the district court construction of spaced relationship,judge schall maintained,was sufficiently clear the term means there is a fixed spatial relationship between the live electrode and the common electrode on each side of the cylindrical bar.ibid.judge schall agreed with the majority that the intrinsic evidence discloses inherent limits of that spacing.but,unlike the majority,judge schall did not presum e a functional linkage between the spaced relationship limitation and the removal of emg sig
