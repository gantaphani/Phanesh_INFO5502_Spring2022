respondent delia,a firefighter employed by the city of rialto,california,missed work after becoming ill on the job.suspicious of delia extended absence,the city hired a private investigation firm to conduct surveillance on him.when delia was seen buying fiberglass insulation and other building supplies,the city initiated an internal affairs investigation.it hired petitioner filarsky,a private attorney,to interview delia.at the interview,which delia attorney and two fire department officials also attended,delia acknowledged buying the supplies,but denied having done any work on his home.to verify delia claim,filarsky asked delia to allow a fire department official to enter his home and view the unused materials.when delia refused,filarsky ordered him to bring the materials out of his home for the official to see.this prompted delia attorney to threaten a civil rights action against the city and filarsky.nonetheless,after the interview concluded,officials followed delia to his home,where he produced the materials.
delia brought an action under against the city,the fire department,filarsky,and other individuals,alleging that the order to produce the building materials violated his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.the district court granted summary judgment to the individual defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed with respect to all individual defendants except filarsky,concluding that he was not entitled to seek qualified immunity because he was a private attorney,not a city employee.
held a private individual temporarily retained by the government to carry out its work is entitled to seek qualified immunity from suit under.
a in determining whether the court of appeals made a valid distinction between city employees and filarsky for qualified immunity purposes,this court looks to the general principles of tort immunities and defenses applicable at common law,and the reasons the court has afforded protection from suit under.see imbler pachtman.the common law as it existed in,when congress enacted,did not draw a distinction between public servants and private individuals engaged in public service in according protection to those carrying out government responsibilities.government at that time was smaller in both size and reach,had fewer responsibilities,and operated primarily at the local level.government work was carried out to a significant extent by individuals who did not devote all their time to public duties,but instead pursued private callings as well.in according protection from suit to individuals doing the government work,the common law did not draw distinctions based on the nature of a worker engagement with the government.indeed,examples of individuals receiving immunity for actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occasional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself.common law principles of immunity were incorporated into and should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent.see pulliam allen.immunity under therefore should not vary depending on whether an individual working for the government does so as a permanent or employee,or on some other basis.
b nothing about the reasons this court has given for recognizing immunity under counsels against carrying forward the common law rule.first,the government interest in avoiding unwarranted timidity on the part of those engaged in the public has been called the most important special government concern,richardson mcknight,is equally implicated regardless of whether the individual sued as a state actor works for the government or on some other basis.second,affording immunity to those acting on the government behalf serves to ensure that talented candidates are not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.at.the government,in need of specialized knowledge or expertise,may look outside its permanent workforce to secure the services of private individuals.but because those individuals are free to choose other work that would not expose them to liability for government actions,the most talented candidates might decline public engagements if they did not receive the same immunity enjoyed by their public employee counterparts.third,the public interest in ensuring performance of government duties free from the distractions that can accompany lawsuits is implicated whether those duties are discharged by private individuals or permanent government employees.finally,distinguishing among those who carry out the public business based on their particular relationship with the government creates significant problems and can deprive state actors of the ability to reasonably anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages,anderson creighton.
c this conclusion is not contrary to wyatt cole,or richardson mcknight.wyatt did not implicate the reasons underlying recognition of qualified immunity because the defendant in that case had no connection to government and pursued purely private ends.richardson involved the unusual circumstances of prison guards employed by a private company who worked in a privately run prison facility.nothing of the sort is involved here,or in the typical case of an individual hired by the government to assist in carrying out its work.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
section provides a cause of action against state actors who violate an individual rights under federal law.at common law,those who carried out the work of government enjoyed various protections from liability when doing so,in order to allow them to serve the government without undue fear of personal exposure.our decisions have looked to these common law protections in affording either absolute or qualified immunity to individuals sued under.the question in this case is whether an individual hired by the government to do its work is prohibited from seeking such immunity,solely because he works for the government on something other than a permanent or basis.
nicholas delia,a firefighter employed by the city of rialto,california,became ill while responding to a toxic spill in august.under a doctor orders,delia missed three weeks of work.the city became suspicious of delia extended absence,and hired a private investigation firm to conduct surveillance on him.the private investigators observed delia purchasing building several rolls of fiberglass insulation from a home improvement store.the city surmised that delia was missing work to do construction on his home rather than because of illness,and it initiated a formal internal affairs investigation of him.
delia was ordered to appear for an administrative investigation interview.the city hired steve filarsky to conduct the interview.filarsky was an experienced employment lawyer who had previously represented the city in several investigations.delia and his attorney attended the interview,along with filarsky and two fire department officials,mike peel and frank bekker.during the interview,filarsky questioned delia about the building supplies.delia acknowledged that he had purchased the supplies,but claimed that he had not yet done the work on his home.
during a break,filarsky met with peel,bekker,and fire chief stephen wells.filarsky proposed resolving the investigation by verifying delia claim that he had not done any work on his home.to do so,filarsky recommended asking delia to produce the building materials.chief wells approved the plan.
when the meeting resumed,filarsky requested permission for peel to enter delia home to view the materials.on the advice of counsel,delia refused.filarsky then asked delia if he would be willing to bring the materials out onto his lawn,so that peel could observe them without entering his home.delia again refused to consent.unable to obtain delia cooperation,filarsky ordered him to produce the materials for inspection.
delia counsel objected to the order,asserting that it would violate the fourth amendment.when that objection proved unavailing,delia counsel threatened to sue the city.he went on to tell filarsky that w e might quite possibly find a way to figure if we can name you filarsky.if you want to take that chance,you go right ahead.app.the threat was repeated over and over e verybody is going to get named,and they are going to sweat it out as to whether or not they have individual liability y ou order him and you will be named and that is not an idle threat.whoever issues that order is going to be named in the lawsuit.w e will seek any and all damages including individual liability w e are coming if you order this.m ake sure the spelling is clear in the order so we know who to sue.at.despite these threats,filarsky prepared an order directing delia to produce the materials,which chief wells signed.
as soon as the interview concluded,peel and bekker followed delia to his home.once there,delia,his attorney,and a union representative went into delia house,brought out the four rolls of insulation,and placed them on delia lawn.peel and bekker,who remained in their car during this process,thanked delia for showing them the insulation and drove off.
delia brought an action under against the city,its fire department,chief wells,peel,bekker,filarsky,and ten unidentified individuals,alleging that the order to produce the building materials violated his rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.the district court granted summary judgment to all the individual defendants,concluding that they were protected by qualified immunity.the court held that delia had not demonstrated a violation of a clearly established constitutional right,because delia was not threatened with insubordination or termination if he did not comply with any order given and none of these defendants entered his house.delia rialto,no.cv cd,app.to pet.for cert.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed with respect to all defendants except filarsky.the court of appeals concluded that the order violated the fourth amendment,but agreed with the district court that delia ha d not demonstrated that a constitutional right was clearly established as of the date of chief wells order,such that defendants would have known that their actions were unlawful.delia rialto.as to filarsky,however,the court concluded that because he was a private attorney and not a city employee,he was not entitled to seek the protection of qualified immunity,at.the court noted that its decision conflicted with a decision of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit,see cullinan abramson,but considered itself bound by circuit precedent and therefore not free to follow the cullinan decision.at citing gonzalez spencer.
filarsky filed a petition for certiorari,which we granted.
section provides a cause of action against any person who deprives an individual of federally guaranteed rights under color of state law.anyone whose conduct is fairly attributable to the state can be sued as a state actor under.see lugar edmondson oil.at common law,government actors were afforded certain protections from liability,based on the reasoning that the public good can best be secured by allowing officers charged with the duty of deciding upon the rights of others,to act upon their own free,unbiased convictions,uninfluenced by any apprehensions.wasson mitchell,iowa,internal quotation marks omitted see also prosser,law of torts,common law protections derived from the need to avoid the impossible burden that would fall upon all our agencies of government if those acting on behalf of the government were unduly hampered and intimidated in the discharge of their duties by a fear of personal liability.our decisions have recognized similar immunities under,reasoning that common law protections well grounded in history and reason had not been abrogated by covert inclusion in the general language of.imbler pachtman,quoting tenney brandhove.
in this case,there is no dispute that qualified immunity is available for the sort of investigative activities at issue.see pearson callahan.the court of appeals granted this protection to chief wells,peel,and bekker,but denied it to filarsky,because he was not a public employee but was instead a private individual retained by the city to participate in internal affairs investigations.at.in determining whether this distinction is valid,we look to the general principles of tort immunities and defenses applicable at common law,and the reasons we have afforded protection from suit under.imbler,supra,at.
under our precedent,the inquiry begins with the common law as it existed when congress passed in.tower glover.understanding the protections the common law afforded to those exercising government power in requires an appreciation of the nature of government at that time.in the century,government was smaller in both size and reach.it had fewer responsibilities,and operated primarily at the local level.local governments faced tight budget constraints,and generally had neither the need nor the ability to maintain an established bureaucracy staffed by professionals.see campbell,the growth of american government governance from the cleveland era to the present,at noting that in the t he governor office staff in wisconsin totaled five workers if we count the lieutenant governor and the janitor 
as one commentator has observed,there was at that time no very clear conception of a professional office,that is,an office the incumbent of which devotes his entire time to the discharge of public functions,who has no other occupation,and who receives a sufficiently large compensation to enable him to live without resorting to other means.goodnow,principles of the administrative law of the united states.instead,to a significant extent,government was administered by members of society who temporarily or occasionally discharge d public functions.at.whether government relied primarily upon professionals or occasional workers obviously varied across the country and across different government functions.but even at the turn of the twentieth century,a public servant was often one who does not devote his entire time to his public duties,but is,at the same time that he is holding public office,permitted to carry on some other regular business,and as a matter of fact finds his main means of support in such business or in his private means since he receives from his office a compensation insufficient to support him.at.
private citizens were actively involved in government work,especially where the work most directly touched the lives of the people.it was not unusual,for example,to see the owner of the local general store step behind a window in his shop to don his postman hat.see,stole stamps,maysville,ky,the evening bulletin,reporting that t he post office and general store at mount hope was broken into,resulting in the loss of worth of cutlery and stamps.nor would it have been a surprise to find,on a trip to the docks,the local ferryman collecting harbor fees as public wharfmaster.see johnson,a history of kentucky and kentuckians.
even such a core government activity as criminal prosecution was often carried out by a mixture of public employees and private individuals temporarily serving the public.at the time was enacted,private lawyers were regularly engaged to conduct criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state.see,commonwealth gibbs,white polk county,iowa.abraham lincoln himself accepted several such appointments.see,an awful crime and speedy punishment,springfield daily register,may,reporting that lincoln,was appointed prosecutor in a rape case.in addition,private lawyers often assisted public prosecutors in significant cases.see,commonwealth knapp,chambers state.and public prosecutors themselves continued to represent private clients while in office sometimes creating odd conflicts of interest.see people bussey,public prosecutor employed as private counsel by the defendant wife in several civil suits against the defendant phillip waller,haw,public prosecutor represented plaintiff in a suit for malicious prosecution oliver pate,public prosecutor who conducted a state prosecution against a defendant later served as counsel for the defendant in a malicious prosecution suit against the complaining witness.
this mixture of public responsibility and private pursuits extended even to the highest levels of government.until the position became in,for example,the attorney general of the united states was expected to and did maintain an active private law practice.to cite a notable illustration,in hayburn case,dall,the first attorney general,edmund randolph,sought a writ of mandamus from this court to compel a lower court to hear william hayburn petition to be put on the pension list.when this court did not allow the attorney general to seek the writ in his official capacity,randolph readily solved the problem by arguing the case as hayburn private lawyer.see also letter from edmund randolph to james madison,reprinted in the papers of james madison,rutland,mason,brugger,sisson,teute eds.bloch,the early role of the attorney general in our constitutional scheme in the beginning there was pragmatism,duke.
given all this,it should come as no surprise that the common law did not draw a distinction between public servants and private individuals engaged in public service in according protection to those carrying out government responsibilities.government actors involved in adjudicative activities,for example,were protected by an absolute immunity from suit.see bradley fisher,wall,bishop,commentaries on the law.this immunity applied equally to the highest judge in the state or nation and the lowest officer who sits as a court and tries petty causes,cooley,law of torts,including those who served as judges on a or episodic basis.justices of the peace,for example,often maintained active private law practices or even had nonlegal livelihoods,and generally served in a judicial capacity only.see hubbell harbeck,hun,ingraham leland.in fact,justices of the peace were not even paid a salary by the government,but instead received compensation through fees payable by the parties that came before them.see murfee,the justice of the peace.yet the common law extended the same immunity to a justice of the peace as to any other judicial officer.pratt gardner,see also mangold thorpe.
the common law also extended certain protections to individuals engaged in law enforcement activities,such as sheriffs and constables.at the time was enacted,however,t he line between public and private policing was frequently hazy.private detectives and privately employed patrol personnel often were publicly appointed as special policemen,and the means and objects of detective work,in particular,made it difficult to distinguish between those on the public payroll and private detectives.sklansky,the private police,ucla,footnotes and internal quotation marks omitted.the protections provided by the common law did not turn on whether someone we today would call a police officer worked for the government or instead for both public and private employers.rather,at common law,a special constable,duly appointed according to law,ha d all the powers of a regular constable so far as may be necessary for the proper discharge of the special duties intrusted to him,and in the lawful discharge of those duties,was as fully protected as any other officer.murfee,a treatise on the law of sheriffs and other ministerial officers.
sheriffs executing a warrant were empowered by the common law to enlist the aid of the men of the community in doing so.see blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england in re quarles.while serving as part of this posse comitatus,a private individual had the same authority as the sheriff,and was protected to the same extent.see,robinson state,a member of a posse comitatus summoned by the sheriff to aid in the execution of a warrant for a felony in the sheriff hands is entitled to the same protection in the discharge of his duties as the sheriff himself state mooring,considering it well settled by the courts that a sheriff may break open the doors of a house to execute a search warrant and that if he act in good faith in doing so,both he and his posse comitatus will be protected north carolina gosnell,cc wdnc both judicial and ministerial officers,in the execution of the duties of their office,are under the strong protection of the law and their legally summoned assistants,for such time as in service,are officers of the law reed rice,app.private individuals summoned by a constable to execute a search warrant were protected from a suit based on the invalidity of the warrant.
indeed,examples of individuals receiving immunity for actions taken while engaged in public service on a temporary or occasional basis are as varied as the reach of government itself.see,gregory brooks,public wharfmaster not liable for ordering removal of a vessel unless the order was issued maliciously henderson smith,notaries public given immunity for discretionary acts taken in good faith chamberlain clayton,iowa,trustees of a public institution for the disabled not liable absent a showing of malice mccormick burt,school board members not liable for suspending a student in good faith donohue richards,me,same downer lent,cal,members of a board of pilot commissioners given immunity for official acts rail potts baker,private individuals appointed by the sheriff to serve as judges of an election were not liable for refusing a voter absent a showing of malice jenkins waldron,johns,ny sup.same.
we read in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses.imbler,at.and we proceed on the assumption that principles of immunity were incorporated into our judicial system and that they should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so.pulliam allen.under this assumption,immunity under should not vary depending on whether an individual working for the government does so as a employee,or on some other basis.
nothing about the reasons we have given for recognizing immunity under counsels against carrying forward the common law rule.as we have explained,such immunity protect s government ability to perform its traditional functions.wyatt cole.it does so by helping to avoid unwarranted timidity in performance of public duties,ensuring that talented candidates are not deterred from public service,and preventing the harmful distractions from carrying out the work of government that can often accompany damages suits.richardson mcknight.
we have called the government interest in avoiding unwarranted timidity on the part of those engaged in the public business the most important special government concern.at.ensuring that those who serve the government do so with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good,scheuer rhodes,is of vital importance regardless whether the individual sued as a state actor works or on some other basis.
affording immunity not only to public employees but also to others acting on behalf of the government similarly serves to ensure that talented candidates are not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.richardson,supra,at quoting wyatt,supra,at.the government need to attract talented individuals is not limited to public employees.indeed,it is often when there is a particular need for specialized knowledge or expertise that the government must look outside its permanent work force to secure the services of private individuals.this case is a good example filarsky had years of specialized experience as an attorney in labor,employment,and personnel matters,with particular expertise in conducting internal affairs investigations.app.to pet.for cert,app.the city of rialto certainly had no permanent employee with anything approaching those qualifications.to the extent such private individuals do not depend
