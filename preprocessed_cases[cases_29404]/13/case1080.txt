the federal treasury enterprise sojuzplodoimport fte,a entity of the russian federation,and oao moscow distillery cristall cristall,fte exclusive licensee fte and cristall together,plaintiffs appeal from the judgment of the district court daniels,judge dismissing their claims for trademark infringement against defendants spi spirits limited and other related individuals and corporations together,defendants.plaintiffs infringement claims rest on a theory that defendants misappropriated and,since the early,have made unauthorized commercial use in the united states of certain united trademarks related to stolichnaya brand vodka the marks plaintiffs maintain that defendants asserted title to the marks is invalid,and that defendants use of the marks infringes the rights of the marks purported true owner,the russian federation.in this appeal,we examine whether plaintiffs themselves have sufficient claim to the marks to sue for infringement under the lanham act the act.
we conclude that,under the operative provisions of the act,fte is neither the russian federation assign of the marks for it has not been granted all relevant rights associated with the marks by a duly executed writing nor its legal representative for the complaint provides no basis to conclude that the russian federation is unable to pursue lanham act remedies.see.we further conclude that cristall may not sue,since its rights as a plaintiff are purely derivative of those held by fte,and fte may not grant rights greater than its own.we reject plaintiffs joint argument that they are entitled to proceed because the russian federation has ratified their suit.neither plaintiff,therefore,is entitled to sue for infringement under,and,accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs third amended complaint with prejudice.
background 
having set forth the factual background of this case at length in fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,cir fte ii,we address the facts here only insofar as they are relevant to the legal issues implicated by this appeal.because plaintiffs challenge the district court grant of a motion to dismiss plaintiffs third amended complaint the operative complaint or complaint,the description provided below is drawn primarily from the allegations set forth in that document and from documents attached to it,incorporated in it by reference,or otherwise relied on by plaintiffs in bringing suit.see atsi commc ns shaar fund,ltd,cir.
the trademarks 
this dispute arises out of the contested ownership of american trademarks related to stolichnaya vodka,a distilled spirit originally made in russia,and whose iconic russian name can be translated as from the capital.according to the complaint,stolichnaya brand vodka has been owned either by the soviet union or by the russian federation for decades.fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,third am.compl,ecf.in the late,the soviet union,acting through a enterprise,registered a trademark in stolichnaya with the united states patent and trademark office the uspto.over the subsequent decades,the uspto issued other trademark registrations relating to stolichnaya to various entities 
in,as the soviet union collapsed,evgeniy filippovich sorochkin,the general director of vvo spi the soviet enterprise then holding the marks,sought personally to acquire vvo spi assets,including the marks,through a new corporation.the corporation formed by sorochkin purported to privatize vvo spi.it then entered into a series of complex transactions that ultimately vested all defendants with at least putative interests in the marks,either by license or assignment 
in the early,the russian federation as successor to interests held by state enterprises is alleged to have discovered that sorochkin and others had failed to comply with laws governing the privatization of state assets when they conducted the relevant transactions a decade earlier.in december,a russian court held that,under russian law,vvo spi continued to exist as a public entity.as one consequence of that holding,and pursuant to applicable russian laws,the russian federation then withdrew the rights and property entrusted to vvo spi,and gradually,through manifold legal and bureaucratic maneuvers,its rights,including the rights to the marks.am.compl.
fte describes russian law as prohibiting governmental bodies from conduct ing business activities.am.compl.after retrieving its rights to the marks,therefore,the russian federation,acting through its ministry of agriculture and ministry of property relations,formed fte as a new entity charged with as alleged here exploit ing the stolichnaya trademarks on behalf of the russian federation.see also am.compl.
formation of fte 
in a series of decrees issued over time,the russian federation endowed fte with certain rights.centrally relevant here are three source documents conveying those rights fte charter,which was adopted by the russian federation in a march decree a july decree that governs fte rights to various trademarks,including the original united stolichnaya mark and a january decree that addresses fte right to prosecute suits in foreign courts 
fte charter sets forth the purposes and subject of activities of the enterprise,the property of the enterprise,and the rights and responsibilities of the enterprise.it does not,however,expressly mention stolichnaya or any of the marks.rather,the charter advises generally that fte was established for the purposes of organizing the manufacture of products,and wholesale and retail trade of vegetables,fruits,spices,coffee,tea,soft drinks,and all types of strong drinks a phrase that,none dispute,includes vodka and other alcoholic beverages.charter.the charter also imparts to fte the authority to organize the export and import of all types of strong drinks and to us e in accordance with established procedure the trade marks of strong drinks and alcoholic products.charter c,i.it entitles fte to protect and restor e the russian manufacturers violated rights to trade marks of any products.charter j.
the charter also outlines the relationship between fte and the russian federation,declaring that property entrusted to fte,am.compl,shall be in federal ownership,but shall be assigned to fte in accordance with established procedure for operative administration.charter.with respect to property assigned to it,the charter limits fte authority.for example,in addition to the unexceptional limitation that fte shall not be entitled to carry on activities which are not provided for by the charter,fte also is not entitled to alienate or otherwise dispose of the property assigned to it except with the consent of the federal executive authorities.charter.
in addition,the charter retains for the government of the russian federation the right to impound any property assigned to fte that is excessive,is not used at all or is not used in conformity with its purpose.charter.finally,the charter expressly contemplates the possibility of fte in accordance with established procedure by decision of the government of the russian federation and on other grounds contemplated by civil legislation of the russian federation.charter.
in contrast to the charter,the july decree refers expressly to the original united stolichnaya mark it authorizes fte to use and dispose without the right to assign,in accordance with the procedure established by the ministry of agriculture,certain listed alcoholic and spirituous marks,including the stolichnaya mark.july decree.it further directs that the ministry of agriculture of the russian federation will develop and approve the procedure for the use by fte of the trade marks.id.
issued three years later,in response to inquiries by foreign courts,the january decree was intended to confirm fte right to sue in foreign courts in its own name to protect or recover the russian federation rights to trademarks for alcoholic products abroad.am.compl.it states that fte is charge d with represent ing the interests of the russian federation in the courts on matters of recovery and protection of the rights of the russian federation to the trademarks for alcoholic products abroad,and to realize registration of the rights of the russian federation to the mentioned trademarks abroad.decree.of note for present purposes,it includes an express sunset provision,providing that its authorization will be valid only until january,id,but fte further alleges that unnamed s ubsequent decrees,the newest of which remains in force,have continued to confirm fte authority.am.compl.
fte has exercised its authority with regard to the marks in a number of ways,it alleges.among other things,at an unspecified time,it granted an exclusive license to cristall to manufacture,for sale in the united states,vodka and other products that bear the marks.further,fte has sued to enforce stolichnaya trademarks,not only in the united states,but in the netherlands and other countries as well.
procedural history 
in october,fte sued defendants shefler,oliynik,and domecq in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in its original complaint,fte asserted ten separate claims in the nature of unfair competition and trademark or copyright infringement,some under the lanham act,others under state common law,and one under article of the paris convention for the protection of industrial property.original complaint.in addition to seeking defendants related profits and fte damages,fte requested a declaratory judgment confirming its right to the marks rectification of the trademark register to show fte as the marks holder and cancellation of stolichnaya related marks.orig.compl.at.
defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that fte lacked statutory standing to enforce the marks and that defendant domecq claimed rights in the marks had become incontestable under the act see.the district court granted defendants motion,agreeing that the marks had become incontestable and that therefore fte challenge to the validity of defendants assignment of the marks to domecq was barred.see fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,d fte i,vacated in part by fte ii,cir.the district court also considered and dismissed certain of fte common law claims.id.at.
on appeal,our court affirmed the district court dismissal of fte common law claims,but vacated the dismissal of fte lanham act claims.see fte ii,at.in contrast to the district court,we concluded that the incontestability doctrine posed no obstacle to fte challenge to defendants claim of ownership in the marks absent a demonstration that defendants had received the marks through a valid assignment.id.in a concurrent summary order,however,we found that despite additional briefing submitted at our request the record remained too sparse to determine whether,under federal rule of civil procedure,additional parties required to be joined if feasible in particular,the russian federation were missing from the litigation.in this regard,we observed that notwithstanding its literal grant to fte of the right to represent the interests of the russian federation in the courts on matters of recovery and protection of the rights of the russian federation to the trademarks for alcoholic products abroad the january decree on its face,does not appear to be an obvious transfer of ownership to fte.fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,app x,cir summary order.the panel left it to the district court on remand to determine,in the first instance,whether the required parties are before it.id.
in february,fte filed its third amended complaint.in it,fte added its exclusive licensee,cristall,as a plaintiff,and grant sons,spi new distributor,as a defendant.defendants again moved to dismiss,arguing that fte and,by extension,cristall lacked standing to sue under the lanham act.
looking to the lanham act requirement that a party be a registrant to have standing to sue under section,and the act definition of registrant as embracing the registrant legal representatives,predecessors,successors and assigns,the district court agreed with defendants and held that plaintiffs lacked standing under the lanham act.it concluded that fte did not qualify as an assign of the russian federation within the meaning of the lanham act,finding insufficient the complaint allegation that fte was entrusted with and granted the exclusive right to use the marks.am.compl.reasoning that fte charter indicates in clear and unambiguous language that fte rights over the trademarks entrusted to it are neither tantamount to ownership,nor sufficient to permit plaintiff fte to exclude the russian federation from taking action with respect to the marks,and noting fte concession that the russian federation not fte owned the marks,the district court found the grant inadequate for lanham act standing purposes,because a trademark assignment requires the sale or transfer of all rights in the mark.fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,civ,wl,at,fte iii emphasis added see also am.compl.referring to the russian federation ultimate ownership of both fte and the marks.
the district court held further that fte was not a legal representative of the russian federation within the meaning of the act.the court explained that,although the january decree authorized fte to sue to protect the marks on the russian federation behalf,the plain and ordinary meaning of the term legal representative is one who appears on behalf of a trademark owner that is unable or incapable of representing itself and enforcing its own rights.id.at.the court held that fte had failed to allege facts plausibly showing that it was somehow necessary for fte to pursue this litigation in its own name or that the russian federation was unable to appear before the court.id.at.

choice of law.although the marks were developed in russia and are used around the world,plaintiffs claims in this suit derive from the marks registration in the united states.therefore,united states law provides the relevant framework for addressing whether plaintiffs are entitled to bring suit under the lanham act.see berni int l gourmet rests.of americas,cir.to proceed under the act,a plaintiff rights in the mark must be established with reference to law.id.concluding that former foreign shareholders in a united states trademark registrant incorporated abroad lacked statutory standing to bring a lanham act trademark infringement claim.
plaintiffs contend,however,that the rights transferred by the charter and other documents must be determined under the law of the russian federation,and argue that fte rights under russian law are sufficient to support their standing to sue here.appellants br.for support,they cite to our opinion in itar tass russian news agency russian kurier,cir,where we stated in a copyright dispute involving a russian plaintiff that russian law is the appropriate source of law to determine issues of ownership of rights.id.at.importantly,however,in itar tass we declined to consider which law determined the validity of an assignment of rights,id.at,and we observed that u nder united states law,an owner may sue for infringement in a united states court only if it meets the standing test set out by the copyright act,id.at.for our purposes here,then,itar tass supports plaintiffs view that russian law may be relevant to this dispute.but russian law is only relevant in helping to determine the relationship between fte and the russian federation the marks.united states law guides our determination of whether this relationship extends sufficient rights to fte for it to be characterized as an assign or legal representative with standing to sue under section of the lanham act.
ii.lanham act standing 
the lanham act was intended to make actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks and to protect persons engaged in commerce against unfair competition.two pesos,taco cabana,quoting.toward this end,the act provides separate causes of action for,among other things,infringement of registered and unregistered trademarks.see registered trademark id.unregistered trademark or trade dress see also two pesos,at.
section of the act,at issue here protects only registered trademarks.it provides a cause of action against any person who use s in commerce any imitation of a registered mark likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.id.this cause of action is available,however,only to registrant s of the trademarks at issue,a term the act defines as embracing the actual registrant legal representatives,predecessors,successors and assigns.in other words,only registrants as statutorily defined have statutory standing to bring an action under section.see allen wright,explaining that to have standing,a plaintiff complaint must fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.this provision contrasts with section of the act,which allows suits by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by the defendant actions.a emphasis added.fte standing here in this action under section thus hinges on whether it has alleged facts plausibly showing that it falls within the statute definition of registrant.as fte exclusive licensee,cristall standing depends in its entirety on fte.
fte acknowledges as it must that the russian federation is the true owner of the marks.see am.compl.it contends nonetheless that it falls within the act definition of registrant.first,it asserts that the russian federation has assigned to it the federation ownership interest in the marks.second,and alternatively,it maintains that it is the russian federation legal representative for purposes of pursuing this infringement claim.
we note as an initial matter that in none of fte complaints has it expressly alleged that it is either an assign or a legal representative.fte argues,however,that the complaint allegation that fte is the only entity with the right to use and dispose of the marks,am.compl,is sufficient to establish statutory standing at this stage.although it may be peculiar that the relevant terminology does not appear in the operative complaint,this absence is of course not fatal to plaintiffs standing arguments,for we may perform a functional analysis to determine whether the act requirements are met.and at this stage,we may look not only to the complaint but also to documents incorporated into the complaint by reference and relied on by the plaintiffs in bringing suit.see border cablevision,cir.such documents include the charter and the and decrees.in examining these documents,we are mindful that any ambiguities should be resolved in plaintiffs favor.see subaru distribs.subaru of,cir.
we first address whether fte is an assign of the russian federation with regard to the marks,and conclude that it is not.second,we address the meaning of the phrase legal representative as used in the act an issue that appears to be one of first impression among federal courts of appeals and conclude that the district court correctly determined that this term denotes not merely one whom an appointing entity designates its legal representative,but requires in addition that the appointing entity be legally unable to bring suit on its own behalf.because fte has not sufficiently alleged that the russian federation is unable to appear in this litigation,fte is not a legal representative with standing to sue under section.
fte is not an assign or its equivalent under the lanham act 
plaintiffs argue that fte is an assign of the marks because it has been granted exclusive rights to the marks,including the right to use,license and enforce the marks in essence,maintaining that it is either a true assign,or,as an exclusive licensee of the russian federation,it has rights tantamount to those conveyed in an assignment.appellants br.defendants retort that fte rights to the marks fall short of those required to constitute an assignment for purposes of the act.we think that defendants have the better of the argument.
at least two requisites are inherent in the concept of assignment under the act the need for the relevant assigning document to be effected by instrument in writing duly executed,a and the need for the assignment to transfer an ownership interest in the marks at issue.because the conveyance to fte falls short on these measures,we conclude that fte is not an assign of the russian federation for statutory standing purposes under the act.we then turn to the question whether,casting fte as the russian federation exclusive licensee,fte rights are nonetheless tantamount to those of an assign.we answer that question,too,in the negative.
duly executed instrument in writing 
section of the act declares,assignments shall be by instruments in writing duly executed,a,and directs the uspto to maintain a record of information on assignments,id.a.
the various documents presented to support plaintiffs position that fte is an assign of the russian federation do not resemble an assignment under united states law,even taking them flexibly and as a cumulative whole.as discussed above,although the charter refers generally to property assigned to fte it does not expressly mention the marks.the july decree,which does refer to a stolichnaya mark,does not declare that the russian federation is assigning anything to fte rather,the document provides that the russian federation is conveying to fte the rights to use and dispose of one of the marks,without any mention at all of assignment,or transferring ownership,or the good will symbolized by the marks.
although we do not here purport to set out a rule requiring that lanham act assignments take a particular written form,we note just how far the charter and the decrees language lies from the unequivocal transfer of title and good will normally required to effectuate an assignment of rights.restatement second contracts it is essential to an assignment of a right that the assignor manifest an intention to transfer the right to another person without further action or manifestation of intention by the assignor.
regulations issued by the uspto reflect an expectation that assignments will be clearly stated in writing,and the assigned marks identified with specificity.thus,to register a trademark assignment,the uspto requires that the assignee submit a cover sheet with information including e ach trademark registration number and each trademark application number or a copy of the application or a reproduction of the trademark.a i.none of the documents at issue here states that russia has transferred title to the marks to fte,and only one mark is identified in any of the documents empowering fte.
although it may seem formalistic,the writing requirement is rooted in real policy concerns.in the copyright context,the ninth circuit has explained that the copyright act writing requirement,a,serves the ends of ensuring that the owner of intellectual property will not assign it inadvertently forcing parties to determine the precise rights being transferred and enhancing predictability and certainty of ownership.effects,cohen,cir.similarly,the predictability and certainty arising from a clear writing assigning a trademark dovetail comfortably with the standing requirements of section.a clear writing effecting an assignment signals to the parties and the world that the assign is the party that owns the mark and is authorized to exclude others from use.there is no such writing in the record before us,nor is such a writing adequately alleged in the complaint.
transfer of ownership rights in the marks 
even if we were to treat the act formal writing requirement as potentially satisfied by aspects of the charter and the and decrees,those documents leave the russian federation with not only ownership,but simply too great an operational interest in the marks for us to consider the federation as having assigned the marks to fte for purposes of the act.
according to one acknowledged authority in the field,an assignment is an outright sale of all rights in that mark.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition ed emphasis added.professor mccarthy further advises that an assignment is by definition a legal document that transfers title to the mark.id.see also id.after an assignment,the assignor has divested itself of its trademark rights.other commentators have echoed this view.see,siegrun kane,kane on trademark law ed.a trademark assignment is a transfer of ownership.the trademark owner assignor gives up all rights to the mark.those rights are acquired by the assignee,who stands in the shoes of the assignor.restatement third of unfair competition the owner of a trademark,trade name,collective mark,or certification mark may transfer ownership of the designation to another through an assignment.
regulations promulgated by the uspto similarly suggest its expectation that a trademark assignment will effect a transfer of ownership.those concerning the issuance of a n ew certificate on change of ownership require that t he assignment or other document changing title must be recorded in the uspto.a emphasis added.
finally,in the more specific context of standing under section,professor mccarthy concludes that both as a matter of statutory interpretation and under general principles of trademark law,only the owner of the trademark is entitled to sue for its infringement.mccarthy.and district courts in this circuit have long held and persuasively reasoned that a party is not an assign for standing purposes under the lanham act unless that party owns the mark at issue 
our own case law on the subject is sparse,but we appear to have accepted that a transfer of an ownership interest in a mark is a predicate to standing for any putative assign.in dep.interstate cigar,cir,for example,we considered whether the exclusive distributor of soap bearing a registered trademark could sue for infringement.to determine whether the plaintiff had functionally been assigned the mark at issue,we looked to the language of the distribution agreement.that document provided that the plaintiff shall not during the continuance of this arrangement or thereafter have or claim any right whatsoever whether of user or otherwise to or in any such trade marks,trade names or brands used in connection with p roducts.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we found this express language dispositive,even if the plaintiff as an exclusive distributor has the greatest interest in bringing an infringement action.id.at.the agreement deni ed the plaintiff any property interest in the trademark,id.at,and we accordingly concluded that the plaintiff could not bring a claim for infringement under section.
fte argues that these cases and authorities misinterpret the act insofar as they require that an assign obtain ownership of or title to a mark.according to fte,congress could have limited standing under section to trademark owners,as it did elsewhere in the act,see d a providing standing in cyberpiracy cases only to the owner of the mark.instead,congress chose to enlarge standing for violations of section to include a registrant legal representatives,predecessors,successors and assigns.fte maintains that this list of proper plaintiffs includes entities that do not actually own the trademarks at issue,and so ownership can not be a sine qua non of statutory standing.further,fte notes that professor mccarthy who elsewhere asserts that an assignment amounts to an outright sale of all rights in that mark also observes that an assignment is valid even though it may reserve certain rights of use of the mark in the assignor.mccarthy.
here,however,we need not precisely delineate the bundle of rights that a trademark assignment must extend to a purported assignee to support the latter standing to bring a section suit.it is enough to say that in this case,in consideration of all of the relevant authorities,too many rights remain with the russian federation for it to be deemed to have assigned the marks to fte.
thus,the charter expressly states that t he property of the enterprise shall be in federal,russian federation ownership,and that the property shall be transferred to fte only for operative administration in accordance with the laws of the russian federation.charter.fte argues that,under russian law,providing an assignment for operative administration is tantamount to an assignment under the lanham act.for example,fte advises that article of the russian civil code provides that the property of a unitary enterprise like fte shall belong to that enterprise by right of economic jurisdiction or operative management.special appendix spa emphasis added.further,parties that possess property by right of operative administration are legally authorized under russian civil code article,we are told,to defend their possessory rights against the actual owner of the property.spa.
russian law,however,appears to be much more equivocal than fte suggests.defendants point to provisions of the russian civil code that suggest strongly that state unitary enterprises are not endowed with the right of ownership.russian civil code,spa.further,russian law allows institutions within which property has been consolidated by right of operative management to possess,use,and dispose of this property within the limits established by a law in accordance with the purposes of its activity,the assignments of the owner of this property,and the designation of this property.id,spa emphasis added.
without purporting to tender a definitive reading of russian law,we can nonetheless observe that the civil code is consistent with the limitations placed on fte rights to the marks by the charter and decrees,and does not so enhance fte operational rights as to render it an assign under united states trademark law.the charter expressly prohibits fte from alienating or otherwise disposing of any property assigned to it by right of operative administration,and allows the russian federation to impound property transferred to fte and to fte.similarly,the july decree provides that fte has the right to use and dispose without the right to assign the marks,and states that any such use shall occur only in accordance with the procedure established by agencies of the russian federation.
not only do russian law and the relevant decrees direct that the russian federation retain formal title to the marks,then,but they expressly reserve to the russian federation certain rights that are generally inherent in the concept of ownership.thus,fte has no right to assign the marks absent permission from the russian federation,and nothing that we have been directed to in the governing documents suggests that fte has been conveyed a general right to exclude others from use of the marks.see mccarthy a trademark is a right to exclude.fte has identified no constraint on the russian federation authority to use the marks itself if,for example,the federation determines in its sole discretion that the marks are not being used for their proper purpose.the russian federation also appears free to withdraw fte rights to use the marks,and to grant others similar rights.although in the future we may find a trademark assignment effective to confer standing where the assignment reserves certain rights in the assignor,fte has not cited any persuasive authority within or outside our circuit holding that a valid assignment of a trademark right can occur when the putative assignor retains the right to rescind the trademark,to grant a license for its use to others,or to exclude others from using the mark.we decline to create such a rule here.
fte statutory standing as an exclusive licensee 
fte argues further that even if the russian federation has not actually assigned the marks,fte exclusive right to use the marks in the united states and abroad in effect,an exclusive license is sufficient to support fte statutory standing to sue under section.some district court opinions appear to offer support for this argument.see,telebrands del,d,holding that where an exclusive licensee has broad rights to sell a product with a registered trademark royalty free,and for a potentially unlimited period and does not set forth any restrictions on the licensee ability to enforce the trademarks,the licensee has standing to sue for infringement under section bliss clearing niagara,midwest brake bond,d,concluding that an exclusive license that also extends the right to pursue actions for infringement of the mark is sufficient to establish standing to sue for infringement.
but congress could easily have included licensee or exclusive licensee among the terms in that define a registrant.it chose instead to limit standing to parties having a more specific set of interests in the registered mark.a plaintiff therefore must show that its license amounts,in fact,to an assignment to establish entitlement to sue under section.see mccarthy even though a contract states that it is a license,a court will not be governed by form,and the contract will be upheld as an assignment of trademark rights if that is its actual legal effect.gilson on trademarks b gilson same.for the reasons discussed above with respect to the putative assignment,see part,plaintiffs allegations fall short here.as defined by united states law,fte is not,in fact,the assign of the marks,and therefore may not sue under section on that basis.
in addition,we observe that plaintiffs complaint does not allege facts plausibly showing that fte was granted an exclusive license to use or enforce the marks,and none of the relevant documents suggest the russian federation intent to grant such an exclusive license.the complaint alleges that fte is the only entity with the right to use and dispose of the marks.am.compl.but that fte was the only licensee when it filed the complaint does not establish that it held an exclusive license,especially in light of the absence of any suggestion of exclusivity in either the charter or the july decree.moreover,the complaint does not appear to suggest that fte could exclude the russian federation from using the marks,since fte acknowledges that its rights are limited by the russian federation ultimate ownership.id.
special considerations concerning foreign government trademark holders 
plaintiffs also contend that we should ignore these legal restrictions on fte rights to sue with regard to the marks and instead look generally to what we discern to be the policies underlying statutory limitations on seeking damages for trademark infringement.in particular,plaintiffs argue that policy interests in avoiding a multiplicity of suits are not implicated in this case because the russian federation has agreed by letter submitted to the district court to be bound by this litigation they urge further that comity considerations compel our court to afford the russian federation flexibility in determining how to protect its trademark rights and therefore to recognize fte as an assign.
we discuss some of these concerns in greater detail below,in the context of the claim that fte is the legal representative of the russian federation.we agree that,in certain contexts,such policy considerations,like the interest in avoiding a multiplicity of suits,may help to guide the analysis of whether a party has standing to sue under the act.phoenix of broward,mcdonald,cir stating that the risk of duplicative damages is a factor to be considered in deciding whether a plaintiff has standing to bring a false advertising claim under section of the lanham act.but the russian federation is not a party to this litigation,and a brief ad hoc letter to the court from the current deputy director of an administrative agency,asserting that the federation as a whole will in the future consider itself bound by the outcome of this litigation does not,in our view,eliminate the risk of duplicative and conflicting litigation.and even if such a letter did begin to assuage those concerns,such policy interests could not override our statutory analysis here.
further,we recognize that foreign states owning registered trademarks for commercial use may face a number of different and even challenging considerations in deciding how and when to enforce the rights protected by their marks.we do not speculate why the russian federation settled on this particular arrangement with fte as the means of pursuing any rights it had in the marks or in particular of asserting its united states rights in the marks.we observe,however,that the lanham act particularly in its provisions governing the assignment of trademarks and those relating to statutory standing to sue under the act sets out formal requirements aligned with the policies it is designed to promote.had the russian federation effected a valid assignment here,fte could sue under section as an assign.as the relationship between the russian federation and fte is now structured,however,it can not,consistent with the act.
fte is not a legal representative of the russian federation for purposes of the act 
we next consider whether fte qualifies as a legal representative under the act.the district court concluded that fte had to satisfy two conditions to achieve this status a party qualifies as a legal representative under section of the lanham act if the party has the authority to appear on behalf of the with respect to the legal interests and the is unable or incapable of representing itself and enforcing its own rights.fte iii,wl,at emphasis in original.in this case,the district court saw no adequate basis in the complaint or in the law for concluding that the russian federation is legally incapable of representing itself,and therefore held that fte did not qualify as a legal representative.id.
on appeal,fte argues that the district court interpreted the term legal representative too narrowly when it required that the real party in interest be legally incapable of representing itself.fte submits that,as used in the act,the phrase legal representative should be construed to include a part y exercising another person rights over a trademark on that person behalf.appellants br.
the interpretation of the phrase legal representative in the lanham act context appears to present a question of first impression in the federal courts of appeal.after review of the language and structure of the lanham act and the district court opinions on point,and remaining mindful of relevant comity concerns,we conclude that the district court here correctly interpreted the phrase.because fte has failed to allege facts plausibly showing that it qualifies as a legal representative,it may not proceed in that capacity.
interpretation of the phrase legal representative 
in its broadest usage,the phrase legal representative may refer simply to o ne who stands for or acts on behalf of another.black law dictionary ed defining representative.often,however,its meaning may be more precise.it may refer,for example,to an executor or administrator designated to act on behalf of a party who is incapable of acting on his own behalf,rock ola filben,cir interpreting a contract including the phrase legal representative,or a trustee named to act on behalf of a party who,by law or agreement,is unauthorized to represent his own interests,see in re casco chem,cir concluding that a bankruptcy trustee is a legal representative for purposes of federal rule of civil procedure b.we must therefore look to the language and purposes of the lanham act to construe the phrase legal representative for present purposes.
the text and structure of the lanham act support defendants interpretation.section expressly restricts standing to the registrant which the act expressly defines as the owner or,as we have said,his legal representatives,predecessors,successors and assigns.by contrast,section of the act allows suits by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by the defendant actions.a emphasis added.to interpret the phrase legal representative broadly would permit both the registrant of the trademark and his putative legal representative to file separate suits against the same defendant for the same infringing act a result that seems inconsistent with congress stated intention to limit standing to the single registrant of the trademark under section as opposed to the broad standing afforded plaintiffs suing under section.see licensing ass inland joseph fruit,d,although the term legal representative is not defined by the act,a broad construction would be inconsistent with the obvious intention to limit trademark infringement suits to those who have or had ownership interests in the trademark and the historically restrictive interpretation given to registrant.
further,adopting fte interpretation of legal representative in this context namely,that a legal representative includes parties like fte that have been given rights conferring control over trademarks ultimately owned by others,reply br.would raise constitutional concerns,thus militating against that interpretation.it is well established that a party must demonstrate to have constitutional standing,lujan defenders of wildlife,and that such injury must be particular to the claim raised and the relief sought,davis fed.election comm n.applying lujan,we have held that an investment manager to whom had given and significant authority over investment decisions lacked constitutional standing to file a securities fraud claim on the clients behalf.huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche llp,cir huff.in huff we recognized that,consistent with supreme court precedent in sprint communications apcc services,the minimum requirement for an is that the plaintiff have legal title to,or a proprietary interest in,the claim,even if that title was not originally held by the plaintiff but was received through an assignment made by the initial holder of the claim.huff,at.we also recognized a few prudential exceptions to the requirement,id.at,and we explained that these exceptions permit standing where the plaintiff can demonstrate a close relationship to the injured party and a barrier to the injured party ability to assert its own interests,see also kowalski tesmer.
fte proposed interpretation of legal representative,however,would extend standing to parties whose sole interest in a action is a right to bring the claim,without owning the claim or having been assigned the claim,even if the actual trademark owner is capable of bringing suit on her own behalf.to ensure that our construction of the term legal representative avoids a possible conflict with the requirements of article iii,we read it as requiring the trademark holder inability to assert a claim for infringement.gollust mendell,requiring plaintiff in suit to maintain a stake in the outcome of the litigation to avoid serious constitutional doubt whether that plaintiff could demonstrate the standing required by article iii limitation on federal court jurisdiction.
fte cites mcclaskey harbison walker refractories,cir,in support of its argument for a broader reading of the phrase.in mcclaskey,the court examined whether,under the patent laws,a sheriff could serve as the legal representative of a patent holder,and therefore be empowered to transfer a patent through a creditors sale of the patent holder assets.id.at.the court permitted the sheriff to go forward,concluding that we can entertain no doubt that a patent may be reached and sold by a creditors bill.id.at.fte argues that because the third circuit did not consider whether the patent holder was unavailable to bring suit,the language legal representative in the context of the lanham act need not be read to include such a requirement.
but mcclaskey does not support fte argument.the court holding there turned on the analogy it drew between the sheriff and a trustee specifically appointed by a court for the purpose of disposing of a debtor property.id.at.as we recognized in huff,a trustee authority to bring suit on behalf of a trust or otherwise represent a trust flows from a special,obligation on the part of the trustee to protect the interests of the trust,which like the debtor and patent holder in mcclaskey has become legally incapable of representing itself.see huff,at see also sprint,at.in other words,even if we were bound by mcclaskey,that opinion merely illustrates that a third party may serve as a legal representative,even where the represented party is physically present,so long as the represented party is somehow disabled from asserting the rights at issue.sprint,at finding that party with contractual obligation to litigate claim has article iii standing in situation where party was also assigned title to the claim 
finally,fte argues that the district court interpretation of legal representative offends international comity by ignor ing the decisions made by a foreign sovereign to place trademarks and the commercial operations associated with them in the hands of a state enterprise.appellants br.at.international comity is a consideration guiding courts,where possible,towards interpretations of domestic law that avoid conflict with foreign law.linde arab bank,plc,cir.considerations of comity are not,however,matters of absolute obligation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.rather,the concept of comity calls for an examination of all of the relevant interests of all of the nations affected by the court decision.id.emphasis omitted see also pravin banker assocs.banco popular del peru,cir e xtending comity is only appropriate if it is consistent with united states government policy.here,concern for international comity does not overcome the united states interests in enforcing its own trademark laws within its borders,or counsel the judicial creation of an exception to the lanham act express requirements as consistently construed over time.foreign sovereigns desiring to avail themselves of the protections of united states laws,particularly on commercial matters such as this,must observe united states prerequisites unless congress directs otherwise.
we thus conclude that to serve as a legal representative entitled to bring suit under section on behalf of a trademark holder,a putative plaintiff must demonstrate both its legal authority to represent the owner and that the trademark holder is legally incapable of representing itself.
applying that rule here,we observe that in neither the original nor the operative complaint did fte allege that the russian federation was incapable of bringing this suit on its own behalf.fte iii,wl,at.indeed,on appeal,fte appears to acknowledge that the russian federation could appear in this suit it now argues that the district court should have permitted the russian federation to join or be substituted into this action.appellants reply br.only an amicus brief submitted to this court on behalf of the russian federation contends that the russian federation is unauthorized to appear in this litigation noting this discordance between plaintiffs and amicus,we decline to accord significant weight to the federation argument both because it was not raised below and because an amicus brief is not a method for injecting new issues into an appeal.universal city studios,corley,cir 
in sum,since plaintiffs have failed sufficiently to allege that the russian federation is unable to appear in this litigation,fte is not the russian federation legal representative for the purpose of bringing suit under section of the lanham act.
c.the russian federation has not ratified this suit under.sufficiently to avoid joinder 
fte argues finally that even if it would ordinarily be unable to sue on its own for infringement of the trademarks at issue,its suit here should be permitted to proceed because the russian federation,as the real party in interest,has ratified the litigation by virtue of the may letter cited above.we can not agree.
federal rule of civil procedure a provides that a n action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,but that 
t he court may not dismiss an action for failure to prosecute in the name of the real party in interest until,after an objection,a reasonable time has been allowed for the real party in interest to ratify,join,or be substituted into the action.after ratification,joinder,or substitution,the action proceeds as if it ha
