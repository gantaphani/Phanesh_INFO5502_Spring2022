frank gagliardi appeals from his conviction on one count of attempting to entice a minor to engage in prohibited sexual activity in violation of b.he argues that b requires an actual minor victim and is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.in the instant case,the targets of gagliardi attempted enticement were not actual minors but adults posing as minors.we now join several other circuits in holding that b does not require that the enticement victim be an actual individual who has not attained the age of years and is neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad.because gagliardi other arguments challenging his conviction are without merit,we affirm the judgment of conviction.
background 
on july,gagliardi,then years old,entered an internet chat room called i love older men and initiated an conversation with lorie,an adult government informant posing as a girl under the screen name.the informant was a private citizen who had previously assisted the federal bureau of investigation fbi in identifying child predators on the internet.during this initial conversation,gagliardi tried to verify that lorie was in fact thirteen years old and broached the topic of sex.
gagliardi contacted lorie again on august,and had the first of many online conversations in which he expressed his desire to have sex with her and used sexually explicit language to describe the acts he wished to perform with her.gagliardi even offered to pay lorie to have sex with him,before telling her,i want to meet you make love to me anytime no strings attached.in the following weeks,gagliardi repeatedly tried to convince lorie to meet him in person,asking her to tell me where is good for you,i come to pick you up,or offering to meet her in a public place.
on september,lorie indicated that she was scared to meet gagliardi alone and suggested that he contact her friend julie.julie was in fact fbi special agent austin berglas,who was working in collaboration with the informant.gagliardi suggested that the two girls come together to meet him,telling lorie,i will dream about you all night.on september,gagliardi lorie a picture of himself,and the informant sent him a photograph that was taken of her when she was approximately thirteen.
taking up lorie suggestion,gagliardi julie,introducing himself as a friend of lorie,asking for her picture,and requesting that she accompany lorie if they ever set up a meeting.on september,gagliardi initiated an chat with julie during which he asked if she was willing to meet him and described the sexual activities that they could engage in.
gagliardi subsequently arranged to meet lorie and julie in lower manhattan on the morning of october.fbi agents placed the meeting place under surveillance and arrested gagliardi as he waited in his car.after being advised of and agreeing to waive his miranda rights,gagliardi admitted to the agents that he was at the location to meet two girls with whom he had previously had sexually explicit online conversations he denied,however,that he intended to have sex with them.during a inventory search of gagliardi car,the agents found two condoms and a viagra pill.gagliardi was charged with attempt to entice,induce,or persuade a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity,in violation of b.
at trial,the government relied on the testimony of the informant and agent berglas,together with gagliardi electronic communications with lorie and julie.gagliardi moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the involvement of an actual minor was a prerequisite to a conviction under b the statute was unconstitutionally vague and the evidence was insufficient to show that gagliardi had committed an attempt.
the district court sidney stein,judge denied the motion.see united states gagliardi,cr shs,wl may.the district court concluded that b did not require an actual minor victim because the statute provided for criminal liability for attempted enticement of a minor,and one could demonstrate that gagliardi had the intent and took a substantial step toward committing the crime,as required for attempt liability,even though it was factually impossible for him to commit the substantive offense.see id.at.it also concluded that the evidence at trial was,in fact,sufficient to demonstrate the elements of intent and substantial step.see id.at.the district court further determined that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently definite to provide notice to an ordinary person of what conduct was prohibited.see id.at.
on may,gagliardi was convicted by a jury and sentenced to the mandatory minimum imprisonment term of sixty months.the defendant moved to set aside the verdict on the basis of government entrapment and insufficiency of evidence.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that e ven if gagliardi had adduced enough credible evidence of inducement that no rational trier of fact could have concluded that the government did not induce the crime,a rational juror could nevertheless have rejected gagliardi entrapment defense by finding that he was predisposed to commit the crime.united states gagliardi,cr shs,wl,at.with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence,the court found that based on gagliardi numerous sexually explicit communications with lorie and julie,his exchange of photographs,and his arrival at the meeting place with condoms and viagra,a rational juror could have concluded that gagliardi had the requisite intent and took a substantial step toward commission of the crime.see id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
gagliardi raises six issues on appeal.he contends that the plain meaning of b requires that the victim of enticement or attempted enticement be an actual minor and that,because the informant and agent berglas were adults posing as minors,his conviction can not stand that b is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad that b mandatory minimum sentence violates the separation of powers doctrine or that its imposition in his case resulted from prosecutorial sentencing manipulation that reversal is required because his conduct could only be construed as conspiring to attempt to violate the law,an offense that is legally impossible to commit when the are all government decoys,appellant br.at that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a conviction for attempted enticement or to defeat his entrapment defense and that the district court erred in admitting into evidence and transcripts of his instant message chats without sufficient authentication.
involvement of an actual minor 
section b of title imposes criminal liability on anyone who knowingly persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of years,to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,or attempts to do so.b.gagliardi argues that the statute plain meaning and legislative history unambiguously indicate congress intent to criminalize such conduct only when directed toward an actual minor.
to support his argument,gagliardi points to congress rejection of a amendment to b that would have expanded the statute to reach a defendant who subjectively believed that the target of his enticement was a minor.compare,at,reprinted in,proposing an amendment that would extend to one who knowingly contacts an individual,who has been represented to the person making the contact as not having attained the age of years,with protection of children from sexual predators act of,stat,amending b without this change.he contends that in refusing to expand the statute in this manner,congress made clear that b only criminalizes an attempt involving a minor.appellant br.at.
gagliardi also infers from a proposed amendment that would allow law enforcement officers to represent themselves as minors on the internet to better protect america children from sexual predators,cong.rec.daily ed,that congress does not believe that b applies to undercover law enforcement officials or cooperating witnesses representing themselves as being under the age of.appellant br.at.he argues that such a proposal would be unnecessary if the statute already applied to government decoys.we disagree.
as an initial matter,we note that gagliardi argument has been squarely rejected by the six other circuits to have considered the issue,and for sound reasons.see,united states hicks,cir a defendant may be convicted of attempting to violate b even if the attempt is made towards someone the defendant believes is a minor but who is actually not a minor.united states tykarsky,cir congress did not intend to allow the use of an adult decoy,rather than an actual minor,to be asserted as a defense to b.see also united states sims,cir united states meek,cir united states root,cir united states farner,cir.
in interpreting a statute,we look first to its text to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.in re med diversified,cir quoting robinson shell oil,d.section b explicitly proscribes attempts to entice a minor,which suggests that actual success is not required for a conviction and that a defendant may thus be found guilty if he fails to entice an actual minor because the target whom he believes to be underage is in fact an adult.see tykarsky,at the attempt provision is most naturally read to focus on the subjective intent of the defendant,not the actual age of the victim.meek,at.
in arguing that he could not have completed the intended crime of enticement because extraneous circumstances unknown to him rendered completion impossible,gagliardi essentially asserts a defense of factual impossibility.we have held,however,that factual impossibility is not a defense to a charge of attempt in substantive criminal law.united states weisser,cir.
gagliardi two arguments from the statute legislative history are similarly unpersuasive.united states craft,d f ailed legislative proposals are a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute quoting pension benefit guar.ltv,d.his proposed interpretation of that history provides just one possible reading of congress intent.as to gagliardi first argument,the fact that congress rejected a supplemental provision to b that would have specifically covered individuals who represented themselves as being minors is not conclusive evidence that congress meant to affirmatively exclude those individuals.it is equally possible that congress did not adopt the amendment because it believed that the text of b,expressly proscribing the attempt,was sufficient to include victims believed to be minors.see pension benefit guar,at.congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction,including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.internal quotation marks omitted.
as to gagliardi second argument,the fact that two legislators proposed a bill in to explicitly expand b is hardly dispositive of the intent of congress as a whole concerning the statute scope.congress could have been aware that several circuits had already interpreted b to include adults posing as minors and found no need to amend the statute.see lorillard pons,d congress is presumed to be aware of a judicial interpretation of a statute united states gagliardi,cr shs,wl,at may,noting that congress has failed to move forward on the proposed legislation.thus,gagliardi arguments on this score are unconvincing.
at the time of b amendment,the house judiciary committee pointed out that 
law enforcement plays an important role in discovering child sex offenders on the internet before they are able to victimize an actual child.those who believe they are victimizing children,even if they come into contact with a law enforcement officer who poses as a child,should be punished just as if a real child were involved.it is for this reason that several provisions in this act prohibit certain conduct involving minors and assumed minors.
at,cong.the interpretation advanced by gagliardi would effectively remove the sting from the government sting operations,preventing undercover officers from obtaining a conviction,or it would require them to use an actual child as a decoy,which they would obviously be reluctant to do.tykarsky,at it is common knowledge that law enforcement officials rely heavily on decoys and sting operations in enforcing solicitation and child predation crimes such as b.we consider it unlikely that congress intended to prohibit this method of enforcement.because such a result would significantly impede legitimate enforcement of the statute,and because the statute language is clear,we reject gagliardi interpretation and join the third,fifth,eighth,ninth,tenth,and eleventh circuits in holding that the involvement of an actual minor is not a prerequisite to an attempt conviction under b.
ii.vagueness and overbreadth 
gagliardi next argues that b is vague and overbroad on its face and as applied.he contends that the statute is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define the terms attempt,persuade,induce,entice,or coerce,and ordinary people could differ in their interpretation of the meaning of these words.he contends that the statute is overbroad because it suppresses protected speech by infringing on the right of an adult to freely engage in fantasy speech with other adults.appellant br.at.we reject both challenges and now join the five other circuits that have already done so.see,tykarsky,at united states thomas,cir meek,at united states panfil,cir united states bailey,cir.
a penal statute is not void for vagueness if it defines the offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson,d see also connally constr.section b satisfies both of these requirements.
the words attempt,persuade,induce,entice,or coerce,though not defined in the statute,are words of common usage that have plain and ordinary meanings.see tykarsky,at panfil,at.although,as gagliardi argues,there may be some uncertainty as to the precise demarcation between persuading,which is criminalized,and asking,which is not,this uncertainty is not cause for constitutional concern because the statute terms are sufficiently definite that ordinary people using common sense could grasp the nature of the prohibited conduct.see tykarsky,at united states cullen,cir although we recognize in many english words there lurk uncertainties,to meet the fair warning prong an ounce of common sense is worth more than an dictionary.citation omitted.
the statute also establishes the requisite minimal guidelines to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement,see kolender,at,in that it applies only to those who knowingly engage in the prohibited conduct.this scienter requirement narrows the scope of b as well as the ability of prosecutors and law enforcement officers to act based on their own preferences.see panfil,at.
we likewise reject gagliardi overbreadth argument.the overbreadth doctrine prohibits the government from banning unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is prohibited or chilled in the process.ashcroft free speech,d.gagliardi contends that b impermissibly suppresses fantasy speech with adults who happen to be posing as minors.yet the statute punishes the act of enticing or attempting to entice a minor when it is knowingly done it does not implicate speech.moreover,when fantasy speech is directed toward an adult believed to be a minor,it is,in effect,the vehicle through which a pedophile attempts to ensnare a victim,meek,at,and we have held,unremarkably,that s peech is not protected by the first amendment when it is the very vehicle of the crime itself,united states rowlee,cir citation omitted see also giboney empire storage ice.it rarely has been suggested that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute.by gagliardi own admission in his brief,there is no first amendment right to persuade minors to engage in illegal sex acts,appellant br.at see also tykarsky,at there
