the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment prevents a state,in the absence of sufficient justification,from separating its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.virginia state bd.of elections.when a voter sues state officials for drawing such lines,this court decisions call for a analysis.first,the plaintiff must prove that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.miller johnson.second,if racial considerations did predominate,the state must prove that its sorting of voters serves a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to that end,at.this court has long assumed that one compelling interest is compliance with the voting rights act of vra or act.when a state invokes the vra to justify districting,it must show to meet the narrow tailoring requirement that it had good reasons for concluding that the statute required its action.alabama legislative black caucus alabama.a district court factual findings made in the course of this inquiry are reviewed only for clear error.see fed.rule civ.proc.a easley cromartie,cromartie ii.
this case concerns north carolina redrawing of two congressional districts,district and district,after the census.prior to that redistricting,neither district had a majority black population bvap,but both consistently elected the candidates preferred by most voters.the new map significantly altered both district and district.the state needed to add almost people to district to comply with the principle,and it chose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of durham increasing the district bvap from to.the state also reconfigured district,increasing its bvap from to.registered voters in those districts here called the plaintiffs filed suit against north carolina officials collectively,the state or north carolina complaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders.a district court held both districts unconstitutional.it found that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of district lines and rejected the state claim that this action was justified by the vra.as for district,the court again found that race predominated,and it explained that the state made no attempt to justify its attention to race in designing that district.
north carolina victory in a similar lawsuit does not dictate the disposition of this case or alter the applicable standard of review.before this case was filed,a state trial court rejected a claim by several civil rights groups that districts and were unlawful racial gerrymanders.the north carolina supreme court affirmed that decision under the equivalent of clear error review.the state claims that the plaintiffs are members of the same organizations that brought the earlier case,and thus precluded from raising the same questions anew.but the state never satisfied the district court that the alleged affiliation really existed.and because the district court factual finding was reasonable,it defeats north carolina attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.
the state backup argument about the proper standard of review also falls short.the rule that a trial court factual findings are reviewed only for clear error contains no exception for findings that diverge from those made in another court.see fed.rule civ.proc.a.although the state court decision is certainly relevant,the premise of clear error review is that there are often two permissible views of the evidence.anderson bessemer city.even assuming that the state court findings capture one such view,the only question here is whether the district court assessment represents another.
the district court did not err in concluding that race furnished the predominant rationale for district redesign and that the state interest in complying with the vra could not justify that consideration of race.
a the record shows that the state purposefully established a racial target for the district and that the target had a direct and significant impact on the district configuration,alabama,at,subordinating other districting criteria.faced with this body of evidence,the district court did not clearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing district indeed,it could hardly have concluded anything but.
b north carolina use of race as the predominant factor in designing district does not withstand strict scrutiny.the state argues that it had good reasons to believe that it had to draw a district to avoid liability for vote dilution under of the vra.thornburg gingles,identifies three threshold conditions for proving such a claim a minority group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in some reasonably configured legislative district,at the minority group must be politically cohesive,at and a district white majority must vote sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the minority preferred candidate,ibid.if a state has good reason to think that all three of these conditions are met,then so too it has good reason to believe that requires drawing a district.but if not,then not.
here,electoral history provided no evidence that a plaintiff could demonstrate the third gingles prerequisite.for nearly years before the new plan adoption,made up less than a majority of district voters,but their preferred candidates scored consistent victories.district thus functioned as a crossover district,in which members of the majority help a large enough minority to elect its candidate of choice.bartlett strickland,plurality opinion.so experience gave the state no reason to think that the vra required it to ramp up district bvap.
the state counters that because it needed to substantially increase district population,the question facing the state mapmakers was not whether the district violated,but whether the future district would do so if drawn without regard to race.but that reasoning,taken alone,can not justify the state redesign of the district.most important,the state points to no meaningful legislative inquiry into the key issue it identifies whether a new,enlarged district,created without a focus on race,could lead to liability.to have a strong basis to conclude that demands measures to augment a district bvap,the state must evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the gingles preconditions in a new district created without those measures.nothing in the legislative record here fits that description.and that is no accident the redistricters believed that this court decision in strickland mandated a plus bvap in district.they apparently reasoned that if,as strickland held,does not require crossover districts for groups insufficiently large under gingles,then also can not be satisfied by crossover districts for groups meeting gingles size condition.but,as this court jurisprudence makes clear,unless each of the three gingles prerequisites is established,there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.growe emison.north carolina belief that it was compelled to redraw district a successful crossover district as a district thus rested on a pure error of law.accordingly,the court upholds the district court conclusion that the state use of race as the predominant factor in designing district does not withstand strict scrutiny.
the district court also did not clearly err by finding that race predominated in the redrawing of district.
a the district legality turns solely on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its reconfiguration.the plaintiffs contended at trial that north carolina intentionally increased district bvap in the name of ensuring preclearance under of the vra.according to the state,by contrast,the mapmakers moved voters in and out of the district as part of a strictly political gerrymander,without regard to race.after hearing evidence supporting both parties accounts,the district court accepted the plaintiffs.
getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court,which must make a sensitive inquiry into all circumstantial and direct evidence of intent to assess whether the plaintiffs have proved that race,not politics,drove a district lines.hunt cromartie,cromartie i.this court job is different and generally easier.it affirms a trial court factual finding as to racial predominance so long as the finding is plausible it reverses only when left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson,at.in assessing a finding plausibility,moreover,the court gives singular deference to a trial court judgments about the credibility of witnesses.see fed.rule civ.proc.a.applying those principles here,the evidence at trial including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations adequately supports the district court conclusion that race,not politics,accounted for district reconfiguration.and contrary to the state view,the court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for district.
b by slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body,north carolina added and subtracted whites,turning district into a district.state senator robert rucho and state representative david lewis the chairs of the two committees responsible for preparing the revamped plan publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind district augmented bvap.specifically,rucho and lewis explained that because part of guilford county,a jurisdiction covered by of the vra,lay in the district,they had increased the district bvap to ensure preclearance of the plan.thomas hofeller,their hired mapmaker,confirmed that intent.the state preclearance submission to the justice department indicated a similar determination to concentrate black voters in district.and,in testimony that the district court found credible,congressman mel watt testified that rucho disclosed a target to him in.hofeller testified that he had drawn district lines based on political data,and that he checked the racial data only after he drew a line between adjacent areas in guilford county.but the district court disbelieved hofeller asserted indifference to the new district racial composition,pointing to his contrary deposition testimony and a significant contradiction in his trial testimony.finally,an expert report lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs case,showing that,regardless of party,a black voter in the region was three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast a ballot within district borders.
the district court assessment that all this evidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error review.maybe this court would have evaluated the testimony differently had it presided over the trial or then again,maybe it would not have.either way,the court is far from having a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it that racial considerations predominated in district design.
c finally,north carolina argues that when race and politics are competing explanations of a district lines,plaintiffs must introduce an alternative map that achieves a state asserted political goals while improving racial balance.such a map can serve as key evidence in a dispute,but it is hardly the only means to disprove a state contention that politics drove a district lines.in this case,the plaintiffs introduction of mostly direct and some circumstantial evidence gave the district court a sufficient basis,sans any map,to resolve the question.although a plaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map,as a practical matter,to make his case,such a map is merely an evidentiary tool to show that an equal protection violation has occurred neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim.
north carolina claims that a passage of this court opinion in cromartie ii makes an alternative map essential in cases like this one,but the reasoning of cromartie ii belies that reading.the court opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categorical rule that the state claims to find there,and the entire thrust of the opinion runs counter to an inflexible requirement.rightly understood,the passage on which the state relies had a different and narrower point given the weak evidence of a racial gerrymander offered in cromartie ii,only maps that would actually show what the plaintiffs had not could carry the day.this case,in contrast,turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts,but on direct evidence of the general assembly intent in creating the actual district including many hours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.that evidence,the district court plausibly found,itself satisfied the plaintiffs burden of debunking north carolina politics defense.

justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the constitution entrusts states with the job of designing congressional districts.but it also imposes an important constraint a state may not use race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason.in this case,a district court ruled that north carolina officials violated that bar when they created two districts whose populations were majority black.applying a deferential standard of review to the factual findings underlying that decision,we affirm.

first,the plaintiff must prove that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.miller johnson.that entails demonstrating that the legislature subordinated other factors compactness,respect for political subdivisions,partisan advantage,what have you to racial considerations.ibid.the plaintiff may make the required showing through direct evidence of legislative intent,circumstantial evidence of a district shape and demographics,or a mix of both.ibid 
second,if racial considerations predominated over others,the design of the district must withstand strict scrutiny.see,at slip,at.the burden thus shifts to the state to prove that its sorting of voters serves a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.ibid.this court has long assumed that one compelling interest is complying with operative provisions of the voting rights act of vra or act,stat,as amended,et.see,shaw hunt,shaw ii.
two provisions of the vra and are involved in this case.section prohibits any standard,practice,or procedure that results in a denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race.a.we have construed that ban to extend to vote dilution brought about,most relevantly here,by the dispersal of a group members into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters.thornburg gingles.section,at the time of the districting in dispute,worked through a different mechanism.before this court invalidated its coverage formula,see shelby county holder,that section required certain jurisdictions including various north carolina counties to voting changes with the department of justice,so as to forestall retrogression in the ability of racial minorities to elect their preferred candidates,beer united states.

a district court assessment of a districting plan,in accordance with the inquiry just described,warrants significant deference on appeal to this court we of course retain full power to correct a court errors of law,at either stage of the analysis.but the court findings of fact most notably,as to whether racial considerations predominated in drawing district lines are subject to review only for clear error.see fed.rule civ.proc.a easley cromartie,cromartie ii,at thomas,dissenting.under that standard,we may not reverse just because we would have decided the matter differently.anderson bessemer city.a finding that is plausible in light of the full record even if another is equally or more so must govern,at.
this case concerns north carolina most recent redrawing of two congressional districts,both of which have long included substantial populations of black voters.in its current incarnation,district is anchored in the northeastern part of the state,with appendages stretching both south and west the latter into durham.district begins in the part of the state where it takes in a large part of charlotte and then travels northeast,much of the way to the state northern border.maps showing the districts are included in an appendix to this opinion.both have quite the history before this court.
we first encountered the two districts,in their versions,in shaw reno.there,we held that voters stated an equal protection claim by alleging that districts and were unwarranted racial gerrymanders.see,at.after a remand to the district court,the case arrived back at our door.see shaw ii.that time,we dismissed the challenge to district for lack of standing,but struck down district.the design of that serpentine district,we held,was nothing if not,and could not be justified as a reasonable attempt to comply with the vra,at see,at.
the next year,the state responded with a new districting plan,including a new district and residents of that district brought another lawsuit alleging an impermissible racial gerrymander.a district court sustained the claim twice,but both times this court reversed.see hunt cromartie,cromartie i cromartie ii.racial considerations,we held,did not predominate in designing the revised district.rather,that district was the result of a political gerrymander an effort to engineer,mostly without regard to race,a safe democratic seat,at.
the state redrew its congressional districts again in,to account for population changes revealed in the prior year census.under the map,which went unchallenged in court,neither district nor district had a black population called a bvap that was a majority of the whole the former had a bvap of around,the latter a bvap of around.see app.nonetheless,in five successive general elections conducted in those reconfigured districts,all the candidates preferred by most voters won their contests and by some handy margins.in district,black voters candidates of choice garnered as much as of the total vote,and never less than.see record,pls.exh.and in district,those candidates won with of the vote at the high end and at the low.see,at.
another census,in,necessitated yet another congressional map finally the one at issue in this case.state senator robert rucho and state representative david lewis,both republicans,chaired the two committees jointly responsible for preparing the revamped plan.they hired thomas hofeller,a veteran political mapmaker,to assist them in redrawing district lines.several hearings,drafts,and revisions later,both chambers of the state general assembly adopted the scheme the three men proposed.
the new map among other things significantly altered both district and district.the census had revealed district to be substantially underpopulated to comply with the constitution principle,the state needed to place almost new people within the district boundaries.see app.evenwel abbott,slip,at explaining that s tates must draw congressional districts with populations as close to perfect equality as possible rucho,lewis,and hofeller chose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of durham,requiring a extension of the district western line.see appendix,infra.with that addition,district bvap rose from to.see app.district,for its part,had no need for significant changes it was overpopulated by fewer than people out of over.see,at.still,rucho,lewis,and hofeller decided to reconfigure the district,further narrowing its already snakelike body while adding areas at either end most relevantly here,in guilford county.see appendix,infra app.those changes appreciably shifted the racial composition of district as the district gained some of voting age and lost some whites of that age,its bvap increased from to.see record fourth affidavit of dan frey,exh,at exh.
registered voters in the two districts david harris and christine bowser,here called the plaintiffs brought this suit against north carolina officials collectively,the state or north carolina complaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders.after a bench trial,a district court held both districts unconstitutional.all the judges agreed that racial considerations predominated in the design of district.see harris mccrory,supp,mdnc.and in then applying strict scrutiny,all rejected the state argument that it had a strong basis for thinking that the vra compelled such a drawing of district lines,at.as for district,a majority of the panel held that race predominated over all other factors,including partisanship,at.and the court explained that the state had failed to put forward any reason,compelling or otherwise,for its attention to race in designing that district.see ibid.judge osteen dissented from the conclusion that race,rather than politics,drove district lines yet still characterized the majority view as e minently reasonable.at.
the state filed a notice of appeal,and we noted probable jurisdiction.mccrory harris.
we address at the outset north carolina contention that a victory it won in a very similar lawsuit should dictate or at least influence our disposition of this case.as the state explains,the north carolina naacp and several other civil rights groups challenged districts and in state court immediately after their enactment,charging that they were unlawful racial gerrymanders.see brief for appellants.by the time the plaintiffs before us filed this action,the state trial court,in dickson rucho,had rejected those claims finding that in district the vra justified the general assembly use of race and that in district race was not a factor at all.see app.the north carolina supreme court then affirmed that decision by a vote,applying the equivalent of clear error review.see dickson rucho,modified on denial of reh g,cert.pending.in this court,north carolina makes two related arguments based on the dickson litigation first,that the state trial court judgment should have barred this case altogether,under familiar principles of claim and issue preclusion and second,that the state court conclusions should cause us to conduct a searching review of the decision below,rather than deferring as usual to its factual findings.reply brief.
the state preclusion theory rests on an assertion about how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated.as the state acknowledges,one person lawsuit generally does not bar another,no matter how similar they are in substance.see taylor sturgell,noting the historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court but when plaintiffs in two cases have a special relationship,a judgment against one can indeed bind both.see,at describing six categories of qualifying relationships.the state contends that harris and bowser,the plaintiffs here,are members of organizations that were plaintiffs in dickson.and according to north carolina,that connection prevents the pair from raising anew the questions that the state court previously resolved against those groups.see brief for appellants.
but north carolina never satisfied the district court that the alleged affiliation really existed.when the state argued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary judgment,harris and bowser responded that they were not members of any of the organizations that had brought the dickson suit.see record defs.motion for summary judgment record pls.opposition to motion for summary judgment.the parties dueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those groups membership policies,could harris payment of dues to the national naacp,or bowser financial contribution to the mecklenburg county naacp,have made either a member of the state branch.because of those unresolved factual disputes,the district court denied north carolina motion for summary judgment.record july,order.and nothing in the subsequent trial supported the state assertion about harris and bowser organizational ties indeed,the state chose not to present any further evidence relating to the membership issue.based on the resulting record,the district court summarily rejected the state claim that harris and bowser were something other than independent plaintiffs.see supp,at.
that conclusion defeats north carolina attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.we have no basis for assessing the factual assertions underlying the state argument any differently than the district court did.nothing in the state evidence clearly rebuts harris and bowser testimony that they never joined any of the dickson groups.we need not decide whether the alleged memberships would have supported preclusion if they had been proved.it is enough that the district court reasonably thought they had not.
the state argument about our standard of review also falls short.the rule that we review a trial court factual findings for clear error contains no exception for findings that diverge from those made in another court.see fed.rule civ.proc.a findings of fact must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous see also hernandez new york,plurality opinion applying the same standard to a state court findings.whatever findings are under review receive the benefit of deference,without regard to whether a court in a separate suit has seen the matter differently.so here,we must ask not which court considering districts and had the better view of the facts,but simply whether the court below view is clearly wrong.that does not mean the state court decision is wholly irrelevant it is common sense that,all else equal,a finding is more likely to be plainly wrong if some judges disagree with it.glossip gross,slip,at noting that we are even less likely to disturb a factual determination when multiple trial courts have reached the same finding but the very premise of clear error review is that there are often two permissible because two plausible views of the evidence.anderson,at see supra,at.even assuming the state court findings capture one such view,the district court assessment may yet represent another.and the permissibility of the district court account is the only question before us.
with that out of the way,we turn to the merits of this case,beginning appropriately enough with district.as noted above,the court below found that race furnished the predominant rationale for that district redesign.see supra,at.and it held that the state interest in complying with the vra could not justify that consideration of race.see supra,at.we uphold both conclusions.
uncontested evidence in the record shows that the state mapmakers,in considering district,purposefully established a racial target should make up no less than a majority of the population.see supp,at.senator rucho and representative lewis were not coy in expressing that goal.they repeatedly told their colleagues that district had to be,so as to comply with the vra.during a senate debate,for example,rucho explained that district must include a sufficient number of to make it a majority black district.app.similarly,lewis informed the house and senate redistricting committees that the district must have a majority black voting age population.at.and that objective was communicated in no uncertain terms to the legislators consultant.hofeller testified multiple times at trial that rucho and lewis instructed him to draw district with a bvap in excess of percent.supp,at see,ibid.once again,my instructions were that the district had to be drawn at above percent 
hofeller followed those directions to the letter,such that the plus racial target had a direct and significant impact on district configuration.alabama,at slip,at.in particular,hofeller moved the district borders to encompass the heavily black parts of durham and only those parts,thus taking in tens of thousands of additional voters.that change and similar ones,made in his words to ensure that the district racial composition would add up correctly,deviated from the districting practices he otherwise would have followed.app.hofeller candidly admitted that point for example,he testified,he sometimes could not respect county or precinct lines as he wished because the more important thing was to create a district,at see,at.the result is a district with stark racial borders within the same counties,the portions that fall inside district have black populations two to three times larger than the portions placed in neighboring districts.see brief for united states as amicus curiae alabama,at slip,at relying on similar evidence to find racial predominance.
faced with this body of evidence showing an announced racial target that subordinated other districting criteria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions between blacks and whites the district court did not clearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing district.indeed,as all three judges recognized,the court could hardly have concluded anything but.see supp,at calling district a textbook example of districting 
the more substantial question is whether district can survive the strict scrutiny applied to racial gerrymanders.as noted earlier,we have long assumed that complying with the vra is a compelling interest.see supra,at.and we have held that districting is narrowly tailored to that objective if a state had good reasons for thinking that the act demanded such steps.see supra,at.north carolina argues that district passes muster under that standard the general assembly so says the state had good reasons to believe it needed to draw district as a district to avoid section liability for vote dilution.brief for appellants.we now turn to that defense.
this court identified,in thornburg gingles,three threshold conditions for proving vote dilution under of the vra.see,at.first,a minority group must be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in some reasonably configured legislative district,at.second,the minority group must be politically cohesive.at.and third,a district white majority must vote sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the minority preferred candidate.ibid.those three showings,we have explained,are needed to establish that the minority group has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice in a possible district,but that racially polarized voting prevents it from doing so in the district as actually drawn because it is submerg ed in a larger white voting population.growe emison.if a state has good reason to think that all the gingles preconditions are met,then so too it has good reason to believe that requires drawing a district.see bush vera,plurality opinion.but if not,then not.
here,electoral history provided no evidence that a plaintiff could demonstrate the third gingles prerequisite effective white for most of the twenty years prior to the new plan adoption,had made up less than a majority of district voters the district bvap usually hovered between and.see supp,at app.yet throughout those two decades,as the district court noted,district was an extraordinarily safe district for preferred candidates.supp,at.in the closest election during that period,candidate of choice received of the total vote in other years,the share of the vote garnered by those candidates rose to as much as.see supra,at.those victories indeed,landslides occurred because the district white population did not vote sufficiently as a bloc to thwart black voters preference,gingles,at rather,a meaningful number of white voters joined a politically cohesive black community to elect that group favored candidate.in the lingo of voting law,district functioned,election year in and election year out,as a crossover district,in which members of the majority help a large enough minority to elect its candidate of choice.bartlett strickland,plurality opinion.when voters act in that way,i t is difficult to see how the requirement could be met and hence how liability could be established,at.so experience gave the state no reason to think that the vra required it to ramp up district bvap.
the state counters that,in this context,past performance is no guarantee of future results.see brief for appellants reply brief.recall here that the state had to redraw its whole congressional map following the census.see supra,at.and in particular,the state had to add nearly new people to district to meet the standard.see supra,at.that meant about of the voters in the new district would never have voted there before.see app.reply brief.so,north carolina contends,the question facing the state mapmakers was not whether the district violated.rather,the question was whether the future district would do so if drawn without regard to race.and that issue,the state claims,could not be resolved by focusing myopically on past elections.at.
but that reasoning,taken alone,can not justify north carolina redesign of district.true enough,a legislature undertaking a redistricting must assess whether the new districts it contemplates not the old ones it sheds conform to the vra requirements.and true too,an inescapable influx of additional voters into a district may suggest the possibility that its former track record of compliance can continue only if the legislature intentionally adjusts its racial composition.still,north carolina too far downplays the significance of a longtime pattern of white crossover voting in the area that would form the core of the redrawn district.see gingles,at noting that longtime voting patterns are highly probative of racial polarization.and even more important,north carolina can point to no meaningful legislative inquiry into what it now rightly identifies as the key issue whether a new,enlarged district,created without a focus on race but however else the state would choose,could lead to liability.the prospect of a significant population increase in a district only raises it does not answer the question whether requires deliberate measures to augment the district bvap.indeed,such population growth could cut in either direction,depending on who comes into the district.to have a strong basis in evidence to conclude that demands such steps,the state must carefully evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the gingles preconditions including effective white in a new district created without those measures.we see nothing in the legislative record that fits that description 
and that absence is no accident rucho and lewis proceeded under a wholly different theory arising not from gingles but from bartlett strickland of what demanded in drawing district.strickland involved a geographic area in which could not form a majority of a reasonably compact district.see,at plurality opinion.the community,however,was sizable enough to enable the formation of a crossover district,in which a substantial bloc of black voters,if receiving help from some white ones,could elect the candidates of their choice.see supra,at.a plurality of this court,invoking the first gingles precondition,held that did not require creating that district when a minority group is not sufficiently large to make up a majority in a reasonably shaped district,simply does not apply.see,at.over and over in the legislative record,rucho and lewis cited strickland as mandating a plus bvap in district.see app.they apparently reasoned that if,as strickland held,does not require crossover districts for groups insufficiently large under gingles,then also can not be satisfied by crossover districts for groups in fact meeting gingles size condition.in effect,they concluded,whenever a legislature can draw a district,it must do so even if a crossover district would also allow the minority group to elect its favored candidates.see tr.counsel explanation that the s tate interpreted strickland to say that,in order to protect electoral strength and thus avoid liability,the bvap in district need ed to be above percent 
that idea,though,is at war with our jurisprudence strickland included.under the state view,the third gingles condition is no condition at all,because even in the absence of effective white,a claim could succeed in a district like the old district with an bvap.but this court has made clear that unless each of the three gingles prerequisites is established,there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.growe,at.and strickland,far from supporting north carolina view,underscored the necessity of demonstrating effective white to prevail in a suit.the plurality explained that i n areas with substantial crossover voting,plaintiffs would not be able to establish the third gingles precondition and so districts would not be required.at see also ibid.noting that states can defend against alleged violations by pointing to crossover voting patterns and to effective crossover districts thus,north carolina belief that it was compelled to redraw district a successful crossover district as a district rested not on a strong basis in evidence,but instead on a pure error of law.alabama,at slip,at.
in sum although states enjoy leeway to take actions reasonably judged necessary under a proper interpretation of the vra,that latitude can not rescue district.we by no means insist that a state legislature,when redistricting,determine precisely what percent minority population of the vra demands.ibid.but neither will we approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence and whose raison is a legal mistake.accordingly,we uphold the district court conclusion that north carolina use of race as the predominant factor in designing district does not withstand strict scrutiny.
we now look west to district,making its fifth appearance before this court.this time,the district legality turns,and turns solely,on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its most recent reconfiguration.the plaintiffs contended at trial that the general assembly chose voters for district,as for district,because of their race more particularly,they urged that the assembly intentionally increased district bvap in the name of ensuring preclearance under the vra.but north carolina declined to mount any defense similar to the one we have just considered for district that requirements in fact justified changes to district perhaps because could not reasonably be understood to have done so,see,infra.instead,the state altogether denied that racial considerations accounted for or,indeed,played the slightest role in district redesign.according to the state version of events,senator rucho,representative lewis,and hofeller moved voters in and out of the district as part of a strictly political gerrymander,without regard to race.record.the mapmakers drew their lines,in other words,to pack district with democrats,not.after hearing evidence supporting both parties accounts,the district court accepted the plaintiffs 
getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court.in the more usual case alleging a racial gerrymander where no one has raised a partisanship defense the court can make real headway by exploring the challenged district conformity to traditional districting principles,such as compactness and respect for county lines.in shaw ii,for example,this court emphasized the highly irregular shape of in concluding that race predominated in its design,at internal quotation marks omitted.but such evidence loses much of its value when the state asserts partisanship as a defense,because a bizarre shape as of the new district can arise from a political motivation as well as a racial one.cromartie i,at.and crucially,political and racial reasons are capable of yielding similar oddities in a district boundaries.that is because,of course,racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation.cromartie ii,at.as a result of those redistricting realities,a trial court has a formidable task it must make a sensitive inquiry into all circumstantial and direct evidence of intent to assess whether the plaintiffs have managed to disentangle race from politics and prove that the former drove a district lines.cromartie i,at internal quotation marks omitted 
our job is different and generally easier.as described earlier,we review a district court finding as to racial predominance only for clear error,except when the court made a legal mistake.see supra,at.under that standard of review,we affirm the court finding so long as it is plausible we reverse only when left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson,at see supra,at.and in deciding which side of that line to come down on,we give singular deference to a trial court judgments about the credibility of witnesses.see fed.rule civ.proc.a.that is proper,we have explained,because the various cues that bear so heavily on the listener understanding of and belief in what is said are lost on an appellate court later sifting through a paper record.anderson,at 
in light of those principles,we uphold the district court finding of racial predominance respecting district.the evidence offered at trial,including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations,adequately supports the conclusion that race,not politics,accounted for the district reconfiguration.and no error of law infected that judgment contrary to north carolina view,the district court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for district as circumstantial evidence of the legislature intent.
begin with some facts and figures,showing how the redistricting of district affected its racial composition.as explained above,district unlike district was approximately the right size as it was north carolina did not indeed,could not much change its total population.see supra,at.but by further slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body including in guilford county,the general assembly incorporated tens of thousands of new voters and pushed out tens of thousands of old ones.and those changes followed racial lines to be specific,the new district had more of voting age and fewer whites of that age.the difference was made up of voters from other racial categories.see ibid.those voter exchanges produced a sizable jump in the district bvap,from to.see ibid.the assembly thus turned district as it did district,see supra,at into a district.
as the plaintiffs pointed out at trial,rucho and lewis had publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind district augmented bvap.in a release issued along with their draft districting plan,the two legislators ascribed that change to the need to achieve preclearance of the plan under of the vra.see app.at that time,covered guilford county and thus prohibited any retrogression in the electoral position of racial minorities there.beer,at see fed.reg.and part of guilford county lay within district,which meant that the department of justice would closely scrutinize that district new lines.in light of those facts,rucho and lewis wrote because of the presence of guilford county in the twelfth district,we have drawn our proposed twelfth district at a bvap level that is above the percentage of bvap found in the current twelfth district.app.according to the two legislators,that measure w ould ensure preclearance of the plan.ibid.thus,the district court found,rucho and lewis own account evince d intentionality as to district racial composition because of the vra,they increased the number of.supp,at.
hofeller confirmed that intent in both deposition testimony and an expert report.before the redistricting,hofeller testified,some black residents of guilford county fell within district while others fell within neighboring district.the legislators,he continued,decided to reunite the black community in guilford county into the twelfth.app.see,at.why hofeller responded,in language the district court emphasized i n order to be cautious and draw a plan that would pass muster under the voting rights act.at see supp,at.likewise,hofeller expert report highlighted the role of the vra in altering district lines.m indful that guilford county was covered by,hofeller explained,the legislature determined that it was prudent to reunify the county community into district.app.that change caused the district compactness to decrease in,it lowered the reock score but that was a sacrifice well worth making it would avoid the possibility of a vra charge that would inhibit preclearance.ibid.
the state preclearance submission to the justice department indicated a similar determination to concentrate black voters in district.one of the concerns of the redistricting chairs,north carolina there noted,had to do with the justice department objection to a failure by the state to create a second majority minority district that is,in addition to district,at.the submission then went on to explain that after considering alternatives,the redistricters had designed a version of district that would raise its bvap to.thus,concluded the state,the new district increases the community ability to elect their candidate of choice.at.in the district court view,that passage once again indicated that making district was no mere coincidence,but a deliberate attempt to avoid perceived obstacles to preclearance.supp,at 
and still there was more perhaps the most dramatic testimony in the trial came when congressman mel watt who had represented district for some years recounted a conversation he had with rucho in about the district future.according to watt,rucho said that his leadership had told him that he had to ramp the minority percentage in district up to over percent to comply with the voting rights law.app.see,at.and further,that it would then be rucho job to go and convince the community that such a racial target made sense under the act.see,at the district court credited watt testimony about the conversation,citing his courtroom demeanor and consistent recollection under probing.supp,at in the court view,watt account was of a piece with all the other evidence including the redistricters attainment of a bvap indicating that the general assembly,in the name of vra compliance,deliberately redrew district as a district.see,at 
the state contrary story that politics alone drove decisionmaking came into the trial mostly through hofeller testimony.hofeller explained that rucho and lewis instructed him,first and foremost,to make the map as a whole more favorable to republican candidates.app.one stratagem in that effort was to pack the historically democratic district with even more democratic voters,thus leaving surrounding districts more reliably republican.see,at.to that end,hofeller recounted,he drew district new boundaries based on political data specifically,the voting behavior of precincts in the presidential election between barack obama and john mccain.see,at.indeed,he claimed,he displayed only this data,and no racial data,on his computer screen while mapping the district.see,at.in part of his testimony,hofeller further stated that the election data explained among other things his incorporation of the black,but not the white,parts of guilford county then located in district.see,at.only after he drew a line between those adjacent areas,hofeller testified,did he check the racial data and f ind out that the resulting configuration of district did not have a issue.at.
the district court,however,disbelieved hofeller asserted indifference to the new district racial composition.the court recalled hofeller contrary deposition testimony his statement repeated in only slightly different words in his expert report that rucho and lewis decided to shift voters into district in order to ensure preclearance under.see supp,at app.and the court explained that even at trial,hofeller had given testimony that undermined his blame it on politics claim.right after asserting that rucho and lewis had told him not to use race in designing district,hofeller added a qualification except perhaps with regard to guilford county.at see,at.as the district court understood,that is the kind of exception that goes pretty far toward swallowing the rule.district saw a net increase of more than black voters in guilford county,relative to a net gain of fewer than across the district so the newly added parts of that county played a major role in pushing the district bvap over.see,at,the district court came away from hofeller testimony unpersuaded that this decisive influx of black voters was an accident.whether the racial of the county was displayed on his computer screen or just fixed in his head,the court thought,hofeller denial of districting r ang hollow.supp,at.
finally,an expert report by stephen ansolabehere lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs case.ansolabehere looked at the six counties overlapping with district essentially the region from which the mapmakers could have drawn the district population.the question he asked was who from those counties actually ended up in district the answer he found was only of the region white registered voters,but of the black ones.see app.ansolabehere next controlled for party registration,but discovered that doing so made essentially no difference for example,only of the region white democrats wound up in district,whereas of the black democrats did.see,at.the upshot was that,regardless of party,a black voter was three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast his ballot within district borders.see ibid.those stark disparities led ansolabehere to conclude that race,and not party,was the dominant factor in district design,at his report,as the district court held,thus tended to confirm the plaintiffs direct evidence of racial predominance.see supp,at.
the district court assessment that all this evidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error review.the court emphasized that the districting plan own architects had repeatedly described the influx of into district as a compliance measure,not a of political gerrymandering.and those contemporaneous descriptions comported with the court credibility determinations about the trial testimony that watt told the truth when he recounted rucho resolve to hit a target and conversely that hofeller skirted the truth especially as to guilford county when he claimed to have followed only criteria in drawing district lines.we can not disrespect such credibility judgments.see anderson,at a choice to believe one of two or more witnesses,each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,can virtually never be clear error and more generally,we will not take it upon ourselves to weigh the trial evidence as if we were the first to hear it.see,at a reviewing court oversteps under rule a if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court no doubt other interpretations of that evidence were permissible.maybe we would have evaluated the testimony differently had we presided over the trial or then again,maybe we would not have.either way and it is only this which matters we are far from having a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it that racial considerations predominated in district design.
the state mounts a final,legal rather than factual,attack on the district court finding of racial predominance.when race and politics are competing explanations of a district lines,argues north carolina,the party challenging the district must introduce a particular kind of circumstantial evidence an alternative map that achieves the legislature political objectives while improving racial balance.brief for appellants emphasis deleted.that is true,the state says,irrespective of what other evidence is in the case so even if the plaintiff offers powerful direct proof that the legislature adopted the map it did for racial reasons.see tr.of oral arg.because the plaintiffs here as all agree did not present such a,north carolina concludes that they can not prevail.the dissent echoes that argument.see post,at.
we have no doubt that an alternative districting plan,of the kind north carolina describes,can serve as key evidence in a dispute.one,often highly persuasive way to disprove a state contention that politics drove a district lines is to show that the legislature had the capacity to accomplish all its partisan goals without moving so many members of a minority group into the district.if you were really sorting by political behavior instead of skin color so the argument goes you would have done or,at least,could just as well have done this.such,and to round out the set arguments are a familiar means of undermining a claim that an action was based on a permissible,rather than a prohibited,ground.see,dretke,if that were the real explanation for striking juror warren,the prosecutors should have struck juror jenkins too.
but they are hardly the only means.suppose that the plaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced scores of leaked emails from state officials instructing their mapmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a district,or telling him to make sure its bvap hit.based on such evidence,a court could find that racial rather than political factors predominated in a district design,with or without an alternative map.and so too in cases lacking that kind of smoking gun,as long as the evidence offered satisfies the plaintiff burden of proof.in bush vera,for example,this court upheld a finding of racial predominance based on substantial direct evidence of the legislature racial motivations including credible testimony from political figures and statements made in a preclearance submission plus circumstantial evidence that redistricters had access to racial,but not political,data at the level needed to explain their intricate designs.see,at plurality opinion.not a single member of the court thought that the absence of a made any difference.similarly,it does not matter in this case,where the plaintiffs introduction of mostly direct and some circumstantial evidence documents issued in the redistricting process,testimony of government officials,expert analysis of demographic patterns gave the district court a sufficient basis,sans any map,to resolve the question.
a plaintiff task,in other words,is simply to persuade the trial court without any special evidentiary prerequisite that race not politics was the predominant consideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.alabama,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted,at,slip,at,rejecting a similar effort to elevate one form of persuasive circumstantial evidence in a dispute respecting racial predominance to a mandatory precondition or threshold requirement of proof.that burden of proof,we have often held,is demanding.cromartie ii,at.and because that is so,a plaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map,as a practical matter,to make his case.but in no area of our equal protection law have we forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form of proof to prevail.see arlington heights metropolitan housing development,offering a varied and list of subjects of proper inquiry in determining whether racially discriminatory intent existed nor would it make sense to do so here.the equal protection clause prohibits the unjustified drawing of district lines based on race.an alternative map is merely an evidentiary tool to show that such a substantive violation has occurred neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim 
north carolina insists,however,that we have already said to the contrary more particularly,that our decision in cromartie ii imposed a requirement.brief for appellants.as the state observes,cromartie ii reversed as clearly erroneous a trial court finding that race,rather than politics,predominated in the assignment of voters to an earlier incarnation of district.see,at supra,at.and as the state emphasizes,a part of our opinion faulted the cromartie plaintiffs for failing to offer a convincing account of how the legislature could have accomplished its political goals other than through the map it chose.see,at.we there stated 
in a case such as this one where districts are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation,the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.that party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.at.
according to north carolina,that passage alone settles this case,because it makes an alternative map essential to a finding that district a district in which race and partisanship are correlated was a racial gerrymander.reply brief.once again,the dissent says the same.see post,at.
but the reasoning of cromartie ii belies that reading.the court opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categorical rule that the state claims to find there.certainly the dissent current defense of that rule,see post,at,was nowhere in evidence.and given the strangeness of that rule which would treat a mere form of evidence as the very substance of a constitutional claim,see supra,at we can not think that the court adopted it without any explanation.still more,the entire thrust of the cromartie ii opinion runs counter to an inflexible requirement.if the court had adopted that rule,it would have had no need to weigh each piece of evidence in the case and determine whether,taken together,they were adequate to show the predominance of race in the legislature process.at.but that is exactly what cromartie ii did,over a span of pages and in exhaustive detail.item by item,the court discussed and dismantled the supposed proof,both direct and circumstantial,of redistricting.all that careful analysis would have been superfluous that dogged effort wasted if the court viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single form of evidence as necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim.
rightly understood,the passage from cromartie ii had a different and narrower point,arising from and reflecting the evidence offered in that case.the direct evidence of a racial gerrymander,we thought,was extremely weak we said of one piece that it says little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role in drawing district lines we said of another that it is less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant in other redistricting cases.at emphasis deleted.nor did the report of the plaintiffs expert impress us overmuch in our view,it offer ed little insight into the legislature true motive.at.that left a set of arguments of the variety.for example,the plaintiffs offered several maps purporting to show how the legislature might have swapped some mostly black and mostly white precincts to obtain greater racial balance without harming the legislature political objective.at internal quotation marks omitted.but the court determined that none of those proposed exchanges would have worked as advertised essentially,that the plaintiffs you could have redistricted differently arguments failed on their own terms.see,at.hence emerged the demand quoted above,for maps that would actually show what the plaintiffs had not.in a case like cromartie ii that is,one in which the plaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerrymander and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alternatives only maps of that kind could carry the day,at.
but this case is most unlike cromartie ii,even though it involves the same electoral district some twenty years on.this case turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts,but on direct evidence of the general assembly intent in creating the actual district,including many hours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.that evidence,the district court plausibly found,itself satisfied the plaintiffs burden of debunking north carolina it was really politics defense there was no need for an alternative map to do the same job.and we pay our precedents no respect when we extend them far beyond the circumstances for which they were designed.
applying a clear error standard,we uphold the district court conclusions that racial considerations predominated in designing both district and district.for district,that is all we must do,because north carolina has made no attempt to justify districting there.for district,we further uphold the district court decision that of the vra gave north carolina no good reason to reshuffle voters because of their race.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
it is so ordered.

a precedent of this court should not be treated like a disposable household item say,a paper plate or napkin to be used once and then tossed in the trash.but that is what the court does today in its decision regarding north carolina congressional district the court junks a rule adopted in a prior,remarkably similar challenge to this very same congressional district.
in easley cromartie,cromartie ii,the court considered the constitutionality of the version of district that was adopted in,at.that district had the same basic shape as the district now before us,and the challengers argued that the legislature predominant reason for adopting this configuration was race.ibid.the state responded that its motive was not race but politics,at.its objective,the state insisted,was to create a district in which the democratic candidate would win.see brief for state appellants in easley cromartie.rejecting that explanation,a court found that the legislature predominant motive was racial,specifically to pack into district.see cromartie hunt,supp,ednc.but this court held that this finding of fact was clearly erroneous.cromartie ii,at.
a critical factor in our analysis was the failure of those challenging the district to come forward with an alternative redistricting map that served the legislature political objective as well as the challenged version without producing the same racial effects.noting that race and party affiliation in north carolina were highly correlated,at,we laid down this rule 
in a case such as this one,the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.that party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.appellees failed to make any such showing here.at.
now,district is back before us.after the census,the north carolina legislature,with the republicans in the majority,drew the present version of district.the challengers contend that this version violates equal protection because the predominant motive of the legislature was racial to pack the district with voters.the legislature responds that its objective was political to pack the district with democrats and thus to increase the chances of republican candidates in neighboring districts.
you might think that the cromartie ii rule would be equally applicable in this case,which does not differ in any relevant particular,but the majority executes a stunning.now,the challengers failure to produce an alternative map that meets the cromartie ii test is inconsequential.it simply does not matter.ante,at.
this is not the treatment of precedent that state legislatures have the right to expect from this court.the failure to produce an alternative map doomed the challengers in cromartie ii,and the same should be true now.partisan gerrymandering is always unsavory,but that is not the issue here.the issue is whether district was drawn predominantly because of race.the record shows that it was not 
under the constitution,state legislatures have the initial power to draw districts for federal elections.vieth jubelirer,plurality opinion this power,of course,must be exercised in conformity with the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.and because the equal protection clause central mandate is racial neutrality in governmental decisionmaking,miller johnson,effort s to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race must satisfy the rigors of strict scrutiny.shaw reno,shaw i.
we have stressed,however,that courts are obligated to exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a state has drawn district lines on the basis of race.miller,at.review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions,and the good faith of a state legislature must be presumed.at.a legislature will almost always be aware of racial demographics during redistricting,but evidence of such awareness does not show that the legislature violated equal protection,at.instead,the court has held,r ace must not simply have been a motivation for the drawing of a district,but the predominant factor motivating the legislature districting decision.cromartie ii,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
this evidentiary burden is a demanding one.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,although t he legislature motivation is a factual question,hunt cromartie,cromartie i,an appellate court conducting review must always keep in mind the heavy evidentiary obligation borne by those challenging a districting plan.see cromartie ii,supra,at.recognizing the intrusive potential of judicial intervention into the legislative realm,miller,supra,at,we have warned that courts must be very cautious about imputing a racial motive to a state redistricting plan.
that caution is especially appropriate where the state has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision,and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly correlated.cromartie ii,at.we have repeatedly acknowledged the problem of distinguishing between racial and political motivations in the redistricting context.see,at,cromartie i,supra,at bush vera,plurality opinion.
the problem arises from the confluence of two factors.the first is the status under the constitution of partisan gerrymandering.as we have acknowledged,p olitics and political considerations are inseparable from districting and apportionment,gaffney cummings,and it is well known that state legislative majorities very often attempt to gain an electoral advantage through that process.see davis bandemer.partisan gerrymandering dates back to the founding,see vieth,supra,at plurality opinion,and while some might find it distasteful,o ur prior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering,even if it so happens that the most loyal democrats happen to be black democrats and even if the state were conscious of that fact.cromartie i,supra,at emphasis in original vera,supra,at plurality opinion.
the second factor is that racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation in many jurisdictions.cromartie ii,at describing correlation in north carolina.this phenomenon makes it difficult to distinguish between political and decisionmaking.if around of voters cast their ballots for the democratic candidate,as they have in recent elections a plan that packs democratic voters will look very much like a plans that packs voters.a legislature may,by placing reliable democratic precincts within a district without regard to race,end up with a district containing more heavily precincts,but the reasons would be political rather than racial.at.
we addressed this knotty problem in cromartie ii,which,as noted,came to us after the district court had held a trial and found as a fact that the legislature predominant reason for drawing district was race,not politics,at.our review for clear error in that case did not exhibit the same diffidence as today decision.we carefully examined each piece of direct and circumstantial evidence on which the district court had relied and conceded that this evidence provided support for the court finding,at.then,at the end of our opinion,we stated 
we can put the matter more generally as follows in a case such as this one where districts or the approximate equivalent are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation,the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.that party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.at.
because the plaintiffs had failed to make any such showing,we held that the district court had clearly erred in finding that race predominated in drawing district.ibid.
cromartie ii plainly meant to establish a rule for use in a broad class of cases and not a rule to be employed one time only.we stated that we were put ting the matter more generally and were describing what must be shown in cases where districts or the approximate equivalent are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation.ibid.we identified who would carry the burden of the new rule the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries and what that party must show that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles while achieving significantly greater racial balance ibid.and we reversed the finding of racial predominance due to the plaintiffs failure to carry the burden established by this evidentiary rule.ibid.
here,too,the plaintiffs failed to carry that burden.in this case,as in cromartie ii,the plaintiffs allege a racial gerrymander,and the state defense is that political motives explain district boundaries.in such a case,cromartie ii instructed,plaintiffs must submit an alternative redistricting map demonstrating that the legislature could have achieved its political goals without the racial effects giving rise to the racial gerrymandering allegation.but in spite of this instruction,plaintiffs in this case failed to submit such a map see brief for appellees.based on what we said in cromartie ii about the same type of claim involving the same congressional district,reversal should be a foregone conclusion.it turns out,however,that the cromartie ii rule was good for one use only.even in a case involving the very same district,it is tossed aside.
the requirement deserves better.it is a logical response to the difficult problem of distinguishing between racial and political motivations when race and political party preference closely correlate.
this is a problem with serious institutional and federalism implications.when a federal court says that race was a legislature predominant purpose in drawing a district,it accuses the legislature of offensive and demeaning conduct.miller,at.indeed,we have said that racial gerrymanders bea r an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.shaw i,at.that is a grave accusation to level against a state legislature.
in addition,f review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions because i t is well settled that reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the state.miller,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted see also cromartie ii,at.when a federal court finds that race predominated in the redistricting process,it inserts itself into that process.that is appropriate indeed,constitutionally required if the legislature truly did draw district boundaries on the basis of race.but if a court mistakes a political gerrymander for a racial gerrymander,it illegitimately invades a traditional domain of state authority,usurping the role of a state elected representatives.this does violence to both the proper role of the judiciary and the powers reserved to the states under the constitution.
there is a final,danger where race and politics correlate that the federal courts will be transformed into weapons of political warfare.unless courts exercise extraordinary caution in distinguishing redistricting from redistricting,miller,supra,at,they will invite the losers in the redistricting process to seek to obtain in court what they could not achieve in the political arena.if the majority party draws districts to favor itself,the minority party can deny the majority its political victory by prevailing on a racial gerrymandering claim.even if the minority party loses in court,it can exact a heavy price by using the judicial process to engage in political trench warfare for years on end.
although i do not imply that this is what occurred here,this case does reflect what litigation of this sort can look like.this is the fifth time that north carolina congressional district has come before this court since,and we have almost reached a new redistricting cycle without any certainty as to the constitutionality of north carolina current redistricting map.given these dangers,cromartie ii was justified in crafting an evidentiary rule to prevent false positives 
the majority nevertheless absolves the challengers of their failure to submit an alternative map.it argues that an alternative map can not be the only means of proving racial predominance,and it concludes from this that an alternative map does not matter in this case.ante,at emphasis in original.but even if there are cases in which a plaintiff could prove a racial gerrymandering claim without an alternative map,they would be exceptional ones in which the evidence of racial predominance is overwhelming.this most definitely is not one of those cases,see part,infra,and the plaintiffs failure to produce an alternative map mandates reversal.moreover,even in an exceptional case,the absence of such a map would still be strong evidence that a district boundaries were determined by politics rather than race the absence of a map would matter.ante,at.
the majority questions the legitimacy of the requirement,ante,at,and,but the rule is a sound one.it rests on familiar principles regarding the allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion and the assessment of evidence.first,in accordance with the general rule in civil cases,plaintiffs in a case like this bear the burden of proving that the legislature motive was unconstitutional.second,what must be shown is not simply that race played a part in the districting process but that it played the predominant role.third,a party challenging a districting plan must overcome the strong presumption that the plan was drawn for constitutionally permissible reasons.miller,supra,at.fourth,when those responsible for adopting a challenged plan contend that the plan was devised for partisan political ends,they are making an admission that may not sit well with voters,so the explanation should not be lightly dismissed.fed.rule evid.b.and finally,the cromartie ii rule takes into account the difficulty of proving a negative.
for challengers like those in the present case,producing a map that meets the cromartie ii test should not be hard if the predominant reason for a challenged plan really was race and not politics.plaintiffs mounting a challenge to a districting plan are almost always sophisticated litigants who have the assistance of experts,and that is certainly true in the present case.today,an expert with a computer can easily churn out redistricting maps that control for any number of specified criteria,including prior voting patterns and political party registration.therefore,if it is indeed possible to find a map that meets the cromartie ii test,it should not be too hard for the challengers to do so.the state,on the other hand,can not prove that no map meeting the cromartie ii test can be drawn.even if a state submits,say,alternative maps that fail the test,that would not prove that no such map could pass it.the relative ease with which the opposing parties can gather evidence is a familiar consideration in allocating the burden of production.see mueller kirkpatrick,federal evidence,ed.wright graham,federal practice and procedure.
even if we set aside the challengers failure to submit an alternative map,the district court finding that race predominated in the drawing of district is clearly erroneous.the state offered strong and coherent evidence that politics,not race,was the legislature predominant aim,and the evidence supporting the district court contrary finding is weak and manifestly inadequate in light of the high evidentiary standard that our cases require challengers to meet in order to prove racial predominance 
my analysis will proceed in three steps.first,i will discuss what the legislature mapmaker did and why this approach is entirely consistent with his stated political objectives.then,i will explain why this approach inevitably had the racial effect to which the challengers object.finally,i will address the evidence of racial predominance on which the majority relies and show why it is inadequate to sustain the district court judgment.
in order to understand the mapmaker approach,the first element to be kept in mind is that the basic shape of district was legitimately taken as a given.when a new census requires redistricting,it is a common practice to start with the plan used in the prior map and to change the boundaries of the prior districts only as needed to comply with the,mandate and to achieve other desired ends.this approach honors settled expectations and,if the prior plan survived legal challenge,minimizes the risk that the new plan will be overturned.and that is the approach taken by the veteran mapmaker in the present case,thomas hofeller.app.the normal starting point is always from the existing districts 
hofeller began with the prior version of district even though that version had a strange,serpentine shape.cromartie i,at app.that design has a long history.it was first adopted in,and subsequent redistricting plans have built on the plan.ibid.in cromartie ii,we sustained the constitutionality of the version of district,which featured the same basic shape.see,at.and retention of this same basic shape is not challenged in this case 
using the prior design as his starting point,hofeller assumed that district would remain a strong democratic distric t.app.he stated that he drew the overall redistricting plan to have an increased number of competitive districts for gop candidates,at,and that he therefore moved more democratic voters into district in order to increase republican opportunities in the surrounding districts,at.
under the map now before us,district is bordered by four districts running counterclockwise,they are district to the northwest district to the southwest district to the southeast and district to the northeast.see appendix,ante.according to hofeller,the aim was to make these four districts considered as a whole more secure for republicans.app.
to do this,hofeller set out in search of pockets of democratic voters that could be moved into district from areas adjoining or very close to district prior boundaries.of the six counties through which district passes,the three most heavily democratic and also the most populous are forsyth,guilford,and mecklenburg,which contain the major population centers of,greensboro,and charlotte,respectively.see record app.as a measure of voting preferences,hofeller used the results of the recent presidential election,the election of,at.in that election,these three counties voted strongly for the democratic candidate,barack obama,while the other three counties,cabarrus,davidson,and rowan,all voted for the republican candidate,senator john mccain.see record.
two of the three democratic counties,forsyth and guilford,are located at the northern end of district,while the other democratic county,mecklenburg,is on the southern end.see appendix,ante.the middle of the district often called the corridor passes through the three more counties cabarrus,davidson,and rowan.ibid.thus,if a mapmaker sat down to increase the proportion of democrats in district and to reduce the proportion in neighboring districts,the most obvious way to do that was to pull additional democrats into the district from the north and south the most populous and heavily democratic counties while shifting republican voters out of the corridor.
that,in essence,is what hofeller did as the majority acknowledges.ante,at hofeller narrow ed district already snakelike body while adding areas at either end app.table.hofeller testified that he sought to shift parts of mecklenburg county out of districts and in order to reduce the percentage of democrats in these two districts and that this required him to increase the coverage of mecklenburg county in district,at.
hofeller testified that he also had political plans for the current map district,which differed substantially from the version in the prior map.hofeller wanted to improve the republicans prospects in this new district by minimizing its coverage of guilford county democratic population,at.that also meant increasing the population of guilford county democrats in district,at.
this influx of democratic voters from the two most populous counties in district required shedding voters elsewhere in order to comply with this court mandate of,see kirkpatrick preisler,and the population removed had to be added to a bordering district.app.parts of davidson and rowan counties were therefore shifted to district,at,table,but hofeller testified that this would not have been sufficient to satisfy the,standard,so he also had to move voters from heavily democratic forsyth county into district,at.doing so did not undermine his political objective,he explained,because district was stronger for republicans to begin with and could take those forsyth democratic precincts without endangering republican chances in the district,at see also,at.the end result was that,under the new map now at issue,the three major counties in the north and south constitute a larger percentage of district total population,while the corridor lost population.see,at table,finding.
a comparison of the presidential election vote under the old and new versions of the districts shows the effect of hofeller map.district which,of the four districts bordering district under the map,was the most democratic district saw a drop of almost in the democratic vote under the new map.see record.district saw a drop in the percentage of registered democrats,at,although the vote percentage for the democratic presidential candidate remained essentially the same increasing by,at.district,which was heavily republican under the prior map and was redrawn to absorb democrats from forsyth county,saw about a swing in favor of the democratic candidate,but it remained a strong republican district.ibid.new district is less susceptible to comparison because its boundaries are completely different from the district bearing that number under the old plan,but the new district was solidly republican,with a republican presidential vote percentage of nearly.ibid.as stated by the state court that considered and rejected the same constitutional challenge now before us 
by increasing the number of democratic voters in the twelfth congressional district located in mecklenburg and guilford counties,the congressional plan created other districts that were more competitive for republican candidates as compared to the versions of these districts app.finding.
the results of subsequent congressional elections show that hofeller plan achieved its goal.in,prior to the adoption of the current plan,democrats won of the districts,including district but by,republicans controlled of the districts,including district,and all the republican candidates for the house of representatives won their races with at least of the vote in accordance with the map design,the only democratic seats remaining after were in districts,and,at.
in sum,there is strong evidence in the record to support hofeller testimony that the changes made to the map were designed to maximize republican opportunities.
i now turn to the connection between the mapmaker strategy and the effect on the percentage of in district.
as we recognized in cromartie ii,political party preference and race are highly correlated in north carolina generally and in the area of congressional district in particular.app.state trial court finding that racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation in north carolina.the challenger expert,stephen ansolabehere,corroborated this important point.ansolabehere calculated the statewide correlation between race and voting in and found a correlation of,which is very high.at,table.see also levin,fox,forde,elementary statistics in social research ed.witte witte,statistics ed.
in the area of district,the correlation is even higher.there,ansolabehere found that the correlation approach ed,app,that is,almost complete overlap.these black democrats also constitute a supermajority of democrats in the area covered by the district.under the version of district which was drawn by democrats and was never challenged as a racial gerrymander black registered voters constituted of democrats in the district.record see also app.finding what this means is that a mapmaker seeking to pull democrats into district would unavoidably pull in a very large percentage of.
the distribution of democratic voters magnified this effect.hofeller plan required the identification of areas of democratic strength that were near district prior boundaries.hofeller prepared maps showing the distribution of democratic voters by precinct see,at,and those maps show that these voters were highly concentrated around the major urban areas of in forsyth county,greensboro in guilford county,and charlotte in mecklenberg county.ansolabehere,the challengers expert,prepared maps showing the distribution of black registered voters in these same counties,see,at record,and a comparison of these two sets of maps reveals that the clusters of democratic voters generally overlap with those of registered black voters.in other words,the population of nearby democrats who could be moved into district was heavily black.
the upshot is that,so long as the legislature chose to retain the basic shape of district and to increase the number of democrats in the district,it was inevitable that the democrats brought in would be disproportionately black.
none of this should come as a surprise.after all,when the basic shape of district was created after the census,the express goal of the north carolina legislature was to create a district.see shaw i,at.it has its unusual shape because it was originally designed to capture pockets of black voters.see shaw hunt,shaw ii.although the legislature has modified the district since then,see cromartie i,at describing changes from the version to the version,it retains its basic snakelike shape and continues to track interstate.record appellees complaint congressional district has existed in roughly its current form since,when it was drawn as a majority district see also app.showing the,and versions of district.the original design of the district was devised to ensure a high concentration of black voters,and as long as the basic design is retained as it has been,one would expect that to continue.
while plaintiffs failed to offer any alternative map,hofeller produced a map showing what district would have looked like if his computer was programmed simply to maximize the democratic vote percentage in the district,while still abiding by the requirement of,at.the result was a version of district that is very similar to the version approved by the north carolina legislature.see,at,at.indeed,this plan had a black voting age population of,which is actually higher than district black voting age population of,at table.
thus,the increase in the black voting age population of district is easily explained by a coherent and generally successful political strategy.cromartie ii,at a legislature may,by placing reliable democratic precincts within a district without regard to race,end up with a district containing more heavily precincts,but the reasons would be political rather than racial 
amazingly,a reader of the majority opinion and the opinion of the district court would remain almost entirely ignorant of the legislature political strategy and the relationship between that strategy and the racial composition of district the majority analysis is like hamlet without the prince 
the majority focuses almost all its attention on a few references to race by those responsible for the drafting and adoption of the redistricting plan.but the majority reads far too much into these references.first,what the plaintiffs had to prove was not simply that race played some role in the districting process but that it was the legislature predominant consideration.second,as i have explained,a court must exercise extraordinary caution before finding that a state legislature predominant reason for a districting plan was racial.miller,at.this means that comments should not be taken out of context and given the most sinister possible meaning.third,the findings of the state courts in a virtually identical challenge to district are entitled to respectful consideration.a north carolina trial court,after hearing much the same evidence as the court below,found that the legislature predominant motive was political,not racial.that decision was affirmed by the north carolina supreme court.dickson rucho,vacated and remanded,aff on remand,cert.pending.even if the judgment in the state case does not bar the present case under the doctrine of res judicata,see ante,at,the finding illustrates the thinness of the plaintiffs proof.
finally,it must be kept in mind that references to race by those responsible for drawing or adopting a redistricting plan are not necessarily evidence that the plan was adopted for improper racial reasons.under our precedents,it is unconstitutional for the government to consider race in almost any context,and therefore any mention of race by the decisionmakers may be cause for suspicion.we have said,however,that that is not so in the redistricting context.for one thing,a state like north carolina that was either wholly or partially within the coverage of of the voting rights act of could not redistrict without heeding that provision prohibition against racial retrogression,see b alabama legislative black caucus alabama,slip,at,and therefore race had to be kept in mind.in addition,all legislatures must also take into account the possibility of a challenge under of the voting rights act claiming that a plan illegally dilutes the voting strength of a minority community.see league of united latin american citizens perry.if a state ultimately concludes that it must take race into account in order to comply with the voting rights act,it must show that it had a strong basis in evidence in support of the choice that it has made.alabama legislative black caucus,supra,at slip,at.but those involved in the redistricting process may legitimately make statements about voting rights act compliance before deciding that the act does not provide a need for districting.and it is understandable for such individuals to explain that a plan happens to satisfy the criteria on which voting rights act challengers might insist.in short,because of the voting rights act,consideration and discussion of the racial effects of a plan may be expected.
the june,statement 
i begin with a piece of evidence that the majority does not mention,namely,the very first item cited by the district court in support of its finding.this evidence consisted of a june,statement by senator rucho and representative lewis,the state legislators who took the lead in the adoption of the current map.in that statement,rucho and lewis referred to constructing voting rights act majority black districts.app.seizing upon the use of the plural term districts,the court below seemed to think that it had found a smoking gun.harris mccrory,supp,mdnc.the state had insisted that its plan drew only one congressional district,district,but since the june statement clearly refers to multiple districts that are now majority minority,the court below viewed the statement as telling evidence that an additional congressional district,presumably district,had been intentionally designed to be a district and was thus based on race.
there is a glaring problem with this analysis the june statement was about state legislative districts,not federal congressional districts.see app.the united states,as amicus curiae in support of plaintiffs,concedes that the district court made a mistake by relying on the june statement.brief for united states.the majority,by contrast,tries to ignore this error.but the district court gave the june statement in its opinion,mentioning it first in its analysis,and the district court seemed to think that this evidence was particularly significant,stating that the reference to multiple districts was not the result of happenstance,a mere slip of the pen.supp,at.the district court error shows a troubling lack of precision.
the preclearance request 
under of the voting rights act,north carolina requested preclearance from the department of justice shortly after the legislature approved the new congressional plan,at.in its preclearance application,the state noted that o ne of the concerns of the redistricting chairs was that in,the justice department had objected to the congressional plan because of a failure by the state to create a second majority minority district.app.the application says that the redistricting chairs sought input from congressman mel watt,the incumbent who represented district,regarding options for his district,and that after this consultation,the chairs had the impression that congressman watt would oppose any redrawing of the twelfth district as originally contemplated by the justice department objection.ibid.the chairs drew district b ased in part on this input from congressman watt.at.two sentences later in the same paragraph,the application observed that the black voting age population for district went up from to and that therefore the district maintains,and in fact increases,the community ability to elect their candidate of choice in district.at.
according to the majority,this statement shows a determination to concentrate black voters in district.ante,at.in fact,it shows no such thing.the statement explains that senator rucho and representative lewis decided not to construct district as a district as the justice department had demanded b ased in part on the input they received from congressman watt,whom they thought would oppose drawing the district as originally contemplated by the justice department objection.app.if anything,this document cuts against a finding of racial predominance.
the statement reference to the increase in district black voting age population hardly shows that the legislature altered district for the purpose of causing this increase.an entirely natural interpretation is that the redistricting chairs simply reported this fact so that it would be before the justice department in the event that the department had renewed voting rights act concerns.only by reading a great deal between the lines and adopting the most sinister possible interpretation can the statement be viewed as pointed evidence of a predominantly racial motive.
the mel watt testimony 
in both the district court and the state trial court,congressman watt testified that,while the redistricting plan was being developed,senator rucho invited him to his home to discuss the new boundaries of district,at.according to congressman watt,senator rucho said that the republican leadership wanted him to ramp the congressional district up to over percent black because they believed it was required by the voting rights act.at.in the state proceedings,senator rucho denied making any such statement,at,and another state legislator present at the meeting,representative ruth samuelson,gave similar testimony,at.neither senator rucho nor representative samuelson testified in federal court although their state court testimony was made part of the federal record.see,at.but the district court credited congressman watt testimony based on its assessment of his demeanor and the consistency of his recollection,supp,at,and i accept that credibility finding for purposes of our review 
but even assuming that congressman watt recollection was completely accurate,all that his testimony shows is that legislative leaders at one point in the process thought that they had to draw district as a district in order to comply with the voting rights act it does not show that they actually did draw district with the goal of creating a district.and as explained in the discussion of the preclearance request above,senator rucho and representative lewis stated that they ultimately turned away from the creation of a district after consulting with congressman watt.based in part on this input from congressman watt,they said they decided not to draw the district as the department of justice had suggested that is,as a district.app.
this account is fully consistent with congressman watt testimony about his meeting with senator rucho.congressman watt noted that senator rucho was uncomfortable with the notion of increasing the black voting age population,at,and congressman watt testified that he told senator rucho that he was opposed to the idea,at.so it makes sense that senator rucho was dissuaded from taking that course by congressman watt reaction.and hofeller consistently testified that he was never asked to meet a particular black voting age population target,see part,infra,and that the only data displayed on his screen when he drew district was political data.see infra,at.thus,congressman watt testimony,even if taken at face value,is entirely consistent with what the preclearance request recounts after initially contemplating the possibility of drawing district as a district,the legislative leadership met with congressman watt,who convinced them not to do so.
hofeller statements about guilford county 
under the prior map,both guilford county and the greensboro community were divided between the and districts.this had been done,hofeller explained,to make both the old and districts strongly democratic.app.see also,at,record showing racial demographics of guilford precincts under and maps.but the republican legislature wanted to make the area surrounding district more republican.the new map eliminated the old district and created a new district bearing that number farther to the east.the territory to the north of greensboro that had previously been in the district was placed in a new district,district,which was constructed to be a district,and the new map moved more of the greensboro area into the new district.this move was entirely consistent with the legislature stated goal of concentrating democrats in the district and making the surrounding districts hospitable to republican candidates.
hofeller testified that the placement of the greensboro community in the district was the result of this political strategy.he stated that the portion of guilford county absorbed by district was moved into cd because it had a substantial black population.it was moved into cd because it had a substantial democratic political voting record app.and hofeller maintained that he was never instructed to draw district as a district or to increase the district black voting age population.see,at.instead,he testified that political considerations determined the boundaries of district and that the only data displayed on his computer screen when he drew the challenged map was voting data from the presidential election,at.
hofeller acknowledged,however,that there had been concern about the possibility of a voting rights act challenge to this treatment of the greensboro community.guilford county was covered by of the voting rights act,and as noted,prohibits retrogression.under the old map,the guilford county community was split between the old district and district,and in both of those districts,black voters were able to elect the candidates of their choice by allying with white democratic voters.under the new map,however,if the greensboro black community had been split between district and the new district,the black voters in the latter district would be unlikely to elect the candidate of their choice.placing the community in district avoided this consequence.even congressman watt conceded that there were potential concerns relating to the black community in guilford county,at.
the thrust of many of hofeller statements about the treatment of guilford county was that the reuniting of the greensboro black community in district was nothing more than a welcome byproduct of his political strategy.he testified that he first drew the district based on political considerations and then checked to ensure that guilford county black population was not fractured,at w hen we checked it,we found that we did not have an issue in guilford county with fracturing the black community see also,at.this testimony is entirely innocuous.
there is no doubt,however,that hofeller also made a few statements that may be read to imply that concern about voting rights act litigation was part of the motivation for the treatment of guilford county.he testified at trial that he was instructed not to use race in any form except perhaps with regard to guilford county.at emphasis added.see,at the legislature determined that it was prudent to reunify the community in guilford county at i t was decided to reunite the black community in guilford county into the twelfth 
these statements by hofeller convinced the district court that the drawing of district was not a purely politically driven affair.supp,at.but in order to prevail,the plaintiffs had to show much more that race was the predominant reason for the drawing of district,and these few bits of testimony fall far short of that showing.
our decision in cromartie ii illustrates this point.in that case,the legislature mapmaker made a statement that is remarkably similar to hofeller.gerry cohen,the legislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans,reported i have moved greensboro black community into the,and now need to take about out of the.i await your direction on this.at.this admission did not persuade the court that the legislature predominant motive was racial.the majority ignores this obvious parallel with cromartie ii.
moreover,in an attempt to magnify the importance of the treatment of guilford county,the majority plays games with statistics.it states that district saw a net increase of more than black voters in guilford county,relative to a net gain of fewer than across the district so the newly added parts of that county played a major role in pushing the district bvap over.ante,at.
this is highly misleading.first,since the black voting age population of district is just barely over specifically,almost any decision that increased the number of voting age blacks in district could be said to have played a major role in pushing the district bvap over.
second,the majority provides the total number of voting age blacks added to district from guilford county approximately alongside the total number of voting age blacks added to the district approximately,and this has the effect of making guilford county look like it is the overwhelming contributor to the district net increase in black voting age population.in truth,mecklenburg county was by far the greatest contributor of voting age blacks to district in both absolute terms approximately and in terms of new voting age blacks approximately.see app.indeed,if what matters to the majority is how much individual counties increased district black voting age population percentage,davidson county deserves attention as well,since the portion of the county within district lost over more voting age whites than blacks.ibid.that is greater than the net number of voting age blacks added to the district by guilford county or mecklenburg county.ibid.as with so much in the majority opinion,the issue here is more nuanced and much more favorable to the state than the majority would have it seem.
the july,statement 
for reasons similar to those just explained,the majority makes far too much of a statement issued by senator rucho and representative lewis on july,when the new districting plan was proposed.particularly in light of hofeller later testimony about the legislature partisan objectives,it is apparent that this statement does not paint an entirely reliable picture of the legislature aims.the statement begins with this proclamation from the beginning,our goal has remained the same the development of fair and legal congressional and legislative districts,at,and the statement seriously downplays the role of politics in the process,acknowledging only that we have not been ignorant of the partisan impacts of the districts we have created,at.
the statement discusses the treatment of guilford county in a section with the heading compliance with the voting rights act.at.in that section,rucho and lewis state because of the presence of guilford county in the twelfth district,we have drawn our proposed twelfth district at a black voting age level that is above the percentage of black voting age population found in the current twelfth district.we believe that this measure will ensure preclearance of the plan.at.
the majority and the district court interpret this passage to say that rucho and lewis decided to move black voters from guilford county into district in order to ward off voting rights act liability.ante,at because of the vra,rucho and lewis increased the number of in district citing supp,at emphasis in original.but that is hardly the only plausible interpretation.the statement could just as easily be understood as an explanation by the legislature that because they chose to add guilford county back into cd,the district ended up with an increased ability to elect candidates,rather than the legislature explaining that they chose to add guilford county back into cd because of the racial results that addition created.at osteen,concurring in part and dissenting in part emphasis in original.and because we are obligated to presume the good faith of the north carolina legislature,this latter interpretation is the appropriate one.
but even if one adopts the majority interpretation,it adds little to the analysis.the majority close and incriminating reading of a statement issued to win public support for the new plan may represent poetic justice having attempted to blur the partisan aim of the new district,the legislature is hoisted on its own petard.but poetic justice is not the type of justice that we are supposed to dispense.this statement is some evidence that race played a role in the drawing of district,but it is a mistake to give this political statement too much weight.
again,we made precisely this point in cromartie ii.there,the legislative redistricting leader,roy cooper,testified before a legislative committee that the proposed plan provides for racial and partisan balance.at emphasis added.the district court read the statement literally and concluded that the district had been drawn with a racial objective.ibid.but this court dismissed the statement,reasoning that although the phrase shows that the legislature considered race,along with other partisan and geographic considerations it says little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role comparatively speaking.ibid.
what was good in cromartie ii should also be good here.
ansolabehere testimony 
finally,the majority cites ansolabehere testimony that black registered voters in the counties covered by district were more likely to be drawn into district than white registered voters and that black registered democrats were more likely to be pulled in than white registered democrats.ante,at.
there is an obvious flaw in ansolabehere analysis.he assumed that,if race was not the driving force behind the drawing of district,white and black registered voters would have approximately the same likelihood of inclusion in a given congressional district.app.internal quotation marks omitted.but that would be true only if black and white voters were evenly distributed throughout the region,and his own maps showed that this was not so.see,at record.black voters were concentrated in the cities located at the north and south ends of the district and constituted a supermajority of democrats in the area covered by district.see part,supra.as long as the basic shape of the district was retained,moving democrats from areas outside but close to the old district boundaries naturally picked up far more black democrats than white democrats.
this explanation eluded ansolabehere because he refused to consider either the implications of the political strategy that the legislature claimed to have pursued or the effects of the changes to district on the surrounding districts.app.the result was a distorted and largely useless analysis.
reviewing the evidence outlined above two themes emerge.first,district borders and racial composition are readily explained by political considerations and the effects of the legislature political strategy on the demographics of district.second,the majority largely ignores this explanation,as did the court below,and instead adopts the most damning interpretation of all available evidence.
both of these analytical maneuvers violate our clearly established precedent.our cases say that we must exercise extraordinary caution where the state has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision,cromartie ii,supra,at emphasis deleted the majority ignores that political explanation.our cases say that the good faith of a state legislature must be presumed,miller,at the majority presumes the opposite.and cromartie ii held that plaintiffs in a case like this are obligated to produce a map showing that the legislature could have achieved its political objectives without the racial effect seen in the challenged plan here,the majority junks that rule and says that the plaintiffs failure to produce such a map simply does not matter.ante,at.
the judgment below regarding district should be reversed,and i therefore respectfully dissent.
a plaintiff succeeds at this stage even if the evidence reveals that a legislature elevated race to the predominant criterion in order to advance other goals,including political ones.see bush vera,plurality opinion holding that race predominated when a legislature deliberately spread the black population among several districts in an effort to protect democratic incumbents miller johnson,stating that the use of race as a proxy for political interest s is prohibit ed 
challenges to the constitutionality of congressional districts are heard by district courts,with a right of direct appeal to this court.see a.
the state argument to the contrary rests on a legal proposition that was foreclosed almost as soon as it was raised in this court.according to the state,racial considerations can not predominate in drawing district lines unless there is an actual conflict between those lines and traditional districting principles.brief for appellants.but we rejected that view earlier this term,holding that when as here race furnished the overriding reason for choosing one map over others,a further showing of inconsistency between the enacted plan and traditional redistricting criteria is unnecessary to a finding of racial predominance.virginia state bd.of elections,slip,at.and in any event,the evidence recounted in the text indicates that district boundaries did conflict with traditional districting principles for example,by splitting numerous counties and precincts.see supra,at.so we would uphold the district court finding of racial predominance even under the incorrect legal standard the state proposes.
in the district court,the parties also presented arguments relating to the first gingles prerequisite,contesting whether the community in the region was sufficiently large and compact to form a majority of a reasonably shaped district.the court chose not to decide that question.and aside from the state unelaborated assertion that t here is no question that the first factor was satisfied,brief for appellants,the parties have not briefed or argued the issue before us.we therefore have no occasion to address it.
north carolina calls our attention to two expert reports on voting patterns throughout the state,but neither casts light on the relevant issue.the first by thomas brunell showed that some elections in many of the state counties exhibited statistically significant racially polarized voting.app.the second by ray block found that in various elections across the state,white voters were noticeably less likely than black voters to support black candidates,at.from those data points themselves based only on past elections the experts opined to no one great surprise that in north carolina,as in most states,there are discernible,relationships between race and voting.but as the district court found,see harris mccrory,supp,mdnc,that generalized conclusion fails to meaningfully or indeed,at all address the relevant local question whether,in a new version of district created without a focus on race,black voters would encounter sufficient white to cancel their ability to elect representatives of their choice,gingles,at.and so the reports do not answer whether the legislature needed to boost district bvap to avoid potential liability.
justice alito charges us with ignor ing the state defense,making our analysis like hamlet without the prince.post,at opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part hereinafter dissent see post,at.but we simply take the state account for what it is one side of a thoroughly case and,as we will discuss,the side the district court rejected,primarily on factual grounds.by contrast,the dissent consistently treats the state version of events what it calls the legislature political strategy and the relationship between that strategy and district racial composition,post,at as if it were a simple fact of the matter the premise of,rather than a contested claim in,this case.see post,at.the dissent narrative thus tracks,and,the testimony of hofeller,the state star witness at trial so much so that the dissent could just have that portion of the transcript and saved itself a fair bit of trouble.compare post,at,with app.imagine to update the dissent theatrical reference inherit the wind retold solely from the perspective of william jennings bryan,with nary a thought given to the competing viewpoint of clarence darrow.
as earlier noted,that inquiry is satisfied when legislators have place d a significant number of voters within or without a district predominantly because of their race,regardless of their ultimate objective in taking that step.see supra,at,and.so,for example,if legislators use race as their predominant districting criterion with the end goal of advancing their partisan interests perhaps thinking that a proposed district is more sellable as a vra compliance measure than as a political gerrymander and will accomplish much the same thing their action still triggers strict scrutiny.see vera,at plurality opinion.in other words,the sorting of voters on the grounds of their race remains suspect even if race is meant to function as a proxy for other including political characteristics.see miller,at.
undeterred by these settled principles,the dissent undertakes to refind the facts of this case at every turn.see post,at.indeed,the dissent repeatedly flips the appropriate standard of review arguing,for example,that the district court is not the only plausible interpretation of one piece of contested evidence and that the state offered an entirely natural view of another.post,at,see also post,at.underlying that approach to the district court factfinding is an elemental error the dissent mistakes the rule that a legislature good faith should be presumed until a claimant makes a showing sufficient to support th e allegation of decisionmaking,miller,at,for a kind of,presumption on appeal,trumping review.see post,at.
the dissent contrary reading of the preclearance submission as reporting the redistricters decis ion not to construct district as a district,post,at is difficult to fathom.the language the dissent cites explains only why rucho and lewis rejected one particular way of creating such a district the submission then relates their alternative and,of course,successful approach to attaining an bvap.see app.
watt recalled that he laughed in response because the vra required no such target.see,at.and he told rucho that the community will laugh at you too.ibid.watt explained to rucho i getting percent of the vote in a percent black district.if you ramp my bvap to over percent,i probably get percent of the vote,and that not what the voting rights act was designed to do.ibid.
the court acknowledged that,in the earlier trial involving district,rucho denied making the comments that watt recalled.see supp,at.but the court explained that it could not assess the credibility of rucho contrary account because even though he was listed as a defense witness and present in the courtroom throughout the trial,the state chose not to put him on the witness stand,at.
the dissent conjures a different way of explaining watt testimony.perhaps,the dissent suggests,rucho disclosed a target to watt,but watt then changed rucho mind and perhaps it was just a coincidence or a mistake that rucho still created a bvap district.see post,at.but nothing in the record supports that hypothesis.see ibid.relying exclusively on the state preclearance submission to back up this story supra,at,and correcting the dissent misreading of that submission.and the state,lacking the dissent creativity,did not think to present it at trial.
the dissent charges that this comparison is misleading,but offers no good reason why that is so.see post,at.it is quite tr
