this appeal,from a criminal sentence imposed on an alien who illegally reentered the united states,requires that we address a question of first impression does the congressional endorsement of downward sentencing departures in conjunction with case processing violate the nondelegation doctrine we answer the question in the negative separately,we reject the defendant request for a booker remand on grounds of disparity in sentencing between defendants in jurisdictions and others.we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
the facts are not in dispute.dennis joel was convicted of the sale and transportation of cocaine in a california state court in and was deported to honduras in.he the united states illegally and was deported again in,this time to mexico.
in march,was arrested again,this time in new london,new hampshire,and charged with after deportation in violation of a.after his motion to suppress evidence was denied as moot,he pled guilty on august.faced to months in prison unless he qualified for a downward departure under the sentencing guidelines.
made three arguments in support of downward departure.the first two revolved around the authority of the attorney general to authorize in certain jurisdictions procedures to speed criminal immigration cases through the system,and the concomitant congressional authorization of and instruction to the sentencing commission to provide for downward departures to defendants in such programs in exchange for their waiver of procedural rights.
programs have been adopted by individual united states attorneys and authorized by the attorney general in some federal jurisdictions but not all,and not in new hampshire.seizing on this fact,first argued that he faced a longer sentence than similarly situated defendants elsewhere in the country.this disparity,he argued,had not been adequately taken into consideration in formulating the sentencing guidelines,and thus the district court could rely on it to depart downward.second,argued that congress violated the nondelegation doctrine by conferring too much discretion on the attorney general to decide when and where to implement procedures.finally,he argued that he should receive an additional downward departure pursuant to sentencing guidelines manual permitting departure for mitigating circumstances not taken into account in the guidelines he stated that his home in honduras had been destroyed in a hurricane and that he had been working as a laborer in new hampshire to support his wife and children.
the district court rejected arguments,but it granted his request for a departure.it sentenced him on november,to a term of months imprisonment,to be followed by three years of supervised release.timely appealed,challenging the rejection of his sentencing claims and asking for a booker remand.
since both of claims on appeal revolve around sentencing,we begin with a brief explanation of the procedure and its provenance.
sentencing originated not with congress,but with federal prosecutors in states bordering mexico.see middleton,to disparity how federal sentencing policies along the southwest border are undermining the sentencing guidelines and violating equal protection,utah.faced with a burgeoning load of illegal and other immigration cases,federal prosecutors in texas,new mexico,arizona,and california adopted policies designed to speed case processing.id.in the typical system,defendants who agreed to plead guilty at an early stage,and to waive their rights to file motions and to appeal,were rewarded with shorter sentences,either via or promises of a recommendation for departure at sentencing.id.at.
in,congress endorsed the concept in a provision of the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act protect act,stat.codified in scattered sections of,and.the applicable provision,m b the protect act provision,instructed the united states sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney.stat.at.pursuant to this dictate,the sentencing commission added a new guidelines provision,effective october,authorizing the departure.see permitting departure and using the same language as the protect act provision.
meanwhile,on september,general john ashcroft issued a memorandum the ashcroft memorandum explaining the circumstances under which he would authorize a program.the memorandum stated,inter alia,that programs would receive the attorney general authorization where the district confronts an exceptionally large number of a specific class of offenses within the district or where the district confronts some other exceptional local circumstance with respect to a specific class of cases that justifies expedited disposition.memorandum from john ashcroft,attorney general,to united states attorneys,setting forth department principles for implementing an expedited disposition or prosecution program in a district,reprinted in fed.sent.
where the programs have been authorized by the attorney general and implemented,the defendant must agree to the factual basis of the criminal charge and waive the rights to file pretrial motions,to appeal,and to seek collateral relief except for ineffective assistance of counsel.united states,cir citing the ashcroft memorandum.as of the date of prosecution and sentencing,such programs had been authorized in various districts new hampshire was not among them.
a.the nondelegation argument 
focuses on appeal on his constitutional attack on the system he argues that by virtue of the protect act provision,congress delegated excessive legislative power to the attorney general to decide when districts may install systems and when they may not.as support for this argument,points us to the attorney general criteria for authorizing programs.he argues that the terms exceptionally large number and exceptional local circumstance are so vague and subjective that they exacerbate the excessive delegation problem created by the protect act provision.we disagree.on these facts,we find that no delegation exists at all,and therefore that the constitutional limits on congress power to delegate could not have been transgressed.
nondelegation principles 
the nondelegation doctrine is rooted in the principle of separation of powers that underlies our tripartite system of government.mistretta united states,d rejecting delegation challenge to the guidelines system.because the constitution states that all federal legislative power shall be vested in a congress of the united states,const.art.i,the supreme court long ha s insisted that the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution mandate that congress generally can not delegate its legislative power to another branch.mistretta,at.quoting field clark.the court,however,also has recognized that this principle do es not prevent congress from obtaining the assistance of its coordinate branches,id.at,and that how it may go about obtaining that assistance in a particular case must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the government,id.quoting hampton,united states.the court developed the following rule so long as congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform,such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.id.quoting hampton,at.alteration in the original.
two details of the nondelegation jurisprudence are worthy of note.first,the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.in other words,if congress delegates a relatively narrow task,it need not cabin the actor discretion as to how to accomplish that task,whereas if it delegates a broad example,setting national air quality must provide substantial guidance.id.second,the nondelegation principle is extraordinar
