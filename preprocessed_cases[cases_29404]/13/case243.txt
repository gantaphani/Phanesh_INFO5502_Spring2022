title bans the broadcast of any obscene,indecent,or profane language.the federal communications commission commission began enforcing in the.in fcc foundation,this court found that the commission order banning george carlin filthy words monologue passed first amendment scrutiny,but did not decide whether an occasional expletive would justify any sanction,at.in the ensuing years,the commission went from strictly observing the narrow circumstances of pacifica to indicating that it would assess the full context of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than limit its regulation to an index of indecent words or pictures.however,it continued to note the important difference between isolated and repeated broadcasts of indecent material.and in a policy statement,it even included,as one of the factors significant to the determination of what was patently offensive,whether the material dwells on or repeats at length the offending description or depiction.
it was against this regulatory background that the three incidents at issue took place.two concern isolated utterances of obscene words during two live broadcasts aired by respondent fox television stations.the third occurred during an episode of a television show broadcast by respondent abc television network,when the nude buttocks of an adult female character were shown for approximately seven seconds and the side of her breast for a moment.after these incidents,but before the commission issued notices of apparent liability to fox and abc,the commission issued its golden globes order,declaring for the first time that fleeting expletives could be actionable.it then concluded that the fox and abc broadcasts violated this new standard.it found the fox broadcasts indecent,but declined to propose forfeitures.the second circuit reversed,finding the commission decision to modify its indecency enforcement regime to regulate fleeting expletives arbitrary and capricious.this court reversed and remanded for the second circuit to address respondents first amendment challenges.fcc fox television stations.on remand,the second circuit found the policy unconstitutionally vague and invalidated it in its entirety.in the abc case,the commission found the display actionably indecent,and imposed a forfeiture on each of the stations that aired the episode.the second circuit vacated the order in light of its fox decision.
held because the commission failed to give fox or abc fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent,the commission standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague.
a the fundamental principle that laws regulating persons or entities must give fair notice of what conduct is required or proscribed,see,connally general constr,is essential to the protections provided by the fifth amendment due process clause,see united states williams,which requires the invalidation of impermissibly vague laws.a conviction or punishment fails to comply with due process if the statute or regulation under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.ibid.the void for vagueness doctrine addresses at least two connected but discrete due process concerns regulated parties should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly and precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.when speech is involved,rigorous adherence to those requirements is necessary to ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech.
b these concerns are implicated here,where the broadcasters claim that the lengthy procedural history of their cases shows that they did not have fair notice of what was forbidden.under the guidelines in force when the broadcasts occurred,a key consideration was whether the material dwell ed on or repeat ed at length the offending description or depiction,but in the golden globes order,issued after the broadcasts,the commission changed course and held that fleeting expletives could be a statutory violation.it then applied this new principle to these cases.its lack of notice to fox and abc of its changed interpretation failed to give them fair notice of what is prohibited.williams,supra,at.
c neither of the government contrary arguments is persuasive.it claims that fox can not establish unconstitutional vagueness because the commission declined to impose a forfeiture on fox and said that it would not consider the indecent broadcast in renewing station licenses or in other contexts.but the commission has the statutory power to take into account any history of prior offenses when setting a forfeiture penalty,b e,and the due process protection against vague regulations does not leave regulated parties at the mercy of noblesse oblige.united states stevens.the challenged orders could also have an adverse impact on fox reputation with audiences and advertisers alike.
the government argues that abc had notice that its broadcast would be considered indecent.but an isolated statement in a commission decision declaring that televising nudes might be contrary to does not suffice for the fair notice required when the government intends to impose over a million fine for allegedly impermissible speech.moreover,previous commission decisions had declined to find isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably indecent.in light of these agency decisions,and the absence of any notice in the guidance that seven seconds of nude buttocks would be found indecent,abc lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to being sanctioned.
d it is necessary to make three observations about this decision scope.first,because the court resolves these cases on fair notice grounds under the due process clause,it need not address the first amendment implications of the commission indecency policy or reconsider pacifica at this time.second,because the court rules that fox and abc lacked notice at the time of their broadcasts that their material could be found actionably indecent under policies,the court need not address the constitutionality of the current indecency policy as expressed in the golden globes order and subsequent adjudications.third,this opinion leaves the commission free to modify its current indecency policy in light of its determination of the public interest and applicable legal requirements and leaves courts free to review the current,or any modified,policy in light of its content and application.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
in fcc fox television stations,fox i,the court held that the federal communication commission decision to modify its indecency enforcement regime to regulate fleeting expletives was neither arbitrary nor capricious.the court then declined to address the constitutionality of the policy,however,because the united states court of appeals for the second circuit had yet to do so.on remand,the court of appeals found the policy was vague and,as a result,unconstitutional.the case now returns to this court for decision upon the constitutional question.
in fox i,the court described both the regulatory framework through which the commission regulates broadcast indecency and the long procedural history of this case.the court need not repeat all that history,but some preliminary discussion is necessary to understand the constitutional issue the case now presents.
title provides that w hoever utters any obscene,indecent,or profane language by means of radio communication shall be fined or imprisoned not more than two years,or both.the federal commission commission has been instructed by congress to enforce between the hours of and,see public telecommunications act of,a,stat,note following,broadcasting of indecent programming.and the commission has applied its regulations to radio and television broadcasters alike,see fox i,supra,at see also cfr commission regulation prohibiting the broadcast of any obscene material or any indecent material between and.although the commission has had the authority to regulate indecent broadcasts under since and its commission,the federal radio commission,since,it did not begin to enforce until the.see campbell,pacifica reconsidered implications for the current controversy over broadcast indecency,fed.com.
this court first reviewed the commission indecency policy in fcc pacifica foundation.in pacifica,the commission determined that george carlin filthy words monologue was indecent.it contained language that describes,in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium,sexual or excretory activities and organs,at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.at quoting.this court upheld the commission ruling.the broadcaster statutory challenge was rejected.the court held the commission was not engaged in impermissible censorship within the meaning of ed,see,at,and that definition of indecency was not confined to speech with an appeal to the prurient interest,see,at.finding no first amendment violation,the decision explained the constitutional standard under which regulations of broadcasters are assessed.it observed that broadcast media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all americans,at,and that broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children,even those too young to read,at.in light of these considerations,broadcasting has received the most limited first amendment protection.at.under this standard the commission order passed constitutional scrutiny.the court did note the narrowness of its holding,explaining that it was not deciding whether an occasional expletive would justify any sanction.at see also,at powell,concurring in part and concurring in judgment c ertainly the court holding does not speak to cases involving the isolated use of a potentially offensive word in the course of a radio broadcast,as distinguished from the verbal shock treatment administered by respondent here 
from to,the commission did not go beyond the narrow circumstances of pacifica and brought no indecency enforcement actions.see in re infinity broadcasting,fcc rcd.see also in re application of wgbh educ.foundation,commission declaring it intend s strictly to observe the narrowness of the pacifica holding recognizing that pacifica provided no general prerogative to intervene in any case where words similar or identical to those in pacifica are broadcast over a licensed radio or television station,the commission distinguished between the repetitive occurrence of the indecent words such as in the carlin monologue and an isolated or occasional expletive,that would not necessarily be actionable,at.
in,the commission determined it was applying the pacifica standard in too narrow a way.it stated that in later cases its definition of indecent language would appropriately includ e a broader range of material than the seven specific words at issue in the carlin monologue.in re pacifica foundation,fcc rcd.thus,the commission indicated it would use the generic definition of indecency articulated in its pacifica order,infinity order,fcc,at,and assess the full context of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than limiting its regulation to a comprehensive index of indecent words or pictorial depictions,at.
even under this context based approach,the commission continued to note the important difference between isolated and repeated broadcasts of indecent material.see ibid.considering variables in determining whether material is patently offensive including whether allegedly offensive material is isolated or fleeting in the context of expletives,the commission determined deliberate and repetitive use in a patently offensive manner is a requisite to a finding of indecency.pacifica order,fcc,at.for speech involving the description or depiction of sexual or excretory functions t he mere fact that specific words or phrases are not repeated does not mandate a finding that material that is otherwise patently offensive is not indecent.ibid.
in,the commission issued a policy statement intended to provide guidance to the broadcast industry regarding its caselaw interpreting and its enforcement policies with respect to broadcast indecency.in re industry guidance on commission case law interpreting and enforcement policies regarding broadcast indecency,fcc rcd.in that document the commission restated that for material to be indecent it must depict sexual or excretory organs or activities and be patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium,at.describing the framework of what it considered patently offensive,the commission explained that three factors had proved significant 
t he explicitness or graphic nature of the description or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or activities whether the material dwells on or repeats at length descriptions of sexual or excretory organs or activities whether the material appears to pander or is used to titillate,or whether the material appears to have been presented for its shock value.at emphasis deleted.
as regards the second of these factors,the commission explained that r epetition of and persistent focus on sexual or excretory material have been cited consistently as factors that exacerbate the potential offensiveness of broadcasts.in contrast,where sexual or excretory references have been made once or have been passing or fleeting in nature,this characteristic has tended to weigh against a finding of indecency.at.the commission then gave examples of material that was not found indecent because it was fleeting and isolated,at citing,communications of south carolina,wybb fm,fcc rcd.mmb finding a fleeting and isolated utterance in the context of live and spontaneous programming not actionable,and contrasted it with fleeting references that were found patently offensive in light of other factors,fcc,at citing,tempe radio,fcc rcd.mmb finding fleeting language that clearly refers to sexual activity with a child to be patently offensive.
it was against this regulatory background that the three incidents of alleged indecency at issue here took place.first,in the billboard music awards,broadcast by respondent fox television stations,the singer cher exclaimed during an unscripted acceptance speech i also had my critics for the last years saying that i was on my way out every year.right.so f.at.second,fox broadcast the billboard music awards again in.there,a person named nicole richie made the following unscripted remark while presenting an award have you ever tried to get cow s out of a prada purse it not so f ing simple.ibid.the third involved an episode of nypd blue,a regular show broadcast by respondent abc television network.the episode broadcast on february,showed the nude buttocks of an adult female character for approximately seven seconds and for a moment the side of her breast.during the scene,in which the character was preparing to take a shower,a child portraying her son entered the bathroom.a moment of awkwardness followed.fed.appx.the commission received indecency complaints about all three broadcasts.see fox i,at fed,at.
after these incidents,but before the commission issued notices of apparent liability to fox and abc,the commission issued a decision sanctioning nbc for a comment made by the singer bono during the golden globe awards.upon winning the award for best original song,bono exclaimed this is really,really,f ing brilliant.really,really great.in re complaints against various broadcast licensees regarding their airing of the golden globe awards program,fcc rcd,golden globes order.reversing a decision by its enforcement bureau,the commission found the use of the actionably indecent,at.the commission held that the word was one of the most,graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the english language,and thus found any use of that word or a variation,in any context,inherently has a connotation.at.turning to the isolated nature of the expletive,the commission reversed prior rulings that had found fleeting expletives not indecent.the commission held the mere fact that specific words or phrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate a finding that material that is otherwise patently offensive to the broadcast medium is not indecent.at see also,at just as the court in pacifica held that the george carlin routine could have enlarged a child vocabulary in an instant,we believe that even isolated broadcasts of the in situations such as that here could do so as well 
even though the incidents at issue in these cases took place before the golden globes order,the commission applied its new policy regarding fleeting expletives and fleeting nudity.it found the broadcasts by respondents fox and abc to be in violation of this standard.
as to fox,the commission found the two billboard awards broadcasts indecent in in re complaints regarding various television broadcasts between february,and march,fcc rcd.numerous parties petitioned for a review of the order in the united states court of appeals for the second circuit.the court of appeals granted the commission request for a voluntary remand so that it could respond to the parties objections.fox television stations,fcc.in its remand order,the commission applied its tripartite definition of patently offensive material from its order and found that both broadcasts fell well within its scope.see in re complaints regarding various television broadcasts between february,and march,fcc rcd.remand order see also fox i,supra,at discussing in detail the commission findings.as pertains to the constitutional issue in these cases,the commission noted that under the policy clarified in the golden globes order,categorically requiring repeated use of expletives in order to find material indecent is inconsistent with our general approach to indecency enforcement.remand order,fcc,at see also,at u nder our golden globe precedent,the fact that cher used the once does not remove her comment from the realm of actionable indecency though the commission deemed fox should have known nicole richie comments were actionably indecent even prior to the golden globes order,fcc,at,it declined to propose a forfeiture in light of the limited nature of the circuit remand,at.the commission acknowledged that it was not apparent that fox could be penalized for cher comment at the time it was broadcast.and so,as in the golden globes case it imposed no penalty for that broadcast,at.
fox and various intervenors returned to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit,raising,statutory,and constitutional challenges to the commission indecency regulations.see fox television stations,fcc.in a decision,with judge leval dissenting,the court of appeals found the remand order arbitrary and capricious because the fcc has made a turn regarding its treatment of fleeting expletives without providing a reasoned explanation justifying the.at.while noting its skepticism as to whether the commission fleeting expletive regime would pass constitutional muster,the court of appeals found it unnecessary to the issue,at.
the case came here on certiorari.citing the administrative procedure act,et,this court noted that the judiciary may set aside agency action that is arbitrary or capricious.in the context of a change in policy such as the commission determination that fleeting expletives could be indecent,the decision held an agency,in the ordinary course,should acknowledge that it is in fact changing its position and show that there are good reasons for the new policy.fox i,at.there is no need,however,for an agency to provide detailed justifications for every change or to show that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one.ibid.
judged under this standard,the court in fox i found the commission new indecency enforcement policy neither arbitrary nor capricious,at.the court noted the commission had acknowledged breaking new ground in ruling that fleeting and nonliteral expletives could be indecent under the controlling standards the court concluded the agency reasons for expanding the scope of its enforcement activity were rational.ibid.not only was it certainly reasonable to determine that it made no sense to distinguish between literal and nonliteral uses of offensive words,but the court agreed that the commission decision to look at the patent offensiveness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with the approach approved in pacifica.ibid.given that e ven isolated utterances can constitute harmful first blow s to children,the court held that the commission could decide it needed to step away from its old regime where nonrepetitive use of an expletive was per se nonactionable.at.having found the agency action to be neither arbitrary nor capricious,the court remanded for the court of appeals to address respondents first amendment challenges,at.
on remand from fox i,the court of appeals held the commission indecency policy unconstitutionally vague and invalidated it in its entirety,at.the court of appeals found the policy,as expressed in the guidance and subsequent commission decisions,failed to give broadcasters sufficient notice of what would be considered indecent.surveying a number of commission adjudications,the court found the commission was inconsistent as to which words it deemed patently offensive.see,at.it also determined that the presumptive prohibition on the and the was plagued by vagueness because the commission had on occasion found the fleeting use of those words not indecent provided they occurred during a bona fide news interview or were demonstrably essential to the nature of an artistic or educational work.at internal quotation marks omitted.the commission application of these exceptions,according to the court of appeals,left broadcasters guessing whether an expletive would be deemed artistically integral to a program or whether a particular broadcast would be considered a bona fide news interview.the court of appeals found the vagueness in the policy had forced broadcasters to choose between not airing controversial programs or risking massive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses.at.and the court found that there was ample evidence in the record that this harsh choice had led to a chill of protected speech.ibid.
the procedural history regarding abc is more brief.on february,the commission issued a forfeiture order finding the display of the woman nude buttocks in nypd blue was actionably indecent.see in re complaints against various television licensees concerning their february,broadcast of the program nypd blue fcc rcd.the commission determined that,regardless of medical definitions,displays of buttocks fell within the category of displays of sexual or excretory organs because the depiction was widely associated with sexual arousal and closely associated by most people with excretory activities.at.the scene was deemed patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,and the commission determined that t he female actor nudity is presented in a manner that clearly panders to and titillates the audience,at.unlike in the fox case,the commission imposed a forfeiture of on each of the stations that aired the indecent episode.in a summary order the united states court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the forfeiture order,determining that it was bound by its fox decision striking down the
