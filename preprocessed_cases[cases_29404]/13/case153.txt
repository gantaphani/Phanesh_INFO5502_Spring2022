petitioner sandifer and others filed a putative collective action under the fair labor standards act of,seeking backpay for time spent donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert respondent united states steel corporation requires workers to wear because of hazards at its steel plants.steel contends that this time,which would otherwise be compensable under the act,is noncompensable under a provision of its agreement with petitioners union.that provision validity depends on o,which allows parties to collectively bargain over whether time spent in changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday must be compensated.the district court granted steel summary judgment in pertinent part,holding that petitioners donning and doffing constituted changing clothes under o.it also assumed that any time spent donning and doffing items that were not clothes was de minimis and hence noncompensable.the seventh circuit affirmed.
held the time petitioners spend donning and doffing their protective gear is not compensable by operation of o.
a this court initially construed compensability under the fair labor standards act expansively.see,anderson clemens pottery.the act was amended in,however,to provide that the compensability of time spent changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday is a subject appropriately committed to collective bargaining,o.whether petitioners donning and doffing qualifies as changing clothes depends on the meaning of that statutory phrase.
b the term clothes,which is otherwise undefined,is interpreted as taking its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states.in dictionaries from the era of o enactment,clothes denotes items that are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress.nothing in o text or context suggests anything other than this ordinary meaning.there is no basis for petitioners proposition that the unmodified term clothes somehow omits protective clothing.section o exception applies only when the changing of clothes is an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed,steiner mitchell,and thus otherwise compensable under the act.see a.and protective gear is the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations,such as butchers and longshoremen.petitioners position is also incompatible with the historical context of o passage,contradicting contemporaneous labor department regulations and dictum in steiner,see,at.the interpretation adopted here leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items that are not clothes,such as some equipment and devices.the view of respondent and its amici that clothes encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual foundation.
c while the normal meaning of changing clothes connotes substitution,changing also carried the meaning to alter at the time of o enactment.the broader statutory context makes plain that time spent in changing clothes includes time spent in altering dress.whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely personal choice,and o should not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will when another reading is textually permissible.
d applying these principles here,it is evident that the donning and doffing in this case qualifies as changing clothes under o.of the items at issue,only safety glasses,earplugs,and a respirator do not fit within the elaborated interpretation of clothes.apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the minutes spent and washing from the minutes devoted to other activities during the relevant period,some courts of appeals have invoked the doctrine de minimis non curat lex the law does not take account of trifles.but that doctrine does not fit comfortably within this statute,which is all about trifles.a more appropriate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue can,on the whole,be fairly characterized as time spent in changing clothes or washing.if an employee devotes the vast majority of that time to putting on and off equipment or other items,the entire period would not qualify as time spent in changing clothes under o,even if some clothes items were also donned and doffed.but if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and doffing clothes as defined here,the entire period qualifies,and the time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.here,the seventh circuit agreed with the district court conclusion that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs was minimal.and this court is disinclined to disturb the district court additional factual finding,not addressed by the seventh circuit,that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during the normal workday and thus fell beyond o scope.

clifton sandifer,et,petitioners united states steel corporation 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
the question before us is the meaning of the phrase changing clothes as it appears in the fair labor standards act of,stat,as amended,et ed.and supp.v.
facts and procedural history 
petitioner clifton sandifer,among others,filed suit under the fair labor standards act against respondent united states steel corporation in the district court for the northern district of indiana.the plaintiffs in this putative collective action are a group of current or former employees of respondent steelmaking facilities as relevant here,they seek backpay for time spent donning and doffing various pieces of protective gear.petitioners assert that respondent requires workers to wear all of the items because of hazards regularly encountered in steel plants.
petitioners point specifically to of what they state are the most common kinds of required protective gear a jacket,pair of pants,and hood a hardhat a snood wristlets work gloves leggings metatarsal boots safety glasses earplugs and a respirator at bottom,petitioners want to be paid for the time they have spent putting on and taking off those objects.in the aggregate,the amount of time and thus money involved is likely to be quite large.because this time would otherwise be compensable under the act,steel contention of noncompensability stands or falls upon the validity of a provision of its agreement with petitioners union,which says that this time is noncompensable the validity of that provision depends,in turn,upon the applicability of o to the time at issue.that subsection allows parties to decide,as part of a agreement,that time spent in changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday is noncompensable.
the district court granted summary judgment in pertinent part to steel,holding that donning and doffing the protective gear constituted changing clothes within the meaning of o.rm,wl,nd.the district court further assumed that even if certain items the hardhat,glasses,and earplugs were not clothes,the time spent donning and doffing them was de minimis and hence noncompensable,at.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit upheld those conclusions,
we granted certiorari,and now affirm.
ii.legal background 
the fair labor standards act,enacted in,governs minimum wages and maximum hours for employees who in any workweek are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,or are employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.a minimum wages a maximum hours see exemptions.the act provides that employee generally means any individual employed by an employer,e,and,in turn,provides that to employ is to suffer or permit to work,g.
the act did not,however,define the key terms work and workweek an omission that soon let loose a landslide of litigation.see ibp,alvarez.this court gave those terms a broad reading,culminating in its holding in anderson clemens pottery,that the statutory workweek includes all time during which an employee is necessarily required to be on the employer premises,on duty or at a prescribed workplace.at.that period,anderson explained,encompassed time spent pursu ing certain preliminary activities after arriving,such as putting on aprons and overalls and removing shirts.at.these activities,the court declared,are clearly work under the act,at.
organized labor seized on the court expansive construction of compensability by filing what became known as portal actions a reference to the portals or entrances to mines,at which workers put on their gear.portal pay suits exceed a billion,announced a newspaper headline in late.times.stating that the fair labor standards act had been interpreted judicially in disregard of customs,practices,and contracts between employers and employees,congress responded by passing the act of,stat,as amended,et ed.and supp.v.a.
the act limited the scope of employers liability in various ways.as relevant here,it excluded from mandatorily compensable time 
activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to the principal activity or activities that an employee is employed to perform,which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences,or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases,such principal activity or activities.stat,a.
the department of labor promulgated a regulation explaining that the act did not alter what is known as the continuous workday rule,under which compensable time comprises the period between the commencement and completion on the same workday of an employee principal activity or activities,whether or not the employee engages in work throughout all of that period.fed.reg.cfr b.of particular importance to this case,a labor department interpretive bulletin also specified that whereas changing clothes and washing up or showering would be considered preliminary or postliminary activities when performed outside the workday and under the conditions normally present,those same activities may in certain situations be so directly related to the specific work the employee is employed to perform that they would be regarded as an integral part of the employee principal activity.fed.reg,and cfr,and.
in,congress amended the fair labor standards act to address the conduct discussed in that interpretive bulletin changing clothes and washing by adding the provision presently at issue 
hours worked.in determining for the purposes of the and sections of this title the hours for which an employee is employed,there shall be excluded any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide agreement applicable to the particular employee.stat,o.
simply put,the statute provides that the compensability of time spent changing clothes or washing is a subject appropriately committed to collective bargaining.
in steiner mitchell,the court echoed the labor department regulations by holding that changing clothes and showering can,under some circumstances,be considered an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed,reasoning that o clear ly impli ed as much,at.and in ibp,we applied steiner to treat as compensable the donning and doffing of protective gear somewhat similar to that at issue here,at.we said that any activity that is integral and indispensable to a principal activity is itself a principal activity under a,at.
as relevant to the question before us,steel does not dispute the seventh circuit conclusion that h ad the time in this case not been rendered noncompensable pursuant to o,it would have been a principal activity.at.petitioners,however,quarrel with the premise,arguing that the donning and doffing of protective gear does not qualify as changing clothes.
iii.analysis 
we begin by examining the meaning of the word clothes.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.perrin united states.
dictionaries from the era of o enactment indicate that clothes denotes items that are both designed and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of dress.see webster new international dictionary of the english language ed.webster second defining clothes as c overing for the human body dress vestments vesture see also,oxford english dictionary defining clothes as c overing for the person wearing apparel dress,raiment,vesture that is what we hold to be the meaning of the word as used in o.although a statute may make a departure from the natural and popular acceptation of language,greenleaf goodrich,citing maillard lawrence,how,nothing in the text or context of o suggests anything other than the ordinary meaning of clothes.
petitioners argue that the word clothes is too indeterminate to be ascribed any general meaning but that,whatever it includes,it necessarily excludes items designed and used to protect against workplace hazards.that position creates a distinction between protection,on the one hand,and decency or comfort,on the other a distinction that petitioners appear to have derived from webster second,which elaborates that clothes is a general term for whatever covering is worn,or is made to be worn,for decency or comfort.webster second emphasis added.but that definition does not exclude,either explicitly or implicitly,items with a protective function,since protection and comfort are not incompatible,and are often synonymous.a parasol protects against the sun,enhancing the comfort of the bearer just as work gloves protect against scrapes and cuts,enhancing the comfort of the wearer.petitioners further assert that protective items of apparel are referred to as clothing rather than clothes.they point out that,when introduced by the adjective protective,the noun clothing is used more commonly than clothes.that is true enough,but it seems to us explained by euphonic preference rather than difference in meaning.we see no basis for the proposition that the unmodified term clothes somehow omits protective clothing.
petitioners proffered distinction,moreover,runs the risk of reducing o to near nothingness.the statutory compensation requirement to which o provides an exception embraces the changing of clothes only when that conduct constitutes an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed.steiner,at.but protective gear is the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to the work of factory workers,butchers,longshoremen,and a host of other occupations.petitioners definition of clothes would largely limit the application of o to what might be called workers costumes,worn by such employees as waiters,doormen,and train conductors.petitioners insist that their definition excludes only items with some specific protective function,but that limitation essentially abandons the assertion that clothes are for decency or comfort,leaving no basis whatever for the distinction.
petitioners position is also incompatible with the historical context surrounding o passage,since it flatly contradicts an illustration provided by the labor department regulations to show how changing clothes could be intimately related to a principal activity.see cfr,and.those regulations cited the situation in which an employee in a chemical plant can not perform his job without putting on certain clothes and specified that s uch a situation may exist where the c
