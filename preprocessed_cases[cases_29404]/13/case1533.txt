richard dunne and christopher mcpartland,suffolk county assistant district attorneys,and peter kelleher,a suffolk county detective,appeal from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york joanna seybert,judge,denying their motion to dismiss,on the ground of absolute prosecutorial immunity,the complaint of,michael bernard,ronald kluesener,and douglas jacob,filed pursuant to.plaintiffs accuse defendants of misusing and conspiring to misuse their public offices and the judicial process for political purposes by investigating and prosecuting plaintiffs without probable cause.accepting these allegations as true,as it was obliged to do on consideration of a motion to dismiss,the district court denied dismissal,holding that defendants alleged political motivation removed their conduct from the scope of activities shielded by absolute immunity.we reverse with respect to the denial of absolute immunity for advocative functions,reiterating what this court has held in other cases as long as a prosecutor acts with colorable authority,absolute immunity shields his performance of advocative functions regardless of motivation.we remand the case to the district court so that it can enter an order dismissing plaintiffs claims of advocative misconduct,specifically their claims for malicious and selective prosecution,as well as for misconduct in the presentation of evidence to grand juries.
plaintiffs submit that defendants nevertheless are not entitled to dismissal of the entire complaint on remand because it further pleads defendants misconduct in their performance of investigative functions,for which absolute immunity provides no shield.defendants do not claim absolute immunity for investigative functions instead,they submit that plaintiffs pleadings fail to state a claim for investigative misconduct.this court declines to exercise pendent interlocutory jurisdiction over the issue.instead,we dismiss this part of the appeal without prejudice to the parties pursuing the matter further on remand.
background 
on august,the date this suit was filed,all of the plaintiffs were registered democrats who had been appointed to various official positions in the town of babylon by the democratic town supervisor richard schaffer michael bernard was the town commissioner of buildings and grounds,ronald kluesener served as commissioner of environmental control,and douglas jacob was director of finance and town comptroller.in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendant suffolk county,as well as individual defendants,suffolk county district attorney james catterson,assistant district attorneys richard dunne and christopher mcpartland,and suffolk county police detective peter kelleher,all republicans,misused their law enforcement authority and the judicial process to pursue a series of politically motivated investigations and indictments without probable cause in a failed effort to discredit babylon democratic leaders.plaintiffs allege that by naming them in three such indictments,defendants subjected them to malicious and selective prosecution in violation of their constitutional rights.we review the specific misconduct alleged in connection with these three indictments.
a.the march,indictment 
on march,at the request of defendants dunne and mcpartland,a suffolk county grand jury returned an indictment against plaintiffs bernard and kluesener,charging them with three counts of offering a false instrument for filing and three counts of falsifying business records.kluesener stood trial and,on january,a petit jury acquitted him on all charges.on august,the court dismissed all charges against bernard.
plaintiffs allege that defendants pursued the indictment for political purposes,that they never possessed probable cause to support the counts charged,and that,throughout the investigation of the case,they were aware that inculpatory evidence was manufactured contrived at the same time that they disregarded exculpatory evidence.complaint at.in support of these allegations,plaintiffs assert that certain identified by to conceal their political animosity toward plaintiffs and the schaffer administration by misrepresenting to the public,the press,and the court that the prosecution had its origins in a referral to the district attorney office from the new york state comptroller.
they further allege that on march,the day before the indictment was filed,when kluesener was interviewed at his home by defendant kelleher and other investigators of the district attorney office and proffered documentary evidence demonstrating his innocence,kelleher summarily dismissed the proffer stating that district attorney catterson was determined to get town supervisor schaffer through kluesener.id.at.similarly,in a november conversation,suffolk county republican leader john powell allegedly told plaintiff bernard that his indictment was politically motivated and that the district attorney office was pursuing a witch hunt to get schaffer.id.at.
b.the march,indictment 
on march,defendants dunne and mcpartland procured a second indictment from the grand jury charging defendants kluesener and jacob with grand larceny,falsifying business records,conspiracy,and several counts of official misconduct.following a jury trial,both defendants were acquitted of all charges.
once again,plaintiffs assert that defendants sole motive in pursuing these charges was to damage the babylon democratic leadership.toward that end,a member of the district attorney office apparently not any of the named with republican leader powell and solicited his assistance in securing a witness who could testify against kluesener and jacob.powell and the unidentified member of the district attorney office thereafter met secretly with dominick testa,who did,in fact,testify against plaintiffs,and who subsequently admitted that he embellished his testimony because it was what powell and a member of the district attorney office wanted,because they were on a witch hunt for schaffer.id.at.indeed,plaintiffs allege that testa stated that he perjured himself because powell and defendants wanted to hammer schaffer.id.
plaintiffs do not identify the defendants referenced by testa.the only allegations naming a specific defendant concern dunne.the complaint alleges that on numerous occasions during the investigation of the case and prior to criminal charges,defendant dunne met with testa at sites outside the district attorney office,including a landfill,a donut shop,and a shopping mall.plaintiffs do not suggest that dunne himself induced or even encouraged testa to commit perjury at any of these meetings.rather,the complaint alleges that dunne was aware that testa had met with powell and with a member of the district attorney office to create testimony,that he nevertheless subpoenaed testa to testify before the grand jury,that he concealed from the grand jury the fact of the witness meetings with powell,and that on information and belief dunne suborned testa perjury before the grand jury.id.at.
c.the july,indictment 
on july,defendants again not identified by a third indictment,this time charging plaintiff jacob with receiving a bribe,receiving a reward for official misconduct,conspiracy,and two counts of official misconduct.plaintiffs assert that throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case,defendants never had any evidence to support a bribery charge their sole purpose was to secure a politically embarrassing indictment.upon information and belief,plaintiffs charge that unidentified defendants coerced and threatened witness james rogers to testify against jacob.id.at.when rogers refused to testify at trial,defendants were obliged to dismiss the indictment.
further,as evidence of selective prosecution,plaintiffs allege,upon information and belief,that defendants decided not to prosecute another person implicated in a bribery scheme because his political ties were republican rather than democratic.id.at.
d.the charged causes of action 
plaintiffs complaint pleads seven causes of action,the first three pursuant to,the last four under state law.
the first federal claim sweeps broadly,charging defendants with violating plaintiffs rights under the fourteenth amendment to be secure in their persons,to be free from punishment without due process and equal protection of laws,and further to be free from conspirators sic to violate their rights under the fourteenth amendment.id.at.the district court construed the claim as one for malicious and selective prosecution.see bernard county of suffolk,cv,at.
plaintiffs second claim,for conspiracy,charged a scheme to injure babylon democrats through the use of unfounded and improper investigations and criminal charges.complaint at.the district court similarly construed the conspiracy claim to focus on defendants alleged malicious and selective prosecution of plaintiffs drawing all inferences in the plaintiffs favor,the complaint alleges that the defendants conspired together and with other state actors in order to prosecute the plaintiffs for their own personal purposes.bernard county of suffolk,cv,at.
the third federal claim charges defendants with abusing their prosecutorial power for improper political purposes in violation of plaintiffs right to substantive due process.complaint at.
plaintiffs state law claims all sound in tort three claims for malicious prosecution and one claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.at.
defendants motions to dismiss the complaint 
by motion dated january,catterson,dunne,mcpartland,and kelleher moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs federal claims were barred by the eleventh amendment and absolute prosecutorial immunity,and that the court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims.defendants further argued for dismissal because plaintiffs failed to state cognizable claims for a violation of substantive due process,b violation of equal protection,and c intentional infliction of emotional distress.defendants also invoked common law immunity in urging dismissal of plaintiffs state law malicious prosecution claims.
by motion dated february,suffolk county similarly moved to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint failed to plead the municipal custom or policy necessary to state a claim under and that its conspiracy claim was barred by the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine.
in a detailed memorandum decision dated september,the district court granted defendants motions in part and denied them in part.it dismissed the complaint against suffolk county in its entirety but without prejudice to plaintiffs filing an amended complaint within thirty days.as for the individual defendants,the district court,apparently without opposition from plaintiffs,granted dismissal of all claims brought against defendants in their official capacities based on the eleventh amendment.insofar as defendants were sued in their individual capacities,the district court ruled that plaintiffs had failed adequately to plead defendant catterson personal involvement in the alleged constitutional deprivations and,accordingly,dismissed the complaint against him without prejudice to plaintiffs filing an amended pleading within thirty days with respect to defendants dunne,mcpartland,and kelleher,the district court dismissed plaintiffs third federal claim for violation of substantive due process in light of albright oliver,d holding that a claim for prosecution without probable cause arises under the fourth amendment not substantive due process.nevertheless,it denied defendants motion to dismiss the first two federal claims,the substantive and conspiratorial claims for malicious and selective prosecution,ruling that defendants alleged political motivations in pursuing plaintiffs prosecutions took their actions outside the scope of their official roles.bernard county of suffolk,cv,at.as the court explained 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants acted outside the scope of their official duties in conducting a politically motivated witch hunt,initiating and continuing to prosecute them in the absence of probable cause.accepting the allegations that the defendants misused their authority and abused the judicial process to advance their own political agenda as true,the court concludes that defendants conduct clearly falls outside the scope of their official duties.consequently,the court rejects the defendants argument that the claims should be dismissed on the basis of absolute immunity.
the district court also declined to dismiss plaintiffs state law claims.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
a denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final order and,thus,is not immediately appealable unless it satisfies the collateral order exception articulated in cohen beneficial industrial loan.providing for immediate appeal where order completely decides the disputed question,resolves an important issue separate from the merits of the suit,and is effectively unreviewable if appellate jurisdiction is deferred until final judgment.in hill city of new york,cir,this court ruled that an order denying a motion to dismiss based on a claim of absolute or qualified immunity is immediately appealable pursuant to cohen provided the challenged ruling turns on issues of law rather than fact.such interlocutory appeal is consistent with the principle that absolute and qualified immunity not only immunizes the state official from any liability,it also immunizes that official from suit.id.at and cases cited therein.
to the extent the district court denial of defendants motion was based on a legal ruling that politically motivated prosecutions fall outside the scope of conduct shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity,this court plainly has jurisdiction to hear defendants appeal pursuant to the holdings in cohen and hill.under the same precedent,however,this court is without jurisdiction to resolve the parties dispute as to whether claims of investigative misconduct survive defendants absolute immunity challenge to the complaint.although the court has discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction in limited cases,see hill city of new york,at,for reasons discussed infra in part c of this opinion,we conclude that this is not a case warranting such exercise.
defendants alleged political motivation does not deprive them of absolute immunity for their performance of advocative functions 
defendants submit that the district court erred in ruling that an improper political motive could take their decisions to prosecute plaintiffs and their conduct before the grand jury outside the scope of official functions shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity.we agree that a defendant motivation in performing such advocative functions is irrelevant to the applicability of absolute immunity.
in creating a civil cause of action for constitutional torts,itself recognizes no immunities.nevertheless,the supreme court has concluded that congress did not intend to abrogate immunities well grounded in history and reason.imbler pachtman,d quoting tenney brandhove.such immunities are of two types absolute and qualified.buckley fitzsimmons,d.absolute immunity is reserved for officials who perform special functions and deserve absolute protection from damages liability.among these are prosecutors,and persons working under their direction,when they function as advocates for the state in circumstances intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.imbler pachtman,at.see also hill city of new york,at extending absolute prosecutorial immunity to persons acting under the direction of prosecutors in performing functions closely tied to the judicial process.
by contrast,only qualified immunity applies to law enforcement officials,including prosecutors,when they perform investigative functions.buckley fitzsimmons,at.when a prosecutor performs the investigative functions normally performed by a detective or police officer,it is neither appropriate nor justifiable that,for the same act,immunity should protect the one and not the other.internal quotation marks and citations omitted accord zahrey coffey,cir.
in applying this functional approach to claims of absolute immunity,courts focus on the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed
