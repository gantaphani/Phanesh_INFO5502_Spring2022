this appeal stems from ongoing attempts by various news organizations to gain access to sealed court proceedings,transcripts,and discovery documents.their marked persistence in pursuing the matter is a result of the public interest in the underlying,and,civil suit that generated the civil contempt action that was the focus of the constitutional claims that face us on appeal.despite this complex posture,the questions this appeal presents are straightforward.first,does the first amendment presumptive right of access to court proceedings attach to civil contempt proceedings and related documents second,for each of the documents sought,does that presumptive right of access require disclosure in this particular case 
background 
i.the underlying lawsuit 
on march,sharon dorsett filed a civil rights suit both on her own behalf and on behalf of the estate of bird,her daughter,alleging that various state actors affiliated with the nassau county police department had negligently contributed to bird fatal stabbing by her and her child father,leonardo valdez cruz bird had obtained several orders of protection against valdez cruz on behalf of herself and her child,and those orders were in effect during the weeks and days leading up to bird death for intermittent periods of time prior to bird death,moreover,valdez cruz was in police custody.nevertheless,the complaint alleged,despite the court orders and the supposed police supervision,that valdez cruz tortured,stalked,menaced,maimed,harassed,annoyed,injured,threatened,mutilated,kidnaped and killed bird as a direct result of the county and the police department negligence.compl.the complaint further alleged that this negligently lax supervision resulted at least in part from valdez cruz status as a police informant.id.
during the course of the litigation,dorsett sought various documents from defendants,including an internal police report detailing the results of an investigation into the matter.this document,which is pages long,is styled nassau county police department internal affairs unit investigation report iau report or report.defendants eventually produced a redacted copy of the report to dorsett and her counsel,and did not seek to place that copy under seal.dorsett objected to the extent of redactions to the report,and the magistrate judge kathleen tomlinson,magistrate judge ruled that some but not all of the redactions inappropriately concealed information that was relevant to dorsett claims and therefore discoverable by her.
ii.the initial protective order 
after receiving the redacted copy of the iau report,dorsett counsel issued a press release announcing a press conference.the purpose of the press conference,which was to be held on the morning of december,was to release the redacted report to the general public.the day before the press conference,the defendants moved orally for an injunction or protective order prohibiting the release of the contents of the report to the general public and requested an emergency hearing on the motion.the magistrate judge heard argument from both sides by conference call at the evening before the announced press conference.at the conclusion of the hearing,the magistrate judge granted defendants motion and temporarily restrained and preliminarily enjoined dorsett counsel from releasing the contents of the report.after that preliminary ruling,the parties submitted supplemental briefing on the appropriateness of an extension of the injunctive relief.additionally,newsday llc and news networks llc collectively,the intervenors or press intervenors sought,and were granted,leave to intervene in the case for purposes of a opposing defendants motion for an injunction or protective order and b moving to unseal any motion papers or transcripts related to the iau report.
on january,the magistrate judge considered the motions in full and concluded that defendants had met the threshold showing of good cause required by federal rule of civil procedure c for issuance of a protective order.in so finding,the magistrate judge rejected intervenors argument that the report was at that point a judicial document and therefore concluded that it did not trigger the common law presumption in favor of public access.importantly,the magistrate judge noted that her determination that the iau report was not a judicial document was limited to the case posture at the time,and that the course of discovery and motion practice might transform the report into a judicial document and therefore create a presumption of public access at a later date 
defendants in the underlying lawsuit ultimately reached a settlement with dorsett,but the agreement was contingent upon approval by the nassau county legislature and the nassau county interim finance authority.pursuant to this clause,defendants sought legislative approval for the million payment that the settlement called for.several members of the legislature,including the eventual contempt defendant peter schmitt,refused to approve such a large settlement without reviewing the evidence that justified it.those legislators accordingly requested that the district court permit them to review the evidence in the case,including the iau report,which was still subject to the magistrate judge protective order.on december,the district court arthur spatt,judge provided schmitt and the other legislators with the iau report subject to an additional confidentiality order prohibiting them from conveying to anyone else information learned exclusively from the report and not independently from another source 
despite the protective order,schmitt made a statement during a televised editorial that appeared to reveal information contained in the report.specifically,schmitt stated 
there are police officers in this county who were mentioned in that confidential internal affairs report who ought to be ashamed to look at themselves in the mirror every morning when they get up to shave,much less be wearing the badge orders of protection were ignored mandatory arrests were called for and not performed,giving a cell phone to the prisoner when he was behind bars and allowing him to call the victim to times,and on and on and on.
upon learning of schmitt statements,the police benevolent association of the police department of the county of nassau,new york,pba sought to intervene in the civil case to enforce the district court december,confidentiality order.the district court granted the motion to intervene and scheduled a hearing to consider whether schmitt was in contempt of the confidentiality order.those civil contempt proceedings began on may.
iii.the contempt hearing 
the contempt hearing began in open court but was moved into judge spatt chambers at the request of schmitt counsel.at the outset of the proceedings,judge spatt declined to review a copy of the report to compare it against schmitt public statement,and instead requested that the pba produce a witness to testify as to the contents of the report.the pba asked that the witness be given a copy of the report to refresh his recollection,and the district court recessed to allow the pba to find a witness familiar with the contents of the report.when the proceedings resumed,the district court asked,is there a request to seal the courtroom both the county and the pba said yes.matthew chayes,a reporter for newsday who was present in the courtroom,requested time to contact the newspaper counsel to object formally to the closing of the courtroom.frank eltman,a reporter from the associated press,joined in the application.the district court declined to allow such a recess,confirmed that chayes was himself objecting to the closing of the courtroom,and overruled the objection counsel for the press intervenors renewed their objections with the district court staff by telephone during the sealed proceedings,but chambers staff declined to interrupt the sealed proceedings and directed the press intervenors to file their objections in writing.
the sealed proceedings continued with the testimony of nassau county police department assistant chief neil delargy,who supervised the internal affairs unit that had produced the report.delargy was allowed to review the report during the course of his testimony,and on two occasions he relied on the text of the report in answering questions.at the conclusion of his testimony,the district court granted the parties request that delargy be allowed to go through the entire report to confirm the number of police officers mentioned in the report.then,at the close of the pba case,while the courtroom was still closed,the parties made arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to prove civil contempt.
next,and with the courtroom still closed,schmitt took the stand to testify in his own defense.schmitt testimony tended to show that the information he revealed in the interview quoted in the television editorial had been otherwise publicly available.at the end of schmitt direct examination,the district court reopened the courtroom,having concluded that no testimony about the contents of the report would be elicited the courtroom remained open for the remainder of schmitt testimony.
finally,the district court once again sealed the courtroom as delargy retook the stand after completing his review of the report.delargy testified that members of the nassau county police department were mentioned in the report and supporting exhibits,and that either eighteen or of those were mentioned in the body and summary of the report at no point during delargy testimony were the names or ranks of the officers revealed,although he did reveal how many of the police officers mentioned were women.at the close of delargy testimony,the courtroom was reopened for closing arguments.
that evening,the press intervenors filed a letter brief formally objecting to the closing of the courtroom during the contempt hearing.they also sought release of a transcript of the hearing and all exhibits used during it.the district court held oral argument on the intervenors requests and,on june,it rejected them.dorsett county of nassau dorsett iv d.the district court concluded that the magistrate judge original rule protective order,combined with the district court subsequent confidentiality order,required that large portions of the contempt hearing transcript,as well as the iau report,remain under seal.id.at.in deciding that the protective order required ongoing secrecy,the district court assumed without deciding that the first amendment common law right of access attache d to the contempt proceedings at issue.id.at.the district court explicitly relied on the magistrate judge earlier finding of good cause in denying intervenors application to unseal the iau report notwithstanding the fact that its use at the civil contempt proceedings might have,as intervenors argued,transformed the report into a judicial document.however,after balancing the public presumptive right of access afforded by the first amendment and the common law against the interest of ongoing confidentiality,the district court concluded that significant portions of the hearing transcript should be unsealed.id.at.
the day after it rejected intervenors requests,the district court held schmitt in contempt and imposed a coercive sanction in order to ensure future compliance by presiding officer schmitt and by other legislators that have viewed this report.dorsett county of nassau dorsett v,no.cv,wl,at june.in so holding,the district court relied on its conclusion that schmitt comments were in fact based on his review of the report.id.at 
the press intervenors timely appealed the district court decision keeping the report and transcripts under seal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to seal proceedings or place documents under seal for abuse of discretion.see united states.air lines,cir.additionally,the supreme court has noted that e very court has supervisory power over its own records and files.nixon warner commc ns.however,we have also held that the first amendment concerns implicated by the sealing of proceedings or documents mandate close appellate scrutiny.in such cases,we have traditionally undertaken an independent review of sealed documents,despite the fact that such a review may raise factual rather than legal issues.see,united states aref,cir.we therefore independently examine the report and related transcripts with due consideration for the prerogative of the district court to administer the evidence before it.
ii.legal principles 
federal courts employ two related but distinct presumptions in favor of public access to court proceedings and records a strong form rooted in the first amendment and a slightly weaker form based in federal common law.we must determine whether either of those presumptions applies to the civil contempt hearing at issue in this case 
the supreme court has held that the first amendment presumptive right of access applies to all criminal trials.richmond newspapers,virginia,d.we have extended that principle and held that the first amendment right applies to civil trials and to their related proceedings and records.civil liberties union transit auth.nycta,cir.in so holding,we have noted that the first amendment does not distinguish between criminal and civil proceedings,but rather protects the public against the government arbitrary interference with access to important information.id.internal quotation marks omitted.based on this logic,we have held that the first amendment right applies,among other things,to summary judgment motions and documents relied upon in adjudicating them,lugosch pyramid of onondaga,cir,pretrial motions and written documents submitted in connection with them,in re new york times,cir,and docket sheets,hartford courant pellegrino,cir.
we have applied two different approaches when deciding whether the first amendment right applies to particular material.the approach applies to both judicial proceedings and documents,and asks both whether the documents have historically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.lugosch,at internal quotation marks omitted.the second approach which we adopt only when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered by the first amendment right asks whether the documents at issue are derived from or are a necessary corollary of the capacity to attend the relevant proceedings.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
under the approach,civil contempt proceedings,which carry the threat of coercive sanctions,implicate first amendment values.as we have noted in the related context of the common law right of access,the need for public access to court proceedings is grounded in the need for federal courts to have a measure of accountability and for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.united states amodeo amodeo ii,cir.this observation applies with special force in the context of contempt proceedings,which,although civil in nature,carry the threat of coercive sanctions and seek to enforce the court own orders.at least one of our sister circuits has considered the issue and concluded that the presumptive right applies to such proceedings.see in re iowa freedom of info.council,cir t he protection of the first amendment extends to proceedings for contempt,a hybrid containing both civil and criminal characteristics.we therefore conclude that the first amendment right applies to civil contempt proceedings 
however,to decide whether the first amendment right applies to judicial documents implicated in civil contempt proceedings as opposed to the proceedings themselves courts must engage in a inquiry to determine whether those documents are derived from or are a necessary corollary of the capacity to attend the proceedings,lugosch,at alteration in original.only those documents necessary to understand the merits of a civil contempt proceeding are covered by the first amendment presumptive right of access.
even when it applies,moreover,the first amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access.as we have noted,w hat offends the first amendment is the attempt to exclude the public without sufficient justification,nycta,at,not t
