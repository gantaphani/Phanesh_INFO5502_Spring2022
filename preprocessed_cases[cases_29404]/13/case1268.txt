the district court denied hester motion to dismiss the indictment.see united states hester,gls,wl.first,the district court stated that w hile it may be true that the states have until july to implement certain administrative portions of sorna,the statute itself became effective in july.therefore,whether mandated by new york,florida or sorna,registering is not optional.id.at.the district court also found that hester had sufficient notice that failure to register and update his registration was illegal the record is clear that he knew he had to register and failed to do so.id.because the district court determined that it is not necessary for a defendant to know precisely which statute he is violating in order to be held liable under the law,it concluded that it is irrelevant whether hester knew specifically that he was in violation of sorna.id.
