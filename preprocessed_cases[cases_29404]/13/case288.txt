for the past years,the congregation of the westboro baptist church has picketed military funerals to communicate its belief that god hates the united states for its tolerance of homosexuality,particularly in america military.the church picketing has also condemned the catholic church for scandals involving its clergy.fred phelps,who founded the church,and six westboro baptist parishioners all relatives of phelps traveled to maryland to picket the funeral of marine lance corporal matthew snyder,who was killed in iraq in the line of duty.the picketing took place on public land approximately feet from the church where the funeral was held,in accordance with guidance from local law enforcement officers.the picketers peacefully displayed their signs stating,thank god for dead soldiers,fags doom nations,america is doomed,priests rape boys,and you going to hell for about minutes before the funeral began.matthew snyder father snyder,petitioner here,saw the tops of the picketers signs when driving to the funeral,but did not learn what was written on the signs until watching a news broadcast later that night.
snyder filed a diversity action against phelps,his daughters who participated in the picketing and the church collectively westboro alleging,as relevant here,state tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress,intrusion upon seclusion,and civil conspiracy.a jury held westboro liable for millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.westboro challenged the verdict as grossly excessive and sought judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the first amendment fully protected its speech.the district court reduced the punitive damages award,but left the verdict otherwise intact.the fourth circuit reversed,concluding that westboro statements were entitled to first amendment protection because those statements were on matters of public concern,were not provably false,and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric.
held the first amendment shields westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.
a the free speech clause of the first amendment can serve as a defense in state tort suits,including suits for intentional infliction of emotional distress.hustler magazine,falwell.whether the first amendment prohibits holding westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern,as determined by all the circumstances of the case.s peech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values and is entitled to special protection.connick myers.although the boundaries of what constitutes speech on matters of public concern are not well defined,this court has said that speech is of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,at,or when it is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public,san diego roe.a statement arguably inappropriate or controversial character is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.rankin mcpherson.
to determine whether speech is of public or private concern,this court must independently examine the content,form,and context,of the speech as revealed by the whole record.dun bradstreet,greenmoss builders.in considering content,form,and context,no factor is dispositive,and it is necessary to evaluate all aspects of the speech.
the content of westboro signs plainly relates to public,rather than private,matters.the placards highlighted issues of public import the political and moral conduct of the united states and its citizens,the fate of the nation,homosexuality in the military,and scandals involving the catholic clergy and westboro conveyed its views on those issues in a manner designed to reach as broad a public audience as possible.even if a few of the signs were viewed as containing messages related to a particular individual,that would not change the fact that the dominant theme of westboro demonstration spoke to broader public issues.
the context of the speech its connection with matthew snyder funeral can not by itself transform the nature of westboro speech.the signs reflected westboro condemnation of much in modern society,and it can not be argued that westboro use of speech on public issues was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on snyder from liability.westboro had been actively engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of matthew snyder,and there can be no serious claim that the picketing did not represent westboro honestly held beliefs on public issues.westboro may have chosen the picket location to increase publicity for its views,and its speech may have been particularly hurtful to snyder.that does not mean that its speech should be afforded less than full first amendment protection under the circumstances of this case.
that said,e ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.frisby schultz.westboro choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not beyond the government regulatory reach it is subject to reasonable time,place,or manner restrictions.clark community for creative.the facts here are quite different,however,both with respect to the activity being regulated and the means of restricting those activities,from the few limited situations where the court has concluded that the location of targeted picketing can be properly regulated under provisions deemed content neutral.frisby,supra,at madsen women health center,distinguished.maryland now has a law restricting funeral picketing but that law was not in effect at the time of these events,so this court has no occasion to consider whether that law is a reasonable time,place,or manner restrictio n under the standards announced by this court.clark,supra,at.
the special protection afforded to what westboro said,in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it,can not be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous for purposes of applying the state law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.that would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish westboro for its views on matters of public concern.for all these reasons,the jury verdict imposing tort liability on westboro for intentional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside.
b snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclusion.he argues that he was a member of a captive audience at his son funeral,but the captive audience doctrine which has been applied sparingly,see rowan post office,frisby,supra,at should not be expanded to the circumstances here.westboro stayed well away from the memorial service,snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers signs,and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself.
c because the first amendment bars snyder from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclusion the allegedly unlawful activity westboro conspired to accomplish snyder also can not recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.
d westboro addressed matters of public import on public property,in a peaceful manner,in full compliance with the guidance of local officials.it did not disrupt mathew snyder funeral,and its choice to picket at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.because this nation has chosen to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that public debate is not stifled,westboro must be shielded from tort liability for its picketing in this case.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
a jury held members of the westboro baptist church liable for millions of dollars in damages for picketing near a soldier funeral service.the picket signs reflected the church view that the united states is overly tolerant of sin and that god kills american soldiers as punishment.the question presented is whether the first amendment shields the church members from tort liability for their speech in this case.
fred phelps founded the westboro baptist church in topeka,kansas,in.the church congregation believes that god hates and punishes the united states for its tolerance of homosexuality,particularly in america military.the church frequently communicates its views by picketing,often at military funerals.in the more than years that the members of westboro baptist have publicized their message,they have picketed nearly funerals.brief for rutherford institute as amicus curiae.
marine lance corporal matthew snyder was killed in iraq in the line of duty.lance corporal snyder father selected the catholic church in the snyders hometown of westminster,maryland,as the site for his son funeral.local newspapers provided notice of the time and location of the service.
phelps became aware of matthew snyder funeral and decided to travel to maryland with six other westboro baptist parishioners two of his daughters and four of his grandchildren to picket.on the day of the memorial service,the westboro congregation members picketed on public land adjacent to public streets near the maryland state house,the united states naval academy,and matthew snyder funeral.the westboro picketers carried signs that were largely the same at all three locations.they stated,for instance god hates the god for,america is doomed,do pray for the usa,thank god for ieds,thank god for dead soldiers,pope in hell,priests rape boys,god hates fags,you going to hell,and god hates you.
the church had notified the authorities in advance of its intent to picket at the time of the funeral,and the picketers complied with police instructions in staging their demonstration.the picketing took place within a by plot of public land adjacent to a public street,behind a temporary fence.app.to brief for appellants in,hereinafter app.that plot was approximately feet from the church where the funeral was held.several buildings separated the picket site from the church,at.the westboro picketers displayed their signs for about minutes before the funeral began and sang hymns and recited bible verses.none of the picketers entered church property or went to the cemetery.they did not yell or use profanity,and there was no violence associated with the picketing,at.
the funeral procession passed within to feet of the picket site.although snyder testified that he could see the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral,he did not see what was written on the signs until later that night,while watching a news broadcast covering the event,at 
snyder filed suit against phelps,phelps daughters,and the westboro baptist church collectively westboro or the church in the united states district court for the district of maryland under that court diversity jurisdiction.snyder alleged five state tort law claims defamation,publicity given to private life,intentional infliction of emotional distress,intrusion upon seclusion,and civil conspiracy.westboro moved for summary judgment contending,in part,that the church speech was insulated from liability by the first amendment.see supp.
the district court awarded westboro summary judgment on snyder claims for defamation and publicity given to private life,concluding that snyder could not prove the necessary elements of those torts,at.a trial was held on the remaining claims.at trial,snyder described the severity of his emotional injuries.he testified that he is unable to separate the thought of his dead son from his thoughts of westboro picketing,and that he often becomes tearful,angry,and physically ill when he thinks about it,at.expert witnesses testified that snyder emotional anguish had resulted in severe depression and had exacerbated health conditions.
a jury found for snyder on the intentional infliction of emotional distress,intrusion upon seclusion,and civil conspiracy claims,and held westboro liable for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.westboro filed several motions,including a motion contending that the jury verdict was grossly excessive and a motion seeking judgment as a matter of law on all claims on first amendment grounds.the district court remitted the punitive damages award to million,but left the jury verdict otherwise intact,at.
in the court of appeals,westboro primary argument was that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the first amendment fully protected westboro speech.the court of appeals agreed.the court reviewed the picket signs and concluded that westboro statements were entitled to first amendment protection because those statements were on matters of public concern,were not provably false,and were expressed solely through hyperbolic rhetoric,at 
we granted certiorari.
to succeed on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress in maryland,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that caused the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress.see harris jones.the free speech clause of the first amendment congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech can serve as a defense in state tort suits,including suits for intentional infliction of emotional distress.see,hustler magazine,falwell,
whether the first amendment prohibits holding westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern,as determined by all the circumstances of the case.s peech on matters of public concern is at the heart of the first amendment protection.dun bradstreet,greenmoss builders,opinion of powell,quoting first nat.bank of boston bellotti.the first amendment reflects a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,robust,and.new york times sullivan.that is because speech concerning public affairs is more than it is the essence of.garrison louisiana.accordingly,speech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values,and is entitled to special protection.connick myers,internal quotation marks omitted.
n ot all speech is of equal first amendment importance,however,and where matters of purely private significance are at issue,first amendment protections are often less rigorous.hustler,supra,at quoting dun bradstreet,supra,at see connick,supra,at.that is because restricting speech on purely private matters does not implicate the same constitutional concerns as limiting speech on matters of public interest t here is no threat to the free and robust debate of public issues there is no potential interference with a meaningful dialogue of ideas and the threat of liability does not pose the risk of a reaction of on matters of public import.dun bradstreet,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we noted a short time ago,in considering whether public employee speech addressed a matter of public concern,that the boundaries of the public concern test are not well defined.san diego roe,per curiam.although that remains true today,we have articulated some guiding principles,principles that accord broad protection to speech to ensure that courts themselves do not become inadvertent censors.
speech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community,connick,supra,at,or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest that is,a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public,san diego,supra,at.see cox broadcasting cohn,time,hill.the arguably inappropriate or controversial character of a statement is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern.rankin mcpherson.
our opinion in dun bradstreet,on the other hand,provides an example of speech of only private concern.in that case we held,as a general matter,that information about a particular individual credit report concerns no public issue.at.the content of the report,we explained,was speech solely in the individual interest of the speaker and its specific business audience.ibid.that was confirmed by the fact that the particular report was sent to only five subscribers to the reporting service,who were bound not to disseminate it further.ibid.to cite another example,we concluded in san diego roe that,in the context of a government employer regulating the speech of its employees,videos of an employee engaging in sexually explicit acts did not address a public concern the videos did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the employing agency functioning or operation.at.
deciding whether speech is of public or private concern requires us to examine the content,form,and context of that speech,as revealed by the whole record.dun bradstreet,supra,at quoting connick,supra,at.as in other first amendment cases,the court is obligated to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.bose consumers union of united states,quoting new york times,supra,at.in considering content,form,and context,no factor is dispositive,and it is necessary to evaluate all the circumstances of the speech,including what was said,where it was said,and how it was said.
the content of westboro signs plainly relates to broad issues of interest to society at large,rather than matters of purely private concern.dun bradstreet,supra,at.the placards read god hates the god for,america is doomed,do pray for the usa,thank god for ieds,fag troops,semper fi fags,god hates fags,maryland taliban,fags doom nations,not blessed just cursed,thank god for dead soldiers,pope in hell,priests rape boys,you going to hell,and god hates you.app.while these messages may fall short of refined social or political commentary,the issues they highlight the political and moral conduct of the united states and its citizens,the fate of our nation,homosexuality in the military,and scandals involving the catholic clergy are matters of public import.the signs certainly convey westboro position on those issues,in a manner designed,unlike the private speech in dun bradstreet,to reach as broad a public audience as possible.and even if a few of the signs such as you going to hell and god hates you were viewed as containing messages related to matthew snyder or the snyders specifically,that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and dominant theme of westboro demonstration spoke to broader public issues.
apart from the content of westboro signs,snyder contends that the context of the speech its connection with his son funeral makes the speech a matter of private rather than public concern.the fact that westboro spoke in connection with a funeral,however,can not by itself transform the nature of westboro speech.westboro signs,displayed on public land next to a public street,reflect the fact that the church finds much to condemn in modern society.its speech is fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern,connick,at,and the funeral setting does not alter that conclusion.
snyder argues that the church members in fact mounted a personal attack on snyder and his family,and then attempted to immunize their conduct by claiming that they were actually protesting the united states tolerance of homosexuality or the supposed evils of the catholic church.reply brief for petitioner.we are not concerned in this case that westboro speech on public matters was in any way contrived to insulate speech on a private matter from liability.westboro had been actively engaged in speaking on the subjects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of matthew snyder,and there can be no serious claim that westboro picketing did not represent its honestly believed views on public issues.garrison,at.there was no relationship or conflict between westboro and snyder that might suggest westboro speech on public matters was intended to mask an attack on snyder over a private matter.contrast connick,supra,at finding public employee speech a matter of private concern when it was no coincidence that the speech followed upon the heels of a transfer notice affecting the employee.
snyder goes on to argue that westboro speech should be afforded less than full first amendment protection not only because of the words but also because the church members exploited the funeral as a platform to bring their message to a broader audience.brief for petitioner.there is no doubt that westboro chose to stage its picketing at the naval academy,the maryland state house,and matthew snyder funeral to increase publicity for its views and because of the relation between those sites and its views in the case of the military funeral,because westboro believes that god is killing american soldiers as punishment for the nation sinful policies.
westboro choice to convey its views in conjunction with matthew snyder funeral made the expression of those views particularly hurtful to many,especially to matthew father.the record makes clear that the applicable legal term emotional distress fails to capture fully the anguish westboro choice added to snyder already incalculable grief.but westboro conducted its picketing peacefully on matters of public concern at a public place adjacent to a public street.such space occupies a special position in terms of first amendment protection.united states grace.w e have repeatedly referred to public streets as the archetype of a traditional public forum,noting that t ime out of mind public streets and sidewalks have been used for public assembly and debate.frisby schultz,
that said,e ven protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.at quoting cornelius naacp legal defense ed.fund.westboro choice of where and when to conduct its picketing is not beyond the government regulatory reach it is subject to reasonable time,place,or manner restrictions that are consistent with the standards announced in this court precedents.clark community for creative.maryland now has a law imposing restrictions on funeral picketing.crim.law code ann.lexis supp,as do other states and the federal government.see brief for american legion as amicus curiae,listing statutes.to the extent these laws are content neutral,they raise very different questions from the tort verdict at issue in this case.maryland law,however,was not in effect at the time of the events at issue here,so we have no occasion to consider how it might apply to facts such as those before us,or whether it or other similar regulations are constitutional 
we have identified a few limited situations where the location of targeted picketing can be regulated under provisions that the court has determined to be content neutral.in frisby,for example,we upheld a ban on such picketing before or about a particular residence,at.in madsen women health center,we approved an injunction requiring a buffer zone between protesters and an abortion clinic entrance.the facts here are obviously quite different,both with respect to the activity being regulated and the means of restricting those activities.
simply put,the church members had the right to be where they were.westboro alerted local authorities to its funeral protest and fully complied with police guidance on where the picketing could be staged.the picketing was conducted under police supervision some feet from the church,out of the sight of those at the church.the protest was not unruly there was no shouting,profanity,or violence.
the record confirms that any distress occasioned by westboro picketing turned on the content and viewpoint of the message conveyed,rather than any interference with the funeral itself.a group of parishioners standing at the very spot where westboro stood,holding signs that said god bless america and god loves you,would not have been subjected to liability.it was what westboro said that exposed it to tort damages.
given that westboro speech was at a public place on a matter of public concern,that speech is entitled to special protection under the first amendment.such speech can not be restricted simply because it is upsetting or arouses contempt.if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment,it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.texas johnson.indeed,the point of all speech protection is to shield just those choices of content that in someone eyes are misguided,or even hurtful.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston.
the jury here was instructed that it could hold westboro liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on a finding that westboro picketing was outrageous.outrageousness,however,is a highly malleable standard with an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors tastes or views,or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression.hustler,at internal quotation marks omitted.in a case such as this,a jury is unlikely to be neutral with respect to the content of the speech,posing a real danger of becoming an instrument for the suppression of vehement,caustic,and sometimes unpleasan t expression.bose,at quoting new york times,at.such a risk is unacceptable in public debate we must tolerate insulting,and even outrageous,speech in order to provide adequate breathing space to the freedoms protected by the first amendment.boos barry,some internal quotation marks omitted.what westboro said,in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it,is entitled to special protection under the first amendment,and that protection can not be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous.
for all these reasons,the jury verdict imposing tort liability on westboro for intentional infliction of emotional distress must be set aside.
the jury also found westboro liable for the state law torts of intrusion upon seclusion and civil conspiracy.the court of appeals did not examine these torts independently of the intentional infliction of emotional distress tort.instead,the court of appeals reversed the district court wholesale,holding that the judgment wrongly attache d tort liability to constitutionally protected speech.at.
snyder argues that even assuming westboro speech is entitled to first amendment protection generally,the church is not immunized from liability for intrusion upon seclusion because snyder was a member of a captive audience at his son funeral.brief for petitioner.we do not agree.in most circumstances,the constitution does not permit the government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.rather,the burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid further bombardment of his sensibilities simply by averting his eyes.erznoznik jacksonville,internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,t he ability of government,consonant with the constitution,to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially intolerable manner.cohen california.
as a general matter,we have applied the captive audience doctrine only sparingly to protect unwilling listeners from protected speech.for example,we have upheld a statute allowing a homeowner to restrict the delivery of offensive mail to his home,see rowan post office,and an ordinance prohibiting picketing before or about any individual residence,frisby,at.
here,westboro stayed well away from the memorial service.snyder could see no more than the tops of the signs when driving to the funeral.and there is no indication that the picketing in any way interfered with the funeral service itself.we decline to expand the captive audience doctrine to the circumstances presented here.
because we find that the first amendment bars snyder from recovery for intentional infliction of emotional distress or intrusion upon seclusion the alleged unlawful activity westboro conspired to accomplish we must likewise hold that snyder can not recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.
our holding today is narrow.we are required in first amendment cases to carefully review the record,and the reach of our opinion here is limited by the particular facts before us.as we have noted,the sensitivity and significance of the interests presented in clashes between first amendment and state law rights counsel relying on limited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case.florida star.
westboro believes that america is morally flawed many americans might feel the same about westboro.westboro funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its to public discourse may be negligible.but westboro addressed matters of public import on public property,in a peaceful manner,in full compliance with the guidance of local officials.the speech was indeed planned to coincide with matthew snyder funeral,but did not itself disrupt that funeral,and westboro choice to conduct its picketing at that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech.
speech is powerful.it can stir people to action,move them to tears of both joy and sorrow,and as it did here inflict great pain.on the facts before us,we can not react to that pain by punishing the speaker.as a nation we have chosen a different course to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.that choice requires that we shield westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this case.
the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
justice breyer,concurring.
i agree with the court and join its opinion.that opinion restricts its analysis here to the matter raised in the petition for certiorari,namely,westboro picketing activity.the opinion does not examine in depth the effect of television broadcasting.nor does it say anything about internet postings.the court holds that the first amendment protects the picketing that occurred here,primarily because the picketing addressed matters of public concern.
while i agree with the court conclusion that the picketing addressed matters of public concern,i do not believe that our first amendment analysis can stop at that point.a state can sometimes regulate picketing,even picketing on matters of public concern.see frisby schultz.moreover,suppose that a were physically to assault b,knowing that the assault being newsworthy would provide a with an opportunity to transmit to the public his views on a matter of public concern.the constitutionally protected nature of the end would not shield a use of unlawful,unprotected means.and in some circumstances the use of certain words as means would be similarly unprotected.see chaplinsky new hampshire,fighting words 
the dissent recognizes that the means used here consist of speech.but it points out that the speech,like an assault,seriously harmed a private individual.indeed,the state tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress forbids only conduct that produces distress so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it,and which itself is so outrageous in character,and so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.post,at opinion of alito,quoting harris jones,internal quotation marks omitted.the dissent requires us to ask whether our holding unreasonably limits liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress to the point where a in order to draw attention to his views on a public matter might launch a verbal assault upon b,a private person,publicly revealing the most intimate details of b private life,while knowing that the revelation will cause b severe emotional harm.does our decision leave the state powerless to protect the individual against invasions of,personal privacy,even in the most horrendous of such circumstances 
as i understand the court opinion,it does not hold or imply that the state is always powerless to provide private individuals with necessary protection.rather,the court has reviewed the underlying facts in detail,as will sometimes prove necessary where first amendment values and say,interests seriously conflict.florida star,bose consumers union of united states.that review makes clear that westboro means of communicating its views consisted of picketing in a place where picketing was lawful and in compliance with all police directions.the picketing could not be seen or heard from the funeral ceremony itself.and snyder testified that he saw no more than the tops of the picketers signs as he drove to the funeral.to uphold the application of state law in these circumstances would punish westboro for seeking to communicate its views on matters of public concern without proportionately advancing the state interest in protecting its citizens against severe emotional harm.consequently,the first amendment protects westboro.as i read the court opinion,it holds no more.

justice alito,dissenting.
our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case.
petitioner albert snyder is not a public figure.he is simply a parent whose son,marine lance corporal matthew snyder,was killed in iraq.snyder wanted what is surely the right of any parent who experiences such an incalculable loss to bury his son in peace.but respondents,members of the westboro baptist church,deprived him of that elementary right.they first issued a press release and thus turned matthew funeral into a tumultuous media event.they then appeared at the church,approached as closely as they could without trespassing,and launched a malevolent verbal attack on matthew and his family at a time of acute emotional vulnerability.as a result,albert snyder suffered severe and lasting emotional injury the court now holds that the first amendment protected respondents right to brutalize snyder.i can not agree.
respondents and other members of their church have strong opinions on certain moral,religious,and political issues,and the first amendment ensures that they have almost limitless opportunities to express their views.they may write and distribute books,articles,and other texts they may create and disseminate video and audio recordings they may circulate petitions they may speak to individuals and groups in public forums and in any private venue that wishes to accommodate them they may picket peacefully in countless locations they may appear on television and speak on the radio they may post messages on the internet and send out.and they may express their views in terms that are uninhibited,vehement,and caustic.new york times sullivan.
it does not follow,however,that they may intentionally inflict severe emotional injury on private persons at a time of intense emotional sensitivity by launching vicious verbal attacks that make no contribution to public debate.to protect against such injury,most if not all jurisdictions permit recovery in tort for the intentional infliction of emotional distress or iied.hustler magazine,falwell.
this is a very narrow tort with requirements that are rigorous,and difficult to satisfy.keeton,dobbs,keeton,owen,prosser and keeton on law of torts,ed.to recover,a plaintiff must show that the conduct at issue caused harm that was truly severe.see nickel,r ecovery will be meted out sparingly,its balm reserved for those wounds that are truly severe and incapable of healing themselves internal quotation marks omitted harris jones,the distress must be so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it quoting restatement second of torts,comment j.
a plaintiff must also establish that the defendant conduct was so outrageous in character,and so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.at,at quoting restatement second of torts,comment d.
although the elements of the iied tort are difficult to meet,respondents long ago abandoned any effort to show that those tough standards were not satisfied here.on appeal,they chose not to contest the sufficiency of the evidence.see.they did not dispute that snyder suffered wounds that are truly severe and incapable of healing themselves.supra,at,at.nor did they dispute that their speech was so outrageous in character,and so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.harris,supra,at,at.instead,they maintained that the first amendment gave them a license to engage in such conduct.they are wrong.
it is well established that a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress can be satisfied by speech.indeed,what has been described as t he leading case recognizing this tort involved speech.prosser and keeton,supra,at citing wilkinson downton,see also restatement second of torts,illustration.and although this court has not decided the question,i think it is clear that the first amendment does not entirely preclude liability for the intentional infliction of emotional distress by means of speech.
this court has recognized that words may by their very utterance inflict injury and that the first amendment does not shield utterances that form no essential part of any exposition of ideas,and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.chaplinsky new hampshire,see also cantwell connecticut,p ersonal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the constitution when grave injury is intentionally inflicted by means of an attack like the one at issue here,the first amendment should not interfere with recovery.
in this case,respondents brutally attacked matthew snyder,and this attack,which was almost certain to inflict injury,was central to respondents strategy for attracting public attention.
on the morning of matthew snyder funeral,respondents could have chosen to stage their protest at countless locations.they could have picketed the united states capitol,the white house,the supreme court,the pentagon,or any of the more than military recruiting stations in this country.they could have returned to the maryland state house or the united states naval academy,where they had been the day before.they could have selected any public road where pedestrians are allowed.there are more than miles of public roads in the united states they could have staged their protest in a public park.there are more than public parks in this country they could have chosen any catholic church where no funeral was taking place.there are nearly catholic churches in the united states but of course,a small group picketing at any of these locations would have probably gone unnoticed.
the westboro baptist church,however,has devised a strategy that remedies this problem.as the court notes,church members have protested at nearly military funerals.ante,at.they have also picketed the funerals of police officers firefighters and the victims of natural disasters accidents and shocking crimes and in advance of these protests,they issue press releases to ensure that their protests will attract public attention 
this strategy works because it is expected that respondents verbal assaults will wound the family and friends of the deceased and because the media is irresistibly drawn to the sight of persons who are visibly in grief.the more outrageous the funeral protest,the more publicity the westboro baptist church is able to obtain.thus,when the church recently announced its intention to picket the funeral of a girl killed in the shooting spree in tucson proclaiming that she was better off dead their announcement was national news and the church was able to obtain free air time on the radio in exchange for canceling its protest similarly,in,the church got air time on a talk radio show in exchange for canceling its threatened protest at the funeral of five amish girls killed by a crazed gunman 
in this case,respondents implemented the westboro baptist church strategy.their press release stated that they were going to picket the funeral of lance matthew snyder because god almighty killed lance snyder.he died in shame,not honor for a fag nation cursed by god.now in hell sine die.supp.app.in.this announcement guaranteed that matthew funeral would be transformed into a raucous media event and began the wounding process.it is well known that anticipation may heighten the effect of a painful event.
on the day of the funeral,respondents,true to their word,displayed placards that conveyed the message promised in their press release.signs stating god hates you and thank god for dead soldiers reiterated the message that god had caused matthew death in retribution for his sins.app.to brief for appellants in,hereinafter app.others,stating you going to hell and not blessed just cursed,conveyed the message that matthew was in hell sine die.at.
even if those who attended the funeral were not alerted in advance about respondents intentions,the meaning of these signs would not have been missed.since respondents chose to stage their protest at matthew snyder funeral and not at any of the other countless available venues,a reasonable person would have assumed that there was a connection between the messages on the placards and the deceased.moreover,since a church funeral is an event that naturally brings to mind thoughts about the afterlife,some of respondents signs,god hates you,not blessed just cursed,and you going to hell would have likely been interpreted as referring to god judgment of the deceased.
other signs would most naturally have been understood as suggesting falsely that matthew was gay.homosexuality was the theme of many of the signs.there were signs reading god hates fags,semper fi fags,fags doom nations,and fag troops.at.another placard depicted two men engaging in anal intercourse.a reasonable bystander seeing those signs would have likely concluded that they were meant to suggest that the deceased was a homosexual.
after the funeral,the westboro picketers reaffirmed the meaning of their protest.they posted an online account entitled the burden of marine lance matthew snyder.the visit of westboro baptist church to help the inhabitants of maryland connect the dots at belying any suggestion that they had simply made general comments about homosexuality,the catholic church,and the united states military,the epic addressed the snyder family directly 
god blessed you,and snyder,with a resource and his name was matthew.he was an arrow in your quiver in thanks to god for the comfort the child could bring you,you had a duty to prepare that child to serve the lord his god period you did just the opposite you raised him for the devil.
albert and julie ripped that body apart and taught matthew to defy his creator,to divorce,and to commit adultery.they taught him how to support the largest pedophile machine in the history of the entire world,the roman catholic monstrosity.every dime they gave the roman catholic monster they condemned their own souls.they also,in supporting satanic catholicism,taught matthew to be an idolater.
then after all that they sent him to fight for the united states of sodom,a filthy country that is in lock step with his evil,wicked,and sinful manner of life,putting him in the cross hairs of a god that is so mad he has smoke coming from his nostrils and fire from his mouth how dumb was that at.
in light of this evidence,it is abundantly clear that respondents,going far beyond commentary on matters of public concern,specifically attacked matthew snyder because he was a catholic and he was a member of the united states military.both matthew and petitioner were private figures and this attack was not speech on a matter of public concern.while commentary on the catholic church or the united states military constitutes speech on matters of public concern,speech regarding matthew snyder purely private conduct does not.
justice breyer provides an apt analogy to a case in which the first amendment would permit recovery in tort for a verbal attack 
s uppose that a were physically to assault b,knowing that the assault being newsworthy would provide a with an opportunity to transmit to the public his views on a matter of public concern.the constitutionally protected nature of the end would not shield a use of unlawful,unprotected means.and in some circumstances the use of certain words as means would be similarly unprotected.ante,at concurring opinion.
this captures what respondents did in this case.indeed,this is the strategy that they have routinely employed and that they will now continue to employ inflicting severe and lasting emotional injury on an ever growing list of innocent victims.
the court concludes that respondents speech was protected by the first amendment for essentially three reasons,but none is sound.
first and most important the court finds that the overall thrust and dominant theme of their demonstration spoke to broad public issues.ante,at.as i have attempted to show,this portrayal is quite inaccurate respondents attack on matthew was of central importance.but in any event,i fail to see why actionable speech should be immunized simply because it is interspersed with speech that is protected.the first amendment allows recovery for defamatory statements that are interspersed with nondefamatory statements on matters of public concern,and there is no good reason why respondents attack on matthew snyder and his family should be treated differently.
second,the court suggests that respondents personal attack on matthew snyder is entitled to first amendment protection because it was not motivated by a private grudge,see ante,at,but i see no basis for the strange distinction that the court appears to draw.respondents motivation to increase publicity for its views,ibid.did not transform their statements attacking the character of a private figure into statements that made a contribution to debate on matters of public concern.nor did their motivation soften the sting of their attack.and as far as culpability is concerned,one might well think that wounding statements uttered in the heat of a private feud are less,not more,blameworthy than similar statements made as part of a cold and calculated strategy to slash a stranger as a means of attracting public attention.
third,the court finds it significant that respondents protest occurred on a public street,but this fact alone should not be enough to preclude iied liability.to be sure,statements made on a public street may be less likely to satisfy the elements of the iied tort than statements made on private property,but there is no reason why a public street in close proximity to the scene of a funeral should be regarded as a zone in which otherwise actionable verbal attacks are shielded from liability.if the first amendment permits the states to protect their residents from the harm inflicted by such attacks and the court does not hold otherwise then the location of the tort should not be dispositive.a physical assault may occur without trespassing it is no defense that the perpetrator had the right to be where he was.see ante,at.and the same should be true with respect to unprotected speech.neither classic fighting words nor defamatory statements are immunized when they occur in a public place,and there is no good reason to treat a verbal assault based on the conduct or character of a private figure like matthew snyder any differently.
one final comment about the opinion of the court is in order.the court suggests that the wounds inflicted by vicious verbal assaults at funerals will be prevented or at least mitigated in the future by new laws that restrict picketing within a specified distance of a funeral.see ante,at.it is apparent,however,that the enactment of these laws is no substitute for the protection provided by the established iied tort according to the court,the verbal attacks that severely wounded petitio
