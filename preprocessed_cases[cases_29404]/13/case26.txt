in response to an ongoing fiscal crisis,petitioner puerto rico enacted the puerto rico public corporation debt enforcement and recovery act.portions of the recovery act mirror chapters and of the federal bankruptcy code and enable puerto rico public utility corporations to restructure their climbing debt.respondents,a group of investment funds and utility bondholders,sought to enjoin the act.they contended,among other things,that a bankruptcy code provision explicitly the recovery act,see.the district court enjoined the act enforcement,and the first circuit affirmed,concluding that the bankruptcy code definition of state to include puerto rico,except for purposes of defining who may be a debtor under chapter,did not remove puerto rico from the scope of the provision.
held section of the bankruptcy code puerto rico recovery act.
a three federal municipal bankruptcy provisions are relevant here.first,the gateway provision,c,requires a chapter debtor to be an insolvent municipality that is specifically authorized by a state to be a debtor.second,the provision,expressly bars states from enacting municipal bankruptcy laws.third,the definition of state,as amended in,includes puerto rico,except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter.
b if petitioners are correct that the amended definition of state excludes puerto rico altogether from chapter,then the provision does not apply.but if respondents narrower reading is correct and the definition only precludes puerto rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek chapter relief,then puerto rico is barred from implementing its recovery act.
the bankruptcy code plain text supports respondents reading.the unambiguous language of the provision contains an express clause,the plain wording of which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.chamber of commerce of united states of america whiting.the definition provision excludes puerto rico for the single purpose of defining who may be a chapter debtor,an unmistakable reference to the gateway provision.this conclusion is reinforced by the definition use of the phrase defining who may be a debtor under chapter,which is tantamount to barring puerto rico from specifically authorizing which municipalities may file chapter petitions under the gateway provision.the text of the exclusion thus extends no further.had congress intended to exclude puerto rico from chapter altogether,including chapter provision,congress would have said so.
the amended definition of state does not exclude puerto rico from all of chapter provisions.first,puerto rico exclusion as a state for purposes of the gateway provision does not also remove puerto rico from chapter separate provision.a state that chooses under the gateway provision not to authorize a municipality to file is still bound by the provision.likewise,puerto rico is bound by the provision,even though congress has removed its authority under the gateway provision to authorize its municipalities to seek chapter relief.second,because puerto rico was not by definition excluded from chapter,both introductory clause and its proviso,the provision,continue to apply in puerto rico.finally,the argument that the recovery act is not a state law that can be is based on technical amendments to the terms creditor and debtor that are too subtle to support such a f undamental chang e in the scope of chapter provision.kellogg brown root services,united states ex rel.carter.

on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal bankruptcy code state bankruptcy laws that enable insolvent municipalities to restructure their debts over the objections of creditors and instead requires municipalities to restructure such debts under chapter of the code.we must decide whether puerto rico is a state for purposes of this provision.we hold that it is.
the bankruptcy code has long included puerto rico as a state,but in congress amended the definition of state to exclude puerto rico for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter.bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act,j,stat,now codified at.puerto rico interprets this amended definition to mean that chapter no longer applies to it,so it is no longer a state for purposes of chapter provision.we hold that congress exclusion of puerto rico from the definition of a state in the amended definition does not sweep so broadly.by excluding puerto rico for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter,emphasis added,the code prevents puerto rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek chapter relief.without that authorization,puerto rico municipalities can not qualify as chapter debtors.c.but puerto rico remains a state for other purposes related to chapter,including that chapter provision.that provision bars puerto rico from enacting its own municipal bankruptcy scheme to restructure the debt of its insolvent public utilities companies.
puerto rico and its instrumentalities are in the midst of a fiscal crisis.more than billion of puerto rico climbing debt is shared by three public utilities companies the puerto rico electric power authority,the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority,and the puerto rico highways and transportation authority.for the fiscal year ending in,the three public utilities operated with a combined deficit of million.the government development bank for puerto rico bank the commonwealth bank and fiscal agent has previously provided financing to enable the utilities to continue operating without defaulting on their debt obligations.but the bank now faces a fiscal crisis of its own.as of fiscal year,it had loaned nearly half of its assets to puerto rico and its public utilities.puerto rico access to capital markets has also been severely compromised since ratings agencies downgraded puerto rican bonds,including the utilities,to noninvestment grade in.
puerto rico responded to the fiscal crisis by enacting the puerto rico corporation debt enforcement and recovery act recovery act in,which enables the commonwealth public utilities to implement a recovery or restructuring plan for their debt.laws.see generally mcgowen,puerto rico adopts a debt recovery act for its public corporations,pratt bkrtcy.law.chapter of the recovery act creates a consensual debt modification procedure that permits the public utilities to propose changes to the terms of the outstanding debt instruments,for example,changing the interest rate or the maturity date of the debt.laws,at.in conjunction with the debt modification,the public utility must also propose a recovery plan to bring it back to financial.ibid.the debt modification binds all creditors so long as those holding at least of affected debt participate in or consent to a vote regarding the modifications,and the participating creditors holding at least of affected debt approve the modifications,at.chapter of the recovery act,on the other hand,mirrors chapters and of the federal bankruptcy code by creating a restructuring process intended to offer the best solution for the broadest group of creditors.see,at.creditors holding of an affected class of debt must participate in the vote to approve the restructuring plan,and half of those participants must agree to the plan,at.
a group of investment funds,including the franklin california trust,and bluemountain capital management,llc,brought separate suits against puerto rico and various government officials,including agents of the bank,to enjoin the enforcement of the recovery act.collectively,the plaintiffs hold nearly billion in bonds issued by the electric power authority,one of the distressed utilities.the complaints alleged,among other claims,that the federal bankruptcy code prohibited puerto rico from implementing its own municipal bankruptcy scheme.
the district court consolidated the suits and ruled in the plaintiffs favor on their claim.supp.pr.the court concluded that the provision in chapter of the federal bankruptcy code,precluded puerto rico from implementing the recovery act and enjoined its enforcement.supp,at.
the first circuit affirmed.the court examined the amendment to the definition of state in the federal bankruptcy code,which includes puerto rico as a state for purposes of the code except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter.at quoting emphasis added.the court concluded that the amendment did not remove puerto rico from the scope of the provision and held that the provision barred the recovery act,at.the court opined that it was up to congress,not puerto rico,to decide when the companies could seek bankruptcy relief,at.
we granted the commonwealth petitions for writs of certiorari.
these cases require us to parse three provisions of the bankruptcy code the who may be a debtor provision requiring states to authorize municipalities to seek chapter relief,c,the provision barring states from enacting their own municipal bankruptcy schemes,and the definition of state,we first explain the text and history of these provisions.we then conclude that puerto rico is still a state for purposes of the provision and hold that this provision the recovery act.
the constitution empowers congress to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the united states.art.i,cl.congress first exercised that power by enacting a series of temporary bankruptcy acts beginning in,which gave way to a permanent federal bankruptcy scheme in.see an act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the united states,stat.hanover nat.bank moyses.but congress did not enter the field of municipal bankruptcy until when it enacted the precursor to chapter,a chapter of the code enabling an insolvent municipality,meaning a political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a state,to restructure municipal debts.see mcconnell picker,when cities go broke a conceptual introduction to municipal bankruptcy,chi.
congress has tailored the federal municipal bankruptcy laws to preserve the states reserved powers over their municipalities.this court struck down congress first attempt to enable the states political subdivisions to file for federal bankruptcy relief after concluding that it infringed the states powers to manage their own affairs.ashton cameron county water improvement dist.no.one.congress tried anew in,and the court upheld the amended statute as an appropriate balance of federal and state power.see united states bekins.critical to the court constitutional analysis was that the state had first authorized its instrumentality to seek relief under the federal bankruptcy laws.see,at.
still today,the provision of the bankruptcy code defining who may be a debtor under chapter,which we refer to here as the gateway provision,requires the states to authorize their municipalities to seek relief under chapter before the municipalities may file a chapter petition 
who may be a debtor 
c an entity may be a debtor under chapter of this title if and only if such entity 
is a municipality 
is specifically authorized,in its capacity as a municipality or by name,to be a debtor under such chapter by state law,or by a governmental officer or organization empowered by state law to authorize such entity to be a debtor under such chapter 
the states powers are not unlimited,however.the federal bankruptcy laws changed again in to bar the states from enacting their own municipal bankruptcy schemes.the amendment overturned this court holding in faitoute iron steel asbury park,rejecting contention that congress occupied the field of municipal bankruptcy law.in faitoute,the court held that federal bankruptcy laws did not new jersey municipal bankruptcy scheme,which required municipalities to seek relief under state law before resorting to the federal municipal bankruptcy scheme.ibid.to override faitoute,congress enacted a provision expressly state municipal bankruptcy laws.act of july,stat.
the express provision,central to these cases,is now codified with some stylistic changes in 
reservation of state power to control municipalities 
this chapter does not limit or impair the power of a state to control,by legislation or otherwise,a municipality of or in such state in the exercise of the political or governmental powers of such municipality,including expenditures for such exercise,but 
a state law prescribing a method of composition of indebtedness of such municipality may not bind any creditor that does not consent to such composition and 
a judgment entered under such a law may not bind a creditor that does not consent to such composition.
the third provision of the bankruptcy code at issue is the definition of state,which has included puerto rico since it became a territory of the united states in.the first federal bankruptcy act,also enacted in,defined states to include the territories,the indian territory,alaska,and the district of columbia.stat.when congress recodified the bankruptcy laws to form the federal bankruptcy code in,the definition of state dropped out of the definitional section.see generally bankruptcy reform act,stat.congress then amended the code to reincorporate the definition of state in,stat,now codified at.the amended definition includes puerto rico as a state for purposes of the code with one exception 
definitions 
the term state includes the district of columbia and puerto rico,except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter of this title.
it is our task to determine the effect of the amended definition of state on the code other provisions governing chapter proceedings.we must decide whether,in light of the amended definition,puerto rico is no longer a state only for purposes of the gateway provision,which requires states to authorize their municipalities to seek chapter relief,or whether puerto rico is also no longer a state for purposes of the provision.
the parties do not dispute that,before,puerto rico was a state for purposes of chapter provision.accordingly,before,federal law would have the recovery act because it is a state law prescribing a method of composition of indebtedness for puerto rico instrumentalities that would bind nonconsenting creditors.
the parties part ways,however,in deciphering how the amendment to the definition of state affected the provision.petitioners interpret the amended definition of state to exclude puerto rico altogether from chapter.if petitioners are correct,then the provision does not apply to them.puerto rico,in other words,may enact its own municipal bankruptcy scheme without running afoul of the code.respondents,on the other hand,read the amended definition narrowly.they contend that the definition precludes puerto rico from specifically authoriz ing its municipalities to seek relief,as required by the gateway provision,c,but that puerto rico is no less a state for purposes of the provision than the other state s,as that term is defined in the code.if respondents are correct,then the provision applies to puerto rico and bars it from enacting the recovery act.
respondents have the better reading.we hold that puerto rico is still a state for purposes of the provision.the amendment precludes puerto rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek relief under chapter,but it does not remove puerto rico from the reach of chapter provision.
the plain text of the bankruptcy code begins and ends our analysis.resolving whether puerto rico is a state for purposes of the provision begins with the language of the statute itself,and that is also where the inquiry should end,for the statute language is plain.united states ron pair enterprises.and because the statute contains an express clause,we do not invoke any presumption against but instead focus on the plain wording of the clause,which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.chamber of commerce of united states of america whiting,internal quotation marks omitted see also gobeille liberty mut.ins,slip,at.
the amended definition of state excludes puerto rico for the single purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter of this title.emphasis added.that exception unmistakably refers to the gateway provision in,titled who may be a debtor.section c begins,an entity may be a debtor under chapter of this title if and only if c.we interpret congress use of the who may be a debtor language in the amended definition of state to mean that congress intended to exclude puerto rico from this gateway provision delineating who may be a debtor under chapter.see,sullivan stroop,reading same term used in different parts of the same act to have the same meaning see also northcross board of ed.of memphis city schools,per curiam s imilarity of language is a strong indication that the two statutes should be interpreted pari passu puerto rico,therefore,is not a state for purposes of the gateway provision,so it can not perform the single function of the state s under that provision to specifically authoriz e municipalities to seek chapter relief.c.as a result,puerto rico municipalities can not satisfy the requirements of chapter gateway provision until congress intervenes.
the amended definition use of the term defining also confirms our conclusion that the amended definition excludes puerto rico as a state for purposes of the gateway provision.the definition specifies that puerto rico is not a state for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter.emphasis added.to define is to decide upon,oxford english dictionary ed,or to settle or to establish or prescribe authoritatively,black law dictionary ed.as discussed,a state role under the gateway provision is to do just that the state must define or decide upon which entities may seek chapter relief.barring puerto rico from defining who may be a debtor under chapter is tantamount to barring puerto rico from specifically authorizing which municipalities may file chapter petitions under the gateway provision.the amended definition of state unequivocally excludes puerto rico as a state for purposes of the gateway provision.
the text of the definition extends no further.the exception excludes puerto rico only for purposes of the gateway provision.puerto rico is no less a state for purposes of the provision than it was before congress amended the definition.the code provision has prohibited states and territories defined as states from enacting their own municipal bankruptcy schemes for years.see stat.overturning faitoute,at.had congress intended to alter th is fundamental detai l of municipal bankruptcy,we would expect the text of the amended definition to say so.whitman american trucking.congress does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.ibid.
the dissent,adopting many of petitioners arguments,reads the amended definition to say what it does not that for the purpose of chapter,puerto rico is not a state.the arguments in support of that capacious reading are unavailing.
first,the dissent agrees with petitioners view that the exclusion of puerto rico as a state for purposes of the gateway provision effectively removed puerto rico from all of chapter.see post,at opinion of sotomayor.to be sure,c and the surrounding subsections serve an important gatekeeping role.those provisions specify who qualifies and who does not qualify as a debtor under the various chapters of the code.toibb radloff.for instance,a railroad must file under chapter,not chapter,b,d,whereas only family farmer s or family fisherm e n may file under chapter.the provision delineating who may be a debtor under chapter is no exception.only municipalities may file under chapter,and only if the state has specifically authorized the municipality to do so.c see also mcconnell picker,chi,at discussing the gatekeeping requirements for chapter.
that puerto rico is not a state for purposes of the gateway provision,however,says nothing about whether puerto rico is a state for the other provisions of chapter involving the states.the states do not pass through the gateway provision.post,at.the gateway provision is instead directed at the debtors themselves the municipalities,in the case of chapter bankruptcy.a municipality that can not secure state authorization to file a chapter petition is excluded from chapter entirely.but the same can not be said about the state in which that municipality is located.a state only role under the gateway provision is to provide that authoriz ation to file.c.the provision then imposes an additional requirement the states may not enact their own municipal bankruptcy schemes.a state that chooses not to authorize its municipalities to seek chapter relief under the gateway provision is no less bound by that provision.here too,puerto rico is no less bound by the provision even though congress has removed its authority to provide authorization for its municipalities to file chapter petitions.again,if it were congress intent to also exclude puerto rico as a state for purposes of that provision,it would have said so.
second,both petitioners and the dissent place great weight on the introductory clause of.post,at.the provision can not apply to puerto rico,so goes the argument,because it is a proviso to introductory clause,which they posit is inapplicable to puerto rico.the introductory clause affirms that chapter does not limit or impair the power of a state to control its municipalit ies.the dissent surmises that this clause is irrelevant and meaningless in puerto rico.post,at.because puerto rico municipalities are ineligible for chapter relief,chapter can not affec t puerto rico control over its municipalities,according to the dissent.ibid.in other words,there is no power for the introductory clause to reserve for puerto rico use.ibid.petitioners likewise contend that it would be nonsensical for congress to provide puerto rico with a shield against intrusion by a chapter that,by definition,can have no effect on puerto rico.brief for petitioner commonwealth of puerto rico et in.so it follows that the provision,the proviso to that clause,can not apply either.ibid.
this reading rests on the faulty assumption that puerto rico is,by definition,excluded from chapter.ibid.for all of the reasons already explained,see part,supra,it is not.the amended definition of state precludes puerto rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek chapter relief.but puerto rico is no less a state for purposes of introductory clause and its proviso.both continue to apply in puerto rico.they are neither irrelevant nor meaningless.post,at.if,for example,congress created a path for the puerto rican municipalities to restructure their debts under chapter,then would assure puerto rico,no less a state for purposes of this section,of its continued power to control,by legislation or otherwise,its municipalit ies in the exercise of the political or governmental powers of such municipalit ies.
third,the government development bank contends that the recovery act does not run afoul of the provision because the recovery act does not bind nonconsenting creditors,as the bankruptcy code now defines that term.in,congress redefined creditor to mean an entity that has a claim against the debtor stat,now codified at emphasis added.a debtor,in turn,is a person or municipality concerning which a case under this title has been commenced.at,now codified at emphasis added.in light of these definitions,the bank contends that the puerto rican municipalities are not debtor s as the code defines the term because they can not commenc e an action under chapter without authorization from puerto rico.brief for petitioner et.and because respondents can not be creditors of a nonexistent debtor,the recovery act is not a state law that binds any creditor.at.
tellingly,the dissent does not adopt this reading.the bank interpretation would nullify the provision.applying the bank logic,a municipality that fails to meet any one of the requirements of chapter gatekeeping provision is not a debtor and would have no creditors.so a state could refuse to specifically authoriz e its municipalities to seek relief under chapter,c,required to commence a case under that chapter.that state would be free to enact its own municipal bankruptcy scheme because its municipalities would have no creditors under federal law.the technical amendments to the definitions of creditor and debtor are too subtle a move to support such a f undamental chang e in the scope of chapter provision.kellogg brown root services,united states ex rel.carter,slip,at.
the dissent concludes that the government and people of puerto rico should not have to wait for possible congressional action to avert the consequences of the commonwealth fiscal crisis.post,at.but our constitutional structure does not permit this court to rewrite the statute that congress has enacted.dodd united states,see also electric storage battery shimadzu.that statute precludes puerto rico from authorizing its municipalities to seek relief under chapter.but it does not remove puerto rico from the scope of chapter provision.federal law,therefore,the recovery act.the judgment of the court of appeals for the first circuit is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

chapter of the federal bankruptcy code allows states municipalities cities,utilities,levee boards,and the like to file for federal bankruptcy with their state authorization.but the code excludes puerto rican municipalities from accessing federal bankruptcy,c.because of this bar,puerto rico enacted its own law in the recovery act to allow its utilities to restructure their significant debts outside the federal bankruptcy process.
the court today holds that puerto rico recovery act is barred by of chapter of the bankruptcy code,which prohibits states from creating their own bankruptcy processes for their insolvent municipalities.because puerto rican municipalities can not access chapter federal bankruptcy process,however,a nonfederal bankruptcy solution is not merely a parallel option it is the only existing legal option for puerto rico to restructure debts that could cripple its citizens.the structure of the code and the language and purpose of demonstrate that puerto rico municipal debt restructuring law should not be read to be prohibited by chapter.
i respectfully dissent.
the commonwealth of puerto rico and its municipalities are in the middle of a fiscal crisis.ante,at.the combined debt of puerto rico three main public utilities exceeds billion.these utilities provide power,water,sewer,and transportation to residents of the island.with rising interest rates and limited access to capital markets,their debts are proving unserviceable.soon,puerto rico and the utilities contend,they will be unable to pay for things like fuel to generate electricity,which will lead to rolling blackouts.other vital public services will be imperiled,including the utilities ability to provide safe drinking water,maintain roads,and operate public transportation.
when debtors face untenable debt loads,bankruptcy is the primary tool the law uses to forge workable solutions.by requiring a debtor and creditors to negotiate together and forcing both sides to make concessions within the limits set by law,bankruptcy gives the debtor a fresh start,discourages creditors from racing each other to sue the debtor,prohibits a small number of holdout creditors from blocking a compromise,protects important creditor rights such as the prioritization of debts,and allows all parties to find equitable and efficient solutions to fiscal problems.see marrama citizens bank of,young higbee.
these concerns are starkly presented in the context of municipal entities like public utilities.while a business corporation can use bankruptcy to reorganize,and,if that fails,fold up shop and liquidate all of its assets,governments can not shut down power plants,water,hospitals,sewers,and trains and leave citizens to fend for themselves.a fresh start can help not only the unfortunate individual debtor but also and perhaps especially the unfortunate municipality and its people.see united states bekins.
congress has excluded the municipalities of puerto rico and the district of columbia from the federal municipal bankruptcy scheme in chapter of the bankruptcy code.see,c.so,in,the puerto rican government enacted the puerto rico public corporation debt enforcement and recovery act recovery act or act.laws.the act authorizes puerto rico public utilities to restructure their debts while continuing to provide essential public services like electricity and water.portions of the act mirror chapter of the bankruptcy code and allow puerto rico utilities to renegotiate their debts with their creditors.see ante,at.like a restructuring plan filed under chapter,a restructuring plan under the recovery act that is approved by at least a majority of creditors and a court would be binding on all creditors,including objecting holdouts.
after the recovery act was signed into law,mutual funds and hedge funds holding bonds of the puerto rico electric power authority filed two lawsuits seeking to enjoin puerto rico enforcement of the act.the district court held that the recovery act could not be enforced because,inter alia,it was prohibited by of the bankruptcy code.the first circuit agreed that the act,and did not address whether some provisions of the act might be unlawful for other reasons.this court now affirms.
bankruptcy is not a process.the federal bankruptcy code sets out specific procedures and governing law for each type of entity that seeks bankruptcy protection.to see how this approach works,consider the structure of the code in more depth.
chapter is the starting point.it sets out how to read the code.see et.for example,sets out general definitions,and provides rules of construction.now skip ahead to,titled,who may be a debtor.that section tells debtors and the interested parties in their bankruptcy which specific bankruptcy laws apply to them.for example,tells an ordinary person seeking to restructure her debts to do so using the rules outlined in chapter,b,or those enumerated in chapter,e.it tells a family farm or fisherman to use the rules outlined in chapter.f.certain corporations can use chapter,b,or chapter,d.and a municipality bankruptcy is governed by the rules in chapter.c.
because tells different kinds of debtors which bodies of bankruptcy law apply to them,the court has described that section as a gateway provision.ante,at.once an entity meets the eligibility requirements for a specific gateway set out in and elects to pass through that gateway,it becomes subject to the relevant chapter of the code,or.the debtor,its creditors,and any other interested parties are governed only by that chapter and the chapters of the bankruptcy code like chapter that apply to all cases.see collier pamphlet edition,bankruptcy code,a s a general rule,the provisions of the particular chapter apply only in that chapter 
interpreting statutory provisions in the context of the operative chapters in the bankruptcy code in which they appear is not unusual it is how the code is designed to work.for example,both chapter and chapter require the debtor to file a plan proposing how the court should reorganize its debts.compare the plan under chapter with the plan under chapter.but no bankruptcy court or practitioner would suggest that a chapter plan also has to satisfy the requirements of chapter.the code is read in context.
these cases concern gateway for municipalities.that provision says that a municipality may file for bankruptcy under chapter if and only if it meets five eligibility criteria.the debtor must be a municipality,c be specifically authorized by state law to seek bankruptcy restructuring,c be insolvent,c have a desir e to effect a plan to adjust its debts,c and have attempted to negoti
