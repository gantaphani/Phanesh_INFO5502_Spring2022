background 
in july,hertel avenue associates,llc hertel secured a judgment lien against tanya calloway calloway home in buffalo,new york.hertel docketed the judgment in the erie county clerk office on july.five years later,another creditor obtained a judgment lien against the same property,which it docketed in december.calloway estimates the current value of her property to be.the property is encumbered by a mortgage with a remaining balance of approximately,leaving her around in equity.
on may,calloway filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in that proceeding,calloway moved to avoid the judgment liens against her residence pursuant to new york homestead exemption.the exemption protects a debtor principal residence from being used to satisfy a creditor judgment up to a statutorily defined maximum value.after standing at from to,see laws ch,the homestead exemption limit has been modified twice in recent years in,new york legislature raised the limit to,laws ch,and in the legislature again modified the exemption,bringing it to its present form,which provides a baseline exemption of that is adjusted upward for certain counties,see laws ch.
in the bankruptcy court,hertel acknowledged that calloway was entitled to claim the homestead exemption,but disputed which version of the exemption should apply calloway claimed the exemption in effect when she filed for bankruptcy in,while hertel contended that the bankruptcy court should apply the lower,exemption in effect when it perfected its judgment lien in.specifically,hertel argued that the amendment should be interpreted to apply only to judgment liens perfected after its effective date because retroactive interpretations are disfavored and the amendment did not explicitly provide that it should be applied to judgment liens.further,hertel also argued that were the amendment interpreted to apply to judgment liens perfected prior to its effective date,this limitation on hertel ability to collect on its judgment lien would constitute an unconstitutional taking of its property in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.
the bankruptcy court bucki,rejected hertel contentions and concluded that calloway was entitled to the homestead exemption in effect at the time of her bankruptcy filing.in re calloway.in so holding,the bankruptcy court relied on cfcu community credit union hayward,cir,in which this court determined that the amendment applies retroactively even to debts that preceded its enactment.although,unlike the creditor in hayward,hertel reduced the debt to a perfected judgment lien prior to the amendment,the bankruptcy court concluded that this made no difference.in its view,the amendment immediately increased the exemption to as to all creditors and all obligations,regardless of whether the creditor had reduced the debt to judgment prior to its enactment.in re calloway,at.as to hertel takings clause challenge,the bankruptcy court concluded that there had been no taking of hertel property because,under new york law,judgment liens are not vested property interests.id.at citing watson cent.the district court skretny,affirmed on substantially the same grounds,adding that even were a judgment lien a property interest protected by the takings clause,the amendment effect on hertel lien did not constitute a taking.hertel,llc calloway,no.cv,slip op.at.
on appeal to this court,hertel reiterates its arguments that the amendment should be interpreted to apply only to judgment liens perfected after its enactment and if the amendment does apply to judgmenent liens,the result is an unconstitutional taking of its property in violation of the fifth amendment.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the order of the district court 
new york has provided a homestead exemption for more than years.see laws ch.the exemption protect s a homeowner against seizure of his or her dwelling to satisfy a money judgment,capital bus.asset funding hakakian,dep t,and reflects a legislative decision to provide an honest debtor with a fresh start and avoid leaving the debtor and his family homeless and on the brink of financial ruin,westinghouse credit cent.trust.rochester,in re leonardo,accord robinson wiley,opinion of johnson.
consistent with the statute purpose,new york legislature has amended the homestead exemption from time to time to ensure that its protections keep pace with homeowners changing needs.the exemption was amended in,for example,to protect condominium apartments,laws ch,and again in to add mobile home s to the list of protectable homesteads,laws ch.to account for rising home values,the legislature has also periodically increased the exemption limit from to in to in to in and to with upward adjustments for counties in see laws ch.laws ch.laws ch.laws ch.
at issue in this case is the amendment,which increased the homestead exemption limit from to and provided as follows 
exemption of homestead.property of one of the following types,not exceeding fifty thousand dollars in value above liens and encumbrances,owned and occupied as a principal residence,is exempt from application to the satisfaction of a money judgment,unless the judgment was recovered wholly for the purchase price thereof 
a lot of land with a dwelling thereon,
shares of stock in a cooperative apartment corporation,
units of a condominium apartment,or 
a mobile home.
laws ch.although the amendment included language directing that t his act shall take effect immediately,laws ch,the amendment did not specify whether its immediate effect was to protect a debtor homestead from all obligations,even those incurred before the amendment was passed,or only obligations postdating its enactment.
this court has once before addressed the amendment interaction with obligations,in cfcu community credit union hayward.cir.in that case,cfcu held a claim against the debtor based on a car loan secured by an automobile valued at only,which left cfcu a general unsecured creditor for the remaining.hayward,at.cfcu argued that because the homestead exemption in effect at the time of the car loan provided only of protection,the debtor was entitled only to that exemption and not the higher exemption set forth in the amendment.id.
following an analysis of the amendment legislative history,the hayward court concluded that a new york debtor ability to invoke the increased homestead exemption is determined not by the date the debtor unsecured contract debt was incurred,but rather,by the date upon which the debtor files his or her bankruptcy petition.id.at.noting that retroactive interpretations are generally disfavored,the court nonetheless applied the increased exemption to an existing obligation because the clear purpose of the legislation was to provide immediate relief to homeowners and because the legislature had evinced its intent that the statute apply to liens by choosing not to carry over into the amendment language from the prior homestead exemption that had specifically included an provision 
in light of the legislative finding that the increased exemption amount was long overdue and that the old amount was unrealistic in today economy,it would defeat the intent of the legislature to judicially engraft an provision similar to that found in the amendment onto the statute where none exists if the legislature intended the amendment to be prospective only it could easily have carried over the language from the amendment.
whether the amendment applies to judgment liens 
although hayward clarified that the amendment increased homestead exemption applies even to debts that predate the amendment,the court did not address whether the amendment applies where,prior to the amendment enactment,a creditor has reduced a debt to judgment and perfected a judgment lien on the debtor residential property.because cfcu had not reduced the debt to a judgment,the hayward court had no reason to reach the issue.see id.at.
this case places the issue squarely before us.hertel obtained a judgment against calloway and secured a judgment lien against her home in july,when the homestead exemption limit still stood at.we must therefore determine whether,when calloway filed for bankruptcy on may,she was entitled to the full homestead protection of the amendment even as to a debt reduced to judgment prior to the statute enactment.hertel argues that the statute should be interpreted not to apply to judgment liens obtained prior to the amendment because interpretations that retroactively affect vested interests are generally disfavored and to avoid the constitutional question of whether the legislation effect on judgment liens constitutes an unconstitutional taking of its property in violation of the fifth amendment.
it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that retroactive operation is not favored by courts and statutes will not be given such construction unless the language expressly or by necessary implication requires it.majewski broadalbin perth cent.sch.however,it is also fundamental that a court,in interpreting a statute,should attempt to effectuate the intent of the legislature.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the presumption against retroactivity and other principles of construction are merely navigational tools to discern legislative intent.id.at.m axims of statutory construction provide helpful guideposts,but the reach of a statute ultimately becomes a matter of judgment made upon review of the legislative goal.duell condon.where a statute is unclear as to its retroactive effect,factors relevant to the retroactivity analysis include whether the legislature has made a specific pronouncement about retroactive effect or conveyed a sense of urgency whether the statute was designed to rewrite an unintended judicial interpretation and whether the enactment itself reaffirms a legislative judgment about what the law in question should be.in re gleason michael vee.
although the legislature made no specific pronouncement as to the amendment effect on debts,the statute legislative history reflects a clear sense of urgency that the homestead exemption limit be immediately adjusted to bring it in line with modern home values.the memoranda submitted by the amendment sponsors in the senate and assembly noted that the exemption limit had not been updated since and was not at all realistic in today economy.spons,spons.the memoranda further explained that hav ing the figure so low is tantamount to having no exemption at all and proposed a exemption as a much more realistic figure.id.
to provide immediate relief to debtors whose homesteads were underprotected by the outdated exemption limit,the amendment explicitly provided that t his act shall take effect immediately.laws ch.the statute directive that it take effect immediately is not itself enough to require retroactive application,but it does evince a sense of urgency on the part of the legislature that the benefit of the increased homestead exemption be available to debtors as soon as possible.see majewski,at.the amendment specification that it take effect immediately is particularly striking given that the effective date of statute it replaced,the amendment,had been intentionally crafted to avoid any effect on debts.section of the amendment provided that t his act shall take effect ninety days after it shall have become a law,but shall not affect the application of property to the satisfaction of a money judgment for a debt contracted before it takes effect.laws ch,emphasis added.the legislature chose not to carry over the provision of the amendment to the amendment and instead replaced it with an instruction that the statute have immediate effect.
hayward relied on these indicia of legislative purpose to conclude that a debtor may invoke the amendment increased homestead exemption even as to unsecured debts.nothing in the legislative history suggests that the legislature intended a different rule to apply where the creditor has reduced the debt to a judgment and obtained a judgment lien.in fact,the statute legislative history further evinces the legislature intent to apply the amendment to judgment liens.as noted above,in the legislature increased the homestead exemption limit to or higher for certain counties.law ch.the amendment provided that t his act shall take effect on the thirtieth day,after it shall become a law and shall apply to the satisfaction of judgments on or after such date.emphasis added.by expressly stating the amendment would apply to the satisfaction of judgments on or after its effective date,the legislature made clear that the increased exemption limits would apply to judgments obtained prior to the effective date,since a party necessarily must have a judgment before seeking to satisfy it.
the fact that the legislature,presumably aware of hayward and alerted to the retroactivity question,arbegast bd.of educ.of new berlin cent,resolved any lingering ambiguity as to the homestead exemption retroactive effect by expressly applying the amendment to judgments supports our conclusion that the amendment is best read as making the increased homestead exemption available to all debtors who file for bankruptcy after the statute effective date,regardless of the date on which the debt was incurred or reduced to judgment or the date on which any judgment lien was perfected.
anticipating our reaffirmation of hayward,hertel argues that even if the amendment is most naturally read to apply to obligations,the canon of constitutional doubt requires the court to adopt a different interpretation as to judgment lien debts to avoid the question of whether the amendment has effected a taking of its property in violation of the fifth amendment.under the federal and new york state canons of constitutional doubt a statute must be construed,if fairly possible,so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional,but also grave doubts upon that score.tauza susquehana coal,cardozo,and almendarez torres united states,both quoting united states jin fuey moy,holmes,accord in re jacob,see also stat.law.the canon is justified partly by a presumption that legislatures are cognizant and respectful of constitutional limitations and partly by a judicial policy of minimizing confrontations between the legislative and judicial branches.see almendarez torres,at.application of the canon requires that the statute in question be genuinely susceptible to at least two interpretations and that there be a serious likelihood that the statute will be held unconstitutional absent application of the canon.
these conditions are not met in this case.even assuming that the amendment is susceptible to two plausible interpretations,there is no serious likelihood that interpreting the statute to apply to hertel judgment lien will result in the statute being held unconstitutional.for the reasons discussed above,the statute is best interpreted as applying the increased exemption limit even to judgment liens,and,although that interpretation requires the court to address a constitutional question,the takings clause issue that hertel raises does not lead us to doubt the statute constitutionality.
takings clause 
hertel argues that if the amendment is read to apply to its judgment lien,the statute effects an unconstitutional taking of its judgment lien in violation of the fifth amendment.the takings clause provides that no private property shall be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v.the clause applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment.kelo city of new london.
whether a judgment lien is a protected property interest 
before addressing hertel takings clause challenge,we must first address the threshold question of whether hertel even held a protected property interest in its judgment lien.if hertel held no property interest,the amendment can have taken none from it.
this court has never previously addressed whether a judgment lien against a judgment debtor real property constitutes a property interest protected by the fifth amendment.the bankruptcy court below,following the decisions of other bankruptcy courts in this circuit,concluded that under new york law a judgment lien against a debtor real property is not a constitutionally protected property interest.see in re calloway.
in an decision,watson new york central railroad,the new york court of appeals addressed whether a judgment lienholder was entitled to be a party to,and receive compensation from,a property seizure initiated by a railroad company pursuant to a state statute delegating to the railroad limited eminent domain power to secure its should it be unable to obtain the land it required by private contract.the court of appeals understood the statute to give a right to compensation only to property holders and reasoned that because a lienholder rights are created by statute,the lienholder holds no property interest in the land underlying the lien,and its statutory rights can be superseded at will by the legislature.id.at.watson is an old case,but its holding has never been repudiated by new york court of appeals.finding no more recent decision to the contrary,a number of bankruptcy courts in this circuit have relied on watson in recent years to reject takings clause challenges to the homestead exemption on the ground that new york law does not recognize judgment liens as protected property interests.see in re calloway,at see also in re trudell,lattimore walt tree,in re lattimore.
the crucial question in this case,however,is not whether hertel judgment lien is categorized as a property interest by new york law,but whether it constitutes a property interest for purposes of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.that determination,despite its underpinnings,is ultimately one of federal constitutional law.although the underlying substantive interest is created by an independent source such as state law,federal constitutional law determines whether that interest rises to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement protected by the due process clause.town of castle rock,gonzales,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we look first to state law to define the contours of the purported property interest,and then to federal constitutional law to determine whether that interest merits constitutional protection as a property interest.
under new york law,after a plaintiff has won a judgment against a defendant,obtaining a judgment lien against his real property is simple.the judgment creditor need only file the judgment with the county clerk of the county where the property is located a.the lien secures the judgment creditor ability to collect the judgment,by forced sale of the property if need be,by ensuring that,apart from a few statutory exceptions,no transfer by the judgment debtor of any interest in the liened property is effective against the judgment creditor.
in ford motor credit nyc police department this court held that a lienholder with a security interest in a motor vehicle seized by the new york city police department possesses a constitutionally protected property interest in the seized vehicle and may not be excluded from participation in the civil forfeiture process,cir.the court relied in part on armstrong united states,in which the supreme court similarly concluded that a mechanic lien obtained pursuant to maine law constituted a constitutionally protected property interest.like the mechanic lien at issue in armstrong,a judgment lien entitles the lienholder to force a sale of the liened property and to obtain payment in priority over other creditors.see a see also prac.cmt.mckinney explaining that a ordinarily bars sale of the realty on execution if the judgment is not a lien.and like other common property interests,a judgment lien can be freely bought,sold,and assigned.there is no reason that a judgment lien should not be entitled to similar protection.the legal rights of a judgment lienholder are obviously far fewer than those of an owner in fee simple,but a judgment lien,like other security interests,is indisputably a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.ford motor credit,at.
regulatory taking analysis 
the supreme court has recognized two branches of takings clause cases physical takings and regulatory takings see tahoe sierra council,tahoe reg l planning agency.a physical taking occurs when there is either a condemnation or a physical appropriation of property.id.a regulatory taking,by contrast,occurs where even absent a direct physical appropriation,governmental regulation of private property goes too far and is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.lingle chevron,quoting.coal mahon,holmes.because application of the amendment to liens does not present the classi c taking in which the government directly appropriates private property for its own use,enters.apfel,alteration in original,any taking in this case would be regulatory in nature.
the supreme court has generally eschewed any set formula for identifying regulatory takings,instead preferring to engage in essentially ad hoc,factual inquiries to determine in each case whether the challenged property restriction rises to the level of a taking.lucas coastal council,alterations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.paramount to the inquiry are the familiar factors set forth in penn central transportation city of new york.primary among those factors are t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and,particularly,the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations.lingle,at alteration in original quoting penn central,at.also telling,is the character of the governmental action,particularly whether it amounts to a physical invasion or appropriation of property or instead merely affects property interests through some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
although these factors govern most regulatory takings challenges,the supreme court has also identified two types of regulatory action that are treated as per se takings for fifth amendment purposes and therefore require no weighing of the penn central factors.a categorical taking occurs where a regulation compel s the property owner to suffer a physical invasion of his property or where regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land.lucas,at.
hertel argues that this case falls into the second of these two per se takings categories.it reasons that the amendment has deprived it of all economic use of its judgment lien against calloway and that the court should simply find a per se taking under lucas and forgo a detailed analysis of the penn central factors.in the alternative,hertel argues that even were we to apply penn central,those factors would weigh in favor of its takings claim.
the cases in which the supreme court has applied lucas total takings rule have involved real property,and it is unclear whether that case per se rule should be applied to purported takings of other types of property,such as intellectual property,personal property,or a security interest like that at issue here.the lucas court repeatedly referred to regulation that deprives land not property of all economically beneficial use and subsequent decisions of the circuit courts have not reached a clear consensus on how broadly to apply lucas per se rule.see a d auto sales,united states,noting the question and collecting cases.the parties have not briefed the issue,however,and its resolution is unnecessary to our decision because there has been no taking under either standard.because hertel takings claim fails for similar reasons under both tests,lucas an
