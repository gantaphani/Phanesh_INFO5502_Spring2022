defendants appellants salim randall and michael burbridge appeal from the judgment of liability of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york weinstein,judge.after a jury trial,defendants appellants were found liable for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and violation of joshua marshall right to a fair trial.they were ordered to pay damages of each.we hold that there was no error in the district court trial rulings and affirm the judgment.
background 
we assume the parties familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history and recite only those details relevant to this appeal.
on may,marshall was arrested in brooklyn by police officers randall,burbridge,and kieran fox who is not a defendant in this case.marshall was walking down a sidewalk with another man,demetrios meade,when they were approached by the officers.as the officers drew near,one of the men threw away a gun,which landed in the street.the officers arrested marshall on the charge of possessing a loaded firearm.their statements to the local district attorney resulted in a criminal complaint against marshall,and their testimony to a grand jury led to marshall indictment.marshall was released in september after four months in jail.approximately eight months after his release from jail,the judge dismissed marshall case on speedy trial grounds.
marshall then sued randall and burbridge under for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and denial of his constitutional right to a fair trial.the essence of marshall claim was that the officers lied when they said they had seen marshall throw the gun.at trial,marshall called the two officers as part of his direct case and them as hostile witnesses.marshall strategy at trial was to attack the officers credibility based on inconsistencies in their accounts of the events on the night of the arrest.
the initial police complaint and arrest report,filled out by randall,indicated only that marshall was found to be in possession of a loaded firearm.police compl.the criminal complaint filed by the kings county district attorney office similarly stated that randall observed the defendant in possession of a loaded caliber smith and wesson revolver.id.at.randall testified to the grand jury that marshall pulled a firearm out of his waist band and tossed it into the street.id.at grand jury tr.at his deposition,randall testified that he saw marshall in physical possession of the pistol w hen he reached into his pants and pulled out an object and threw it to the ground.id.at dep.tr.at trial,however,randall admitted that he never saw the gun in marshall actual physical possession,id.at trial tr,but that he saw the motion,and heard the clink when it hit the ground,id.at trial tr.
the evidence against burbridge was similar.the criminal complaint stated that burbridge recovered the revolver from the ground where burbridge observed the defendant throw it.id.at.burbridge testified to the grand jury that he observed marshall remove what appeared to be a silver firearm from his waist band and throw it under a vehicle.id.at grand jury tr.at his deposition,burbridge testified that he could not remember from which part of his waistband marshall pulled the gun,but at trial he testified that marshall pulled the gun from the center of his waistband.burbridge also gave conflicting deposition testimony about whether he saw marshall make a furtive movement before his decision to approach marshall and meade,or whether that decision had been based entirely on his recognition of marshall from a nypd database of police and arrest reports.
the jury found randall and burbridge liable on all three counts and awarded in compensatory and punitive damages against each officer.this appeal followed.
discussion 
randall and burbridge challenge three elements of the district court trial rulings the use of their grand jury testimony as violative of the rule in rehberg paulk.the lack of a jury instruction disclosing that marshall criminal case was dismissed on speedy trial grounds and the exclusion from trial of evidence that burbridge stopped marshall in part because he recognized marshall from a review of nypd arrest reports.
use of grand jury testimony 
citing rehberg,randall and burbridge argue that their grand jury testimony,admitted for impeachment purposes,was improperly used by marshall as a basis for liability.marshall responds that the use of grand jury testimony for impeachment did not violate rehberg holding that a grand jury witness has immunity from a malicious prosecution action based on the witness grand jury testimony.we hold that the grand jury testimony was properly admitted for impeachment purposes and that the manner in which it was used at trial did not contravene the rule in rehberg.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and will reverse only if an erroneous ruling affected a party substantial rights.marcic reinauer transp,cir.in general,a party is entitled to a new trial if the district court committed errors that were a clear abuse of discretion that were clearly prejudicial to the outcome of the trial,where prejudice is measured by assessing the error in light of the record as a whole.id.quotation marks omitted.a district court abuses its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.in re sims,cir quotation marks omitted.
in rehberg,the chief investigator for a local district attorney was sued in a action following rehberg indictment based on the investigator grand jury testimony.the supreme court held that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any claim based on the witness testimony.rehberg.at.it reasoned that the justifications for absolute immunity for trial witnesses also applied to grand jury witnesses in both contexts,a witness fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence.and in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent perjurious testimony.id.at see also briscoe lahue,establishing trial witness immunity.the court also noted that the subversion of grand jury secrecy was an additional supporting factor.id.at.
this case asks us to consider what the supreme court meant by any claim based on the witness testimony.id.at emphasis added.in rehberg,the plaintiff assertion of malicious prosecution liability was predicated exclusively on the allegations that the investigator lied to the grand jury.in this case,marshall presented evidence of grand jury testimony,along with among other things the police report,the officers statements to the district attorney as reflected in the criminal complaint,and the inconsistencies in deposition and trial testimony.we must determine whether the use of the officers grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes and the references to the grand jury testimony during opening and closing statements in this action nonetheless caused the action to be based on the witness grand jury testimony.
turning first to the use of grand jury testimony for impeachment,we agree with the district court that such use does not violate rehberg.evidence that is inadmissible as direct proof is frequently permitted for impeachment purposes.see,united states griffith,cir noting that there is a distinction between using evidence to prove substantive guilt and using evidence to impeach and collecting cases see also harris new york,holding that a statement made by a defendant to police in violation of miranda is inadmissible as direct evidence but admissible for impeachment purposes.and juries are often called upon to distinguish between proper and improper purposes of testimony.
when marshall questioned the officers as hostile witnesses,their grand jury testimony was admitted only to attack their credibility.the district court was explicit in its jury instruction that this testimony could not be a basis for liability a defendant can not be held liable for what he said to the grand jury.he may be held liable for what he said to the prosecutor if his statement was not in preparation for his grand jury testimony.trial tr.we have no reason t
