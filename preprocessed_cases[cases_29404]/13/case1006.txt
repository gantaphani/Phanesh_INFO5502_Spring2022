appellant center for constitutional rights ccr seeks disclosure,pursuant to the freedom of information act foia,principally by the department of defense dod and the federal bureau of investigation fbi and,jointly with the dod,the government of certain videos and photographs of a guantanamo bay detainee,mohammed,who is believed to be the hijacker in the september,terrorist attacks on the united states.
we hold that the government has met its burden of establishing that these images are exempt from disclosure pursuant to foia exemption,which authorizes of records that are properly authorized by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.b.the declarations submitted by the government establish with adequate specificity that release of images depicting one of the most guantan could logically and plausibly harm national security because these images are uniquely susceptible to use by extremists as propaganda to incite violence against united states interests domestically and abroad.
accordingly,we affirm the september,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york naomi reice buchwald,judge granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.
background 
mohammed detention 
mohammed a saudi national,has been held at guantanamo bay from february,to the present day on suspicion that he had planned to act as the hijacker of the planes used in the september,terrorist attacks on the united states,but was prevented from entering the united states in august.al qahtani detention first drew public attention in when a log of his interrogations was purloined and published in time magazine.the government subsequently made official disclosures regarding the dates and conditions of detention the involvement of the dod and fbi in his interrogation the interrogation tactics used mental,physical,and psychological response to the interrogation and eventual cooperation in a january interview published in the washington post,the dod convening authority for military commissions susan crawford,stated that treatment at guantanamo,in her opinion,met the legal definition of torture.see bob woodward,detainee tortured,says official,washington post.
b.the foia requests and responses 
on march,ccr filed foia requests with the government seeking disclosure of videos,photographs,and other recordings of at guantanamo between and.on january,after the government did not respond to the requests,ccr filed this lawsuit,purportedly with consent 
in response,dod and fbi identified records responsive to ccr requests the responsive records fbi videotapes depicting activities in his cell and his interactions with dod personnel the fbi videos one video showing two forced cell extractions of the fce video two videos showing document intelligence debriefings the debriefing videos and six of.they claimed the right to withhold the responsive records primarily under foia exemption,which exempts from disclosure records that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order.b 
the government sought to justify the invocation of exemption in three public declarations and in one classified declaration each declaration represented that the responsive records were properly classified under executive order,which pertains,in relevant part,to military plans or operations intelligence activities including covert action,intelligence sources or methods,or cryptology and foreign relations or foreign activities of the united states,including confidential sources.exec.order a,c,d.
declarant major general karl asserted that the disclosure of the responsive records could reasonably be expected to harm national security by endangering the lives and physical safety of military personnel,diplomats,and aid workers serving in afghanistan and elsewhere,and by aiding in the recruitment and financing of extremist and insurgent groups because enemy forces in afghanistan and elsewhere have previously used videos and photographs particularly of forces interacting with detainees out of context to incite the civilian population and influence government officials.as examples of images that had been used by extremist groups to recruit new members and incite violence,general horst cited images published by the media in relating to allegations of abuse of iraqi detainees in iraq and media reporting in of alleged incidents of mishandling of the koran at guantanamo.id.in addition,general horst stated that t he subject of detainee operations in iraq,afghanistan,and at guantanamo is extremely sensitive with the host nations and governments whose nationals we detain.he opined that release of any portion of the responsive records would facilitate the enemy ability to conduct information operations and could be used to increase sentiment,particularly because the images could be manipulated to show greater mistreatment than actually occurred,or change the chronology of actual events.
the government submitted ex parte an index the fbi index identifying the contents of the fbi videotapes for the district court in camera review.see 
c.the district court decision 
in a september,memorandum and order,the district court granted summary judgment for the government,approving nondisclosure of the responsive records under exemption,on the basis that it was both logical and plausible that the disclosure of any portion of the responsive records could reasonably be expected to harm national security.ctr.for constitutional rights dep t of,d.in particular,after reviewing in camera the fbi index describing the videotapes,the district court found it logical and plausible that extremists would utilize images of whether in native or manipulated formats to incite sentiment,to raise funds,to recruit other loyalists,as has occurred in the past.id.at.the district court found further that such misuse was particularly plausible in this case,which involves a detainee,the treatment of whom the convening authority for military commissions determined met the legal definition of torture.id.the court then rejected ccr argument that the extensive prior disclosures concerning undermined the government justifications.id.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
exceptions to foia general principle of broad disclosure of government records have consistently been given a narrow compass.new york times dep t of justice,l,wl,at cir.june,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the government bears the burden of demonstrating that an exemption applies to each item of information it seeks to withhold,council of la raza dep t of justice,cir,and all doubts as to the applicability of the exemption must be resolved in favor of disclosure,new york times,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we review a district court order granting summary judgment in a foia action de novo.id.an agency may carry its burden by submitting declarations giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption,and such declarations are accorded a presumption of good faith.wilner sec.agency,cir internal quotation marks omitted.when such declarations are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of agency bad faith,summary judgment for the government is warranted.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.notwithstanding the presumption in favor of disclosure,when the claimed exemption implicates national security,an agency justification for invoking a foia exemption is sufficient if it appears logical or plausible.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
at issue here is whether foia exemption is satisfied.this exemption shields from disclosure records that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order.b.the parties dispute whether the responsive records satisfied the prerequisites for classification under executive order
