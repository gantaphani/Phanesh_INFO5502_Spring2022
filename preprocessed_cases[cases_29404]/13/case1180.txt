the government appeals two interlocutory orders of the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,entered on august,and october,respectively.the first order suppressed cocaine seized from the person of defendant appellee dean steppello incident to his warrantless arrest,as well as statements made by steppello,based on a lack of probable cause to support the arrest.the order also suppressed evidence seized from steppello residence pursuant to the execution of a search warrant on the ground that without the reference to the cocaine seized from steppello person,the warrant application did not establish probable cause to search the residence.the second order denied the government motion for reconsideration of the suppression decisions in the first order.the government argues that the district court erred in determining that steppello arrest was not supported by probable cause.we agree and conclude that the evidence seized from steppello person and residence,as well as the statements made by steppello during and after his arrest,should not have been suppressed.
background 
steppello arrest 
on june,james eric jones,an investigator with the new york state police community narcotics enforcement team cnet,executed a search warrant at the residence of richard szuba.during the search,szuba agreed to cooperate with police and identified steppello as his cocaine supplier.investigator jones was aware that steppello had been the subject of an earlier drug investigation and that he had sold cocaine in the presence of a new york state trooper in november.szuba indicated that his transactions with steppello had been ongoing for approximately four years and that steppello would supply him with four ounces of cocaine in exchange for approximately every two weeks.szuba then described the coded nature of their cocaine would call steppello on his cell phone and ask are you good and steppello would deliver the cocaine to szuba residence shortly thereafter.szuba showed the police steppello residence on the second floor of a house,and described steppello vehicle as an envoy or sport utility vehicle suv 
while officers were questioning szuba at his house,others,including investigator sullivan,were surveilling steppello residence.the officers had szuba call steppello to determine whether he would be nearby because during their surveillance of steppello home,they observed a person leaving the building at approximately,investigator jones closely observed szuba call steppello,whose telephone number was preprogrammed as a speed dial number in cell phone.during the conversation,investigator jones heard szuba say you good,this afternoon,minutes.although investigator jones knew that someone was speaking to szuba,he could not hear what that person said.at the completion of the call,szuba told investigator jones that steppello would arrive at szuba house in twenty minutes with cocaine.
at,investigator sullivan observed a white male arrive at steppello residence in a silver gmc suv and enter the residence.five minutes later,investigator sullivan observed the white male get back into the vehicle and drive away.investigator sullivan followed the vehicle to the vicinity of szuba residence,where he terminated the surveillance to avoid detection.investigator sullivan immediately notified the officers at szuba residence that the person under surveillance was coming.
although szuba advised officers that he usually left the garage door open when steppello delivered cocaine the police closed the door and hid in the garage.the white male arrived at szuba house and parked his gmc envoy in the driveway.an officer inside the house relayed to investigator jones,who was in the garage,that steppello called szuba cell phone ten times and szuba house once when the officers heard a person exit the vehicle,they proceeded to exit the garage and arrested the white male in the driveway.as the officers took the person to the ground to handcuff him,he uttered that he could do somebody.
the officers immediately searched the person and found a small plastic bag containing cocaine in his pants pocket.the person arrested was steppello.moments later,after investigator jones issued miranda warnings,steppello stated that he wanted to speak to his attorney and the district attorney before identifying his supplier.
search warrant for steppello residence 
after securing the cocaine from steppello person,investigator jones proceeded to the utica city court,where he reviewed and signed both the application for a warrant to search steppello residence and vehicle and the affidavit in support of the search warrant application.the affidavit established that investigator jones a new york state police officer for twelve years and member of the cnet for approximately three years had been thoroughly trained to combat drug trafficking.the affidavit also established that as a result of his training and experience with investigations and arrests and with handling confidential informants,investigator jones was familiar with the communication methods and customs used by persons involved in drug trafficking.
the affidavit then set forth the events that occurred that day,which included the controlled phone call szuba made to steppello,the surveillance of steppello residence,and the arrest of steppello and incident seizure of cocaine from his person.the affidavit also noted steppello criminal history and that he was the registered owner of the gmc envoy he drove to szuba house.finally,the affidavit concluded,based upon the information provided by szuba,the surveillance conducted by new york state police,and the resulting arrest of steppello and incident seizure of cocaine from his person,that steppello was utilizing his residence and vehicle to further a cocaine distribution operation.
the utica city court issued the search warrant.during the subsequent search of steppello residence,police seized two jars containing cocaine,paraphernalia,and in cash.
indictment and suppression decision 
on may,a grand jury returned a indictment charging steppello with possessing with intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of cocaine,in violation of a and b c,and possessing with intent to distribute more than grams of cocaine,in violation of a and b b.in a pretrial motion,steppello sought to suppress the cocaine seized from his person incident to his arrest,as well as the cocaine seized from his residence pursuant to the execution of the search warrant.in a subsequent motion,steppello sought to suppress statements he made following his arrest on the basis that they were the fruit of his unlawful arrest.on june,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised by steppello motions.
in a memorandum decision order,entered on august,the district court determined that the admissibility of the cocaine seized from steppello person and the statements he made following his arrest depended on whether police had probable cause to arrest him.the court concluded that probable cause was lacking because at the time steppello was arrested,the police had nothing more than the partially corroborated account of a criminal informant with no history of reliability.united states steppello,d.the court also noted that steppello had not engaged in any suspicious activity while under surveillance.the court next determined that the admissibility of evidence seized from steppello residence depended on the legality of his arrest because without the reference to the cocaine seized from his person,the warrant application did not establish probable cause to search the residence.accordingly,the district court granted steppello motion to suppress the cocaine seized incident to his arrest the statements he made during and after his arrest and the evidence seized from his residence.
