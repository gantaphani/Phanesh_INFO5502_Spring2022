voters in new york state may vote by absentee ballot in every kind of election save one elections for political party county committees.the plaintiffs,who are two voters,the albany county republican committee acrc,and a candidate for the acrc,claim that the state has infringed their first amendment rights through this omission,without adequate justification.the district court rejected the plaintiffs arguments,and it concluded that the state explanation was constitutionally sufficient.we reverse.
in every county in new york,the political parties are each represented by a county committee.as a general matter,the party committees prepare rules for governing the ir party within their political unit s.law.these committees also have several specifically defined tasks,including the responsibility for selecting the party nominee for certain local offices,in the rare situations when such an office becomes vacant between early july and early november in a year when that office is up for election.see id.
if the county committee is required to make such a nomination,it has a relatively short time period in which it may act.when the vacancy occurs more than seven days before the date of the primary election,the county committee can not act before the primary election,but it also must act within seven days after the primary election.id.when the vacancy occurs less than seven days before the primary election,the committee must make its nomination within fourteen days after the vacancy is created,although the committee must still wait until the primary election before it may act.id.the committee also has fourteen days to act if a vacancy is created after the primary election.id.
county committee elections operate on a small scale.each county is broken into a number of tiny election districts eds that contain no more than registered voters.id.a.in albany county,the acrc elects two committee members from each of the county eds.every member is selected biannually,in even numbered years,in an election held coterminously with the regularly scheduled primary election.the undisputed evidence before the district court showed that in a typical election cycle,there are usually only or eds in all of albany county that have contested elections for the acrc.
for the vast majority of elected offices in new york,the election calendar builds in a transition period for incoming officeholders.that is,after an election takes place,there is usually a period of several weeks or more during which the outgoing officeholder remains in office until his successor is sworn in.by creating this transition period,the state ensures that an office does not become vacant between election day and the date when the incoming official is certified as the winner of the election.
county committee positions work differently.for reasons that are not entirely clear,committee members only hold office until the next election at which members of the committee are elected.id.as a result,when there are contested elections for seats on the committee,those seats will be vacant between the day of the primary election and the day that the election results are certified see settineri dicarlo,adopting the analysis stated in,balletta,dissenting.this vacancy period can last up to nine days.see law allowing the local boards of election up to nine days to complete their canvass of the election and certify the results.
county committee elections are unique in another respect.in elections for all positions other than county committee members,new york permits voters to cast an absentee ballot if they can present one of several valid excuses see id.these ballots are counted if they are postmarked before election day,and if they are received by the local board of elections within seven days after election day.id.in county committee elections,however,absentee ballots are expressly prohibited.id.
there are three categories of plaintiffs in this case.plaintiff david price was a candidate for a position representing ed on the acrc.two other plaintiffs,martha mcmahon and james thornton,are individual voters in ed who wished to cast absentee ballots in the election.the remaining plaintiff is the acrc.the defendants are the state board of elections and its officials 
in,the primary election was scheduled for september.four days before the election,the plaintiffs filed the complaint in this case and sought a temporary restraining order tro requiring the county elections board to distribute absentee ballots for the race in ed.the district court granted the tro on september,and it instructed the albany county board of elections to give the a supplemental paper ballot for the relevant committee member race.however,the court also instructed the county elections board that it could not count these supplemental ballots until the court allowed it.
the plaintiffs also sought relief in addition to the tro.specifically,plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that election law was unconstitutional,in nominal damages for each plaintiff,and an injunction against the enforcement of election law.
following the election the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.in support of their motion,the plaintiffs attached declarations from the chairman of the acrc and the commissioner of the albany county board of elections.the defendants submitted no evidence of their own in opposition.instead,they to dismiss the complaint.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.price state bd.of elections,wl,at.to guide its inquiry,the district court applied the framework articulated in burdick takushi,d.price,wl,at.accordingly,the district court explained that it would apply strict scrutiny if the new york law severely burdened the plaintiffs rights,and a lesser standard of review otherwise.id.citing lerman bd.of elections,cir.
the district court then concluded that election law did not severely burden any of the plaintiffs rights.in large part,the district court relied on the supreme court opinion in mcdonald board of election commissioners,d,which the district court read as holding that restrictions on access to absentee ballots do not severely burden the right to vote,so long as the class of voters to whom absentee ballots are denied are not thereby deprived of their only method of voting.price,wl,at.the district court therefore concluded that the claims of the mcmahon and thornton could not be subjected to strict scrutiny.id.the court also concluded that the statute did not severely burden candidate price or the acrc.id.
the district court then proceeded to determine what lesser standard of review was applicable.id.at.the court explained that,because election law burdened voting rights,it would be inappropriate to apply a purely deferential review to the challenged statute.id.however,because the court deemed the burden on the plaintiffs rights to be de minimis,the court stated that its review would be far closer to a purely deferential review than it is to strict scrutiny.id.
notwithstanding the court comments that it would apply something close to purely deferential review,the court referred to its analysis as rational basis review,id.at,and it cited equal protection cases from outside of the voting rights context in order to develop the meaning of that standard.see id.citing heller doe,d,and beach communications,d.thus,in the district court view,the new york law had to be sustained if there were any plausible reasons for the challenged legislative action.id.quoting,at.
applying this rational basis standard,the district court held that the statute was constitutional.the court explained that if absentee ballots were permitted in county committee races,the local boards of election would be unable to certify the results of these races until at least seven days after the election.id.during this seven day window,the county committee positions would be vacant,which would pose a problem in those rare situations when the committee was required to act to nominate a candidate during that same seven day window.id.at.thus,the court found that the legislature could have rationally sought to avoid this problem when it precluded the use of absentee ballots.id.at.
following the district court ruling,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.plaintiffs also asked the district court to stay its judgment pending appeal,and the district court agreed.to date,the local board of elections has not yet finally tabulated the results of the election,and no winner has been declared in ed.

first amendment rights and the burdick standard 
on appeal,the plaintiffs do not assert a general right to obtain absentee ballots.instead,they press three related claims under the first amendment all of which stem from the simple observation that some voters can find it difficult to cast an ballot in county committee elections.the argue that the lack of absentee balloting constitutes a burden,at least to some degree,on their associational right to vote for a political party position price asserts that his associational rights are burdened because it is difficult for him to fully associate with all of the voters who wish to cast votes to support his candidacy.finally,the county committee asserts that its associational rights have been burdened because some republican voters who wish to cast ballots in committee races find it difficult to do so.
while one can debate the extent to which the plaintiffs associational rights are burdened,there can be no real debate that all of the plaintiffs first amendment rights have been burdened to some degree.all e lection laws will invariably impose some burden upon individual voters.burdick,at.every provision of a state elections code,whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters,the selection and eligibility of candidates,or the voting process itself,inevitably least to some individual right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.anderson celebrezze,d.
in this case,the burdens on the plaintiffs can be easily identified.the have an associational right to vote in political party elections,see state bd.of elections,d kusper pontikes,d,and that right is burdened when the state makes it more difficult for these voters to cast ballots.see kusper,at.similarly,candidates associational rights are affected,in at least some manner,when barriers are placed before the voters that would elect these candidates to party positions.see anderson,at.explaining that the associational rights of candidates and voters are generally similarly burdened by election laws.and it is that a political party associational rights are affected when the party nomination process,and its mechanisms for selecting internal leaders,are disrupted by state action.see,timmons twin cities area new party,d eu county democratic cent,d.
because there is some burden on the plaintiffs associational rights,we must apply the framework articulated in burdick.see at.in burdick,the supreme court established a balancing test for courts to utilize when faced with a first amendment challenge to a state election law 
a court considering a challenge to a state election law must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.
at.internal quotation marks omitted quoting anderson,at,and tashjian republican party of connecticut,d.
more recently,in clingman beaver,d,the supreme court employed the same weighing analysis it had applied in burdick,even though the court concluded that the burden on any associational interests was minor.at.id.at,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment suggesting that the burden at issue was modest rather than minor.the court found that the state had proffered three important interests served by its restriction,and the court concluded that these three interests were together sufficient to justify the minor burden at issue.see id.at.majority opinion.
the defendants assert that pure rational basis review should be utilized in this case in reviewing the constitutionality of election law.they are incorrect.under burdick flexible standard,at,the court must actually weigh the burdens imposed on the plaintiff against the precise interests put forward by the state,and the court must take into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.id.quoting anderson,at.by contrast,under rational basis review,the plaintiff must negative every conceivable basis which might support the challenged law,at.quoting lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d internal quotation marks omitted,even if some of those bases have absolutely no foundation in the record,heller,at.
the standards for review are clear.if the plaintiffs rights are severely burdened,the statute is subject to strict scrutiny.burdick,at.if the burden is minor,but,burdick balancing test is applied.under this balancing test,the state reasonable and nondiscriminatory restrictions will generally be sufficient to uphold the statute if they serve important state interests.id.review in such circumstances will be quite deferential,and we will not require elaborate,empirical verification of the weightiness of the state asserted justifications.timmons,at.nonetheless,in cases like this one where the burden imposed by the law is,we must weigh the state justification against the burden imposed.see burdick,at.see also timmons,at.
identifying the burden 
as the case comes to us,the record contains relatively little evidence about the extent of the burden on the plaintiffs rights.there is undisputed evidence that mcmahon and thornton both submitted valid applications to vote by absentee ballot.however,the record does not reveal the exact reason why they were unable to vote in person.mcmahon and thornton might not have been able to vote in person for a very compelling reason,such as they were confined to a hospital bed.see law c.it can not be disputed that election law would impose a substantial burden on voters physically unable to attend a polling station because they are hospitalized,homebound,or incarcerated.alternatively,mcmahon and thornton might not have been able to vote in person for a somewhat less compelling reason,such as they were be on vacation.see id.b.
for our initial purposes,it is important only that there is at least some burden on the rights.indeed,whatever mcmahon and thornton reasons for finding it difficult to vote in person,we note that the state of new york recognizes these reasons as sufficiently strong that it would always permit them to vote by absentee ballot in any other election accordingly,we hold that the burden on the plaintiffs rights is,at a minimum,not trivial.
weighing the state justifications 
there are many plausible reasons why a state might choose not to provide absentee ballots in an election.for example,a state might reasonably be concerned about ballot security,in re the protest of election returns and absentee ballots in the,election for the city of miami,so d,invalidating all absentee ballots cast in an election tainted by massive absentee balloting fraud.alternatively,a state might want to make sure that all voters cast their ballots on the same day,thereby ensuring that some voters have not cast their ballots before they learn about news that breaks late in a campaign.a state might also be concerned about the administrative expenses associated with absentee balloting.
in this case,however,the state has put forward no substantive justifications for the restrictions imposed by election law.instead,the state relies exclusively on its contrived argument that tabulating absentee ballots could cause a delay in finalizing election results,which could interfere with the acrc ability to nominate a candidate in situations where quick action was required specifically,if a local elected office became vacant in a general election year,and the vacancy came into existence after early july but less than seven days before the september primary,and the office was required to be filled at the next general election,the new county committee would then need to nominate the party candidate for that office within seven days after the primary election.because absentee ballots can be received up until the seventh day after the primary election,the state allegedly fears that elections with absentee balloting will not be certified in time to allow the acrc to make a timely nomination.
as an initial matter,the importance of the state interest is undercut by the fact that the acrc is willing to incur this risk in order to allow absentee balloting.as the supreme court recognized in eu,a state does not have a compelling interest in sav ing a political party from pursuing acts because the state can not substitut e its judgment for that of the party.at.
moreover,if absentee balloting is allowed,it is still extraordinarily unlikely that the acrc would be unable to fulfill its nominating duties.this is somewhat true as a general matter,because vacancies are somewhat unusual events,and it is even less common for a vacancy to occur in the narrow window between early july and early september.and this is particularly true with regard to the acrc,for several reasons.
first,elections for the acrc only take place in even numbered years.that is important in this case,because the undisputed record showed that local offices in new york are generally voted upon in odd numbered years,making it extremely unusual for there to be a situation in which the acrc would have to nominate a candidate in the same year that acrc members were up for election.kermani decl.at.settineri,at balleta,dissenting explaining that after the king county republican committee decided to elect its members in odd numbered years,the committee encountered a situation in which it had to fill a vacancy in a local office at the same time that the committee members were up for election 
second,there is no dispute that the overwhelming majority of elections for the acrc are uncontested,with only about of eds featuring contested races in a typical election cycle.candidates in the other of eds are automatically deemed elected as of the date of the primary.law see also hooper power.thus,even if a few acrc races will be unsettled for several days while the candidates await certification,the overwhelming majority of acrc members will be ready to act immediately after the date of the primary.indeed,it is extraordinarily likely that,from these uncontested races,the acrc will have far more members than it needs to make an immediate nomination the acrc can be legally constituted even if only percent of its members have been elected.see election law.
third,even if the acrc inexplicably found itself unable to muster enough members to act when needed,the committee would still have at least one remedy available.in that unlikely scenario,state law would permit the outgoing committee chairman to make the needed nomination,so long as such action was consistent with the republican party internal rules.see settineri,at,adopting the analysis stated in at balletta,dissenting.we also note that the election code contemplates the possibility that a vacancy will occur too late to comply with the state strict time limits for nominations.law.in such scenarios the law directs nominating authorities like the acrc to make their nominations as soon as practicable.id.
finally,the state flimsy proffered justification is further undermined by the fact that even the current system fails to ensure that election results are certified before the end of the seven day nominating period.under election law,the local boards of election have up to nine days to complete their canvass and certify the results.while the local boards could choose to certify election results within seven days,there is no guarantee that they will do so settineri,at balleta,dissenting describing how the local elections board waited eight days to certify the results of that year county committee races,even though there was a vacancy that required the new committee to act within seven days of the primary.
taking into account all of the above,we conclude that the state has burdened the plaintiffs rights for a reason that is exceptionally and extraordinarily weak.while the burden on the plaintiffs rights is not large,and while our review is accordingly deferential,we nonetheless conclude that the state proffered reasons have such infinitesimal weight that they do not justify the burdens imposed.we therefore hold that,on this record,it is unconstitutional for the state to deny absentee ballots in acrc elections.
the fact pattern here is unusual,and our holding in this case is necessarily narrow.we do not hold that there is a general constitutional right to obtain absentee ballots.nor do we hold that there is a constitutional right to obtain absentee ballots in all county committee races in new york state.instead,after applying a deferential standard of review,and after examining the record in this challenge,we conclude that the arguments proffered by the state are so extraordinarily weak that they can not justify the burdens imposed by election law.the district court therefore erred in granting the defendants motion to dismiss,and it erred in denying the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.
the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded.the district court is instructed to enter judgment for the plaintiffs on those of their claims for which they moved for summary judgment 
the parties disagree in this case about the applicable standard of review,with the state relying on mcdonald board of election commissioners,d,to argue that rational basis scrutiny applies to all claims involving absentee balloting and the plaintiffs asking us to apply sliding scale scrutiny based on burdick takushi,d.because i conclude that the law at issue here should be upheld under either test,i do not find it necessary to decide this issue and will assume without deciding that the potentially stricter burdick balancing test governs our review of the plaintiffs claims.under this standard,we weigh the character and magnitude of the alleged injury to the plaintiffs first and fourteenth amendment rights against the interests the state asserts to justify the burden imposed by its rule,keeping in mind that in our constitutional scheme,states retain the power to regulate their own elections,and that to do so,they must elaborate rules that inevitably affect at least to some individual right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.id.at quoting anderson celebrezze,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiffs allege that the state of new york has burdened their first amendment associational rights by omitting to make absentee ballots available for party committeemen elections in albany county.since the state does not provide absentee ballots,voters who wish to vote in party committeemen elections must appear in person at the polls on election day.the record contains no information about the magnitude of the burden on these individual plaintiffs or the burden on voters generally,except for an affidavit by the albany county republican committee chairman stating that the republican party wants every possible republican to participate in the election and that t he republican party desires that its members be all
