petitioner ramon brito asks this court to review the july,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming in part and modifying in part the april,decision of immigration judge ij noel brennan denying brito application for adjustment of status.in re ramon brito,no.july,aff g no.immig.city.brito argues because he returned to the united states pursuant to a grant of advance parole,he erroneously was designated an arriving alien the ij has jurisdiction over his application for adjustment of status because it is a renewed version of the application he filed prior to his departure from the united which his grant of advance parole was based and the regulations withholding from the ij jurisdiction to adjudicate his application for adjustment of status are ultra vires.we conclude brito failed to exhaust before the agency the issue of his designation as an arriving alien and thus we do not reach it because brito present application for adjustment of status is new and separate from his previously filed application,the ij lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate it and brito lacks standing to assert his argument that the applicable regulations are ultra vires.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
background 
petitioner ramon brito is a native and citizen of the dominican republic.brito entered the united states without inspection in march.one month later,brito married his first wife,mildred brito formerly mildred melendez.approximately one year after his marriage,brito filed an application to adjust his status to that of a person admitted for lawful permanent residence his wife simultaneously filed an immigrant visa petition on brito behalf.while his application was pending,brito requested,and received,advance parole permission to visit his ailing mother in the dominican republic and then return to the united states.the immigration and naturalization service ins granted brito advance parole and warned him that in the event his application for adjustment of status was denied,he would be subject to removal proceedings.in december,pursuant to his advance parole status,brito departed the united states.he returned approximately one month later,and on january,brito applied for admission to enter the united states.he was paroled in until january.on march,due to mildred brito failure to report to a scheduled interview,the ins denied her petition.at the same time,the ins denied brito application and terminated his parole status.
on may,the ins served brito with a notice to appear to show cause why he should not be removed from the united states.the ins charged that brito was an arriving alien removable from the united states pursuant to a a i i as an immigrant who at the time of admission was not in possession of a valid entry document.brito denied he was an arriving alien and denied being removable as charged.
on march,through counsel,brito notified the immigration court of the following matters he had divorced his wife he had remarried another united states citizen,judy brito formerly judy almonte his new wife had filed on brito behalf a second petition and brito had filed a second application.brito asserted that he was improperly designated an arriving alien because he had been granted advance parole to leave and return to the united states 
on april,the ij determined that brito was an arriving alien and removable as charged.specifically,the ij determined that an alien like brito who seeks entry into the united states pursuant to a grant of advance parole is an arriving alien.the ij pointed to q which provided that a n arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to d.the ij also determined that brito is not eligible to adjust his status in immigration court.
brito appealed to the bia arguing that the ij has jurisdiction over his application.brito,however,did not challenge in his brief to the bia the ij determination that brito was an arriving alien.in its per curiam decision of july,the bia affirmed the ij determination that brito was an arriving alien.the bia also affirmed the ij determination that brito can not pursue adjustment of status in immigration court but it did so for different reasons than those cited by the ij.the bia explained that while brito appeal was pending before it,the attorney general had enacted interim regulations clarifying that,subject to one narrow exception,ijs lack jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for adjustment of status.that exception,explained the bia,applies only where the alien has been placed in removal proceedings after having departed and returned to the united states pursuant to a grant of advance parole and seeks to adjudicate an application for adjustment he filed prior to his departure.the bia noted that brito had filed his second one at he returned to the united states and was placed in removal proceedings and that nothing in the regulations permits an alien to substitute a newly filed application for an old one.the bia held that the ij lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate brito application but noted that brito can pursue his application for adjustment with the bureau of united states citizenship and immigration services uscis.brito now petitions this court for a review of the bia decision.
ii.discussion 
brito argues that both the ij and bia erred in designating him an arriving alien,that the ij has jurisdiction to adjudicate his application for adjustment of status even under immigration regulations as amended,and that the ij has jurisdiction to adjudicate his application because the regulations prohibiting the adjudication of applications for adjustment of status by ijs are ultra vires.because the bia decision affirms in part and modifies in part the decision of the ij,we review the decision of the ij as modified by the bia.see dong gao bia,cir.
brito designation as an arriving alien 
a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right d.in lin zhong dep t of justice,cir,we clarified that while not jurisdictional,issue exhaustion is mandatory.indeed,in order to preserve an issue for review by this court,the petitioner must not only raise it before the bia,but do so with specificity.steevenez gonzales,cir citing foster ins,cir.here,as the government asserts,brito not only failed to contest before the bia his designation as an arriving alien,but also conceded that designation both in his statements of reasons for appealing the decision of the ij,see attachment to form,notice of appeal from a decision of an immigration judge,no.may,brito can adjust his status even though he is an arriving alien,and in his brief on appeal to the bia,see respondent brief on appeal at may,discussing whether brito satisfies a regulation that would allow the ij jurisdiction to adjudicate an arriving alien application for adjustment of status.thus,he has failed to preserve for review by this court the issue of whether his designation as an arriving alien was erroneous 
b.the ij jurisdiction under the regulations 
statutory background 
because the regulations governing the ij jurisdiction over applications for adjustment of status,prior to their recent amendment,have been the subject of a considerable amount of litigation concerning their validity,we provide some history.
prior to,any alien in the united states no longer in possession of a valid immigrant visa but eligible for adjustment of status had to go abroad to apply for permanent resident status.see akhtar gonzales,cir succar ashcroft,cir.in,congress eliminated that burden by expanding eligibility for adjustment of status to include all aliens inspected and admitted or paroled,allowing aliens in the united states,with or without valid visas,to apply for immigrant status without having to depart.a akhtar,at succar,at.section a commits to the discretion of the united states attorney general,and under such regulations as he may prescribe,the granting of applications for adjustment of status.a.in addition,a b i makes unreviewable the attorney general exercise of that discretion.akhtar,at see also succar,at.
