background 
this lawsuit arises out of events that took place during the autumn of at the ulster county jail the ucj in ulster county,new york.at the time,singer,decker,and nollner were employed at the ucj,singer as a corporal,and decker and nollner as corrections officers.
a.the parody 
during a shift in,singer created a parody on his work computer.a copy of it is annexed to this opinion.it was a spoof on the familiar absolut vodka advertisements,which typically display an absolut vodka bottle adorned or transformed in some thematic fashion,and beneath the bottle a phrase beginning with the word absolut.singer version displayed in or on the bottle pictures of four ucj officials two of whom are defendants becker and ferro and the caption read,absolut corruption.the parody was not original singer got the idea from a similar absolut corruption parody that he had found on the internet.he printed out the previous version and then overlaid it with images of his targets.
at his deposition,singer described his parody as a political statement that he thought was funny.dep.of kent singer,singer dep,at joint app x at.he meant the parody to refer to what he considered to be corrupt practices among jail officials involving preferential hiring and staffing,selective enforcement in matters of employee discipline,and other miscellaneous forms of favoritism.when asked whether the reasons he regarded the persons portrayed as corrupt are generally internal reasons,he replied yes,stating that his complaints concerned both his specific employment within the jail and matters of employment in general.singer dep.at joint app x.
after he created the parody,singer showed it to five fellow employees.among them were nollner and decker.singer then discarded the parody in a trash can in an employee common area.he testified at his deposition that he never intended to show it to anyone else.his intentions were thwarted,however,when another employee retrieved the parody from the trash.eventually,it made its way to the people depicted on the bottle,including defendants ferro and becker 
b.the alleged retaliation 
ferro and becker,who were both ucj supervisors,thought that all three of the plaintiffs were involved in creating the parody.they allegedly used their supervisory authority to retaliate against the plaintiffs.
the first incident took place in late september.since april of that year,singer had not been required to participate in prisoner transports.this was at singer request his mother had been ill,and he had asked to be removed from transport duty so that he could remain at the ucj,ready to leave and attend to her in case of emergency.but soon after the parody was circulated,singer found himself assigned to transports.ferro and another supervisor were responsible for the assignments to prisoner transports at this time.
singer complained about the assignment.on october,becker called singer into his office for a meeting.singer had heard that ferro and becker were head hunting over the parody,singer dep.at joint app x at,so he concealed a small tape recorder in his breast pocket in order to record the meeting.during the meeting,becker told singer that he would respect singer request to be kept off transport duty,but also confronted singer about the parody,telling him that he knew singer had created it.
the alleged retaliation against decker and nollner began about the same time.decker asserts that one day shortly after the parody was circulated,he became ill while at work and went to ferro office to ask if he could leave for the day.ferro not only declined the request,but also told decker that he heard from other people that decker had something to do with the parody,and proposed that he and decker deal with it the old fashioned way by tak ing the matter outside.dep.of jonathan decker,decker dep,at joint app x at.
decker and nollner also allege that their perceived involvement with the parody affected their work assignments.both decker and nollner had been members of the sheriff emergency response team sert a unit that dealt with problem inmates for about a decade.dep.of thomas nollner,nollner dep,at joint app x at decker dep.at joint app x at.they allege that in a march sert meeting,becker looked directly at decker and nollner while telling the group that he kn e w sert members were in the room when corporal singer made the parody,nollner dep.at joint app x at,and ferro then stated that he had lost a lot of respect for those members,nollner dep.at joint app x at.becker then assigned two leadership positions in sert to members who had less seniority than decker and nollner.
