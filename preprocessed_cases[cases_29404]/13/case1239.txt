new york appellate division adopted new rules prohibiting certain types of attorney advertising and solicitation,which were to take effect february.the new rules barred,inter alia,testimonials from clients relating to pending matters,portrayals of judges or fictitious law firms,techniques unrelated to attorney competence,and trade names or nicknames that imply an ability to get results.the amendments also established a moratorium for targeted solicitation following a specific incident,including targeted ads on television or in other media.plaintiffs,a new york attorney,along with his law firm and a public interest organization,challenged these provisions as violating the first amendment.the district court agreed in declared most of the rules unconstitutional,while upholding the moratorium.both plaintiffs and defendants timely appealed from portions of the district court decision adverse to them.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs with respect to the advertising restrictions,with the exception of the prohibition on portrayals of fictitious law firms.we likewise conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants with respect to the moratorium.accordingly,we affirm the district court opinion in large part,and reverse in part.
background 
a.the parties 
the plaintiffs are an individual james alexander,a law firm alexander catalano,and a consumer rights organization public citizen.alexander is the managing partner of alexander catalano,a personal injury law firm with offices in syracuse and rochester.alexander catalano use various broadcast and print media to advertise.prior to the adoption of new york new attorney advertising rules,the firm commercials often contained jingles and special effects,including wisps of smoke and blue electrical currents surrounding the firm name.firm advertisements also featured dramatizations,comical scenes,and special instance,depicting alexander and his partner as giants towering above local buildings,running to a client house so quickly they appear as blurs,and providing legal assistance to space aliens.another advertisement depicted a judge in the courtroom and stated that the judge is there to make sure the trial is fair.the firm ads also frequently included the firm slogan,heavy hitters,and phrases like think big and we give you a big helping hand.to date,no disciplinary actions have been brought against the firm or its lawyers based on firm advertising.the new rules,however,caused the firm to halt its advertisements for fear of such action.
plaintiff public citizen is a corporation,with approximately members nationwide,including roughly in new york.public citizen litigation group is a division of public citizen that conducts,inter alia,pro bono constitutional litigation in state and federal courts on behalf of its clients.these organizations maintain a website and various blogs,and participate in distributing educational materials on various legal issues to the public.
defendants are the chief counsels or acting chief counsels of the disciplinary committees whose jurisdiction lies within each of the four judicial departments of the new york supreme court,appellate division.the appellate division is authorized to discipline attorneys for professional misconduct.see judiciary law mckinney.pursuant to this authority,the four presiding justices of each of new york four departments are responsible for adopting disciplinary rules,which set the parameters for professional conduct and provide for the discipline of attorneys violating the rules.the departments have,in turn,appointed the disciplinary committees of which defendants are a part.these committees undertake investigations into complaints of attorney misbehavior.following an investigation,defendants are empowered to take a number of actions with respect to a complaint,including issuing a letter of caution or recommending that formal disciplinary proceedings be started.when formal disciplinary proceedings are deemed warranted,defendants begin such proceedings in the appellate division.accordingly,defendants are responsible for enforcing the new york code of professional responsibility and the attorney disciplinary rules promulgated thereunder.
b.the appellate division adoption of the new rules 
in june,the presiding justices of the four departments of the appellate division approved for comment draft amendments to the rules.a press release explained that the new rules were designed to protect consumers against inappropriate solicitations or potentially misleading ads,as well as overly aggressive marketing,and to benefit the bar by ensuring that the image of the legal profession is maintained at the highest possible level.following a comment period,the presiding justices issued final rules.these rules were set to take effect on february.
we consider below a subset of these final rules,which we subdivide into two categories.the first group of amendments imposes a series of restrictions 
c an advertisement shall not 
include an endorsement of,or testimonial about,a lawyer or law firm from a client with respect to a matter that is still pending 
include the portrayal of a judge,the portrayal of a fictitious law firm,the use of a fictitious name to refer to lawyers not associated together in a law firm,or otherwise imply that lawyers are associated in a law firm if that is not the case 
rely on techniques to obtain attention that demonstrate a clear and intentional lack of relevance to the selection of counsel,including the portrayal of lawyers exhibiting characteristics clearly unrelated to legal competence 
utilize a nickname,moniker,motto or trade name that implies an ability to obtain results in a matter 
the second group of amendments imposes a moratorium on certain communications following a personal injury or wrongful death event 
tit,solicitation and recommendation of professional employment 
b for purposes of this rule,solicitation means any advertisement initiated by or on behalf of a lawyer or law firm that is directed to,or targeted at,a specific recipient or group of recipients,or their family members or legal representatives,the primary purpose of which is the retention of the lawyer or law firm,and a significant motive for which is pecuniary gain.it does not include a proposal or other writing prepared and delivered in response to a specific request of a prospective client.
e no solicitation relating to a specific incident involving potential claims for personal injury or wrongful death shall be disseminated before the day after the date of the incident,unless a filing must be made within days of the incident as a legal prerequisite to the particular claim,in which case no unsolicited communication shall be made before the day after the date of the incident.
tit.communication after incidents involving personal injury or wrongful death 
a in the event of a specific incident involving potential claims for personal injury or wrongful death,no unsolicited communication shall be made to an individual injured in the incident or to a family member or legal representative of such an individual,by a lawyer or law firm,or by any associate,agent,employee or other representative of a lawyer or law firm representing actual or potential defendants or entities that may defend indemnify said defendants,before the day after the date of the incident,unless a filing must be made within days of the incident as a legal prerequisite to the particular claim,in which case no unsolicited communication shall be made before the day after the date of the incident.
b an unsolicited communication by a lawyer or law firm,seeking to represent an injured individual or the legal representative thereof under the circumstance described in paragraph a shall comply with e.
c.the present action and district court decision 
plaintiffs filed their complaint on february,the date on which the new rules were to take effect.they sought declaratory and injunctive relief from several of the new rules,including all those set forth above.plaintiffs contended that these rules infringed their first amendment rights because the rules prohibited truthful,communications that the state has no legitimate interest in regulating.plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the rules,and defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for,inter alia,lack of standing.the district court scullin,reserved decision on plaintiffs motion and denied defendants.alexander cahill,dist.lexis.thereafter,the parties stipulated to a set of facts and exhibits that became the basis for competing motions for summary judgment.
on july,the district court filed its and order granting partial summary judgment to plaintiffs and partial summary judgment to defendants.alexander cahill,d.principally,the district court found unconstitutional the disputed provisions of c set forth above,while concluding that the moratorium provisions survived constitutional scrutiny 
throughout its opinion,the district court applied the test for commercial speech set forth in central hudson,which considers whether the speech is protected by the first amendment there is a substantial state interest to be achieved by the restriction the restriction materially advances the state interest and the restriction is narrowly drawn.see central hudson gas pub.serv.comm of.the district court rejected defendants claim that the state of new york could ban attorney advertising that was irrelevant,unverifiable,and without reference to the central hudson test.alexander,d at.it concluded defendants have provided no legal support for this proposition,and the court finds none.although these characteristics may be evidence that an advertisement is misleading,they do not by themselves constitute a justification for banning commercial speech in the form of attorney advertising.id.
turning to the amendments that restricted potentially misleading advertisements,including the disputed provisions of c,the district court found that defendants stated interest in protecting consumers from misleading attorney advertisements was a substantial one.id.at.under central hudson penultimate prong,which requires that the regulation materially advance the state interest,however,the district court concluded that the record was notably lacking.id.at.the district court gave considerable weight to defendants reliance on the new york state bar association task force report on lawyer advertising,but concluded that the report provided sufficient support only for two amendments the prohibition on the portrayal of judges in attorney advertisements,and the prohibition on the use of trade names that imply an ability to get results.id.at.as to the remaining disputed portions of c,the district court emphasized that the task force report had recommended disclosure and invigorated enforcement of existing rules,rather than any new restrictions.id.at.finally,the district court found that the two amendments that materially advanced new york interest in preventing misleading advertising did not do so in a sufficiently narrowly tailored fashion.the district court criticized defendants for failing to produce any evidence that measures short of categorical bans would not have sufficed to remedy the perceived risks of such advertising being misleading.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that all of the disputed portions of c failed the central hudson test.
with regard to the moratorium on contacting victims,the district court reached the opposite conclusion.the district court recognized that new york moratorium is broader than the florida moratorium sustained by the supreme court in florida bar.went for it.florida moratorium was limited to solicitation,while new york provisions extend by their plain language to television,radio,newspaper,and website solicitations that are directed to or targeted at a specific recipient or group of recipients.alexander,d at.nonetheless,the district court concluded that new york moratorium materially advanced state interests in protecting the privacy of citizens and guarding against the indignity of being solicited for legal services immediately following a personal injury or a wrongful death event,and did so in a reasonably proportionate manner.id.at.the district court relied on an emerging consensus among authorities,state and federal,regarding the desirability of some form of moratorium,citing the task force report review of moratoria in florida and eight other states,the federal airline disaster moratorium which prohibits not only solicitation,but unsolicited communications generally for a day period,and the supreme court opinion in florida bar.alexander,d at.the district court also noted the existence of ample alternative channels for the public to receive information concerning legal services during the moratorium,general advertisements in any media,provided they do not reference a specific tragedy.id.quoting florida bar,at.
discussion 
this case calls on us once again to assess the scope of first amendment protection accorded to commercial speech,and the measure of evidence a state must present in regulating such speech.because this action was resolved on summary judgment,we review the district court decision de novo,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party.miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
the supreme court has established a inquiry for determining whether regulations of commercial speech are consistent with the first amendment 
whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.
central hudson gas pub.serv.comm of,
a.the disputed provisions regulate commercial speech protected by the first amendment 
defendants appeal challenges the district court threshold conclusion as to the first prong of this the first amendment protects advertising that is irrelevant,unverifiable,and.although they do not dispute that new york moratorium provisions regulate protected commercial speech,defendants argue strenuously to us that new york restrictions regulate speech that is not entitled to first amendment protection at all.
the supreme court first recognized attorney advertising as within the scope of protected speech in bates state bar of arizona,in which the court invalidated a ban on price advertising for what the court deemed routine legal services.in so doing,the court reserved the question of whether similar protection would extend to advertising claims as to the quality of services that are not susceptible of measurement or verification.id.at.
in the years since bates,the supreme court has offered differing,and not always fully consistent,descriptions as to what constitutes protected commercial speech,particularly with respect to attorney advertising.speaking generally,the supreme court has said that states may impose regulations to ensure that the stream of commercial information flow s cleanly as well as freely.bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council.but this court has nonetheless observed that there are doctrinal uncertainties left in the wake of supreme court decisions from which the modern commercial speech doctrine has evolved.in particular,these decisions have created some uncertainty as to the degree of protection for commercial advertising that lacks precise informational content.bad frog brewery,state liquor,cir 
in the end,we agree with the district court that,with one exception discussed below,the restrictions in the disputed provisions of c regulate commercial speech protected by the first amendment.in almost every instance,descriptions of the first prong of the central hudson test are phrased in the negative,and the only categories that central hudson,and its sequellae,clearly excludes from protection are speech that is false,deceptive,or misleading,and speech that concerns unlawful activities.see,florida bar,at t he government may freely regulate commercial speech that concerns unlawful activity or is misleading.commercial speech that falls into neither of those categories may be regulated if the government satisfies central hudson remaining three prongs.citation omitted ibanez fl.dep t of bus.prof l regulation,bd.of accountancy,o nly false,deceptive,or misleading commercial speech may be banned.the supreme court has also emphasized that states may not place an absolute prohibition on certain types of potentially misleading information if the information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive.in re,u,see also,peel attorney registration disciplinary comm of,shapero.bar ass n,zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio.we conclude from these precedents that the central hudson analysis applies to regulations of commercial speech that is only potentially misleading 
the speech that defendants restrictions seeks to which is irrelevant,unverifiable,and not inherently false,deceptive,or misleading.defendants own press release described its proposed rules as protecting consumers against potentially misleading ads.this is insufficient to place these restrictions beyond the scope of first amendment scrutiny 
there is one exception to this conclusion.subsection c prohibits the portrayal of a fictitious law firm,the use of a fictitious name to refer to lawyers not associated together in a law firm,or otherwise imply that lawyers are associated in a law firm if that is not the case,tit,c.the district court invalidated c in its entirety.alexander,d at.plaintiffs acknowledge,however,that they intended to challenge only the first clause of this portrayals of they do not oppose defendants appeal seeking reinstatement of the prohibition on fictitious firms.
the provision prohibiting advertisements including fictitious firms is susceptible to more than one interpretation.but we need not decide whether it would be constitutional to prohibit dramatizations in which an advertising law firm portrays itself arguing against a fictitious opposing counsel.at oral argument,the attorney general,representing the defendants,suggested a narrower interpretation of this regulation.he asked that we construe this language as applying only to situations in which lawyers from different firms give the misleading impression that they are from the same firm,the dream team.oral arg.we accept this interpretation.so read,this portion of c addresses only attorney advertising techniques that are actually misleading as to the existence or membership of a firm,and such advertising is not entitled to first amendment protection.see florida bar,at.accordingly,and subject to the construction,we reverse the district court invalidation of that portion of c that prohibits advertisements that include fictitious firms.
having concluded that the remainder of the disputed regulations falls within the zone of protected commercial speech,we turn to the rest of the central hudson test.the supreme court has explained that c ommercial speech that is not false or deceptive and does not concern unlawful activities may be restricted only in the service of a substantial governmental interest,and only through means that directly advance that interest.shapero,at quotation marks and alteration omitted.the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it.edenfield fane,quotation marks and alteration omitted.we apply the three remaining prongs of central hudson,in turn,to each of the two categories of regulations set forth above.
central hudson and the regulations 
substantial interest 
under the second prong of central hudson,the state must identify a substantial interest in support of its regulation s.florida bar,at.t he central hudson standard does not permit us to supplant the precise interests put forward by the state with other suppositions.id.at quotation marks omitted.before the district court and again on appeal,defendants proffered a state interest in prohibiting attorney advertisements from containing deceptive or misleading content.appellants br.the report by the new york state bar association task force on lawyer advertising hereinafter,the task force report or report,which the state considered in formulating its new rules and which constitutes the bulk of the record on appeal,indicates that this is a proper and genuinely asserted interest.the task force report identified protecting the public by prohibiting advertising and solicitation practices that disseminate false or misleading information as one of its key concerns.task force report this state interest is,states have a generally unfettered right to prohibit inherently or actually misleading commercial speech.see,edenfield,at t here is no question that the state interest in ensuring the accuracy of commercial information in the marketplace is substantial.in re,at states retain the authority to regulate advertising that is inherently misleading or that has proved to be misleading in practice.the disputed regulations codified at c therefore survive the second prong of the central hudson analysis 
defendants also assert an interest in protecting the legal profession image and reputation.appellants reply in florida bar,the supreme court recognized a substantial interest in preventing the erosion of confidence in the legal profession.florida bar,at.defendants explain that their interest in preventing misleading attorney advertising is inextricably linked to its overarching interest in maintaining attorney professionalism and respect for the bar.appellants reply this interest also supports the disputed regulations 
materially advanced 
the penultimate prong of the central hudson test requires that a regulation impinging upon commercial expression directly advance the state interest involved the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.edenfield,at quoting central hudson,at.the state burden with respect to this prong is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restrictions will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.florida bar,at quotation marks omitted.moreover,i f the protections afforded commercial speech are to retain their force,we can not allow rote invocation of the words potentially misleading to supplant this burden.ibanez,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
invalidating a regulation of commercial speech for lack of sufficient evidence under this prong of central hudson does not foreclose a similar regulation being enacted validly in the future.rather,such invalidation returns the matter to the applicable legislating body and forces that body to take a second look with the eyes of the people on it.guido calabresi,foreward antidiscrimination and constitutional accountability what the debate ignores,harv,see also benjamin jacobson,cir en banc calabresi,concurring in the result.
in defending the disputed c provisions,defendants rely on three sources of evidence history,consensus,and simple common sense,florida bar,at quotation marks omitted,including regulations of attorney advertising in other states existing and unchallenged rules already in new york code of professional responsibility targeting advertising similar to that targeted by the new amendments and the new york state bar association task force report.defendants have not submitted any statistical or anecdotal evidence of consumer problems with or complaints of the sort they seek to prohibit.nor have they specifically identified any studies from other jurisdictions on which the state relied in implementing the amendments.see alexander,d at.against this background,we test each of the disputed c provisions.
subsection c client testimonials 
this subsection prohibits advertisements that include an endorsement of,or testimonial about,a lawyer or law firm from a client with respect to a matter that is still pending,tit,c.the task force report observed that testimonials can be misleading because they may suggest that past results indicate future performance.task force report the task force report,however,did not recommend outright prohibitions of all testimonials on this basis.instead,as the district court observed,the task force report recommended a different approach.alexander,d at.the report suggested strengthening the rules governing testimonials to prohibit the use of an actor or spokesperson who is not a member or employee of the advertising lawyer or law firm absent disclosure thereof.task force report emphasis added.the task force noted,moreover,that it would be an improper restriction on a client free speech rights to prohibit client testimonials outright.id.the task force report therefore does not support defendants assertion that prohibiting testimonials from current clients will materially advance an interest in preventing misleading advertising.indeed,the report contradicts,rather than strengthens,the board submissions.edenfield,at.
nor does consensus or common sense support the conclusion that client testimonials are inherently misleading.testimonials may,for example,mislead if they suggest that past results indicate future not all testimonials will do so,especially if they include a disclaimer.the district court properly concluded that defendants failed to satisfy this prong of central hudson with respect to client testimonials.
subsection c portrayal of a judge 
this subsection prohibits the portrayal of a judge,tit,c the task force report observes that a communication that states or implies that the lawyer has the ability to influence improperly a court is likely to be false,deceptive,or misleading.task force report,app.i,the district court found this comment to be persuasive evidence that a ban on portrayals of judges would materially advance the state interest in preventing misleading advertising.we disagree.although it seems plainly true that implying an ability to influence a court is likely to be misleading,defendants have failed to draw the requisite connection between that common sense observation and portrayals of judges in advertisements generally.the advertisement in which alexander catalano use the portrayal of a judge,for instance,depicts a judge in the courtroom and states that the judge is there to make sure the trial is fair.this sort of advertisement does not imply an ability to influence a court improperly.it is not misleading an advertisement of this sort may,instead,be informative.we believe the task force report fails to support defendants prohibition on portrayals of and conclude that defendants have not met their burden with respect to the wholesale prohibition of portrayals of judges.this prohibition consequently must fall.
subsection c irrelevant techniques 
this subsection prohibits advertisements that rely on techniques to obtain attention that demonstrate a clear and intentional lack of relevance to the selection of counsel,including the portrayal of lawyers exhibiting characteristics clearly unrelated to legal competence,tit,c.defendants note that the new york code of professional responsibility has long declared that the purpose of attorney advertising is to educate the public to an awareness of legal needs and to provide information relevant to the selection of the most appropriate counsel.appellants br.quotation marks omitted defendants contend that their rule excluding techniques unrelated to attorney competence reflects this principle and so materially advances new york interest in factual,relevant attorney advertisements.appellants br.
a rule barring irrelevant advertising components certainly advances an interest in keeping attorney advertising factual and relevant.but this interest is quite different from an interest in preventing misleading advertising.like defendants claim that the first amendment does not protect irrelevant and unverifiable components in advertising,defendants here appear to conflate irrelevant components of advertising with misleading advertising.these are not one and the same.questions of taste or effectiveness in advertising are generally matters of subjective judgment.moreover,as the task force report acknowledged,limiting the information that may be advertised assumes that the bar can accurately forecast the kind of information that the public would regard as relevant.task force report,app.i,
defendants have introduced no evidence that the sorts of irrelevant advertising components proscribed by subsection c are,in fact,misleading and so subject to proscription.significantly,the task force report expressly recognized that communications involving puffery and claims that can not be measured or verified were not specifically addressed in its proposed rules,although such communications would already be prohibited to the extent that they are false,deceptive or misleading.task force report,app.i,insofar as the task force report touched on style and advertising gimmicks designed to draw attention,its recommendations were hortatory only.see task force report quoting the monroe county bar association project not and firms to include only factually accurate and objectively verifiable information in their advertisements,and to minimize devices such as puffery in favor of information relevant to the thoughtful selection of counsel.
moreover,the sorts of gimmicks that this rule appears designed to as alexander catalano wisps of smoke,blue electrical currents,and special not actually seem likely to mislead.it is true that alexander and his partner are not giants towering above local buildings they can not run to a client house so quickly that they appear as blurs and they do not actually provide legal assistance to space aliens.but given the prevalence of these and other kinds of special effects in advertising and entertainment,we can not seriously as a matter of common sense that ordinary individuals are likely to be misled into thinking that these advertisements depict true characteristics.indeed,some of these gimmicks,while seemingly irrelevant,may actually serve important communicative functions they attract the attention of the audience to the advertiser message,and they may also serve to impart information directly.zauderer,at.plaintiffs assert that they use techniques to communicate ideas in an form,to attract viewer interest,to give emphasis,and to make information more memorable.appellees br.defendants provide no evidence to the contrary nor do they provide evidence that consumers have,in fact,been misled by these or similar advertisements.absent such,or similar,evidence,defendants can not meet their burden for sustaining subsection c prohibition under central hudson.
section c nicknames,mottos,and trade names 
this subsection bars advertisements utiliz ing a nickname,moniker,motto or trade name that implies an ability to obtain results in a matter,tit,c.we conclude,once again,that the evidence on which defendants rely fails to support this regulation.
there is a compelling,commonsense argument that,given the uncertainties of litigation,names that imply an ability to obtain results are usually misleading.the task force report made precisely this observation,stating in its recommendations that the use of dollar signs,the terms most cash or maximum dollars,or like terms that suggest the outcome of the legal matter is likely to be false,deceptive or misleading.task force report,app.i,like its recommendations on irrelevant advertising techniques,however,the task force report did not recommend outright prohibition of all such trade names or simply acknowledged that such names are often misleading.defendants rule,by contrast,goes further and prohibits such,according to the attorney general,alexander catalano own heavy hitters when they are not actually misleading.the task force report therefore fails to support defendants considerably broader rule.
nor are we persuaded as to this rule constitutionality by reference to friedman rogers,in which the supreme court upheld a prohibition on optometrist trade names.there is doubt as to friedman continued vitality.friedman preceded central hudson by nine years and did not employ central hudson first amendment analysis.as this court previously observed in bad frog brewery,subsequent supreme court precedent has undermined friedman and moved in the direction of greater first amendment protection for a logo or a slogan that conveys no information,other than identifying the source of the product,but that serves,to some degree,to propose a commercial transaction.at quoting posadas de puerto rico assocs.tourism of.accordingly,we decline to rely solely on friedman to uphold c given the subsequent precedential developments establishing more specific and demanding burdens of evidence on the state.
moreover,in friedman itself,the state marshaled substantially stronger and more specific evidence supporting its prohibition on trade names than was done in this case.see,friedman,at.there is a dearth of evidence in the present record supporting the need for c prohibition on names that imply an ability to get results when the names are akin to,and no more than,the kind of puffery that is commonly seen,and indeed expected,in commercial advertisements generally.defendants have once again failed to provide evidence that consumers have,in fact,been misled by the sorts of names and promotional devices targeted by c,and so have failed to meet their burden for sustaining this prohibition under central hudson.
narrowly tailored 
the final prong of central hudson asks whether the fit between the goals identified the state interests and the means chosen to advance these goals is reasonable the fit need not be perfect.florida bar,at.as this court has explained,laws restricting commercial speech need only be tailored in a reasonable manner to serve a substantial state interest in order to survive first amendment scrutiny.state ass of realtors shaffer,cir quoting edenfield,at.nonetheless,restrictions upon potentially deceptive speech may be no broader than reasonably necessary to prevent the deception.in re,at.t he existence of numerous and obvious alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether the fit between ends and means is reasonable.florida bar,at quotation marks and alteration omitted.more precisely,the supreme court has emphasized that states may not place an absolute prohibition on certain types of potentially misleading information if the information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive.in re,at.and the supreme court has also affirmed that a state may not impose a prophylactic ban on potentially misleading speech merely to spare itself the trouble of distinguishing the truthful from the false,the helpful from the misleading,and the harmless from the harmful.zauderer,u.at.
on this basis,even if we were to find that all of the disputed section c survived scrutiny under central hudson third prong,each would fail the final inquiry because each wholly prohibits a category of advertising speech that is potentially misleading,but is not inherently or actually misleading in all cases.contrary to defendants assertions,the fact that new york rules do also permit substantial information in attorney advertising does not render the disputed provisions any less categorical.significantly,zauderer deemed a rule barring illustrations a blanket ban.zauderer,at.and new york rules prohibiting,inter alia,all testimonials by current clients,all portrayals of judges,and all depictions of lawyers exhibiting characteristics unrelated to legal competence are similarly categorical.because these advertising techniques are no more than potentially misleading,the categorical nature of new york prohibitions would alone be enough to render the prohibitions invalid.
moreover,nowhere does the state cite any evidence or authority of any kind for its contention that the potential abuses associated with the disputed provisions can not be combated by any means short of a blanket ban.zauderer,at see also peel,at noting that the mere potential for misleading does not satisfy the state heavy burden of justifying a categorical prohibition.as the district court observed,the state could have,for example,required disclaimers similar to the one already required for fictional scenes.alexander,d at see,tit,c fictional scenes.nothing in the record suggests that such disclaimers would have been ineffective.
the materials in the record show,instead,that disclaimers and other regulations short of bans were in fact suggested.the task force agreed at the outset to deal in practical solutions,generally strengthening existing disclaimers and requiring further disclosures without adding restrictions.task force report nearly all of the report recommendations followed this general rule.and in comments responding to new york draft rules,the federal trade commission,which has a long history of reviewing claims of deceptive advertising,peel,at,similarly stated its belief that new york could adequately protect consumers using less restrictive means such as requiring clear and prominent disclosure of certain information.letter from the ftc office of policy planning,bureau of consumer protection,and bureau of economics to michael colodner,office of court administration,
defendants have failed to carry their burden with respect to central hudson final prong.we therefore conclude,like the district court,that the disputed portions of subsections c,and are unconstitutional.in so doing,we return this matter to the appellate division,where that body may take a second look with the eyes of the people on it.calabresi,foreward,supra,at.
central hudson and the moratorium provisions 
plaintiffs challenges the district court decision upholding new york moratorium on solicitation of accident victims or their families.in cases where a legal filing is required within thirty days,the moratorium is limited to a cooling off period.alexander,d at.new york moratorium provisions apply to all media through which an attorney might initiate communication directed to,or targeted at,a specific recipient or group of recipients,tit,b.
consistent with the regulations as written and with counsel concessions at oral argument,we construe the moratorium provision as inapplicable to a broad,generalized mailings oral arg.b general advertisements conveying an attorney experience in handling suits,even when these advertisements appear near news stories in a newspaper that the attorney knows will be filled with coverage of a particular accident oral arg.or c advertisements informing readers of an attorney past experience with a particular product where that product has caused repeated problems as with the dalkon shield advertisement at issue in zauderer.oral arg.
we turn now to the remaining central hudson inquiries relevant to the moratorium provision.
state interest 
in florida bar,the supreme court recognized as a substantial state interest protecting the privacy and tranquility of personal injury victims and their loved ones against intrusive,unsolicited contact by lawyers.florida bar,at.that case considered a moratorium on solicitation of accident victims or their families.this case similarly involves a moratorium on contacting accident victims and their families.the task force report,which defendants considered,recommended a limited moratorium because the cooling off requirement would be beneficial in removing a source of annoyance and offense to those already troubled by an accident or similar occurrence.task force report florida bar makes clear that defendants stated interest is substantial,and the task force report indicates that that interest is genuinely asserted.the moratorium provisions thus meet the requirements of central hudson substantial interest prong.
materially advanced 
florida bar upheld florida moratorium rule,which is similar to the new york provisions before us.several other states have since adopted analogous regulations prohibiting targeted solicitation of accident victims for specific periods of time the task force report,based in part on the practices of these states,recommended a period during which solicitation of accident victims would be prohibited.task force report,app.i,new york moratorium provisions seek to address the same harms that the florida bar court recognized in upholding a ban on solicitations.and the new york provisions seek to address those harms through similar moratorium on targeted solicitation of potential clients.florida bar makes clear that such means materially advance the state interest.we conclude,therefore,that defendants have met their burden under this prong of central hudson.see moore morales,cir relying largely on florida bar in upholding a rule prohibiting attorneys,physicians,and other professionals from soliciting accident victims within thirty days following the accident.
narrowly tailored 
were new york moratorium provisions limited to solicitation,there would be little question as to their constitutionality.see falanga state bar of georgia,cir.but new york moratorium is not so limited.as the district court recognized,the moratorium provisions in this case extend by their plain language to television,radio,newspaper,and website solicitations that are directed to or targeted at a specific recipient or group of recipients.alexander,d at.
the supreme court has in some circumstances favored a approach to the first amendment.see united states playboy entm t group,cable television,like broadcast media,presents unique problems,which inform our assessment of the interests at stake,and which may justify restrictions that would be unacceptable in other contexts.reno aclu,e ach medium of expression may present its own problems.quotation marks and alteration omitted fcc league of women voters of,w e have recognized that differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the first amendment standards applied to them.quoting red lion broad.fcc,different media may present unique attributes that merit a tailored first amendment analysis.but see jim chen,regulation of speech,duke,a constitutional jurisprudence that minimizes reliance on distinctions best protects free speech.
but the differences among media may or may not be relevant to the first amendment analysis depending on the challenged restrictions.compare sable commc ns of,fcc,unlike an unexpected outburst on a radio broadcast,the message received by one who places a call to a service is not so invasive or surprising that it prevents an unwilling listener from avoiding exposure to it,with reno,at likening regulations seeking to protect minors from harmful material on the internet to regulations on obscene commercial telephone recordings,and sable commc ns,at likening obscene commercial telephone recordings to obscene commercial mailings shapero.bar ass n,our lawyer advertising cases have never distinguished among various modes of written advertising to the general public.
in the context before us,we eschew a approach to the first amendment and conclude that new york moratorium we construe constitutional scrutiny notwithstanding their applicability across the technological spectrum.we focus first on the potential differences among media as to the degree of affirmative action needed to be taken by the targeted recipient to receive the material plaintiffs seek to send.for many media forms,it is about the same.thus,to us,the affirmative act of walking to one mailbox and tearing open a letter seems no greater than walking to one front step and picking up the paper or turning on a knob on a television or radio.
it is true that the internet may appear to require more affirmative acts on the part of the user in order to recover content and is therefore perhaps entitled to greater first amendment protection insofar as users are soliciting information,rather than being solicited.but regardless of whether this characterization was once accurate,it no longer is so.has replaced letters newspapers are often read online radio streams online television programming is broadcast on the web and the internet can be connected to television.see christopher yoo,the rise and demise of the approach to the first amendment,geo,t he impending shift of all networks to packet switched technologies promises to cause all of the distinctions based on the means of conveyance and the type of speech conveyed to collapse entirely.furthermore,internet searches do not bring a user immediately to the desired result without distractions.advertisements may appear with the user search results ads appear on web pages and gmail google service creates targeted advertising based on the keywords used in one.in such a context,an accident victim who describes her experience in an might very well find an attorney advertisement targeting victims of the specific accident on her computer screen 
states are increasingly responding to these expanded and expanding roles of the internet.several already apply existing attorney professional responsibility rules to electronic and internet advertisements and solicitations.see amy haywood melissa jones,navigating a sea of uncertainty how existing ethical guidelines pertain to the marketing of legal services over the internet,geo.legal ethics,i t can be assumed that internet use in the context of legal marketing will generally invoke all ethics rules relating to advertising and solicitation.texas and florida have also added language to their disciplinary rules specifically to address attorney solicitation via the internet the new york task force report reached the same conclusion.the report repeatedly stated that advertisements and websites are not materially different than typical printed advertisements,and that the rules should be enforced equally across media.task force report in so doing,the report demonstrate d that the harms it recites are real and its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a degree.florida bar,at quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we conclude that even acknowledging that differences among media may be significant in some first amendment analyses,they are not so in this case.three aspects of the supreme court analysis in florida bar are of particular relevance to our determination that the harms identified in that case,and put forth by defendants in this case,are just as compelling with respect to targeted attorney advertisements on television,radio,newspapers,and the internet as they are in justifying a ban on targeted mailings of attorney advertisements.

the supreme court has recognized the particular sensitivity of people to targeted plaintiff attorney advertisements during periods of trauma.to the extent that the attorney advertisements,regardless of the media through which they are communicated,are directed toward the same sensitive people,there is no reason to distinguish among the mode of communication.depending on the individual recipient,the printed word may be a likely to offend as images on a screen or in newspapers.
in florida bar,the court recognized the state substantial interest in protecting injured floridians from invasive conduct by lawyers.at.as the dissent in florida bar pointed out,the primary distinction between the targeted letters at issue in florida bar and the untargeted letters at issue in shapero kentucky bar association,was that victims or their families will be offended by receiving a targeted solicitation during their grief and trauma.florida bar,at.the dissent argued that the majority should not allow restrictions on speech to be justified on the ground that the expression might offend the listener.id.
but the majority of the supreme court in florida bar held otherwise.it focused on a subset of the public in analyzing the first amendment essentially,a first amendment analogue to tort law plaintiffs,those who have a porcelain heart.some accident victims and their families might welcome targeted solicitations that inform them of their legal rights immediately after the accident particularly when insurance companies may already be knocking on their doors.other accident victims and their families might be not the targeted solicitations.the supreme court,however,tailored first amendment law,in the context of attorney solicitations,to the most sensitive members of the public.it is with these porcelain hearts in mind that we must evaluate new york moratorium.
in addition to a heightened concern for public sensitivity to potentially offensive attorney communication
