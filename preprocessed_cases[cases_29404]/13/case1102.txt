this case concerns how the new york state department of correctional docs determines when an inmate receives temporary medical leave from prison for the treatment of mental illness.plaintiff appellee steven spavone spavone requested a leave of absence from prison in order to obtain additional treatment for his stress disorder ptsd.docs officials brian fischer,deborah joy,and nick chalk collectively,with docs,defendants appellants denied his request.spavone then brought suit under and the americans with disabilities act ada,et,alleging,among other things,that defendants appellants denial of his leave request violated his fourteenth amendment right to equal protection of the law and his eighth and fourteenth amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.in a january,opinion and order,the district court for the southern district of new york patterson,j.denied defendants appellants motion for summary judgment.
fischer,joy,and chalk,the individual defendants appellants,argue on appeal that the district court erred in rejecting their contention that they are entitled to qualified immunity from spavone claims as a matter of law.we agree,and now reverse the district court decision 
background 
factual background 
new york,like many states,allows some of its inmates to obtain temporary release from prison.sections through of the new york correction law provide for several types of temporary release.relevant here,a leave of absence permits an inmate to leave prison in order to visit a dying relative,attend a relative funeral,or receive absolutely necessary medical treatment.correct.law.the correction law specifies that a medical leave of absence mloa is available for the period of time necessary for an inmate 
to undergo surgery or to receive medical or dental treatment not available in the correctional institution only if deemed absolutely necessary to the health and of the inmate and whose approval is granted by the commissioner or his designated representative.
id.c.regulations promulgated by docs reiterate this standard.see regs.tit,a.
docs regulations establish the procedure for obtaining temporary release.see correct.law regs.tit,et.each correctional facility with inmates that could qualify for temporary release must have a temporary release committee to review applications.regs.tit,a.inmates apply to the committee by completing a form that states the type of temporary release they seek and their reasons for applying.id.a.after an inmate applies,a prison official checks the inmate file and interviews him or her to ensure that the inmate is statutorily or otherwise eligible for temporary release.id.b,c.besides meeting the standard established in,an inmate seeking a leave of absence typically must,among other requirements,be within two years of parole eligibility and not be currently committed for certain violent offenses.id.c.the inmate application must also receive a sufficiently high score based on a point system that takes into account factors such as criminal history and behavior while incarcerated.id.e.for medical leaves of absence,the commissioner may waive these eligibility requirements.id.a.but temporary release of any sort is apparently rare within new york correctional system.in,for example,docs granted only leaves for a prison population of over.
mental health treatment in the new york correctional system is provided by the new york state office of mental health omh,a state agency charged by law with providing such care.see correct.law.a memorandum of understanding mou between omh and docs establishes the various levels of care that omh is obligated to offer within different docs facilities.at some prisons,mostly maximum security,omh provides a satellite unit that employs a psychiatric staff.satellite units provide crisis treatment programs with hour observation,outpatient services,and intermediate care programs.mou at.outpatient services include individual and group therapy and psychiatric services that are similar to mental health clinic services in the community.id.at.intermediate care programs provide patients with housing separate from the general prison population similar to day treatment and residential programs which exist in the community.id.
pursuant to the mou,docs and omh mutually agree upon the amount and level of mental health services required at each correctional facility.id.at.in contrast to a satellite unit,at some prisons omh operates a mental health unit that staffs a minimum of eight hours of psychiatric services a week and provides outpatient services,but not crisis treatment or intermediate care programs.id.at.still other prisons afford fewer options.id.at.finally,omh also provides services at the central new york psychiatric center cnypc,a secure psychiatric hospital,for inmates requiring more intensive treatment.id.at see also correct.law.according to the mou,i nmates are assessed to determine the level of mental health services they will require and are assigned to facilities which have at least the identified level of services needed.mou at.
plaintiff appellee spavone suffers from ptsd,which he attributes to two experiences.first,spavone traveled to nicaragua in the to join the contra rebel forces and saw combat while fighting with them in that country civil war.second,spavone worked on the scaffolding of a building across the street from the world trade center on september.credited with risking his life to rescue several of his coworkers,spavone witnessed victims of the attack jump from the towers.symptoms of spavone ptsd include anxiety,headaches,and vivid nightmares and flashbacks spavone takes several medications to treat the symptoms of his ptsd,and he claims that his ptsd greatly interferes with his daily functioning.
spavone was convicted in of one count of robbery and four counts of attempted robbery in the first degree.he received concurrent sentences on all counts.from to,spavone was incarcerated at eastern correctional facility eastern,a prison with a mental health unit.in he was transferred to woodbourne correctional facility woodbourne,a prison that also contains a mental health unit.spavone was released from prison in.
while he was at eastern,spavone received treatment for his ptsd from a psychologist,edward rudder rudder,and a psychiatrist,venkateswara inaganti inaganti.spavone treatment at eastern included both psychiatric medication and group and individual therapy sessions.when spavone learned that he would be transferred to woodbourne,he informed rudder and inaganti that he would soon be eligible for a medical leave of absence and asked them to write a letter in support the two sent a letter to woodbourne dated april,in which they strongly recommend ed that spavone obtain exposure therapy,cognitive behavioral therapy,and group therapy,without specifying where such treatment could or should be provided.they asserted only that these treatments,especially if provided in a community inpatient program,would be of great benefit to spavone.
spavone was transferred in may.according to him,woodbourne did not initially provide him with the same level of care he had received at eastern.spavone primary therapist was at first a social worker,not a psychologist and spavone claims he was forced to organize his own group therapy sessions.after spavone transfer to woodbourne and in response to spavone concerns about his ptsd treatment there,al shimkunas shimkunas,cnypc chief psychologist for outpatient services,interviewed spavone,reviewed his diagnostic test results,and conducted a full psychological evaluation of him.
in august spavone wrote to both shimkunas and donald sawyer,cnypc executive director,from woodbourne to elicit their assistance in obtaining temporary release.in a letter dated september,shimkunas responded on behalf of both of them.shimkunas noted that while spavone correspondence implies that central new york psychiatric center and office of mental health staff recommend that you be given temporary release in order to pursue further treatment in a residential program,this was not a recommendation that shimkunas and sawyer were at liberty to make.shimkunas continued,however,that they strongly recommended that spavone treatment continue and shimkunas stated they were willing to indicate that treatment in a community residential or inpatient program could be of great benefit to spavone.shimkunas further noted that the treatment spavone was receiving at woodbourne has proved to be an effective treatment for ptsd,including for patients who are incarcerated.
shimkunas thereafter wrote a letter to defendant appellant joy,the director of temporary release programs for docs,informing her that spavone had been treated by omh staff for his ptsd since,that his current treatment included both psychiatric medication and cognitive behavioral therapy,and that spavone was receiving therapeutic interventions designed to reduce the intensity of his emotional distress.the letter further noted that spavone was applying for a medical leave of absence.shimkunas explained 
spavone request for medical leave of absence in a community inpatient or residential trauma treatment program represents a continuation of his desire to resolve the effects of his traumatic experiences.treatment effectiveness in such a program as in his current therapy depends on his intrinsic motivation to address painful memories which is essential for a successful outcome.inpatient hospitalization at central new york psychiatric center is not indicated for his degree of psychiatric disability,as he does not suffer from a psychotic disorder and he is not a danger to himself.
joy responded to shimkunas with a letter stating that a leave of absence is available to seek medical treatment not available in the correctional institution only if deemed absolutely necessary to the health and well being of the inmate.she explained that spavone would not appear to meet this statutory definition,but that if and when he applied,his application would be evaluated.joy concluded by stating that i n the mean time,i hope that spavone continues to avail himself of mental health services available in general confinement.
spavone applied for a leave of absence directly to defendant appellant and commissioner fischer on september.after fischer office informed spavone that he had to apply at the facility where he was incarcerated,spavone submitted an application to the temporary release committee at woodbourne,which was headed by defendant appellant chalk.spavone stated reason for seeking a leave of absence was t o obtain a community based program to provide essential medical care that can not be provided to me while or during my incarceration for ptsd.spavone application,however,did not include material from a medical provider indicating that spavone ongoing ptsd treatment was ineffective,nor did spavone application identify either the community program he proposed to attend or the form of ptsd treatment currently unavailable to him but absolutely necessary to his care.the temporary release committee denied spavone application on the ground that his violent and recidivist history,including the instant offense with counts of robbery in which you robbed the proprietor at gunpoint,meant his release posed a risk to the community 
spavone appealed the denial of medical leave to joy,and attached to the appeal his correspondence with shimkunas,rudder,and inaganti,as well as a letter from a residential treatment facility providing him with information about its program and inviting him to apply.on november,joy denied the appeal,explaining 
after careful review and consultation with nysdocs counsel office there are no provisions in the temporary release rules and regulations that allow a medical leave of absence for mental health reasons.therefore your current application for a medical leave of absence is denied based on eligibility criteria.
after spavone asked for reconsideration of his appeal,joy wrote in a letter that the requested purpose did not meet statutory criteria for mloa.she further explained to spavone,mloas are considered for medical treatment not available in the facility.your request was for an omh placement.you are receiving omh services at your facility and are encouraged to continue these services.joy later explained in an affidavit that her decision was based on the understanding that all of an inmate mental health care needs are met in the correctional facility setting through the comprehensive services provided by omh,and that n othing in the papers submitted in connection with plaintiff application raised a substantial challenge to that understanding.
procedural history 
spavone filed a complaint in the southern district of new york on january,naming docs,fischer,joy,and chalk as defendants.spavone sought damages under for alleged violations of the eighth amendment and of the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment,as well as for alleged violations of the ada.docs and the individual defendants appellants moved for summary judgment on june.
in a january,opinion and order,judge patterson denied the motion for summary judgment,rejecting,inter alia,the individual defendants appellants claim that they are entitled to qualified immunity.he explained that a decision denying participation in the temporary release program on the ground that the statute,correction law,and the regulations do not mention mental health care as distinguished from medical care discriminate s against inmates suffering from mental health issues such as ptsd.spavone state dep t of corr,cv,wl,at.judge patterson concluded that spavone had raised three issues of material fact whether the mental health treatment spavone seeks is deemed absolutely necessary to the health and of the inmate as provided in nycrr a whether the present practices and policies of docs are being administered in accordance with the purposes of section and regulations which docs itself adopted and whether,under the present regulations of docs,mloa is not available for mental health treatment even if it is absolutely necessary to the health and well being of persons such as the plaintiff.id.at.
defendants appellants timely appealed.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
denials of motions for summary judgment are typically not final decisions appealable under.an exception exists for denials of summary judgment motions premised on qualified immunity,which are appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see mitchell forsyth.this is because qualified immunity entails an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like an absolute immunity,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.id.at.
the collateral order doctrine,however,only permits appellate review of a claim of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action.id.at quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan,internal brackets omitted.for this reason,appellate courts may review denials of claims of qualified immunity only to the narrow extent they turn on questions of law.bolmer oliveira,cir.while an appellate court may reconsider a district court determination that an issue is material,it may not reconsider the district court determination that an issue is genuine.id.at.the result is that we may find that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity only on stipulated facts,or on the facts that the plaintiff alleges are true,or on the facts favorable to the plaintiff that the trial judge concluded the jury might find.salim proulx,cir.the reasonableness of a defendant actions,however,remains a question of law,so long as the underlying facts are undisputed.see winfield trottier,cir.
the district court below found three genuine issues of fact.first,the district court found a genuine issue as to whether a leave of absence was absolutely necessary to the health and well being of spavone.second,it found an issue as to whether docs practices and its policies concerning leaves of absence were being administered in accordance with the purposes of section and docs own regulations.third,the district court found an issue as to whether docs policies would ever allow a leave of absence for mental health treatment,even when that treatment was absolutely necessary for the health and well being of the applicant.we must accept these findings as true for purposes of this appeal.
for issues that do fall within our jurisdiction,we review the district court denial of summary judgment de novo.see amore novarro,cir bolmer,at.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.the court construes all evidence,draws all inferences,and resolves all ambiguities in favor of the party.see,novarro,at.
spavone constitutional claims 
spavone alleges that defendants appellants fischer,joy,and chalk violated two of his constitutional rights his right to equal protection of the laws under the fourteenth amendment,and his right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth and fourteenth amendments he argues on appeal that defendants appellants violated these rights through docs policy of carving out mental health treatment from the statutory safety valve for necessary but unavailable medical treatment under.appellee br.at.defendants appellants contend on appeal that they are entitled to qualified immunity.
qualified immunity protects federal and state officials from both civil damages and unnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings.crawford el britton.it is an affirmative defense that the defendants have the burden of raising in their answer and establishing at trial or on a motion for summary judgment.coollick hughes,cir internal quotation marks omitted.its purpose,as we have repeatedly said,is to serve the public good by shielding public officials from potentially disabling threats of liability.see,novarro,at provost city of newburgh,cir see also malley briggs.qualified immunity therefore extends to circumstances where an official conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,and applies regardless of whether the government official error is a mistake of law,a mistake of fact,or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.pearson callahan,internal quotation marks omitted.so long as a defendant has an objectively reasonable belief that his actions are lawful,he is entitled to qualified immunity.swartz insogna,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
even assuming,arguendo,that on spavone version of the facts a reasonable jury could find a violation of his fourteenth or eighth amendment rights,we conclude that the individual defendants appellants are entitled to qualified immunity.see pearson,at.no reasonable jury could conclude,on the record here,that it would have been objectively unreasonable for a public official in the position of these defendants appellants to believe that he or she was acting in a manner consistent with spavone rights to equal protection and to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.we therefore hold that individual defendants appellants have qualified immunity from spavone constitutional claims.
personal involvement of nick chalk 
at the start,and even before reaching the merits of spavone claims,we first conclude that there is no genuine issue as to whether defendant appellant nick chalk,the chairman of the temporary release committee at woodbourne,was personally involved in the alleged violations of spavone constitutional rights.it is well settled in this circuit that personal involvement of defendants in alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under.colon coughlin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on appeal,spavone premises his equal protection and cruel and unusual punishment claims on docs alleged policy of denying leaves of absence for absolutely necessary mental health treatment while affording such leaves for the provision of other absolutely necessary medical care.chalk,however,denied spavone application due to spavone criminal history.it was only when spavone appealed the committee decision to deborah joy that he was told there are no provisions in the temporary release rules and regulations that allow a medical leave of absence for mental health reasons.
we recognize consistent with the district court finding that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether docs present practices and policies are being administered in accordance with the purposes of section and docs regulations that there may be a factual dispute as to whether chalk followed proper procedure in evaluating spavone application for medical leave.spavone,however,has not alleged before this court that any failure by docs to comply with its own regulations was what denied him equal protection of the law or subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment.rather,he focuses solely on the alleged policy of denying all leaves of absence for mental health treatment.since there is no evidence that chalk had any involvement in the promulgation or application of such a policy,he is entitled to qualified immunity 
equal protection 
we next conclude that,even accepting spavone version of the facts,spavone has failed to raise a genuine issue as to whether a public official in the position of fischer or joy could reasonably have understood that his or her actions were consistent with spavone equal protection rights.simply put,a reasonable jury could not deem such an understanding objectively unreasonable on the sparse record before this court.in such circumstances,fischer and joy are entitled to the protection of qualified immunity.see farid ellen,cir.
when a party challenges a government classification that does not involve a suspect class or burden fundamental rights,courts apply rational basis scrutiny.the classification will be constitutional so long as there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.bryant state educ.dep t,cir citing fcc beach commc ns.challenged classifications are entitled to a strong presumption of validity.beach commc ns,at.the party attacking a classification rationality bears the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.armour city of indianapolis,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
spavone does not contend that a suspect group or fundamental right is involved in this case.still,he urges us to apply the standard of review used in turner safley,which would invalidate any prison regulation where the logical connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational,id.at.we disagree that turner applies to this case.turner involved prison regulations that were claimed to infringe upon both the fundamental right to marry and first amendment freedom of speech.id.at.the standard adopted by the supreme court was a compromise between the strict scrutiny standard that usually would apply to such constitutional claims and the inordinately difficult undertaking of running a prison.id.at see also shakur selsky,cir applying turner to freedom of speech claim benjamin coughlin,cir applying turner to free exercise and religious discrimination claims.we thus join the seventh circuit in holding that turner does not govern equal protection claims brought by prisoners that do not involve suspect groups or fundamental rights.see hatch sharp,cir.this is consistent with our previous treatment of such claims.see benjamin jacobson,cir en banc applying traditional rational basis review.
the district court determined that a genuine factual dispute exists as to whether docs policies would ever permit a leave of absence for mental health treatment.accepting this finding,as we must,the question on rational basis review at the summary judgment stage is clear whether a reasonable jury could conclude that no reasonably conceivable set of facts could have provided a rational basis for docs to deny all medical leaves of absence for the treatment of mental illness,while affording such leaves albeit in narrow circumstances for other medical care.fischer and joy argue that at the time they acted on spavone application for medical leave,it was reasonably conceivable that all absolutely necessary mental health treatment was available within the new york correctional system
