background 
factual background 
plaintiff appellant commack kosher is a delicatessen and butcher shop in commack,new york,that specializes in kosher foods.plaintiffs appellants brian,jeffrey,and evelyn yarmeisch are shareholders,directors,and officers of commack kosher.commack kosher operates under the kosher supervision of rabbi william berman,a rabbi of a conservative jewish synagogue.
in,the plaintiffs filed an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,challenging the constitutionality of the prior version of the kosher act that imposed inspection and labeling requirements on food marketed as kosher.the plaintiffs alleged that those statutes violated the religious freedom clauses of the first amendment to the united states constitution known as the establishment and free exercise clauses,as well as the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment.see commack self serv.kosher meats,rubin,d.during that litigation,the plaintiffs challenged only the portions of the law which define d kosher as prepared in accordance with orthodox hebrew religious requirements,require d adherence to those requirements,or we re integral to the state enforcement of such requirements.id.at.the plaintiffs did not contest the sections of the law that simply required the labeling of the food as kosher or the identification or registration of the person or organization certifying a food product as kosher the certifier.see commack self serv.kosher meats,weiss,cir hereinafter commack i citing agric.mkts.law g,e,i.
in,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,finding that the challenged portions of the law facially violated the establishment because that version of the kosher act required state officials to apply religious doctrine namely orthodox jewish standards of kashrut in order to determine whether the food was kosher commack,d at.on appeal,this court agreed,noting that although the state had a valid interest in protecting the general public against fraud in the marketing of kosher food,the challenged laws violated the establishment clause by fostering excessive state entanglement with religion and by producing a primary effect that both advances and inhibits religion.see commack i,at.specifically,the challenged laws excessively entangled the state with religion because,inter alia,the challenged laws interpret ed kosher as synonymous with the views of one branch of judaism,those of orthodox judaism.id.at.the prior kosher act also had the effect of both advancing religion,namely the dietary restrictions of orthodox judaism,and inhibiting religion,by preventing labeling of food products as kosher that did not meet the orthodox jewish religious requirements.id.at.
following this court decision,the new york state legislature passed the kosher law protection act of.agric.mkts.law a d see also kosher act.this law repealed certain sections of the prior kosher act and added three new sections,a,b,and c,which retained in revised form certain provisions of the former law.see kosher act the new kosher act imposed requirements on sellers and manufacturers that market their food products as kosher to label those foods as kosher and to identify the individuals certifying their kosher nature,but did not define kosher or authorize state inspectors to determine the kosher nature of the products.see generally id.in promulgating this new law,the legislature noted that a significant number of consumers within the state seek to purchase food products that are kosher,and that many of those consumers do so for reasons unrelated to religious observance.id.the legislature found it essential that consumers be provided clear and accurate information about the food they are purchasing,and that this goal is furthered by requiring vendors of food and food products represented as kosher to make available to consumers the basis for that representation.id.
ii.procedural history 
the plaintiffs initiated the current suit on february,challenging the constitutionality of the new kosher act and alleging that the law discriminated against jews and impermissibly gave the state a supervisory role over what is kosher.specifically,the plaintiffs claimed that the labeling requirements of the kosher act violate the establishment clause because there is no halachic jewish law requirement that to be considered kosher all food must bear a label stating it is kosher,and certain jews wish to market and purchase particular kosher foods without a kosher label or designation.the plaintiffs contended that by adopting a labeling requirement,the challenged statutes discriminate against jews and some kosher food purveyors.the plaintiffs also argued that the inspection provision that grants the department of agriculture the authority to inspect all food establishments for compliance with the kosher act directly or indirectly involves an analysis of the acceptability or reliability of the kosher nature of the food that is sold additionally,the plaintiffs claimed that the kosher act violates the free exercise clause because it constitutes an impermissible regulation of a religious practice whether a product is kosher and was not the least restrictive means of preventing fraud.finally,the plaintiffs argued that the language of the kosher act is unconstitutionally vague.
on august,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,finding that the kosher act did not violate the free exercise and establishment clauses of the first amendment and was not void for vagueness.see commack self serv.kosher meats,hooker,d.the district court concluded that the new york state legislature passed the kosher act for a valid secular purpose namely the need to protect consumers from fraud in the kosher food market.id.at.the district court also concluded that,unlike the prior version of the kosher act,this legislation is purely a labeling and disclosure law and neither endorses a particular religious viewpoint nor creates an impermissible entanglement with religion.see id.at.the court pointed out that the state does not have the authority through the kosher act to determine if a product is kosher under religious law,and the kled inspectors do not have the authority to verify whether foods are acceptably kosher.id.at.similarly,the district court held that the kosher act does not impermissibly regulate a religious practice in contravention of the free exercise clause because the state does not determine whether a product is kosher.id.at.the court also concluded that the kosher act was a law of general applicability,with only the incidental burden on producers and retail vendors of labeling and disclosing information regarding the qualifications of their kosher certifier.see id.at.as such,the district court found that the state need only have a rational basis for its enforcement of the kosher act,a test the district court deemed the kosher act met.see id.at.finally,the district court held the kosher act was not unconstitutionally vague.id.at.
judgment was entered for the defendants on august.this appeal followed.

kosher law protection act of 
the history of new york kosher fraud statutes,which date back to,was described in commack see commack i,at.like its immediate predecessor,the amended kosher act is contained in article of the state agriculture and markets law entitled adulteration,packing,and branding of food and food products.in summary,the kosher act requires that any food establishment that sells or offers for sale food prepared on its premises or under its control that is represented as kosher post a kosher certification form on the premises that any individual packaging a product which is sold or offered for sale as kosher or kosher for passover label these products as such that any person selling both kosher and products post a window sign indicating that both kosher and products are sold there and that any individual certifying a food product as kosher file his or her identifying information with the department of agriculture,and if that individual is certifying food as kosher,he or she must also file a statement of his or her qualifications for providing such certification.the relevant portions of the kosher act are articulated in greater detail below.
section a,entitled kosher food and food products packaging,requires,in relevant part,that packers or manufacturers of products sold or offered for sale as kosher affix a kosher label to these products.agric.mkts.law a.furthermore,any food product labeled as kosher,kosher for passover,rabbinical supervision,or labeled with any other generic marking indicating that the food product is kosher,may not be sold or offered for sale by the producer or distributor of such food product until the individual certifying such food products as kosher has registered with the department of agriculture and provided identifying information.see id.a see also id.a requiring that any advertisement for food products which represents that such food products are kosher identify the name of the person or entity certifying such food products as kosher.
section b,entitled retail sale of kosher food or food products,provides,in part 
all fresh meat,meat preparations,meat and poultry sold or offered for sale at retail as kosher shall be marked on the label when packaged,or by a sign when not packaged,with the words soaked and salted or not soaked and salted,as the case may be.such words,when marked on a label or a sign,shall be in letters at least as large as the letters of the words on the label or sign designating such meat,meat preparations,meat and poultry as kosher.
section b also requires that any establishment that sells both kosher and food products indicate in window signs that both kosher and food products are sold there.section b requires that vendors of kosher meat or kosher poultry maintain a record of each purchase of such products,including any records relating to the origin of the meat or poultry,for two years after the sale of such products.
section c is captioned persons certifying as kosher filing with department and requires that any individual who certifies food products as kosher or kosher for passover file a statement of such person qualifications with the department of agriculture.id.c.food establishments and caterers offering food products for sale that are prepared on premises and represented as kosher must post a kosher certification form in a visible location on the premises and file such certification with the department of agriculture.id.c.
these same establishments must also maintain a logbook of each inspection visit by the person certifying the food as kosher that includes the name and signature of the individual certifying the food products as kosher,and the date and time of the visit id.c.moreover,c provides,
the department is authorized to inspect all food establishments and caterers selling or offering for sale food or food products represented as kosher to ensure compliance with sections two hundred and two hundred of this article and this section,and the accuracy of any information supplied in accordance with such sections.the commissioner is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations as are necessary to further implement the provisions of sections two hundred and two hundred of this article and this section.the department shall develop and maintain a website that makes available to consumers copies of all forms and certification information that are required by this section.
failure to comply with any requirements of the kosher act results in a fine.id.c.
finally,d provides for written notice to the violator of the violations charged and the penalty assessed,as well as disclosure to the public of the name and address of the violator,the date of inspection,the violation,and the penalty assessed.
ii.establishment clause challenge 
t he establishment clause of the first amendment,which is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.doe phillips,cir quoting const.amend.i internal citation omitted.the united states supreme court has interpreted this clause to protect against three main evils sponsorship,financial support,and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.lemon kurtzman,internal quotation marks omitted.
in evaluating a facial challenge to a law on establishment clause grounds,courts apply the three factors articulated in lemon.see santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe.lemon counsels that the law,to survive such a challenge,must first,have a secular legislative purpose second,its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion finally,the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.lemon,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.courts have frequently treated the excessive entanglement prong of the lemon test as part of the inquiry into a statute principal or primary effect.see destefano emergency hous,cir.thus,when presented with establishment clause challenges,we are required to ask whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion and whether the aid has the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we will first discuss the purpose of the statute.we will then turn to the excessive entanglement prong,followed by the question of the statute principal or primary effect.
secular legislative purpose 
the supreme court has invalidated legislation on the ground that a secular purpose was lacking,only when it has concluded there was no question that the statute was motivated wholly by religious considerations.lynch donnelly,emphasis added.in commack i,this court concluded that the state has a valid secular interest in protecting against fraud in the kosher food market,and that this interest extends to the general public.commack i,at.the plaintiffs now contend,however,that the stated purposes for the act are merely a pretext for discrimination against jews.according to the plaintiffs,consumers can not rely on the kosher label because the sellers of kosher food may label the product as kosher pursuant to any criteria they choose.thus,the plaintiffs claim that the labeling may ultimately be misleading to the consumer and is a meaningless exercise,unless it is viewed as an attempt by the state to impose orthodox requirements on sellers of kosher products 
when a governmental entity professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious policy,the government characterization is,of course,entitled to some deference.but it is nonetheless the duty of the courts to distinguis h a sham secular purpose from a sincere one.santa fe,at quoting wallace.jaffree,concurring.in analyzing whether the legislators had such a sincere motive,the court may consider whether an objective observer,acquainted with the text,legislative history,and implementation of the statute can determine the motive.mccreary,am.civ.liberties union of,quoting santa fe,at.
although consuming kosher food products may have begun as a purely religious practice,sales of kosher food have grown to the point that jewish consumers reportedly now make up less than thirty percent of the consumers of kosher food.commack i,at see also curran lee,cir aid by the city of new haven to the patrick day parade is not an establishment of religion because,even though the practice of honoring patrick may be rooted in religious belief,a parade named after him is not necessarily religious and has possibly evolved into a secular celebration by irish americans and their friends.indeed,as the district court noted,and as discussed in the l egislative findings and intent of the kosher act,a significant number of consumers in new york state seek to purchase kosher food products,and many of those consumers do so for reasons unrelated to religious observance.commack,d at quoting kosher act.the kosher act goal of providing clear and accurate information to these consumers about the food they are purchasing,is furthered by requiring vendors of food and food products represented as kosher to make available to consumers the basis for that representation.see id.quoting kosher act.thus,the legislative history is clear that the labeling law has the secular purpose of protecting against fraud by informing a consumer that a particular seller believes a product is kosher.see kosher act see also agric.mkts.law a.the consumer can then examine the kosher certifying criteria of the seller.see agric.mkts.law a c,unlike its prior version,the kosher act does not adopt a definition,interpretation or standard for the term kosher,and the plaintiffs have not alleged that the act has been implemented in a discriminatory manner.therefore,an objective observer acquainted with the text,legislative history,and implementation of the statute would conclude that the purpose of the statute was secular.
we now turn to the entanglement and advancement prongs of the lemon test.
b.the entanglement factor 
the plaintiffs argue that the kosher act impermissibly entangles the state with religion because it requires goods sold as kosher to bear a kosher label.the plaintiffs assert that many food items are acceptably kosher to jews even if they do not bear a kosher label conversely,orthodox jews will normally not purchase food without a kosher label.thus,the plaintiffs claim that the act adopts an orthodox labeling requirement and thereby entangles the state in religion by favoring orthodox jews.
the kosher act,however,does not adopt an orthodox standard of kashrut,nor does it regulate what foods are acceptably kosher or take a position on what it means for a product to be considered kosher each seller or producer of kosher goods has the ability to determine for itself what standard of kashrut they follow.the law only requires that if a product is to be held out to the public as kosher,the product must bear a label describing it as such,and information is to be provided to the purchaser as to the basis for that description.the presence of the label does not affect the seller assessment of the kosher nature of a product and is not what makes a product kosher or not kosher.the label simply indicates to the consumers that the seller or producer,and its certifier,believe the food to be kosher under their own standards.
the plaintiffs also argue that there is no religious requirement that all kosher products bear a label,and that they specifically do not want to label certain foods as kosher.as the district court noted,however,the kosher act does not enforce religious law or religious requirements.commack,d at.the kosher act merely requires food products marketed as kosher to be labeled as kosher.thus,the kosher act does not entangle the state with religion because it does not require the state to enforce laws based on religious doctrine or to inquire into the religious content or religious nature of the products sold.jimmy swaggart ministries bd.of equalization of,from the state point of view,the critical question is not whether the materials are religious,but whether there is a sale or a use,a question which involves only a secular determination.
the plaintiffs attempt to analogize the amended kosher act to the prior act labeling requirements.however,under the prior act,the state required a seller to follow specific processes set forth in the act that followed the orthodox jewish food preparation standards of kosher before a product could be marketed as kosher.commack i,at.the prior act also gave the state the ability to delegate advisory power under the law to a board on the basis of religion indeed,all six rabbis on the board were of the orthodox jewish faith.id.at.neither situation is present here the term kosher is not defined in the statute,no specific religious processes are detailed as required for kosher labeling,no particular religious viewpoint is referenced,and no particular religion or denomination is given preference.
the plaintiffs also argue that c,authorizing the department of agriculture to inspect all food establishments selling kosher products to ensure the accuracy of any information supplied in accordance with,entangles the state with religion by granting inspectors the authority to verify whether or not a particular item labeled as kosher actually is kosher pursuant to jewish law to analyze whether the plaintiffs view of the statute is correct,we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.see universal church.geltzer,cir.in so doing,we consider the language in the specific context in which it is used,as well as in the broader context of the statute of the whole.in re ames dep t stores,cir see also universal church,at people ballman,when presented with a question of statutory interpretation,our primary consideration is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature.internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiffs challenge focuses on the meaning of the words any information in the statute,arguing that this phrase means that the inspectors act without restriction or limitation and can thereby ascertain whether the food labeled as kosher is actually kosher under jewish religious dietary laws.the issue,however,is what information is supplied pursuant to the statutes namely,whether this includes the assessment of whether the food product is kosher.
unlike the prior law,the kosher act contains no definition of or standard for kosher.as the plaintiffs concede,for the inspectors to verify whether a product is actually kosher,the legislature would first need to adopt an official position as to what is or is not kosher.no such position has been adopted here.the plaintiffs assertion that the kled inspectors are not trained in jewish law only further demonstrates that their interpretation of the law is incorrect.indeed,unlike the prior act,there is no advisory board to counsel or consult on matters of kosher enforcement.therefore,c can only be interpreted as authorizing inspectors to assess compliance with and the accuracy of the information filed with the department of agriculture and the commissioner,not to engage in a substantive evaluation of whether a food item is or is not kosher.see in re chapman,n othing is better settled than that statutes should receive a sensible construction,such as will effectuate the legislative intention,and,if possible,so as to avoid an unjust or absurd conclusion.such routine regulatory interactions between the state and sellers of kosher products,which involve no inquiries into religious doctrine,no delegation of state power to a religious body,and no detailed monitoring or close administrative contact between secular and religious bodies,do not violate the command of the first amendment.see hernandez comm r of internal revenue.
thus,unlike the statute at issue in commack i,the kosher act does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.
advancement of religion factor 
the plaintiffs also contend that the kosher act has the primary effect of both promoting and inhibiting religion by taking sides in a religious matter.the plaintiffs arguments on the advancement factor fail for many of the same reasons as their arguments on the excessive entanglement part of the lemon test.
the kosher act does not endorse a particular religious denomination or sect,but merely requires a seller of kosher products to label those products held out as kosher.although the plaintiffs argue that the kosher act adopts and adheres to orthodox requirements,unlike in commack i,there is no preference by the government of one interpretation of sacred text over others.commack i,at.the labeling requirement may be similar to practices under orthodox judaism in that it requires all products sold as kosher to be labeled as such b ut a statute primarily having a secular effect does not violate the establishment clause merely because it happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions.hernandez,at quoting mcgowan maryland,see also mcgowan,at noting that sunday closing laws further the purpose of providing a uniform day of rest for citizens the fact that sunday is a date of particular significance to christian sects does not bar the state from achieving its secular goals curran,at.here,applying a label to a food product to inform consumers that the product has been deemed kosher by the seller or producer merely happens to coincide with orthodox jewish practice and does not evidence a specific endorsement or impairment of any religious practice or viewpoint.
the plaintiffs also argue that,because of the inherently religious nature of the observance of kashrut,the state will be perceived as having chosen among the various existing religious views regarding the need for or appropriateness of kosher labeling.this argument too fails.in discussing the second prong of the lemon test,the supreme court has warned that violation of the establishment clause can result from perception of endorsement.the establishment clause,at the very least,prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief bronx household of faith bd.of educ.of the city of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.new york,through the kosher act,has not explicitly adopted or endorsed one religion or religious group over another,nor has it encouraged particular religious activities.the neutral labeling requirement does not define kosher or any other religious terms and contrasts with prior situations in which this court has found a perception of endorsement.see lamont woods,cir noting that the message communicated by direct government funding to foreign sectarian schools may offend the establishment clause parents ass of quinones,cir perception of endorsement when,inter alia,female hasidic children were taught in classrooms that only they could use and children could not use,yiddish was spoken in those classrooms,and a partition was erected to physically separate the hasidic girls from the remainder of the school population.
therefore,because the amended kosher act neither advances nor impedes religion,has a secular purpose,and does not create an excessive entanglement between state and religion,it does not violate the establishment clause of the first amendment.
iii.free exercise challenge 
the plaintiffs argue that the kosher act violates the free exercise clause of the first amendment,which applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment,see walz tax comm of city of,by impermissibly regulating religious practices in a fashion and substantially burdening the plaintiffs religious beliefs.
at a minimum,the protections of the free exercise clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons.church of the lukumi babalu aye,city of hialeah.nonetheless,the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.emp t,dep t of human res.of or.smith,internal quotation marks omitted.i f the object of a law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation,the law is not neutral,and it is invalid unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest.lukumi,at internal citation omitted.however,a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.id.at.
the kosher act is a law of general applicability.it applies to any seller who offers products for sale as kosher regardless of the seller religious belief or affiliation.moreover,the labeling requirement of the act impacts all consumers of kosher products,regardless of the consumer religious belief.although consumers of kosher products may initially only have included members of the jewish faith,jewish consumers reportedly now make up less than thirty percent of the consumers of kosher food.the remainder are muslims and others with similar religious requirements,persons with special dietary restrictions,and those who simply prefer food bearing the kosher label as a symbol of purity.commack i,at internal citation omitted see also kosher act a significant number of consumers within the state seek to purchase food products that are kosher,and many of those consumers do so for reasons unrelated to religious observance.thus,as this court recognized in commack i,the interest in protecting against fraud in the kosher food market extends to the general public.commack i,at.
the plaintiffs also concede that the act is neutral on its face.nonetheless,the plaintiffs argue this facial neutrality is not determinative.lukumi,at the free exercise clause forbids subtle departures from neutrality and covert suppression of particular religious beliefs internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,the plaintiffs contend that whether a law is neutral or discriminatory can be gleaned,not only from the statutory language,but also from direct or circumstantial evidence of intent,including the legislative history and the historical background of the statute.the plaintiffs claim that these factors demonstrate a discriminatory purpose,and that the act does not have a truly secular purpose.
an individual alleging such religious gerrymandering must be able to show the absence of a neutral,secular basis for the lines government has drawn.gillette united states,emphasis added.relevant evidence of the basis of the law includes the historical background of the decision under challenge,the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question,and the legislative or administrative history,including contemporaneous statements made by members of the decisionmaking body.lukumi,at.as discussed earlier,these factors demonstrate that the legislature is not attempting to challenge the plaintiffs religious beliefs and that there is a neutral,secular purpose for the kosher act.in lukumi,the local animal protection ordinances found by the supreme court to have violated the free exercise clause were clearly enacted in response to a particular church practicing a religion which required animal sacrifice.lukumi,at here,the new york state legislature enacted the kosher act to
