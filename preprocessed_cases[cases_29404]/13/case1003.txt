the government appeals from an order of the united states district court for the district of vermont reiss,suppressing,on substantive due process grounds,drugs that had been secreted within the vagina of crystal anderson,the wife of defendant valentino anderson,and that she surrendered to vermont state police officers after a lengthy custodial interrogation during which she was the subject of unconstitutional,coercive conduct.the district court held that,because the conduct of the vermont state troopers anderson was sufficiently outrageous,the drugs could not be admitted into evidence at valentino anderson trial.the government does not contest on appeal that the conduct of the vermont state troopers violated anderson substantive due process rights,but contends that anderson can not assert such a claim based on conduct directed solely at his wife.for the reasons that follow,we agree and we reverse.
background 
evidence adduced during the suppression proceedings established the following.on october,the vermont state police conducted a traffic stop of a vehicle that defendant valentino anderson was driving with his wife,crystal anderson,and another passenger named kenneth clark.the ostensible basis for the stop was that the vehicle front headlights were not illuminated in violation of vermont state law.earlier that evening,senior trooper michael studin had received a call from a massachusetts state trooper informing him that a suspicious vehicle was traveling north on interstate.the massachusetts state trooper described the vehicle for studin and told him that the registered owner anderson had numerous prior arrests,including ones for drugs and firearms.studin then contacted senior trooper max trenosky to tell him that there was a potential drug load coming up interstate,and trenosky stationed himself on interstate near the border.united states anderson,cr,wl,at.
approximately minutes later,studin located the vehicle traveling north on interstate,through brattleboro,vermont,and observed the vehicle exit the highway and pull into a gas station.when the vehicle subsequently left the gas station,studin stopped the vehicle.trenosky arrived at the scene shortly thereafter.
when questioned,the three occupants offered differing accounts of their movements and of the purpose of their trip.anderson was required to leave the vehicle and,according to studin,consented to be searched.studin questioned anderson,who eventually told studin that he and his wife had used drugs in the past and that she had problems with heroin and crack cocaine.anderson,wl,at.
meanwhile,trenosky interrogated and searched clark and anderson,and studin then sought and obtained anderson consent to search the vehicle.trenosky found drug paraphernalia in anderson handbag and drug residue in a bag in the pocket of anderson jacket.studin placed anderson in handcuffs,telling her that she was being detained for investigatory purposes,and asked her to sit in the front passenger seat of trenosky vehicle.anderson,wl,at.another vermont state police trooper then arrived at the scene with a search dog.during an exterior search of anderson vehicle,the dog alerted to the presence of drugs and after a search of the front passenger seat where anderson had been sitting,the dog again alerted to the presence of narcotics.based on the reaction of the dog,the troopers apparently believed that anderson may have secreted drugs on her person.
anderson and clark were subsequently released,but the troopers detained anderson.the troopers did not tell her that she had been placed under arrest.they did,however,tell her that she was being taken to the state police barracks and that they intended to apply for a warrant for a body cavity search.anderson informed the troopers that she knew her rights and that the officers had no grounds for obtaining such a warrant.at the barracks,anderson was handcuffed to a chair in the processing room while studin contacted the state attorney and applied for a warrant for a body cavity search.the state court judge denied the application.both studin and trenosky were informed that their application had been denied,but they and the other troopers undertook to conceal this fact from anderson.
at some point,studin and trenosky were joined by a female officer,aubrey crowley.after anderson had been handcuffed to the chair for approximately three hours,crowley approached her,asked if she needed water and told her,referring to the warrant,just so you know,he going to go see the judge right now and get that all signed off,alright anderson,wl,at.the district court concluded that,prior to this conversation,crowley presumably had learned that the warrant application had been denied and so her statement to anderson was false.
another thirty minutes later,after anderson had been handcuffed to the chair for three and a half hours,crowley returned to give her water and said,s o we going to be headed over to the hospital,okay anderson,wl,at.after viewing the police videos of the processing room,the district court described anderson as appearing disheveled,groggy and uncommunicative,hanging her head or turning away as officer crowley attempted to engage her in conversation.id.crowley asked anderson if she wanted to share her story with crowley specifically because crowley was also a girl and because the other troopers could be a little brusque and hard to talk to.id.anderson again requested to see the warrant and indicated that she might talk if she saw a warrant.anderson asked crowley why she would not show her the warrant if the police officers were about to take her to the hospital where she would be forcibly searched.crowley did not tell her the warrant had been denied.
after approximately four hours of detention,crowley took anderson to a conference room in the barracks where anderson told crowley l ike i said,you show me the warrant or there no point and again crowley did not mention that the application had been denied.anderson,wl,at.some time later,in the early morning of october,trenosky came to join crowley and anderson and as he recounted he made small talk by bringing up the fact that her husband had a poor relationship with her as he threw her under the bus roadside and that it speaks volumes about his character,how he left her and went back to rutland.id.trenosky also told anderson that he was disappointed with her and that her relationship with her husband must not be that good if he was willing to let her take responsibility for trafficking his drugs.id.
crowley brought the unsigned search warrant application into the room and anderson asked why the warrant had not been signed by the judge.she again said that if she saw a signed copy she might agree to speak with the officers.none of the officers told her that the judge had refused to sign the warrant and trenosky reiterated how poorly her husband treated her.anderson,wl,at.at that point,anderson began to cry and said that she was not willing to risk a lengthy period of incarceration to protect her husband.then,trenosky finally read anderson her miranda warnings and asked if she would speak with him.she signed a waiver form at on the morning of october,some six hours after she had been arrested.
anderson was then escorted back to the processing room and interviewed for another two hours by trenosky and another unidentified police officer.she admitted that the drugs were concealed in her vagina.trenosky told her that the easiest way to do this would be for her to remove the drugs in the presence of the female officer.anderson,wl,at.he also told her that with the body warrant,it very difficult for us to actually get it signed a lot of times,so a lot of times we ask for voluntary consent,but he still did not tell her that the warrant had been denied.id.at.crowley then accompanied anderson to the bathroom where anderson recovered the drugs from a condom in her vagina and gave them to crowley.
at this point,trenosky told anderson,for the first time,that the state judge had denied their application for a search warrant.trenosky then shared with anderson his modus operandi.he told her as recorded in a videotape of anderson detainmen
