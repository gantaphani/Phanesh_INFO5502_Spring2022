defendant paulino lara appeals the denial of a motion to dismiss the charges against him on double jeopardy grounds after his first trial resulted in a mistrial.he argues that the district court mistrial declaration,following discovery of a bible in the jury room during deliberations,was made without his consent and without the required showing of manifest necessity.after careful review,we agree and conclude that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the indictment.
lara was indicted for importing and distributing more than grams of cocaine in violation of a and a.on the third day of his trial,the jury was instructed and retired to deliberate.shortly thereafter,the court received a note from the jury requesting,inter alia,a transcript of lara testimony.in response,the court sent the court reporter into the jury room to read the testimony aloud.later that day,the court received a second note from the jury that read 
your honor,
we need to inform you that we ca reach a unanimously veredict.we ca get an agreement.we had performed several rounds of votings.
the jury had revised all evidence but is still divided in the decision of guilty or not guilty.is divided evenly.
at that point,the court convened a conference with counsel.it read the note to the attorneys and also informed them that the court reporter had reported seeing a bible in the jury room while she was reading the transcript the court stated 
it seems to me that i just read a case,i not certain where i read it,it was ordered a new trial when the jurors had a bible in the jury room,because then they violating the instructions of the court that they should not consider anything but the evidence.
then the court reporter stated for the record that she saw a huge bible,not the kind you carry in your pocket like a daily inspiration.engaging counsel in a discussion of what should be done,the court initially proposed that it could give them an allen charge,and also tell them that they not supposed to have a bible in the jury room.the prosecutor agreed that an allen charge should be given.however,the court retreated from its initial proposal,stating that i f they have that bible that would contaminate the whole thing.
the prosecutor tried to alleviate the court concern,suggesting that if a juror simply has the habit of carrying a bible around with him or her in that case,it would not be considered a contamination.the court resisted,however,responding it in the jury room.the prosecutor urged the court not to assume that the bible presence was a problem without evidence that it had been used in the jury deliberations.the court then suggested a voir dire of the jury foreperson to ask whether the bible has been used in their deliberations.the prosecutor and defense counsel both agreed to that course of action.
in the presence of counsel,the court called the jury foreperson into the conference room and asked her about the bible.the brief questioning established that a juror had brought a bible into the jury room and that the same juror had used the bible in deliberations.the court then asked the foreperson,would you say that the juror position,whatever it t tell me whether she for or based on the bible,if you know the foreperson replied,well,his evidence are based,wants the rest of us,we hear the facts,but also consider what god says in the bible,something like that.the government requested the juror number for the juror who had brought the bible.the court refused this request,stating,no.i do want to know who it is.the court then asked counsel whether they wanted him to ask any other questions of the foreperson.both replied in the negative and the foreperson left the room.
the court asked to hear from counsel.both the prosecutor and defense counsel began by stating that they were not familiar with case law regarding the presence of a bible in the jury room.the prosecutor requested a mistrial,characterizing the foreperson testimony as essentially stat ing that the juror who brought the bible has referred to specific portions of the bible and has urged the remaining members of that jury to consider those portions of the bible in their deliberations.this characterization greatly overstated the foreperson account of the juror bible reference.the jury foreperson did not state that the juror had referred to specific portions of the bible.nor did the jury foreperson describe this juror as urging the other members of the jury to consider any specific portions of the bible in their deliberations.nonetheless,the court agreed with the prosecutor characterization of the foreperson testimony and asked defense counsel for suggestions about how to proceed.defense counsel offered two interviews with each of the jurors and a curative of which was quickly rejected by the court in the following exchange 
defense counsel you can instruct them that they should disregard any elements 
court that already done.the cat is out of the bag.we ca now say to this juror,do use any biblical arguments.
defense counsel maybe we can interview them one by one and say 
court no,no.
defense counsel maybe they be able to do it,to disregard 
court i inclined to go along with the government,to declare a mistrial,because i do think that this is going to get any better,and to me,it useless to give an allen charge.
defense counsel maybe interview them one by one.
court no,counsel.that will be interjecting the court into the deliberation process of the jurors.
court counsel,give me any other suggestion other than asking jurors one by one why i should declare a mistrial.
defense counsel my only suggestion,your honor,would be either instructing them that they should disregard anything that has been discussed or commented as to the bible,and ask them whether they would be able to do so,as opposed you are supposed to follow the law.
the court once again rejected this course of action,noting that the jurors were not yet aware that the court knew about the bible in the jury room.defense counsel suggested that they could be made aware and that a curative instruction could be given.the court replied that curative instructions could not be used after the jury had begun to deliberate 
court this is not an issue where you can give a curative instruction at trial where something is said,something out of bounds,and the jury has not been deliberating and you tell the jury,do do this,do do that.of course,they would do it.but now it done.there nothing that i can do to cure that,because the purpose of a curative instruction is given to the jury before they go to deliberate so that they can disregard that offhand remark that the court has told them not to consider.but here,they did already discuss the bible,and injected the bible into the deliberations.they have a bible there.next time,i make sure that there no bible,nor any other book thing is really serious,because you are injecting religion,we injecting religion.it not,well,they reading the papers,the world series,they reading about what happened in iraq.that can be cured by saying,give me back the paper.but here,i ca take back what has already been done.like in macbeth,what is done can not be undone.shakespeare.unless you come up with any better solution,i do see any.
defense counsel the only one is the one i have stated,your honor,to ask them one by one whether they can still not consider any argument without giving consideration to the bible.
court that will be worse.the remedy would be worse than the cure.
the court then concluded that it had no choice but to declare a mistrial.the court recalled the jury into the courtroom and dismissed them.a new trial date was set for january,
on january,lara moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis of double jeopardy,arguing that the court had not adequately considered alternatives to a mistrial during his first trial.the court denied the motion in a written opinion on february,explaining in the instant case,the declaration of a mistrial was a manifest necessity first,the jury had informed that it was deadlocked second,the jury foreperson indicated that the jury had been using the bible during deliberations.noting the discretion afforded trial judges in responding to unexpected events at trial,the court recounted that it had maintained open communication with both counsel,requested their suggestions to avoid a mistrial,investigated the situation as to the presence of a bible in the jury room with the presence of counsel,and heard and carefully considered counsel arguments.the court rejected the claim of the defendant that it had made a precipitate decision,reflected by a rapid sequence of events culminating in a declaration of mistrial.instead,the court stated that its decision to declare a mistrial was a pondered assessment of many factors,careful not to intrude upon the sanctity of the jury deliberation or to place upon the jury even the subtlest of pressures.the court then repeated its manifest necessity evaluation 
where,as here,the jury initiative to communicate to the judge that it is deadlocked is coupled with the presence and use of a bible in the jury room and during deliberations,having heard counsel and carefully considered and reflected upon the alternatives,it stands to reason that the court declaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances.united states brown,cir quoting united states keene,cir.
the court then concluded in view of all the circumstances,cautioning the jurors as to their ability to render a verdict discarding any reference to the bible would have been and an ensuing allen charge would have been rendered unsuccessful.
following a second jury trial,lara was convicted and sentenced to months in prison he then filed this timely appeal,arguing that the second trial violated his constitutional right to avoid double jeopardy.
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment protects a criminal defendant from being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.const.amend.v.a defendant valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,united states jorn,d plurality opinion quoting wade hunter,is a constitutional protection entitled to the deepest respect.united states pierce,cir.as a result,the declaration of a mistrial must be a last resort,implemented only if the jury ability to reach a just verdict has been incurably compromised.united states diaz,cir declaring a mistrial is a last resort,only to be implemented if the taint is ineradicable,that is,only if the trial judge believes that the jury exposure to the evidence is likely to prove beyond realistic hope of repair.quoting united states sepulveda,cir.a defendant may waive his right to avoid double jeopardy by consenting to a mistrial ordinarily,the prosecution may then proceed with a new trial.united states,cir.however,when a mistrial is declared without the defendant consent,the permissibility of a new trial depends upon the manifest necessity for the mistrial declaration.united states dipietro,cir.
we review the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds following the declaration of a mistrial for abuse of discretion,at.mindful of the important constitutional right involved,our appellate review must ensure that the trial court indulged in a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion in its decision to declare a mistrial.id.quoting jorn,at.to that end,we accept the trial court factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous,but review the legal principles on which the court premised its decision de novo,united states bradshaw,cir,cognizant that a mistake of law is,a fortiori,an abuse of discretion,at.we then ask whether,given the totality of the circumstances then and there obtaining,the sum of the trial court acts and omissions constituted a misuse of its discretion.bradshaw,at.
the district court applied the manifest necessity test in its order denying lara motion to dismiss,thus implicitly concluding that lara had not consented to the mistrial.we review this implicit legal determination de novo,at whether the facts as found add up to consent is a legal determination that we review de novo.
the government argues that lara failed to clearly object to the granting of a mistrial,and thereby conceded to the declaration of the mistrial and can not now raise a violation of his rights under the double jeopardy clause.to evaluate this claim,we must inquire whether lara waived his right to avoid double jeopardy by consenting,either expressly or impliedly,to the mistrial.dipietro,at see also united states smith,cir.consent may sometimes be implied from a defendant acts or failures to act,such as where the defendant sits silently by and does not object to the declaration of a mistrial even though he has a fair opportunity to do so,at.however,such an implication of consent is not lightly to be indulged.id.
here,the actions of defense counsel belied any suggestion of consent.he repeatedly urged specific alternatives to the mistrial,thereby giving unmistakable notice to the trial court that he opposed a mistrial declaration.while our prior holdings make clear that,in the usual case,counsel must formalize his or her lack of consent with an on the record objection setting forth reasons for the objection,it is immaterial here that defense counsel did not say the words i object in the immediate aftermath of the court declaration of a mistrial.the record makes clear that counsel intended and the district court understood that lara objected to and did not consent to the mistrial.moreover,the court understood the reasons for the objection.that is why the district court never even discussed the issue of consent in its written decision denying the motion to dismiss the indictment.
our decision in dipietro,cited by the government,is not to the contrary.see at.there we held that,although the court had not explicitly alerted counsel that it was considering a mistrial,defense counsel should have anticipated the possibility of a mistrial and been prepared to object or suggest more acceptable alternatives when the trial judge announced his ruling.id.quoting camden circuit court,cir emphasis added.in dipietro,defense counsel never offered any alternatives to a mistrial.id.although the government counsel and the judge remained in the courtroom for several minutes following the mistrial declaration,defense counsel said nothing at all about the mistrial issue.id.instead,she consulted her calendar and discussed acceptable dates for a new trial.id.thus,we concluded that g iven no hint that the defendant desired her fate to be entrusted to this particular,and perhaps severely prejudiced jury,the court did not have to consider any such undisclosed wishes.id.here,unlike in dipietro,lara counsel urged the court to consider alternatives to a mistrial,provided explicit suggestions,and never acquiesced in the court conclusion that it had no choice but to declare a mistrial.these persistent pleas to pursue a different course of action preclude any implication of consent.to the contrary,counsel suggestions informed the court that lara desired his fate to be determined by this particular jury.
our decision in united states mcintosh,cir,also cited by the government,is similarly distinguishable from the facts here.there we held that the defendants had forfeited two of their three grounds for appeal by failing to explicitly object on those grounds at the time the mistrial was declared.id.after a series of problems with a particular juror,repeated reports of deadlock,and a series of attempted remedies,defense counsel had moved for a mistrial and a dismissal of the indictment on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct id.at.however,the trial court declared a mistrial based on a finding of intractable deadlock and then denied the prosecutorial misconduct motion.id.although defense counsel objected generally to the mistrial declaration,we explained that t here was nothing in the attorneys comments that so much as hinted that they thought the jury was not hung or that they objected to the declaration of a mistrial because of the absence of a true deadlock.id.at.in fact,we noted that counsels statements on the day previous to the day of the mistrial gave every indication that they believed aborting the trial on that ground was the proper course.id.as a result of the failure to explain the grounds for their objection,we concluded that the district court had no occasion to consider the arguments that the appellants now belatedly seek to advance on appeal.id.in contrast,lara counsel explicitly disagreed with the court assessment of the magnitude of the taint caused by the bible presence in the jury room and urged alternatives to the declaration of a mistrial.the trial court here had every opportunity to consider lara position prior to rendering its decision.
in light of all the circumstances,we find no evidence that lara impliedly consented to the mistrial.as a result,we agree with the district court conclusion that the manifest necessity test applies.
manifest necessity 
the inquiry into whether a mistrial was justified by manifest necessity is and can not be discharged by resort to a mechanical checklist.brown,at.our task on appeal is to determine whether the district judge declaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances.id.at quoting keene,at.we are guided in this determination by consideration of three interrelated factors i whether alternatives to a mistrial were explored and exhausted ii whether counsel had an opportunity to be heard and iii whether the judge decision was made after sufficient reflection,at see also united states simonetti,cir.
reported deadlock 
when the court declared a mistrial,it did not treat the reported deadlock as an important factor in its mistrial decision.near the beginning of the colloquy,the court stated,i f the bible has played nothing in the jury deliberations,we can then move to an allen charge.however,after questioning the jury foreperson,the court concluded that the bible had played a role in deliberations and that,as a result,it was useless to give an allen charge,which would have urged jurors to reexamine their positions and listen to the views of their fellow jurors.in the court view,it was pointless to ask the jurors to reexamine their positions when those positions had been incurably tainted by the presence of the bible in the jury room.
as we explain more fully below,the premise of the court refusal to consider an allen charge ineradicable taint of the seriously flawed.the court had assumed an ineradicable taint without pursuing the alternatives,suggested by defense counsel,that might have disproved any such taint or suggested the appropriateness of a curative instruction.
in its subsequent written decision denying lara motion to dismiss,the court treated the deadlock issue somewhat differently.there,the court concluded that the combination of the reported deadlock and the bible issues created a manifest necessity for a mistrial however,if the court was going to give some independent weight to the jury report of a deadlock which it did not do when it declared the mistrial,it had to at least explore the alternatives that might have remedied the deadlock or determined its intractable nature.it never did that because of its flawed premise that the bible taint made it pointless to address the deadlock issue.as a result,the record is insufficient to give any weight to the jury deadlock in the manifest necessity analysis.see united states razmilovic,cir w here the record does not indicate that there was a genuine deadlock,and the court has not provided an explanation for its conclusion or pointed to factors that might not be adequately reflected on a cold record,we are unable to satisfy ourselves that the trial judge exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.accordingly,the correctness of the court manifest necessity determination turns on the necessity of the court mistrial declaration as a response to the presence of a bible in the jury room during deliberations.
bible in the jury room 
our task then is to determine whether the district court adequately explored and exhausted alternatives to a mistrial on the basis of the bible in the jury room and whether the court declared the mistrial after sufficient reflection when a colorable claim of jury taint surfaces during jury deliberations,the trial court has a duty to investigate the allegation promptly.bradshaw,at footnote omitted see also united states corbin,cir.the investigation must ascertain whether some event actually occurred,and then assess the magnitude of the event and the extent of any resultant prejudice.bradshaw,at.even if both a event and a significant potential for prejudice are found through the investigation,a mistrial is still a remedy of last resort.see id.the court must first consider the extent to which prophylactic measures such as the discharge of particular jurors or the pronouncement of curative instructions will suffice to alleviate prejudice.id.this painstaking investigatory process protects the defendant constitutional right to an unbiased jury,id.at,as well as his valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,jorn,at.plurality opinion quoting wade,at.the investigation is also critical in creating a sufficient record to permit meaningful appellate review of the district court manifest necessity determination.
although we recognize that the presence of the bible in the jury room posed an unusual situation for the district court,we must conclude that the inquiry conducted by the court was inadequate to support a finding that a mistrial was manifestly necessary.the court questioned only the court reporter and the jury foreperson.this minimal investigation produced only the following evidence that a bible had been brought into the jury room by one of the jurors,and that the same juror had stated,during deliberations,that he wanted the other jurors to hear the facts,but also consider what god says in the bible,something like that.immediately following the court questioning of the jury foreperson after the foreperson had been excused,the prosecutor characterized the foreperson testimony as revealing that the juror who brought the bible had referred to specific portions in the bible and had urged the remaining members of that jury to consider those portions of the bible in their deliberations.as we noted earlier,this characterization of the foreperson testimony is untenable.we do not know whether any specific portions of the bible were actually read or referred to or whether the bible was ever even opened.we do not know whether the bible was discussed by jurors during deliberations or whether a single juror simply referred to the bible generally as something that should be taken into account.in sum,although the questioning of the jury foreperson may have been enough to establish that a event had occurred,it fell far short of establishing the magnitude of the event and the extent of any resultant prejudice.without this information,the court had no basis upon which to assess the potential efficacy of the alternatives to a mistrial,such as further questioning of individual jurors,a curative instruction,or both.
we recognize that conducting an inquiry into a colorable question of jury taint,particularly when that taint involves the bible,is a delicate matter.see bradshaw,at.the privacy and secrecy of jury deliberations play an important role in isolating the jury from undue influence.united states olano,d.however,concern for the sanctity of jury deliberations may not be elevated above the defendant right to have his fate decided by the first jury empaneled in his case.although the district court has broad discretion to fashion an appropriate procedure for assessing whether the jury has been exposed to substantively damaging information,and if so,whether cognizable prejudice is an inevitable and ineradicable concomitant of the jury exposure to an improper outside influence,bradshaw,at,the judge does not have discretion to refuse to conduct any inquiry at all regarding the magnitude of the event and the extent of the resulting prejudice.accordingly,the district court investigation in this case fell short of the scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion required to support the mistrial declaration.see jorn,at.plurality opinion.
additionally,we discern two misconceptions of the law that appear to have contributed to the overly hasty mistrial declaration in this cas
