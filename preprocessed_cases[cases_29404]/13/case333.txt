in this case,we must determine whether the supreme court description of deportation in padilla kentucky as an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes,d,has altered the longstanding notion that removal is and thus does not implicate the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment or related constitutional protections.petitioner rogelio blackman hinds was convicted of a felony requiring his removal,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed an order that he be removed.blackman challenges the bia decision by arguing that,because padilla described deportation as a penalty,his removal violates the constitution unless a court conducts an individualized assessment to determine whether his order of removal is a proportional punishment relative to his underlying criminal conviction.as explained below,we conclude that padilla has not signaled a break from law.thus,we deny blackman petition for review.
blackman,a native of panama,has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since.in april,after a jury trial,he was convicted by a federal court in new york on ten drug and firearm charges.blackman was sentenced to years imprisonment,but received credit for good conduct during his incarceration and was released in.upon his release,the department of homeland security promptly issued blackman a notice to appear in removal proceedings,charging him with removability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony drug trafficking crime.see a b a a iii.
through counsel,blackman admitted the allegations in the notice to appear,but nevertheless denied removability.seeking no asylum,withholding,or other relief from the immigration judge ij,blackman sole ground for denying removability was that his removal would violate his fifth amendment right to due process.although he did not testify,blackman submitted an affidavit describing various factors that,he claimed,should weigh in his favor and against removal.for example,blackman indicated that he had served honorably in the united states marine corps for four years enlisting only a few months after his arrival in the united states at age twenty.he and his united wife now have four children,and blackman asserted that his presence in the united states is necessary to help care for their son,who was seriously injured in a car accident.finally,blackman expressed fear that he would be harmed or killed by gang members if removed to panama.he pointed to a prison beating he had suffered in the united states at the instigation of a who now resides in panama 
the ij concluded that he lack ed authority to consider blackman constitutional challenges.see,matter of c,i t is settled that the immigration judge and the bia lack jurisdiction to rule upon the constitutionality of the immigration and nationality act and the regulations.because blackman asserted no other substantive defense to removal,the ij ordered him removed.the bia affirmed on the same ground,and this petition followed.
consistent with his arguments before the ij and the bia,blackman does not contest that he was convicted of an aggravated felony that renders him removable.nor has he sought any substantive relief from removal.thus,in order for us to overturn the bia decision,blackman must show that his removal would be unconstitutional.see a d.
the constitution vests congress with plenary power to set the circumstances under which noncitizens are permitted to enter and remain in the united states.see,flemming nestor,d.in undertaking that responsibility,congress has at times regulated by reference to an alien criminal convictions.pursuant to statute,aliens who commit certain enumerated crimes are automatically removable.what an alien may see as a simple criminal infraction may in fact pose serious consequences for her continued presence in the united states.
in light of this reality,a majority of the supreme court held in padilla that defense counsel in a criminal case provides constitutionally ineffective assistance,and deprives a noncitizen of the sixth amendment right to counsel,if she fails to inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation,d.noting that immigration reforms over time have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation,id.at,the court found it compelling that deportation is an integral part indeed sometimes the most important part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes,id.at emphasis added footnote omitted.
padilla dealt only with defense counsel obligation in a criminal case to apprise a noncitizen defendant of her plea immigration consequences but blackman asserts that the court description of deportation as a penalty has dramatic and consequences and has necessarily altered the administrative removal process as well.placing heavy reliance on padilla description of removal as a penalty,blackman argues that the constitution mandates that an ij,or this court,assess whether the sting of deportation and its accompanying reentry bar is a proportionate sanction for his underlying criminal conviction.when those penalties would be disproportionate under the circumstances of the individual case,blackman contends that a lawful permanent resident can not be removed and barred from.in essence,he claims that the equities of an alien particular case might require that an alien remain in the united states,either temporarily or permanently,despite congress statutory mandate that he be removed.
blackman grounds this argument in two distinct,but at least in these circumstances related,constitutional provisions the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,and the fifth amendment due process clause.together,these two clauses impose substantive limits on the government discretion to impose criminal penalties and punitive damages.cooper,leatherman tool,d.in either case,the government exceeds those limits when it imposes a punishment that is grossly disproportional to the gravity of defendants offenses.id.at ellipses and alterations omitted quoting united states bajakajian,d 
yet,federal courts have long described removal orders as and,therefore,not punishment.as we explain below,we reject blackman contention that padilla heralded a dramatic change in this view.
a.the eighth amendment 
blackman first contends that the eighth amendment,which prohibits a punishment if it is grossly disproportionate to the underlying offense,united states lyons,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,demands a proportionality inquiry in the removal context.
despite the close association between criminal convictions and removal,however,for more than a century federal courts have described orders of removal as.see,fong yue ting united states.see also reno anti discrimination,d.when noncitizens are removed because they have committed serious state or federal offenses,congress has simply determined that those aliens are among the categories of noncitizens who pose a particular concern to the nation welfare.mahler eby.by referencing a crime as a justification for removing an alien,congress does not seek to punish an alien either generally or for her particular federal or state offense.id.instead,if the government seeks to remove an alien because of some act the alien has committed,he is merely being held to the terms under which he was admitted.anti discrimination,at.for this reason,and however severe its consequences,the court has consistently classified removal as a civil rather than a criminal procedure.harisiades shaughnessy.
moreover,although the outcome is undeniably severe for an alien,because removal is not intended to punish,federal courts have consistently held that the eighth amendment,the ex post facto clause,the double jeopardy clause,and other attendant criminal protections do not apply to orders of removal.accordingly and again for over a century the description of deportation as has expressly foreclosed blackman argument.constitutionally speaking,there is a categorical difference b
