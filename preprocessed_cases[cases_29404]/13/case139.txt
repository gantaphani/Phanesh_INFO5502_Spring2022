congress passed the general railroad act of to provide railroad companies right s of way through the public lands of the united states,one such right of way,obtained by a railroad in,crosses land that the united states conveyed to the brandt family in a land patent.that patent stated,as relevant here,that the land was granted subject to the railroad rights in the act right of way,but it did not specify what would occur if the railroad later relinquished those rights.years later,a successor railroad abandoned the right of way with federal approval.the government then sought a judicial declaration of abandonment and an order quieting title in the united states to the abandoned right of way,including the stretch that crossed the land conveyed in the brandt patent.petitioners contested the claim,asserting that the right of way was a mere easement that was extinguished when the railroad abandoned it,so that brandt now enjoys full title to his land without the burden of the easement.the government countered that the act granted the railroad something more than a mere easement,and that the united states retained a reversionary interest in that land once the railroad abandoned it.the district court granted summary judgment to the government and quieted title in the united states to the right of way.the tenth circuit affirmed.
held the right of way was an easement that was terminated by the railroad abandonment,leaving brandt land unburdened.
a the government loses this case in large part because it won when it argued the opposite in great northern united states.there,the government contended that the act unlike statutes granting rights of way granted nothing more than an easement,and that the railroad in that case therefore had no interest in the resources beneath the surface of its right of way.this court adopted the government position in full.it found the act text wholly inconsistent with the grant of a fee interest,at agreed with the government that cases describing the nature of rights of way granted prior to were not controlling because of a major shift in congressional policy concerning land grants to railroads after that year,at and held that the act clearly grants only an easement,at.under common law property principles,an easement disappears when abandoned by its beneficiary,leaving the owner of the underlying land to resume a full and unencumbered interest in the land.see smith townsend.
b the government asks this court to limit great northern characterization of act rights of way as easements to the question of who owns the oil and minerals beneath a right of way.but nothing in the act text supports that reading,and the government reliance on the similarity of the language in the act and statutes directly contravenes the very premise of great northern that the act granted a fundamentally different interest than did its predecessor statutes.nor do this court decisions in stalker oregon short line,and great northern steinke,support the government position.the dispute in each of those cases was framed in terms of competing claims to acquire and develop a particular tract of land,and it does not appear that the court considered much less rejected an argument that the railroad had only an easement in the contested land.but to the extent that those cases could be read to imply that the interest was something more,any such implication would not have survived this court unequivocal statement to the contrary in great northern.finally,later enacted statutes,see,c,do not define or shed light on the nature of the interest congress granted to railroads in their rights of way in.they instead purport only to dispose of interests if any the united states already possesses.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
in the century,congress began granting private railroad companies rights of way over public lands to encourage the settlement and development of the west.many of those same public lands were later conveyed by the government to homesteaders and other settlers,with the lands continuing to be subject to the railroads rights of way.the settlers and their successors remained,but many of the railroads did not.this case presents the question of what happens to a railroad right of way granted under a particular statute the general railroad act of when the railroad abandons it does it go to the government,or to the private party who acquired the land underlying the right of way 
in the early to century,america looked west.the period from the louisiana purchase in to the gadsden purchase in saw the acquisition of the western lands that filled out what is now the contiguous united states.
the young country had numerous reasons to encourage settlement and development of this vast new expanse.what it needed was a fast and reliable way to transport people and property to those frontier lands.new technology provided the answer the railroad.the civil war spurred the effort to develop a transcontinental railroad,as the federal government saw the need to protect its citizens and secure its possessions in the west.leo sheep united states.the construction of such a railroad would furnish a cheap and expeditious mode for the transportation of troops and supplies,help develop the agricultural and mineral resources of this territory,and foster settlement.united states union pacific.
the substantial benefits a transcontinental railroad could bring were clear,but building it was no simple matter.the risks were great and the costs were staggering.popular sentiment grew for the government to play a role in supporting the massive project.indeed,in,president lincoln winning platform proclaimed that a railroad to the pacific ocean is imperatively demanded by the interests of the whole country that the federal government ought to render immediate and efficient aid in its construction.ely,railroads and american law.but how to do it sufficient funds were not at hand especially with a civil war to fight,and there were serious reservations about the legal authority for direct financing.the policy of the country,to say nothing of the supposed want of constitutional power,stood in the way of the united states taking the work into its own hands.union pacific,supra,at.
what the country did have,however,was land lots of it.it could give away vast swaths of public land which at the time possessed little value without reliable transportation in hopes that such grants would increase the appeal of a transcontinental railroad to private investors.ely,supra,at.in the early,congress began granting to railroad companies rights of way through the public domain,accompanied by outright grants of land along those rights of way.gates,history of public land law development.the land was conveyed in checkerboard blocks.for example,under the union pacific act of,lots of one square mile apiece were granted to the railroad,while lots were retained by the united states.leo sheep,supra,at.railroads could then either develop their lots or sell them,to finance construction of rail lines and encourage the settlement of future customers.indeed,railroads became the largest secondary dispenser of public lands,after the states.gates,supra,at.
but public resentment against such generous land grants to railroads began to grow in the late.western settlers,initially some of the staunchest supporters of governmental railroad subsidization,complained that the railroads moved too slowly in placing their lands on the market and into the hands of farmers and settlers.citizens and members of congress argued that the grants conflicted with the goal of the homestead act of to encourage individual citizens to settle and develop the frontier lands.by the,legislators across the political spectrum had embraced a policy of reserving public lands for settlers rather than granting them to railroads,at.
a house resolution adopted in summed up the change in national policy,stating 
that in the judgment of this house the policy of granting subsidies in public lands to railroads and other corporations ought to be discontinued,and that every consideration of public policy and equal justice to the whole people requires that the public lands should be held for the purpose of securing homesteads to actual settlers,and for educational purposes,as may be provided by law.cong.globe.
congress enacted the last checkerboard statute for railroads in.gates,supra,at.still wishing to encourage railroad construction,however,congress passed at least special acts between and granting to designated railroads the right of way through public lands,without any accompanying land subsidy.great northern united states,and.
rather than continue to enact special legislation for each such right of way,congress passed the general railroad act of,stat.the act provided that t he right of way through the public lands of the united states is granted to any railroad company meeting certain requirements,to the extent of one hundred feet on each side of the central line of said road.a railroad company could obtain a right of way by the actual construction of its road or in advance of construction by filing a map as provided in section four of the act.jamestown northern jones.section in turn provided that a company could secure its right of way by filing a proposed map of its rail corridor with a local department of the interior office within months after survey or location of the road.upon approval by the interior department,the right of way would be noted on the land plats held at the local office,and from that day forward all such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to the right of way.ibid.
the act remained in effect until,when its provisions governing the issuance of new rights of way were repealed by the federal land policy and management act,a,stat.this case requires us to define the nature of the interest granted by the act,in order to determine what happens when a railroad abandons its right of way.
melvin brandt began working at a sawmill in fox park,wyoming,in.he later purchased the sawmill and,in,moved his family to fox park.melvin son marvin started working at the sawmill in and came to own and operate it in until it closed,years later.
in,the united states patented an parcel of land in fox park,surrounded by the medicine national forest,to melvin and lulu brandt.a land patent is an official document reflecting a grant by a sovereign that is made public,or patent.the patent conveyed to the brandts fee simple title to the land with all the rights,privileges,immunities,and appurtenances,of whatsoever nature,thereunto belonging,unto said claimants,their successors and assigns,forever.app.to pet.for cert.but the patent did include limited exceptions and reservations.for example,the patent except s and reserv es to the united states from the land granted a thereon for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the united states reserv es to the united states a for the existing platte access road and reserv es to the united states a for the existing dry park road.at capitalization omitted.but if those roads cease to be used by the united states or its assigns for a period of five years,the patent provides that the easement traversed thereby shall terminate.at.
most relevant to this case,the patent concludes by stating that the land was granted subject to those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted to the laramie,hahn peak pacific railway company,its successors or assigns.ibid.capitalization omitted.the patent did not specify what would occur if the railroad abandoned this right of way.
the right of way referred to in the patent was obtained by the laramie,hahn peak and pacific railroad in,pursuant to the act the right of way is miles long and feet wide,and it meanders south from laramie,wyoming,through the medicine national forest,to the border.nearly a stretch of the right of way crosses brandt land in fox park,covering ten acres of that parcel.
in,the completed construction of its railway over the right of way,from laramie to coalmont,colorado.its proprietors had rosy expectations,proclaiming that it would become one of the most important railroad systems in this country.laramie,hahns peak and pacific railway system the direct gateway to southern wyoming,northern colorado,and eastern utah.but the railroad ultimately fell short of that goal.rather than shipping coal and other valuable ores as originally hoped,the was used primarily to transport timber and cattle.king,trails to rails a history of wyoming railroads.largely because of high operating costs during wyoming winters,the never quite achieved financial stability.it changed hands numerous times from until,when it was acquired by the union pacific railroad at the urging of the interstate commerce commission.thybony,rosenberg,rosenberg,the medicine bows wyoming mountain country hollenback,the laramie plains line.
in,the union pacific sold the rail line,including the right of way,to the wyoming and colorado railroad,which planned to use it as a tourist attraction.king,supra,at.that did not prove profitable either,and in the wyoming and colorado notified the surface transportation board of its intent to abandon the right of way.the railroad tore up the tracks and ties and,after receiving board approval,completed abandonment in.in the united states initiated this action seeking a judicial declaration of abandonment and an order quieting title in the united states to the abandoned right of way.in addition to the railroad,the government named as defendants the owners of parcels of land crossed by the abandoned right of way.
the government settled with or obtained a default judgment against all but one of those landowners marvin brandt.he contested the government claim and filed a counterclaim on behalf of a family trust that now owns the fox park parcel,and himself as trustee brandt asserted that the stretch of the right of way crossing his family land was a mere easement that was extinguished upon abandonment by the railroad,so that,under common law property rules,he enjoyed full title to the land without the burden of the easement.the government countered that it had all along retained a reversionary interest in the railroad right of way that is,a future estate that would be restored to the united states if the railroad abandoned or forfeited its interest.
the district court granted summary judgment to the government and quieted title in the united states to the right of way over brandt land.wl d,the court of appeals affirmed.united states brandt,fed.appx.per curiam.the court acknowledged division among lower courts regarding the nature of the government interest if any in abandoned act rights of way.but it concluded based on circuit precedent that the united states had retained an implied reversionary interest in the right of way,which then vested in the united states when the right of way was relinquished,at.
we granted certiorari.
this dispute turns on the nature of the interest the united states conveyed to the in pursuant to the act.brandt contends that the right of way granted under the act was an easement,so that when the railroad abandoned it,the underlying land brandt fox park parcel simply became unburdened of the easement.the government does not dispute that easements normally work this way,but maintains that the act granted the railroads something more than an easement,reserving an implied reversionary interest in that something more to the united states.the government loses that argument today,in large part because it won when it argued the opposite before this court more than years ago,in the case of great northern railway united states.
in,great northern succeeded to an act right of way that ran through public lands in glacier county,montana.oil was later discovered in the area,and great northern wanted to drill beneath its right of way.but the government sued to enjoin the railroad from doing so,claiming that the railroad had only an easement,so that the united states retained all interests beneath the surface.
this court had indeed previously held that the statutes,granting rights of way accompanied by checkerboard land subsidies,conveyed to the railroads a limited fee,made on an implied condition of reverter.see,northern pacific townsend.great northern relied on those cases to contend that it owned a fee interest in the right of way,which included the right to drill for minerals beneath the surface.
the government disagreed.it argued that the act granted an easement and nothing more,and that the railroad accordingly could claim no interest in the resources beneath the surface.brief for united states in great northern united states.the year marks the end of one era and the beginning of a new in american history,the government contended thus,cases construing the statutes were inapplicable in construing the act,at.instead,the government argued,the text,background,and subsequent administrative and congressional construction of the act all made clear that,unlike rights of way granted under statutes,those granted under the act were mere easements.
the court adopted the united states position in full,holding that the act clearly grants only an easement,and not a fee.great northern,at.the court found section of the act especially persuasive,because it provided that all such lands over which such right of way shall pass shall be disposed of subject to such right of way.ibid.calling this language wholly inconsistent with the grant of a fee interest,the court endorsed the lower court statement that a pter words to indicate the intent to convey an easement would be difficult to find.ibid.
that interpretation was confirmed,the court explained,by the historical background against which the act was passed and by subsequent administrative and congressional interpretation.the court accepted the government position that prior cases describing the nature of rights of way including townsend,supra,at were not controlling,because of the shift in congressional policy after that year.great northern,supra,at,and.the court also specifically disavowed the characterization of an act right of way in rio grande western stringham,as a limited fee,made on an implied condition of reverter.great northern,supra,at quoting stringham,supra,at.the court noted that in stringham it does not appear that congress change of policy after was brought to the court attention,given that n o brief was filed by the defendant or the united states in that case.great northern,supra,at,and.
the dissent is wrong to conclude that great northern merely held that the right of way did not confer one particular attribute of fee title.post,at opinion of sotomayor.to the contrary,the court specifically rejected the notion that the right of way conferred even a limited fee.at see also,at declining to follow cases describing a right of way as a limited,base,or qualified fee.instead,the court concluded,it was clear from the language of the act,its legislative history,its early administrative interpretation and the construction placed upon it by congress in enactments that the railroad had obtained only an easement in its rights of way acquired under the act of.at see united states union pacific,noting the conclusion in great northern that,in the period after,only an easement for railroad purposes was granted at frankfurter,dissenting observing that the court conclude d in the great northern case that a right of way granted by the act was an easement and not a limited fee 
when the united states patented the fox park parcel to brandt parents in,it conveyed fee simple title to that land,subject to those rights for railroad purposes that had been granted to the.the united states did not reserve to itself any interest in the right of way in that patent.under great northern,the railroad thus had an easement in its right of way over land owned by the brandts.
the essential features of easements including,most important here,what happens when they cease to be used are well settled as a matter of property law.an easement is a nonpossessory right to enter and use land in the possession of another and obligates the possessor not to interfere with the uses authorized by the easement.restatement third of property servitudes.unlike most possessory estates,easements may be unilaterally terminated by abandonment,leaving the servient owner with a possessory estate unencumbered by the servitude.comment d,comments a,f.in other words,if the beneficiary of the easement abandons it,the easement disappears,and the landowner resumes his full and unencumbered interest in the land.see smith townsend,w hoever obtained title from the government to any land through which ran this right of way would acquire a fee to the whole tract subject to the easement of the company,and if ever the use of that right of way was abandoned by the railroad company the easement would cease,and the full title to that right of way would vest in the patentee of the land op,the purchasers or grantees of the united states took the fee of the lands patented to them subject to the easement created by the act of but on a discontinuance or abandonment of that right of way the entire and exclusive property,and right of enjoyment thereto,vested in the proprietors of the soil 
those basic common law principles resolve this case.when the wyoming and colorado railroad abandoned the right of way in,the easement referred to in the brandt patent terminated.brandt land became unburdened of the easement,conferring on him the same full rights over the right of way as he enjoyed over the rest of the fox park parcel.
contrary to that straightforward conclusion,the government now tells us that great northern did not really mean what it said.emphasizing that great northern involved only the question of who owned the oil and min 
erals beneath a right of way,the government asks the court to limit its characterization of act rights of way as easements to that context.even if the right of way has some features of an easement such as granting only a surface interest to the railroad when the government wants the subsurface oil and minerals the government asks us to hold that the right of way is not an easement for purposes of what happens when the railroad stops using it.but nothing in the text of the act supports such an improbable and reading.
the government argues that the similarity in the language of the act and the statutes shows that congress intended to reserve a reversionary interest in the lands granted under the act,just as it did in the statutes.see brief for united states.but that is directly contrary to the very premise of this court decision and the government argument in great northern that the act granted a fundamentally different interest in the rights of way than did the predecessor statutes,at see great northern brief great northern argument fails because it disregards the essential differences between the act and its predecessors.contrary to the government position now but consistent with the government position in great northern stands for the proposition that the statutes and this court decisions construing them have little relevance to the question of what interest the act conveyed to railroads.
the government next contends that this court decisions in stalker oregon short line,and great northern steinke,support its position that the united states retains an implied reversionary interest in act rights of way.brief for united states.according to the government,both stalker and steinke demonstrate that those rights of way can not be bare common law easements,because those cases concluded that patents purporting to convey the land underlying a right of way were inoperative to pass title.brief for united states quoting steinke,supra,at see also tr.of oral arg.if the right of way were a mere easement,the argument goes,the patent would have passed title to the underlying land subject to the railroad right of way,rather than failing to pass title altogether.but that is a substantial overreading of those cases.
in both stalker and steinke,a railroad that had already obtained an act right of way thereafter claimed adjacent land for station grounds under the act,as it was permitted to do because of its right of way.a homesteader subsequently filed a claim to the same land,unaware of the station grounds.the question in each case was whether the railroad could build on the station grounds,notwithstanding a subsequent patent to the homesteader.the homesteader claimed priority because the railroad station grounds map had not been recorded in the local land office at the time the homesteader filed his claim.this court construed the act to give the railroad priority because it had submitted its proposed map to the department of the interior before the homesteader filed his claim.see stalker,supra,at steinke,supra,at.
the dispute in each case was framed in terms of competing claims to the right to acquire and develop the same tract of land.the court ruled for the railroad,but did not purport to define the precise nature of the interest granted under the act.indeed,it does not appear that the court in either case considered much less rejected an argument that the railroad had obtained only an easement in the contested land,so that the patent could still convey title to the homesteader.in any event,to the extent that stalker and steinke could be read to imply that the had been granted something more than an easement,any such implication would not have survived this court unequivocal statement in great northern that the act clearly grants only an easement,and not a fee.at.
finally,the government relies on a number of later enacted statutes that it says demonstrate that congress believed the united states had retained a reversionary interest in the act rights of way.brief for united states.but each of those statutes purported only to dispose of interests the united states already possessed,not to create or modify any such interests in the first place.first,in and,congress declared forfeited any right of way on which a railroad had not been constructed in the five years after the location of the road.the united states would resume the full title to the lands covered thereby free and discharged of such easement,but the forfeited right of way would immediately inure to the benefit of any owner or owners of land conveyed by the united states prior to such date.ibid.
then,in,congress provided that whenever a railroad forfeited or officially abandoned its right of way,all right,title,interest,and estate of the united states in said lands other than land that had been converted to a public highway would immediately be transferred to either the municipality in which it was located,or else to the person who owned the underlying land.finally,as part of the national trails system improvements act of,congress changed course and sought to retain title to abandoned or forfeited railroad rights of way,specifying that any and all right,title,interest,and estate of the united states in such rights of way shall remain in the united states upon abandonment or forfeiture.c.
the government argues that these statutes prove that congress intended to retain or at least believed it had retained a reversionary interest in act rights of way.otherwise,the argument goes,these later statutes providing for the disposition of the abandoned or forfeited strips of land would have been meaningless.that is wrong.this case turns on what kind of interest congress granted to railroads in their rights of way in.leo sheep,at the pertinent inquiry in this case is the intent of congress when it granted land to the union pacific in.great northern answered that question an easement.the statutes the government cites do not purport to define or redefine the nature of the interest conveyed under the act.nor do they shed light on what kind of property interest congress intended to convey to railroads in.see united states price,the views of a subsequent congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one 
in other words,these statutes do not tell us whether the united states has an interest in any particular right of way they simply tell us how any interest the united states might have should be disposed of.for rights of way in which the united states retained an implied reversionary interest,or for rights of way crossing public lands,these statutes might make a difference in what happens to a forfeited or abandoned right of way.but if there is no right,title,interest,or estate of the united states in the right of way,then the statutes simply do not apply.
we can not overlook the irony in the government argument based on sections and.those provisions plainly evince congress intent to divest the united states of any title or interest it had retained to railroad rights of way,and to vest that interest in individuals to whom the underlying land had been patented in other words,people just like the brandts.it was not until years after the united states patented the fox park parcel to the brandts that congress did an and attempted to reserve the rights of way to the united states.that policy shift can not operate to create an interest in land that the government had already given away 
more than years ago,the government argued before this court that a right of way granted under the act was a simple easement.the court was persuaded,and so ruled.now the government argues that such a right of way is tantamount to a limited fee with an implied reversionary interest.we decline to endorse such a stark change in position,especially given the special need for certainty and predictability where land titles are concerned.leo sheep,supra,at.
the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the court bases today holding almost entirely on great northern united states,and its conclusion that the general railroad act of granted only an easement,and not a fee,to a railroad possessing a right of way.the court errs,however,in two ways.first,it does not meaningfully grapple with prior cases northern pacific townsend,and rio grande western stringham,that expressly concluded that the united states retained a reversionary interest in railroad rights of way.to the extent the court regards great northern as having abrogated these precedents,it places on great northern more weight than that case will bear.second,the court relies on basic common law principles,ante,at,without recognizing that courts have long treated railroad rights of way as sui generis property rights not governed by the ordinary regime.because townsend and stringham largely dictate the conclusion that the government retained a reversionary interest when it granted the right of way at issue,and because any ambiguity in land grants is to be resolved favorably to a sovereign grantor,great northern,at,i respectfully dissent.
over a century ago,this court held that a right of way granted to a railroad by a act of congress included an implied condition of reverter to the government if the right of way ceased to be used for the purpose for which it was granted.northern pacific townsend.the question in townsend was whether individual homesteaders could acquire title by adverse possession to land granted by the united states as a railroad right of way.the court held that they could not,because the land forming the right of way was not granted with the intent that it might be absolutely disposed of at the volition of the company.ibid.on the contrary,the court held,the grant was explicitly stated to be for a designated purpose,one w
