when this case first came to us on appeal,we certified to the new york court of appeals two questions concerning the scope of new york statute,as set forth in a,in our effort to determine whether the district court had personal jurisdiction over defendant lebanese canadian bank,sal lcb.the court of appeals accepted our certified questions,and,in response,explained that a foreign bank use of a new york correspondent account to execute dozens of wire transfers is sufficiently purposeful conduct to constitute a transaction of business within the meaning of that section.licci lebanese canadian bank,sal,n,licci iii.the court of appeals also concluded that the allegations contained in the complaint,taken as true for these purposes,establish the requisite nexus or relationship between the foreign bank new york business activity and the plaintiffs claims to support the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction under the statute.id.at,at,at.
now that the new york court of appeals has answered the portion of the jurisdictional inquiry,we must ensure that subjecting the foreign bank to personal jurisdiction in new york comports with due process protections provided by the united states constitution.we conclude that it does.we therefore vacate that part of the district court judgment dismissing the complaint against defendant lcb for lack of personal jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because our previous opinion extensively recites the facts and procedural history of this case,see licci lebanese canadian bank,sal,cir licci ii,we reiterate here only those facts we think necessary to understand our disposition of this appeal following the new york court of appeals answers to our certified questions.
plaintiffs are american,canadian,and israeli citizens who were injured,or whose family members were injured or killed,in rocket attacks allegedly carried out by in july and august in israel.id.at.defendant lcb is a lebanese bank with no operations,branches,or employees in the united states id.at.to effectuate transactions,lcb maintains a correspondent bank with defendant american express bank amex in new york.id.the plaintiffs allege that lcb used this correspondent account to wire millions of dollars on behalf of hizballah,knowing that such wire transfers would enable hizballah to plan,to prepare for and to carry out terrorist attacks,including the rocket attacks in which the plaintiffs or their family members were injured.am.compl.specifically,the plaintiffs allege that lcb executed wire transfers using its correspondent account in new york,for an account held by the shahid martyrs foundation shahid,which is a financial arm of hizballah.id.shahid was the account holder in name only.the plaintiffs allege that funds held in shahid lcb account belonged to hizbollah and were under the control of hizbollah,id,and that lcb carried out wire transfers for the shahid account in order to assist and advance hizbollah goal of using terrorism to destroy the state of israel,id.
proceedings in the district court 
the plaintiffs brought five claims against lcb commission of international terrorism in violation of the anti terrorism act,u.aiding and abetting international terrorism in violation of the anti terrorism act aiding and abetting genocide,war crimes,and crimes against humanity in violation of international law,under the alien tort statute,the ats negligence in violation of israeli civil wrongs ordinance and breach of statutory duty in violation of israeli civil wrongs ordinance lcb moved to dismiss all five claims for lack of personal jurisdiction under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,and for failure to state a claim under rule b.
in a memorandum decision and order dated march,the district court granted lcb rule b motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.licci am.express bank,d licci i.the district court correctly noted that a defendant may be subject to personal jurisdiction in new york under a if the defendant transacted business within the state and the claim asserted arise s from that business activity,id.at quoting solé resort,de allure resorts,llc,cir,but decided that the allegations in the amended complaint were insufficient to satisfy either such prong,id.at.
with respect to section a transaction of business requirement,the district court concluded that lcb execution of wire transfers is not a use of a correspondent account which alone is sufficient to confer jurisdiction over a foreign bank because one of the primary functions of a correspondent account is to facilitate wire transfers.id.at.it could perceive no meaningful distinction between use of a correspondent account and the maintenance of such an account,which some decisions had found to be insufficient,standing alone,to establish personal jurisdiction.id.at.
with respect to section a requirement that a plaintiff claim arise from new york business activity,the district court apparently interpreted new york statute to require that the defendant transaction of business proximately caused the plaintiff injury.id.at.it found no such proximate causation because t he injuries and death suffered by plaintiffs and their family members were caused by the rockets launched by hizbollah,not by the banking services provided by lcb through its correspondent account or wire transfers with amex bank via new york.id.
although the rule b dismissal rested entirely on the plaintiffs failure to make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction under new york law,the district court also offered its view without further explication that t he exercise of personal jurisdiction over lcb on the basis alleged by plaintiffs would not comport with constitutional principles of due process.id.the court did not reach lcb alternative argument that the complaint should be dismissed for failure adequately to plead a cause of action under rule b.
proceedings in this court 
in our initial consideration of the plaintiffs appeal,we found the scope and application of the statute transaction of business and arising from tests to be uncertain.we determined that we could not confidently say whether the new york court of appeals would conclude that the plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of jurisdiction under a.licci ii,at.we therefore certified the following questions to the new york court of appeals 
does a foreign bank maintenance of a correspondent bank account at a financial institution in new york,and use of that account to effect dozens of wire transfers on behalf of a foreign client,constitute a transact ion of business in new york within the meaning of a 
if so,do the plaintiffs claims under the anti terrorism act,the ats,or for negligence or breach of statutory duty in violation of israeli law,aris e from lcb transaction of business in new york within the meaning of a

on march,the court of appeals accepted our certified questions.licci lebanese canadian bank,sal.having heard argument on the case,the court answered the certified questions in the affirmative.licci iii,at,at,at.equipped with this guidance,we now return to the jurisdictional questions presented 
discussion 
personal jurisdiction 
we review de novo the district court rule b dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant.chloé queen bee of beverly hills,llc,cir.in order to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that jurisdiction exists.thomas ashcroft,cir.in evaluating whether the requisite showing has been made,we construe the pleadings and any supporting materials in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.chloé,at.
determining personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant in a case such as this requires a inquiry.first,we look to the law of the forum state to determine whether personal jurisdiction will lie.see best van lines,walker,cir.if jurisdiction lies,we consider whether the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant comports with due process protections established under the united states constitution.see also int l shoe washington.
new york statute provides in relevant part that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any who in person or through an agent transacts any business within the state or contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the state.a.to establish personal jurisdiction under section a,two requirements must be met the defendant must have transacted business within the state and the claim asserted must arise from that business activity.solé resort,at.
transacting business.in its response to our certified questions,the court of appeals confirmed that amigo foods marine midland bank,stands for the proposition that the use of a new york correspondent bank account,standing alone,may be considered a transaction of business under the statute if the defendant use of the correspondent account was purposeful.licci iii,at,at,d at.the court concluded that whether a defendant has purposefully availed itself of the new york forum is a inquiry inasmuch as it requires the trial court,in the first instance,to closely examine the defendant contacts for their quality.id.at,at,at.as a general matter,however,
complaints alleging a foreign bank repeated use of a correspondent account in new york on behalf of a client in effect,a course of dealing show purposeful availment of new york dependable and transparent banking system,the dollar as a stable and fungible currency,and the predictable jurisdictional and commercial law of new york and the united states.
id.at,at,at citation omitted.
with respect to lcb contacts with new york,the court of appeals found both the frequency and deliberate nature of lcb use of its correspondent account to be determinative.the court focused on the allegations that lcb used its new york correspondent account dozens of times to effect its support of shahid and shared terrorist goals,not once or twice by mistake.id.at,at,at.the court confirmed that this conduct indicates desirability and a lack of coincidence,at,at that is,it reflects lcb purposeful availment of the privilege of doing business in the new york forum.
claims arising from a transaction of business.the court of appeals made clear that the arising from prong of section a does not require a causal link between the defendant new york business activity and a plaintiff injury.instead,it requires a relatedness between the transaction and the legal claim such that the latter is not completely unmoored from the former,regardless of the ultimate merits of the claim.id.at,at,at.according to the court,whether a plaintiff claim arises from a defendant new york contacts depends upon the nature and elements of the particular causes of action pleaded.id.at,at,at.however,section a does not require that every element of the cause of action pleaded must be related to the new york contacts rather,where at least one element arises from the new york contacts,the relationship between the business transaction and the claim asserted supports specific jurisdiction under the statute.id.at,at,at.
with respect to the plaintiffs claims against lcb,which the court of appeals characterized as claims for breach of various statutory duties,the court acknowledged that n ot all elements of the causes of action pleaded are related to lcb use of the correspondent account,inasmuch as the specific harms suffered by plaintiffs flowed not from lcb alleged support of a terrorist organization,but rather from rockets,at,at.but,the court pointed out,the plaintiffs claims are also grounded in the allegation that lcb violated various statutory duties by using its correspondent account to funnel money to shahid and hizballah.id.at,at,at.because the defendant allegedly culpable conduct stems from this use of the new york correspondent account,the court of appeals concluded,the plaintiffs claims are sufficiently related to lcb new york business activity to satisfy the second prong of section a.see,at,at.
the plaintiffs have therefore made a prima facie showing that the district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over lcb with respect to their anti terrorism act,ats,and israeli law claims pursuant to the state statute.
constitutional due process 
now that the jurisdictional questions have been resolved,we must determine whether the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over lcb is consistent with the due process protections provided by the united states constitution.ehrenfeld mahfouz,cir e ven if the new york court of appeals concludes that personal jurisdiction is proper under a of the new york statute,this court must make the ultimate determination whether this jurisdiction satisfies constitutional due process.
due process considerations require that the defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at internal quotation marks omitted.where,as in this case,the plaintiffs ask the district court to assert specific over the defendants,the jurisdictional inquiry focuses on the affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy.goodyear dunlop tires operations brown,internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
our analysis typically proceeds in two steps.first,we evaluate the quality and nature of the defendant contacts with the forum state under a totality of the circumstances test.best van lines,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.where the claim arises out of,or relates to,the defendant contacts with the forum,specific jurisdiction is asserted minimum contacts necessary to support such jurisdiction exist where the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum and could foresee being haled into court there.bank brussels lambert fiddler gonzalez rodriguez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
once it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum state,these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.burger king rudzewicz,internal quotation marks omitted.relevant factors at this second step of the analysis may include the burden that the exercise of jurisdiction will impose on the defendant the interests of the forum state in adjudicating the case and the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief metro.life ins.robertson ceco,cir.
we pause to note that,despite the fact that section a of new york statute and constitutional due process are not coextensive,and that personal jurisdiction permitted under the statute may theoretically be prohibited under due process analysis,we would expect such cases to be rare.it would be unusual,indeed,if a defendant transacted business in new york and the claim asserted arose from that business activity within the meaning of section a,and yet,in connection with the same transaction of business,the defendant can not be found to have purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in the forum and to have been able to foresee being haled into court there,bank brussels lambert,at internal quotation marks omitted,or the assertion of specific jurisdiction would somehow otherwise offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,int l shoe,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,we have been pointed to no such decisions in this circuit.that observation does not,however,spare us from a separate constitutional analysis in each such case.
minimum contacts.the jurisdictional basis for the plaintiffs claims is lcb execution of dozens of wire transfers through its amex correspondent account in new york.these wire transfers are a part of the principal wrong at which the plaintiffs lawsuit is directed inasmuch as they allege that lcb carried out the t ransfers as a matter of official lcb policy,in order to assist and advance hizbollah terrorist activities against jews in israel in violation of various statutory duties.am.compl.
we conclude that the selection and repeated use of new york banking system,as an instrument for accomplishing the alleged wrongs for which the plaintiffs seek redress,constitutes purposeful avail ment of the privilege of doing business in new york,bank brussels lambert,at internal quotation marks omitted,so as to permit the subjecting of lcb to specific jurisdiction within the southern district of new york consistent with due process requirements.
in light of the widespread acceptance and availability of currency,lcb could have,as it acknowledges,processed wire transfers for the shahid account through correspondent accounts anywhere in the world.appellee post argument letter brief at see also tamam fransabank sal,d,noting that foreign bank defendants maintained dollar correspondent relationships with banks located in cairo,sri lanka,london,paris,jordan,the philippines,and saudi arabia,any of which they could have used to execute wire transfers on behalf of hizballah front groups.but lcb deliberately chose to process the many shahid wire transfers through amex in new york.
moreover,lcb use of a correspondent account in new york to accomplish its wire transfers was recurring.indeed,the plaintiffs allege wire transfers through amex that numbered in the dozens and totaled several million dollars,so it can not be said that lcb contacts with new york were random,isolated,or fortuitous.keeton hustler magazine.this deliberate and recurring activity constitutes,as the court of appeals put it in analyzing the applicability of new york statute,lcb purposeful availment of new york dependable and transparent banking system,the dollar as a stable and fungible currency,and the predictable jurisdictional and commercial law of new york and the united states.licci iii,at,at,n.at see also id.at,at,d at speculating that,although lcb could have routed the shahid wire transfers through any correspondent account,cost savings or other conveniences associated with the amex account in new york enabled lcb to retain shahid as a customer.
in reaching this conclusion,we by no means suggest that a foreign defendant mere maintenance of a correspondent account in the united states is sufficient to support the constitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction over the in connection with any controversy.in this case,the correspondent account at issue is alleged to have been used as an instrument to achieve the very wrong alleged.we conclude that in connection with this particular jurisdictional controversy a lawsuit seeking redress for the allegedly unlawful provision of banking services of which the wire transfers are a part allegations of lcb repeated,intentional execution of wire transfers on behalf of shahid,in order to further hizballah terrorist goals,are sufficient.it should hardly be unforseeable to a bank that selects and makes use of a particular forum banking system that it might be subject to the burden of a lawsuit in that forum for wrongs related to,and arising from,that use 
lcb argues that the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case can not be squared with our decisions in the multidistrict litigation stemming from the september,terrorist attacks.in in re terrorist attacks on september,cir,abrogated on other grounds,samantar yousuf,the plaintiffs,who suffered personal injuries and financial losses as a result of the attacks,filed suit against hundreds of parties,including four saudi princes who allegedly gave money to muslim charities with the knowledge that such charities would transfer the funds to the terrorist organization al qaeda.id.at.we decided that minimum contacts with the united states would exist if the plaintiffs show ed that the four princes engaged in intentional,and allegedly tortious,actions expressly aimed at residents of the united states.id.at quoting calder jones,ellipsis in original.but we could find no basis for the constitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction over the saudi princes,explaining 
the plaintiffs burden is not satisfied by the allegation that the four princes intended to fund al qaeda through their donations to muslim charities it may be the case that acts of violence committed against residents of the united states were a foreseeable consequence of the princes alleged indirect funding of al qaeda,but foreseeability is not the standard for recognizing personal jurisdiction.rather,the plaintiffs must establish that the four princes expressly aimed intentional tortious acts at residents of the united states.providing indirect funding to an organization that was openly hostile to the united states does not constitute this type of intentional conduct.in the absence of such a showing,american courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the four princes.
id.at citation omitted.
similarly,in another case related to the september attacks,we affirmed the dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction over several foreign financial institutions and individuals associated therewith who were alleged to have knowingly maintained bank accounts for individuals associated with al qaeda as well as for purported front charities that aided al qaeda,where those accounts were used for al qaeda operations.in re terrorist attacks on,cir.as with the saudi princes,the court rejected the exercise of personal jurisdiction over those banking defendants because they did not expressly aim their conduct at the united states.id.
but lcb fails to recognize that the in re terrorist attacks cases,as well as calder,the supreme court case on which they rely,speak to the requirements for personal jurisdiction under the effects test.the effects test is a theory of personal jurisdiction typically invoked where unlike the conduct that forms the basis for the controversy occurs entirely,and the only relevant jurisdictional contacts with the forum are therefore effects harmful to the plaintiff.in such circumstances,the exercise of personal jurisdiction may be constitutionally permissible if the defendant expressly aimed its conduct at the forum.see calder,at finding the exercise of personal jurisdiction over florida defendants in california state court based on the effects of their florida conduct in california to be consistent with due process because their intentional,and allegedly tortious,actions were expressly aimed at california.
we do not,however,understand the existence of effects sufficient to satisfy the effects test to be a prerequisite to the constitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant in cases where the conduct on which the alleged personal jurisdiction is based occurs within the forum.so long as this activity sufficiently reflects the defendant purposeful availment of the privilege of carrying on its activities here,minimum contacts are established,even if the effects of the defendant entire course of conduct are felt elsewhere.see chloé,at because we have concluded that the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the benefits of the new york forum,we need not decide whether his act represented conduct expressly aimed at new york under the calder effects test.best van lines,at although calder and keeton were handed down simultaneously on similar subjects,they relied on independent,if conceptually overlapping,methods of demonstrating minimum contacts keeton on the defendant overall activity within the forum state calder on the effects of activity.
as we have explained,lcb repeated use of the correspondent account and hence new york banking system as an instrument to achieve the wrong complained of in this suit satisfies the minimum contacts component of the due process inquiry.
reasonableness.where a defendant has purposefully directed its activities at the forum state,it may still defeat jurisdiction on due process grounds.to do so,however,it must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.burger king,at see also metro life ins,at instructing that dismissals resulting from the application of the reasonableness test should be few and far between.in conducting this part of the due process inquiry,we focus on the factors we identified in part of this discussion,above.
we recognize,of course,that lcb is based in lebanon and that all of the plaintiffs,including those who are american citizens,res
