background 
the broad channel labor day parade 
plaintiff steiner hosted a barbecue at his home in broad channel for several score of his friends,including plaintiffs locurto and walters on september,a sunday afternoon.there the possibility of creating a float for the town annual labor day parade to be held the next day was discussed.the same group had previously sponsored floats titled the gooks of hazzard that parodied asian americans and the television show the dukes of hazzard hasidic park that parodied jewish americans and the movie jurassic park dysfunctional family feud that poked fun at two local groups and spoofed a television game show and jamaica bay watch that addressed local water pollution concerns.
two possible themes for the float were considered.one was a gottizilla theme parodying italian americans.the other was a black to the channel theme purportedly parodying african americans while referring to the future effects of racial integration on the predominantly caucasian community of broad channel.when they parted sunday night,plaintiffs thought the float would be the proposed gottizilla theme,but when locurto and walters arrived at steiner house early monday afternoon,the group had shifted to the black to the future theme,allegedly because there was insufficient time to complete the gottizilla float.
the broad channel labor day parade began at.the black to the future float was the last one and so did not leave the starting point until.because of the advent of a heavy rainstorm at,the parade was canceled,so that the black to the future float never reached the viewing stand at the parade end where local politicians judged the floats.during the half hour that the float was in the parade,locurto,walter,steiner and several friends rode it costumed in blackface.some participants chanted slogans such as crackers,we moving in,and no justice,no peace.included as props were kentucky fried chicken buckets,and a number of participants ate watermelon and threw the rinds to the audience.at one point,walters grabbed the back of the truck carrying the float and let himself dangle towards the ground,in parody of the dragging murder of james byrd,in jasper,texas a few months earlier.
locurto,walters,and steiner were at the time public employees of the city of new york.locurto had served as a police officer since february,on assignment in a racially mixed precinct in queens,without involvement in any violent or racial incidents.in addition to making over arrests during his four years as an officer,locurto had received an award for apprehending a fleeing felon.steiner had joined the city fire department as a firefighter in february,had served for a time in the south bronx,and similarly had never been involved in any racial incidents.walters had served with the fire department for eight years,the last three of which were spent without incident in a racially mixed neighborhood in brooklyn after walters voluntary transfer.
all three of these men participated in the parade solely as citizens of the broad channel community,without wearing uniforms or other insignia that might identify them with their respective departments.yet,as lifelong residents of broad channel,the possibility existed that they were individually recognizable to the crowd that gathered to watch the parade.
the public controversy 
the day following the parade,tuesday,september,a television news station aired a videotape of the parade featuring the black to the future float.much public controversy ensued.when informed that city personnel had participated in the float,new york city mayor rudolph giuliani was quoted as responding,i spoken to police and fire commissioners safir and von essen,and we all agree that any police officer,firefighter or other city employee involved in this disgusting display of racism should be removed from positions of responsibility immediately.they will be fired.david chen,officers and firemen wore blackface on float,officials say,times,at.at the same time,locurto became aware that the police department was interested in talking to him about his involvement in the parade.when he came forward on friday,september before being asked any questions about what he had was suspended from his job without pay.steiner and walters also met with the fire department to admit their participation,and they too were suspended.
on saturday morning,september,locurto held a press conference in which he apologized for his conduct.mayor giuliani publicly commented in response,i not going to take the responsibility of keeping him on the police force and then three years from now he hurts somebody and somebody wants to know why he was removed.the only way this guy gets back on the police force is if the supreme court of the united states tells us to put him back.kit roane,suspended officer apologizes,calling float a big mistake,times,at.that same day,the reverend al sharpton led a march of over demonstrators through the broad channel community,explaining that during the parade people were laughing and clapping,and his supporters wanted to let them know it not funny to us.david herszenhorn,march gets warm reception,times,at.
the disciplinary proceedings police officer locurto 
a week after the parade,on september,the new york city police department charged locurto with two violations of patrol guide,page,paragraphs a and.the first alleged he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the good order,efficiency and discipline of the department,to wit said officer did participate in and appear on a labor day parade float which depicted in a demeaning and offensive manner.the second alleged locurto did knowingly associate with person s or organization s advocating hatred,or oppression of,or prejudice toward a racial or religious group.
an administrative hearing on the charges was held on october,before the city police department deputy commissioner for trials.the police department presented as witnesses detective james trudden,chief of the broad channel volunteer fire department,who testified to locurto participation in the parade,and director of training james,who testified to the police department efforts to foster racial sensitivity among recruits and officers.in his defense,locurto asserted that he was being disciplined only in retaliation for the content of his speech on a matter of public concern,in violation of his first amendment rights.the hearing officer in her written decision rejected locurto first amendment defense,recommended that he be found guilty of the first charge,but that the second charge be dismissed,and recommended further that locurto be punished by dismissal from the police force.
defendant commissioner safir had discretion to accept,reject,or modify the hearing officer proposed findings,conclusions,and disposition of the charges,consistent with the record of the hearing.see rules of the city of new york.five days after the hearing commissioner safir adopted all of the hearing officer recommendations,and officer locurto was discharged from the police department.
firefighters steiner and walters 
meanwhile,the fire department charged steiner and walters on september with conduct instrumental in arousing racial hatred,conduct reflecting discredit upon the fire department,and conduct in violation of the oath of office,all in violation of of the regulations for the uniformed force.these charges were set down for an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge alj from the city office for administrative trials and hearings.
at the hearing,the fire department introduced testimony from trudden that the volunteer fire department had,subsequent to the parade,received numerous threatening phone calls,necessitating the installation of a trace on incoming calls.trudden also testified regarding an incident in which rocks were thrown at an ambulance operated by the broad channel volunteer fire department,which had organized the labor day parade.in response,steiner and walters raised the defense that they,like locurto,were being disciplined only in retaliation for the content of their speech.they introduced testimony that fire commissioner thomas von essen had concluded that his hands were tied by mayor giuliani decision to fire any public employees participating in the float.
in a written decision dated october the alj rejected plaintiffs first amendment defense and recommended that while the first charge should be dismissed,steiner and walters should be found guilty of the second and third charges,and be punished by dismissal from the fire department.as with the police department,the fire commissioner has discretion to accept or reject an alj disciplinary recommendations.see rules of the city of new york.ten days after receiving the decision commissioner von essen adopted all of the alj recommendations.he concurred with the alj findings that steiner and walters had not testified credibly or truthfully about their actions,that their actions were likely to erode public trust in the fire department,and that the egregiousness of their conduct,particularly walters mocking of the murder of james byrd,merited the most severe penalty.steiner and walters were discharged from the fire department.
the federal litigation 
in september the plaintiffs each filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york asserting a first amendment retaliation claim as well as a due process claim under.these cases were referred to judge john sprizzo and consolidated for pretrial purposes before him.subsequently,the complaints were amended to add pendent state law claims pursuant to article of new york civil practice law and rules and articles and of new york civil service law.
prior to any discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.plaintiffs argued that the decision to terminate them was unjustified under pickering board of education,d,given the lack of evidence that their speech disrupted the efficient functioning of the police and fire departments and further,that this dearth of evidence,together with mayor giuliani public comments,which indicated that he had prejudged the case,demonstrated that any purported concern for disruption was merely a pretext meant to conceal defendants actual retaliatory motives.defendants contended in response that plaintiffs federal claims were collaterally estopped by the prior administrative determinations and,even if not,plaintiffs had failed to state valid first amendment and due process claims.defendants further asserted they were entitled to qualified immunity because their actions were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law.
following oral argument on the for summary judgment,judge sprizzo denied both parties motions in a written opinion and order.locurto giuliani,d.first,he cited the existence of factual disputes as to whether plaintiffs had received a full and fair opportunity to litigate at the disciplinary hearings.the district court judge thereby concluded defendants collateral estoppel argument could not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment,and that plaintiffs contrary arguments were premature.id.at.second,judge sprizzo rejected defendants qualified immunity defense,reasoning that given the murky factual record before him,he could not agree that plaintiffs failed to state a claim or that defendants actions were objectively reasonable.id.at.each of the denials of summary judgment was without prejudice to its later renewal.id.
with respect to the due process claim,the trial court added,in a footnote,that since it was established law that a government employer,before taking an adverse employment action,was required to give an employee a hearing that comported with due process,it could not plaintiffs the benefit of every reasonable inference respecting the irregularities surrounding the hearings that culminated in plaintiffs defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.id.at.in denying the for summary judgment,the court did so without prejudice,and ordered the parties to proceed with discovery.id.at.
defendants giuliani,safir,and von essen then brought an interlocutory appeal of the district court order insofar as it denied their defense of qualified immunity.on november,a motions panel of this court granted defendants motion to stay discovery pending appeal,but referred plaintiffs motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction to the present merits panel.in the discussion that follows,our first task therefore is to determine whether defendants appeal is taken from a final order giving us appellate jurisdiction.upon concluding that we have no jurisdiction over the appeal as it relates to plaintiffs first amendment claims,our second task is to decide whether the district court properly denied defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to the alleged due process violations of plaintiffs rights at their termination hearings.
discussion 
i appellate jurisdictiona.denial of qualified immunity as final decision 
before reaching the merits,we must settle the question of whether we have jurisdiction over the appeal,especially given the fact that judge sprizzo denials of summary judgment were without prejudice.ordinarily,an appeal lies only from a final judgment of a district court,since federal law limits appellate jurisdiction to review of final decisions of that court.under the collateral order doctrine,the supreme court has ruled that the term final decisions also encompasses that small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen beneficial indus.loan.from that holding,it is clear that an interlocutory order is immediately appealable if it conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separable from the merits of the action,and would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d.
a denial by a district court of a claim of qualified the extent that it turns on an issue of a collateral order subject to immediate appeal.mitchell forsyth,d.under the qualified immunity doctrine,government officials performing discretionary functions,generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.hence,the doctrine strikes a balance between the need,on one hand,to hold responsible public officials exercising their power in a wholly unjustified manner and,on the other hand,to shield officials responsibly attempting to perform their public duties in good faith from having to explain their actions to the satisfaction of a jury.kaminsky rosenblum,cir citing gregoire biddle,cir,ch.
to the extent the denial of the defense rests on a legal determination of the state of the law at the time of the official actions,a denial of immunity is conceptually separable from the merits of the plaintiff claim that his rights have been violated.mitchell,at.because qualified immunity is a shield not only from liability,but also from the burdens of discovery and trial,a denial of immunity is effectively unreviewable if appeal is delayed until after a final judgment has been entered.id.at.such a denial also satisfies the requirement of finality,since the district court legal determination is conclusive with respect to the official entitlement to avoid the burdens of discovery and trial.id.at.accordingly,a denial of qualified immunity,to the extent it turns on a question of law,satisfies the test of the collateral order doctrine set forth in coopers lybrand,and is immediately appealable.id.at.
applying this test,we have permitted an interlocutory appeal from an order denying qualified immunity where the facts as alleged by plaintiff are assumed to be true,and the only question for appellate review is the legal determination whether the defendant official conduct violated a clearly established constitutional right,pataki,cir.equally clear is that a defendant may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial,since such an order is not truly separable from the merits of the action.johnson jones,d accord rodriguez phillips,cir.thus,we have dismissed appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction where the only point challenged by the defendant was the district court conclusion that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether the defendant actually committed the acts alleged by the plaintiff.martinez simonetti,cir tolbert queens,cir.but mccullough wyandanch union free sch,cir reviewing total absence of evidence as matter of law collecting cases.
behrens pelletier 
in behrens pelletier,d,the supreme court held that the collateral order doctrine permits successive interlocutory appeals of a district court rulings denying qualified immunity.in behrens,the district court had denied without prejudice the defendant initial motion for dismissal or,in the alternative,for summary judgment,on the ground that summary judgment on qualified immunity was premature given the lack of discovery.id.at.when the defendant renewed the motion following discovery,the district court again denied the motion,this time holding that material issues of fact precluded summary judgment.id.at.the ninth circuit entertained the defendant interlocutory appeal from the first ruling,but when defendant sought immediate appeal of the second ruling,the ninth circuit dismissed the appeal in light of its precedent permitting only one interlocutory appeal.id.at.
the supreme court reversed the decision to dismiss the second appeal.id.at.it said that qualified immunity gives government officials the right not only to avoid trial,but also to avoid burdens like discovery that can be disruptive of government effectiveness w hether or not a later summary judgment motion is granted,denial of a motion to dismiss is conclusive as to this right.id.at.as a result,the ninth circuit rule improperly forced government officials to choose between the right to avoid discovery and the right to avoid trial,when the qualified immunity doctrine set forth in harlow and mitchell encompassed both rights,thereby supporting a separate appeal to protect each right.see id.at.behrens further noted that such successive appeals typically will not be redundant,since motions for dismissal and for summary judgment follow different legal standards,and that the potential for abusive delays of proceedings was minimal.id.at.the court concluded,an order denying qualified immunity,to the extent it turns on an issue of law,is immediately appealable.id.at.quoting mitchell,at.
we think behrens casts considerable doubt on the continued viability of our decision in whalen county of fulton,cir.in that case we dismissed an intermediate appeal in light of the district court denial of the qualified immunity motion with the use of the phrase without prejudice,believing that such denial did not conclusively determine the issue of immunity and therefore did not impinge on the right to avoid the trial itself.id.at.behrens now teaches us that such appeals should be permitted because denials of immunity are conclusive with regard to a defendant right to avoid discovery,so long as the validity of the denial of the qualified immunity defense can be decided as a matter of law in light of the record on appeal.at.
similar circuit decisions 
this conclusion is reinforced by our recent decision in,pataki.in,the district court denied in part an initial motion to dismiss the plaintiff civil rights complaint on qualified immunity grounds,holding that in light of the lack of discovery the motion was premature and could be better decided on a motion for summary judgment,pataki.we declined to dismiss the appeal from that ruling for lack of jurisdiction,giving reasons equally applicable to the instant appeal 
where the district court bases its refusal to grant a motion on the premise that the court is unable to,or prefers not to,determine the motion without discovery into the alleged facts,that refusal constitutes at least an implicit decision that the complaint alleges a constitutional claim on which relief can be granted.that purely legal decision does not turn on whether the plaintiff can in fact elicit any evidence to support his allegations it thus possesses the requisite finality for immediate appealability under the collateral order doctrine.
from this it follows that even when a district court rejects a qualified immunity defense due to a perceived need for further discovery,an appellate court may exercise jurisdiction to review an interlocutory appeal that questions the plaintiff version of the actions violated the plaintiff clearly established constitutional rights as a matter of law.see id.at.
several other circuits have similarly held.mcvey stacy,cir relying on behrens brown nix,cir see also behrens,at.even where district court denies summary judgment because of material issues of fact,appellate court may still review purely legal question whether,on plaintiff version of facts,qualified immunity standard has been met as matter of law velasquez senko,cir appeal dismissed not because district court denied qualified immunity without prejudice but because only point raised by defendants turned on fact issue united states yonkers bd.of,cir denial of eleventh amendment immunity not immediately appealable because of need for factual development,but court noted that complaint stated allegations that,if proven,would overcome immunity bar as matter of law musso hourigan,cir denial of qualified immunity immediately appealable as to legal questions where district court failed to rule on the defense even though defendant motion had raised it.
at first blush our conclusion that there is finality for jurisdictional purposes might appear to contradict other circuit decisions that have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction where the trial court wanted further discovery before ruling on qualified immunity.see james moore et,moore federal practice b ii,at ed collecting cases charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.supp collecting cases.closer inspection reveals this not to be true,as these cases not only predated behrens,but also are consistent with behrens treatment of unresolved fact questions.see schrob catterson,cir denial of substitution motion that vitiated immunity implicitly rested on unresolved factual issues maxey ex rel.maxey fulton,cir by choosing not to appeal denial of initial dispositive motion,defendant waived ability to object to discovery that was ordered following denial,without prejudice,of later summary judgment motion lawson abrams,cir no interlocutory jurisdiction where discovery needed to determine whether absolute or qualified immunity applied based on defendants conduct boulos wilson,cir qualified immunity ruling turned on factual issue whether defendant had coerced plaintiff consent to warrantless search.
as a consequence,we hold that where a district court denies an initial dispositive motion on qualified immunity grounds prior to discovery,the appealability of that ruling depends not on whether the motion was denied without prejudice to its renewal following discovery,but rather on whether the ruling turns on a question of law.
first amendment retaliation claim 
defendants appeal the denial of qualified immunity on plaintiffs first amendment retaliation claim on the ground that their actions were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established first amendment law as of september.as noted,the district court disagreed with the argument that defendants actions were objectively reasonable given the murky factual record before it.locurto,d at.plaintiffs maintain we lack jurisdiction to resolve defendants argument on appeal,since the district court ruling turned on an issue of fact,and not on a question of law.to decipher what the district court meant by its cryptic ruling,and thus to determine whether the ruling turns on a question of law,we find it helpful first to examine the general contours of first amendment retaliation law.
first amendment retaliation law 
for over years the supreme court has consistently held that while the government enjoys significantly greater latitude when it acts in its capacity as employer than when it acts as sovereign,the first amendment nonetheless prohibits it from punishing its employees in retaliation for the content of their protected speech.see,waters churchill,d rankin mcpherson,d connick myers,d pickering bd.of,d.to make out a claim of illegal retaliation,a plaintiff must establish that what he said or did constituted speech on a matter of public concern,and that his speech was a motivating factor in the adverse action taken by the employer.heil santoro,cir.for purposes of the present appeal,defendants do not strenuously dispute,as they did before the trial court,that plaintiffs participation in the broad channel labor day parade constituted first amendment speech on a matter of public concern.
if a plaintiff makes such a showing,the government may nonetheless escape liability on either of two separate rationales plaintiff speech would disrupt the government activities and such disruption is sufficient to outweigh the first amendment value of plaintiff speech,waters,at.or the government demonstrates it would have taken the same adverse action in the absence of the protected speech,heil,at.defendants do not invoke the element of causation as a basis for granting summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.rather,they premise their appeal solely on the argument that the district court erred in failing to recognize that defendants could have objectively reasonably concluded,given the state of the law at the time,that the potential disruption to the police and fire departments outweighed the first amendment value of plaintiffs speech.
this balancing of interests,commonly known as the pickering balancing test,presents a question of law for the court to resolve.lewis cowen,cir see also coady steil,cir reviewing pickering balance on interlocutory appeal of qualified immunity denial.under the pickering test,a government employer may fire an employee for speaking on a matter of public concern if the employer prediction of disruption is reasonable the potential disruptiveness is enough to outweigh the value of the speech and the employer took action against the employee based on this disruption and not in retaliation for the speech.jeffries harleston,cir.as this last element suggests,even if the pickering balance is resolved in the employer favor,the employee may still demonstrate liability by proving that the employer disciplined the employee in retaliation for the speech,rather than out of fear of the disruption.lewis,at accord britton,d noting retaliation for the exercise of free speech as an example of a claim for which an official motive is a necessary element citing pickering,at.sheppard beerman,cir.
consequently,although the pickering test presents a question of law,resolution of a first amendment retaliation claim on a motion for summary judgment may not be possible if the plaintiff introduces sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on the question of defendant improper intent,which is a question of fact.see sheppard,at plaintiff may avoid summary judgment on first amendment retaliation claim based on qualified immunity defense if he can show particularized evidence of direct or circumstantial facts supporting his claim of unconstitutional motive accord,cir kimberlin quinlan,hoard sizemore,cir see also,at.distinguishing between the plaintiff showing of improper intent a pure issue of fact,and the separate qualified immunity question which is an essentially legal question.
the district court opinion 
we read the district court opinion to reflect its belief that this is a case in which a fact issue as to retaliatory motive precludes an award of summary judgment.had the district court attempted to resolve the pickering balance as a matter of law,presumably it would have taken all of the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and would have proceeded to conduct a careful balancing of the respective interests at stake.see lewis,at discussing pickering balancing inquiry.such analysis is not reflected in the trial court opinion.instead,it discussed the evidence that indicated defendants had prejudged plaintiffs disciplinary charges,see locurto,d at,and found it impossible to conclude that defendants actions were objectively reasonable,given the murky factual record before the court,id.at.
we infer from this reasoning that the trial court found it unnecessary to analyze this case under the pickering balancing test,since even if that balance were resolved in defendants favor,the live factual issue as to subjective retaliatory intent would still preclude a grant of summary judgment for defendants.behrens,at.a court of appeals may have to undertake a cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed.quoting johnson,at.
for our part,therefore,to review the district court first amendment ruling would ultimately require us to review its determination that sufficient evidence existed to create a genuine issue of fact on the question of subjective motivation.as just discussed,we lack jurisdiction to undertake such review on an interlocutory appeal.see tellier fields,wl,at,cir.april,what we may not do,after johnson and behrens,is entertain an interlocutory appeal in which a defendant contends that the district court committed an error of law in ruling that the plaintiff evidence was sufficient to create a jury issue on the facts relevant to the defendant immunity defense.quoting salim proulx,cir catone spielmann,cir dismissing for lack of appellate jurisdiction based on factual issues,even where the district court did not expressly state that it was relying on a disputed issue of material fact.
existence of factual issues as to intent 
defendants respond by citing a number of cases for the proposition that a district court mere assertion that disputed factual issues exist is not enough to preclude an immediate appeal.rohman new york city trans,cir quoting salim,at alteration in original.but these statements hail from decisions in which the defendant appeal was otherwise amenable to resolution as a matter of law,independent of any factual issues identified by the district court.
in rohman,for example,we reviewed a malicious prosecution claim,notwithstanding the element of malice,since even on the plaintiff version of the facts the claim was resolvable on another element as a matter of law,namely,whether the defendant had initiated a prosecution.id.at.and,in salim we exercised jurisdiction solely to determine whether,on the plaintiff version of the facts,the defendant use of force to effect a fourth amendment seizure was objectively reasonable as a matter of law.at accord tierney davidson,cir even where the lower court rules that material disputes of fact preclude summary judgment on qualified immunity,we may still exercise interlocutory jurisdiction if the defendant contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity even under plaintiff version of the facts.
by contrast,the present appeal is not resolvable in an analogous fashion.in the first place,defendants have not conceded plaintiffs version of the facts for purposes of their summary judgment motion.further,defendants invoke no elements of plaintiffs first amendment claim that could resolve that claim as a matter of law,independent of the element of intent.the supreme court has suggested that a first amendment retaliation claim may prove susceptible to summary judgment in appropriate cases based on the absence of elements from a plaintiff threshold showing,such as whether the speech was on a matter of public concern as well as the element of causation,at.see also,at notwithstanding allegation of motive,plaintiffs first amendment retaliation claim should have been dismissed as a matter of law because defendant legislators free speech rights precluded recovery.
but,as noted,defendants do not contest either of those elements on this appeal.the only issue they challenge is whether their actions,in assessing the disruption that would result from plaintiffs speech,were objectively reasonable under pickering.nevertheless,that balancing test is incapable of disposing of plaintiffs first amendment claim in light of the factual issue as to intent.see,at dismissing qualified immunity appeal where defendant argued his actions were objectively reasonable but appeal turned on factual issue of motivation with respect to plaintiff first amendment retaliation claim hoard,at same with respect to plaintiff first amendment claim of discharge based on political affiliation see also.crim.def.lawyers ass forst in re state police litig,cir dismissing qualified immunity appeal where defendants legal arguments ultimately turned on resolution of factual contention.
subjective intent and qualified immunity 
defendants further urge upon us that subjective intent is per se irrelevant to the inquiry into objective reasonableness.but this argument betrays a fundamental misconception of the application of the qualified immunity doctrine to constitutional claims for which intent is an element.in the usual case where intent is not an element,bare allegations of malice coupled with otherwise legitimate government action do not yield a viable constitutional claim.in such a case,the qualified immunity doctrine focuses only on whether the government official actions were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law,without regard for possible subjective malice.see,at.but where a more specific intent is actually an element of the plaintiff claim as defined by clearly established law,it can never be objectively reasonable for a government official to act with the intent that is prohibited by law.see id.at.thus,although evidence of improper motive is irrelevant on the issue of qualified immunity,it may be an essential component of the plaintiff affirmative case.sheppard,at t he employer actual subjective motive is not irrelevant in a qualified immunity inquiry on a first amendment retaliation claim.
our own precedents have emphasized this distinction between generalized malice and particularized unlawful intent.for example,in sound aircraft services,town of east hampton,cir,where the plaintiff alleged that the town board had snubbed his bid for a municipal lease and instead awarded the lease to a competitor,we vacated a denial of qualified immunity based on the district court perception of a factual issue as to the defendants motivation.we reasoned that generalized malice of the sort identified by the district court is irrelevant to the qualified immunity inquiry into objective reasonableness,and we criticized the district court for not first pausing to frame the plaintiff claim to determine whether intent was even an element of the claim.id.at.in instructing the district court on remand,we noted that specific illegal intent might well be an element of a properly framed equal protection claim,but that the complaint as it then stood was too vague to state such a claim.id.at.
to accept defendants proposed approach in this case would effectively immunize all defendants in cases involving constitutional torts,so long as they could point to objective evidence showing that a reasonable official could have acted on legitimate grounds.hoard,at.moreover,this is precisely the approach rejected by the supreme court in when it declined to adopt a heightened evidentiary standard for constitutional torts.see at.rejecting justice scalia unprecedented proposal to immunize all officials whose conduct is objectively valid,regardless of improper intent quoting id.at.scalia,dissenting see also hoard,at discussing and rejecting defendant attempt to transform a factual question about his motivation into a legal question about the objective reasonableness of the discharges challenged by plaintiffs first amendment claim.rather,emphasized that the federal rules of civil procedure require only that the plaintiff put forward specific,nonconclusory factual allegations that establish improper motive causing cognizable injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for dismissal or summary judgment.at.quoting siegert gilley,d kennedy,concurring in judgment.
the standard is entirely consistent with prior precedents from this circuit that have held a plaintiff need only show particularized evidence of direct or circumstantial facts supporting his claim of unconstitutional motive in order to survive a motion for summary judgment on the defense of qualified immunity.sheppard,at accord blue koren,cir see also,at.rehnquist,dissenting under the court view,only a factfinder ultimate determination of the motive with which defendant acted will resolve this case.indeed,our subsequent case law has continued to adhere to this standard as implicitly consistent with.see,ford moore,cir accord,at hoard,at.but see stanley city of dalton,nn.cir w here the facts show mixed motives lawful and unlawful motivations and law does not dictate that the merits of the case must be decided in plaintiff favor,the defendant is entitled to immunity.
in sum,defendants proposed per se rule flies in the face of supreme court precedent as well as our own,and therefore we can not adopt it.unlawful intent,a necessary element of plaintiffs properly framed first amendment retaliation claim,is an issue on which the district court found a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat defendants motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.because plaintiffs claim turns on an issue of fact rather than on a question of law,that portion of the present interlocutory appeal pertaining to the first amendment claim must therefore be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
jurisdiction over due process claim 
plaintiffs do not challenge our jurisdiction to review the district court ruling on their due process claim.nonetheless,we are independently obligated to examine our subject matter jurisdiction,regardless of whether the parties invite us to do so.concourse rehab.nursing ctr.debuono,cir.
on this portion of the appeal,the only issue raised by defendants is whether plaintiffs allegation of due process violations at their administrative hearings is foreclosed by the existence of an adequate remedy in the form of an article proceeding under new york law.see wilson layne,d a court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all.quoting conn gabbert,d accord saucier katz,d this must be the initial inquiry.whether a remedy is adequate presents a question of law.gudema nassau county,cir.thus,under the principles art
