the district court held that morphed child pornography which uses the faces of known minors and the bodies of adult females is not protected expressive speech under the first amendment and therefore hotaling indictment under c was constitutional.hotaling,d at.we agree.

hotaling asserts that the morphed child pornography he created using the faces of actual minors and the bodies of adult females is protected speech under the first amendment and therefore his conviction under c is unconstitutional as applied to him.he contends that the interests of actual children were not implicated because they were not engaged in sexual activity during the creation of the photographs.hotaling wishes us to differentiate the child pornography he created from the pornography addressed in united states bach,cir,an eighth circuit case,which held that morphed images utilizing the bodies and faces of actual minors were not protected expressive speech in bach,the defendant morphed the face of a known minor onto a lasciviously posed body of another minor.bach,at.hotaling proposed differentiation,however,is misp
