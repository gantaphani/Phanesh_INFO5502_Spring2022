we are invited in this case to change our circuit law on the type of intent needed by a defendant to communicate true threats under c.we note there is a circuit split on the question of intent in the aftermath of virginia black.the issue was not raised before the trial court,and on plain error review we see no reason to depart from this circuit law that an objective test of defendant intent is used from the defendant vantage point under c.united states whiffen,cir.
on may,a jury convicted jeffrey clemens of two counts of sending threats to injure another across state lines in violation of c.he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment.the threats were in two emails,one sent to stephen pfaff,the opposing counsel and defendant in a lawsuit that clemens had filed,and the other to patricia vinchesi,the town administrator of scituate,massachusetts,which was also a defendant in that suit.
clemens appeals from his conviction,primarily arguing that the district court gave incorrect jury instructions on the meaning of the term threat.he also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that the district court had erred in denying his motion to dismiss his indictment.pertinent to most of clemens claims of error is his argument,made for the first time on appeal,that the supreme court decision in black required the jury to find that he subjectively meant to threaten pfaff and vinchesi and that it was insufficient to measure his intent by reference to an objectively reasonable person.
we draw the facts primarily from the parties pleadings and the trial record.because clemens challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,we describe the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see united states soto,cir.
on may,clemens was arrested in scituate,massachusetts,and that set off the chain of events which eventually resulted in the federal indictment in this case.that day,the scituate police department had received a call from a town resident that clemens was trespassing on the grounds of her home.the police arrested clemens for trespassing,after he had already left the private residence,and charged him with disorderly conduct and impersonating a private investigator,inter alia.see clemens town of scituate,rgs,wl,at.may.a jury convicted clemens of the disorderly conduct count,for which he served six months in state prison,although that conviction was later overturned.the reason is not in the record.he also had admitted that there were sufficient facts to prove his guilt for impersonating an investigator,for which he received a six month suspended sentence.
in may,clemens filed a lawsuit,pro se,in federal court against the town of scituate town,two local police officers,the town resident who had accused him of trespassing and that resident husband,asserting that the arrest had been without probable cause,in violation of the fourth amendment,and pendent common law tort claims.see id.at.pfaff was the attorney who represented the town and the police officers in this case.on january,pfaff filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that clemens had no legal basis for his claims.the district court granted summary judgment as to all federal claims on may,declining to exercise jurisdiction over the pendent state law claims.see id.at.
again proceeding pro se,on october,clemens filed another lawsuit in federal court against the town,the scituate police officers,and additional defendants,including pfaff this time clemens sought damages for malicious prosecution and willful negligence.the case was assigned to a different federal district court judge.
pfaff again represented the town,some individual defendants,and himself in this second lawsuit.on march,pfaff moved to dismiss the lawsuit as to himself.in response,clemens sent pfaff the following email three days later,on march,at

jeffrey clemens 
emphasis added.
clemens also sent this email as an attachment to patricia vinchesi,the scituate town administrator,at on march,with the message sic vinchesi you all might be digging yourself a grave.jeffrey.vinchesi was not a defendant in either of clemens lawsuits.
pfaff read clemens email the following morning on march.he testified in this case that he had read the email as a personal physical threat.as a result,he sent his wife a photograph of clemens,which he had in his case file,because he was worried that clemens would show up at the child care center where she worked.pfaff sent this same photograph to the chief of police in the town where he lived because he was concerned for his physical safety and asked for extra patrol cars to come by his house.
that same day,pfaff forwarded the email to an fbi agent whom he knew.he also sent clemens email to the courtroom clerk assigned to the civil lawsuit 
like pfaff,vinchesi also opened the email from clemens on march.she testified that she got very scared considering that she was the only person to receive an attachment with clemens email to pfaff,and the message addressed to her was you all might be digging yourself a grave.she forwarded the email to scituate chief of police and also met with him in person.the chief gave her a photograph of clemens.vinchesi said it was very important to know what clemens looked like,in case he should show up in her office in the scituate town hall,which was open to the public and had no security measures.
fbi agent thomas greenwalt testified that he had arrested clemens on march in huron,ohio,where he then lived with his parents.after being advised of his rights,clemens admitted that he had sent the emails to pfaff and vinchesi while he was in huron.greenwalt testified that clemens had characterized the emails as strongly worded and rhetoric.clemens also said to greenwalt that he did not use his best judgment in sending them although he asserted that f eeling like doing something is not the same as actually doing it.
on april,a grand jury charged clemens with two counts of interstate transmission of threat to injure in violation of c,based on the emails that he had sent to pfaff and vinchesi.section c punishes w hoever transmits in interstate commerce any communication containing any threat to injure another person.
clemens moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing in part that the emails are,as a matter of law,protected speech under the first amendment and do not contain true threats,which are outside the scope of first amendment protection.
on april,the district court denied clemens motion,noting that whether a statement is a threat under c is usually an issue of fact for the jury.it applied this circuit objective test under which a statement is a threat if the sender should have reasonably foreseen that the recipient would interpret it as such.
while acknowledging clemens point that some of the statements in the email express hopes or wishes,such as clemens wish that a ton fall on pfaff,the court observed that these wishes are hardly of a benign nature and are accompanied by statements that reference clemens intent to actually do something to pfaff.given the context of clemens communications highly contentious litigation the court concluded that a reasonable jury could find that clemens statements constituted a threat.
during a trial in may,pfaff,vinchesi,and fbi agent greenwalt testified on behalf of the government and clemens emails to pfaff and vinchesi were submitted as evidence.the defense did not call any witnesses,and clemens chose not to testify.
at trial,clemens had admitted that the emails were sent in interstate commerce,traveling from ohio to massachusetts,where pfaff and vinchesi received them and he intended to send the emails.so,the only issue left for the jury under c was whether the emails contained a threat to injure someone.
in closing,the defense argued that it is not reasonable to construe these emails as literal threats,characterizing clemens as an aggrieved person who was just blowing off steam because he felt he had been treated unfairly in the state criminal justice system and was frustrated with the progress of his related civil suits.the defense also focused on the language of the emails,saying that clemens cartoonish and statements were not meant to be taken literally.
clemens proposed several jury instructions to the district court,including one on the meaning of a threat.
the district court instructed the jury that it had to determine whether the emails sent to pfaff and vinchesi contained a threat to injure,explaining that the general definition of a threat,is a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another.the court also instructed the jury to use an objective test for identifying a threat under c,saying in part 
w e are looking for a societal judgment about whether or not a person sending such a communication would understand that it was a threat and that a person receiving such a communication would understand that they have been threatened.you become the embodiment of society here in making this kind of judgment about deciding according to our ordinary notions of behavior and responsibility among ordinary people in our society at this time,not somebody who is overanxious or,not somebody who is oblivious to communications.but the ordinary person who receives this or sends it,what would they believe this to be,a threat or not 
clemens objected to the jury instructions,arguing that the court should have used his proposed instructions on threats because they add an additional protection of describing threats as true,and because they say that the threat of injury must be imminent.
clemens did not object to the court refusal to instruct the jury on ambiguous statements or its application of an objective,as opposed to subjective,standard to the issue of intent.he raises both of these arguments for the first time on appeal.nor did clemens ever challenge the sufficiency of the evidence at trial.
after the court had already given its instructions it declined to add clemens definition of a threat,saying that it add s dimensions to the case that are nowhere to be found in the first circuit law.
after deliberating for just under two hours,on may,the jury found clemens guilty of both counts of sending threats to injure in interstate commerce.clemens timely appealed.
jury instructions 
clemens only preserved challenge to the jury instructions is that the court did not use his language on a true threat.he suggests that the court instructions did not distinguish between language that is protected by the first amendment and true threats.clemens own proposed instructions,it is worth pointing out,utilized an objective test,referring to an intention to assault someone in such a way as could reasonably induce fear.emphasis added.
we review preserved claims of legal error in jury instructions de novo.see united states sasso,cir.a district court refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes error only if the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case.united states symonevich,cir.an error mandates reversal only when it is prejudicial based on a review of the entire record.id.
the district court did not err in not adopting clemens instructions.to start,clemens proposal contains incorrect statements.his instructions ask the jury to consider whether his statements were so unequivocal,unconditional,and specific as to convey to the recipients a gravity of purpose and apparent prospect of execution.we have rejected any requirement that threats be unequivocal,unconditional,and specific.rather,use of ambiguous language does not preclude a statement from being a threat.united states fulmer,cir see id.at,holding that a jury could find the phrase t he silver bullets are coming represented a threat despite evidence of that phrase potential innocuous meaning see also united states turner,cir commenting that the second circuit has affirmed convictions for threats that were both conditional and inexplicit.
there are other errors in clemens instructions,but we need not parse them because the district court jury instructions accomplish that which he requested distinguishing real or true threats from those that are not.see symonevich,at holding that there is no error where the requested instruction is substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered.clemens submitted instructions asked jurors to evaluate statements in their context to distinguish a true threat from idle,careless talk,exaggeration,or something said in a rude,aggressive,or offensive manner.
the district court accomplished the needed distinctions,but in more appropriate language 
now,there have been various adjectives that have been used by the parties in talking about this,incendiary and excitable and bad judgment and not friendly and vehement and bad manners.those may or may not be ways to distinguish a threat under these circumstances,but you are not so much concerned about whether or not it was bad manners or vehement or excitable as to whether or not a reasonable person reading this would say that is a threat,and whether a reasonable person sending it would understand that is a threat 
of course in making that determination you consider all of the circumstances.horseplay between kids using inflated language might,under some circumstances,not be considered a threat.a kind of acting out might not be considered a threat.but what you are focusing on is whether or not in our society at this time the communication of these words in this context would,by a reasonable person,be considered a threat,and that is what is at the core of this case.
as to clemens stated objections at trial,there was no error.
we turn to clemens arguments made for the first time on appeal.first,he argues that the court definition of a threat,drawn from black law dictionary,misstates the law because it failed to include the statutory language of a threat to injure.he mixes apples and oranges.the court had initially instructed the jury 
at the guts of this case,i would suggest to you,and the thing that you are going to have to be concerned with is whether or not the communications contained a threat to injure someone.
now,the law has been i think fairly specific about what a threat means in this setting.the general proposition,general definition of a threat,is a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another.
emphasis added.the district court did not err at all when it explained to the jury that it was providing a general definition of the term threat immediately after it had instructed them of their particular task deciding whether the emails contained a threat to injure.
more significantly,clemens argues that the district court erred when it told the jury to decide if a reasonable person sending clemens emails would understand them to be threats.he argues that the supreme court decision in black mandates a subjective intent test.to be more precise,the question under c is whether the government must prove only that a reasonable person would construe the words as a threat,and need not prove as well that the defendant subjectively meant the words to be a threat.see united states jeffries,cir sutton,dubitante,cert.denied.
because clemens never once raised this issue at trial,although it was clearly available to him,we review only for plain error united states laplante,cir,which clemens can not establish.to do so,clemens must show that there was error the error was plain the error affected his substantial rights and the error adversely impacted the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states caraballo rodriguez,cir quoting united states riggs,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
before black was decided,this court had addressed what test must be used to determine intent under true threat statutes.in fulmer,involving a threat to a federal agent under a b,we framed the question.we noted the circuits agreed that the test was an objective one but that they disagree d regarding the appropriate vantage point what a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen or what a reasonable person receiving the statement would believe.at.we concluded that the appropriate standard under which a defendant may be convicted for making a threat is whether he should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it wa s made.id.
the question of whether the statute involved in this case,c,required the government to prove specific intent that the defendant intended his communications to be received as a threat was addressed a few months later in whiffen.we rejected the argument that c was a specific intent crime,described it as a general intent crime,and adhered to the fulmer articulation.whiffen,at.
although not previously presented with this type of argument based on black,since black was decided in this court has continued to apply its objective defendant vantage point test for determining intent in criminal threat cases.see,united states stefanik,cir united states walker,cir united states nishnianidze,cir.
the core holding of black is actually addressed to a different issue about the constitutionality of a virginia law that banned cross burning with an intent to intimidate,which contained a presumption as to intent.a jury in black had been instructed that the state must prove the defendant had the intent to intimidate any person and that specific intent was not at issue.the supreme court of virginia held the statute unconstitutional on first amendment grounds.the united states supreme court,in a divided opinion concerned only with the statute facial provision,which treat ed any cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate,black,at,remanded in part for further interpretation of that provision,id.at.in its analysis,the court said,true threats encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.id.at emphasis added.it continued,saying i ntimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat,where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.id.at.it is this first means to communicate language on which defendant argument is based.even if the statement were only dicta,we must take supreme court dicta seriously.see.delivery ass coakley,cir.
of the courts of appeals to consider a subjective intent argument derived from this language in black,most have rejected it.see united states martinez,wl cir,united states elonis,cir united states nicklas,cir jeffries,united states white,cir.these courts have reasoned that the black decision had no occasion to distinguish between subjective and objective standards for construing threats because the virginia law at issue required subjective intent and the prima facie evidence provision that the court invalidated had no standard at all for intent,allow ing convictions based solely on the fact of cross burning itself.jeffries,at quoting black,at see also elonis,at refusing to interpret black as invalidat ing the objective intent standard the majority of circuits appl y to true threats because the virginia statute already required a subjective intent to intimidate.
these courts have also addressed the particular language in black on which clemens relies,in which threats are those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence.rather than read the language as setting forth a subjective intent requirement,they have concluded that the sentence only requires the speaker to intend to make the communication,not the threat.elonis,at see martinez,wl,at jeffries,at white,at.
to date,only the ninth circuit has held that this language from black imposes a subjective intent requirement in a criminal threat statute,a,which prohibits certain threats against presidential candidates and their families.see united states bagdasarian,cir.that holding is consistent with the ninth circuit prior case law see id.at observing that black affirmed that circuit dictum requiring subjective intent.in united states parr,cir,the seventh circuit did not decide the issue but suggested that an objective intent standard is no longer tenable after black.
here,we need only conclude that clemens can not show plain error.even if there was any error,that error is not plain or obvious.most circuits have rejected clemens argument and this court has applied an objective defendant vantage point standard.united states diaz,cir holding that defendant can not establish plain error where law is unsettled both within and outside the first circuit.absent further clarification from the supreme court,we see no basis to venture further and no basis to depart from our circuit law.
as to the remaining prongs of plain error,we add that we have little doubt that if a subjective specific intent instruction had been given,the jury would have,on these facts,found such intent.under either an objective or subjective standard,the jury evaluates the particular circumstances of a case to determine intent.see united states goodchild,cir observing,in a criminal fraud case,that direct proof of intent is rare and that the government usually prove s specific intent by circumstantial evidence.it is rare that a jury would find that a reasonable speaker would have intended a threat under the particular facts of a case but that a competent defendant did not.this might occur,for example,if the defendant were mentally handicapped.the choice between an objective and specific intent requirement is likely to have a greater impact in circuits,like the sixth but not like this circuit,which uphold criminal threat convictions based solely on the reaction of the reasonable listener.see jeffries,at.
finally,clemens also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to read his instruction on ambiguous statements.he again can not show plain error where his instructions include errors of law,such as by saying t he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was not ambiguous and that it clearly conveyed a threat to assault.
while he claims his instruction is drawn from fulmer,it instead contradicts fulmer,which said that ambiguous language does not prevent a statement from being a threat.at.so,under c the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a statement is a threat,but need not prove that the statement is unambiguous.
clemens proposed instruction also erroneously requires the government to prove a threat to assault.emphasis added.section c,however,prohibits a threat to injure.the assault language appears to come from a b,which proscribes threats to assault,kidnap,or murder united states officials.the district court did not plainly err in rejecting an instruction riddled with legal error.
denial of motion to dismiss the indictment 
clemens argues that the district court should have dismissed his indictment before trial because no reasonable jury could conclude his emails,as charged,communicated true threats.we review his legal challenge to the indictment de novo.united states guerrier,cir.the argument is misplaced.
it is true that statute s which make criminal a form of pure speech must be interpreted with the commands of the first amendment clearly in mind.watts united states,per curiam.this is not a basis on which to take away from a jury the factual question of whether or not clemens emails conveyed true threats.see united states white,cir per curiam rejecting defendant first amendment argument to dismiss an indictment because potential first amendment concern s are addressed by the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at trial,not by a dismissal at the indictment stage.
whether a statement constitutes a threat is an issue of fact for the trial jury,involving assessments of both credibility and of context.fulmer,at quoting united states malik,cir internal quotation marks omitted see,white,at noting that an indictment need not lay out all of the government evidence that defendant speech was criminal solicitation nishnianidze,at considering circumstances leading up to alleged threatening statements in determining whether a reasonable jury could convict the defendant under a criminal threat statute.
clemens argues his case is different because his statements were nothing more than generalized fantasy,sarcastic,and cartoonish and hyperbolic.not so.in whiffen,a defendant also offered a interpretation of the statements that served as the basis for his indictment,and we held that the choice among interpretations was an issue of fact properly left to a jury.at.here too the district court was correct in letting the jury decide.
other circuits agree.united states stock,cir in the usual case,whether a communication constitutes a threat or a true threat is a matter to be decided by the trier of fact.quoting united states kosma,cir see,white,at whether speech constitutes a threat is an issue of fact for a jury parr,at same malik,at same.there may be cases where no reasonable jury could conclude the statements were threats,but this is not one.see united states alkhabaz,cir.
sufficiency of the evidence 
turning from his argument that his statements as a matter of law were not threats,clemens next argues the evidence before the jury was not sufficient.because clemens never challenged the sufficiency of the evidence at trial we review the evidence only to determine if there is a clear and gross injustice.united states hicks,cir quoting united states gobbi,cir internal quotation mark omitted.
a jury could easily conclude clemens had intentionally made true threats.here clemens sent an email that warned pfaff to watch his backside,that they might meet in a back alley,that pfaff was playing a very dangerous game,that clemens wished pfaff were dead,that he hoped a ton beam would fall on pfaff,and that he had a feeling someone would get hurt real bad.clemens forwarded the email to vinchesi,with the note to her,you all might be digging yourself a grave.
the victims did in fact feel fear clemens would physically harm them after reading the emails and acted to protect themselves.pfaff took several precautions,including sending a photo of clemens to his wife and asking for patrol cars to circle his home.vinchesi also took precautions,meeting with scituate chief of police.the jury verdict was firmly based in the evidence.see nishnianidze,at while the may consider other evidence,including the effect of the statement on the recipient,the ultimate standard is an objective one whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be threatening.fulmer,at commenting that evidence of the recipient reactions is relevant to what a person making the statement should have reasonably foreseen see also mitchell united states,cir noting that even where challenges to evidence are preserved,an appellate court can not disturb a factfinder weighing of evidence and credibility determinations except for clear error.
clemens claim that his statements were not threatening because they were made to an opposing counsel during civil litigation is also unavailing.to the contrary,a jury could have found the perceived threat was more likely to be carried out given that litigation was contentious and the significance of the suit to clemens.
the judgment is affirmed.
the underlined portions of the email are those that pfaff identified as threatening at trial.the emphasis that was in clemens original email has been removed.the bracketed material appears as such in the original.the underlined portions of the email are those that pfaff identified as threatening at trial.the emphasis that was in clemens original email has been removed.the bracketed material appears as such in the original.
