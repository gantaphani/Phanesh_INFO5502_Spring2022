edward perrotta was convicted of conspiring with rocco folco and others to make extortionate extensions of credit,aiding and abetting folco in making extortionate extensions of credit,and financing extortionate extensions of credit made by folco.he appeals on a number of grounds.unconvinced by his arguments,we affirm his convictions.
background 
in april of,perrotta loaned to folco at an interest rate of one percent per week percent per year.folco,in turn,loaned the to anthony regine at an interest rate of two percent per week percent per year.under rhode island law,annual interest rates in excess of percent are not legally enforceable.regine testified,however,that he believed something would happen to me or to my family if he failed to make timely payments to folco.
in march of a grand jury indicted perrotta,folco,and several others on various charges.the indictment charged that perrotta had financed extortionate extensions of credit from folco to regine,in violation of.most of the defendants pled guilty.in march of the grand jury returned a superceding indictment which included the original count against perrotta and also charged that he had conspired with folco and others to make extortionate extensions of credit to regine,in violation of,and that perrotta had aided and abetted folco in making extortionate extensions of credit,in violation of and the general aiding and abetting statute.
perrotta moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that proscribing the advancement of money to a person with reasonable grounds to believe that person intends to use it to make an extortionate extension of credit encourages the jury to use a standard of proof less exacting than beyond a reasonable doubt,in violation of the due process clause of the constitution.the district court denied his motion.perrotta also moved to suppress weapons seized from his home and car which had not been described in the search warrant,and that motion was also denied.in addition,perrotta objected unsuccessfully in a motion in limine and at trial to the admission into evidence of the seized weapons.after the jury convicted perrotta on all charges,the court denied his earlier motions for a judgment of acquittal and sentenced perrotta to months in prison.
on appeal,perrotta argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions,that the district court erred in admitting into evidence weapons seized during a search of his home and car,that the seizure of the weapons violated the fourth amendment,and that invites confusion in the application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard and is therefore unconstitutional.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
a.the charges 
under,whoever makes any extortionate extension of credit,or conspires to do so,shall be fined or imprisoned not more than years,or both.federal law also proscribes willfully advanc ing money to any person,with reasonable grounds to believe that it is the intention of that person to use the money for the purpose of making extortionate extensions of credit.an extortionate extension of credit is 
a ny extension of credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person,reputation,or property of any person.
recognizing that direct evidence of the understanding of the parties concerning the consequences of delayed repayment or may be difficult to obtain,congress enumerated four factors which,if all present,would constitute prima facie evidence that the extension of credit was extortionate.b.the factors are that repayment is unenforceable through civil judicial process that the loan requires interest greater than per year that the loan exceeds and that the debtor reasonably believes that the lender either has used extortionate means to collect other debts or has a reputation for doing so.united states zannino,cir summarizing b.
instead of alleging that perrotta loan to folco was extortionate,the government tried to implicate perrotta as a participant in folco extortionate loan to regine.count one of the indictment charged that perrotta had conspired with folco to make extortionate extensions of credit to regine,in violation of.to win a conviction on this count,the government had to prove that perrotta and folco agreed and intended that folco would make an extortionate extension of credit to regine that is,that regine would understand that folco would,if necessary,resort to violence or other criminal means to collect.united states jesus,cir to prove the elements of a conspiracy,the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant and one or more coconspirators intended to agree and to commit the substantive criminal offense which was the object of their unlawful agreement.internal quotation marks omitted.
count three charged that perrotta had aided and abetted folco in making extortionate extensions of credit to regine,in violation of and.to win a conviction on this count,the government was required to prove that perrotta knew that folco extensions of credit to regine were extortionate and that perrotta intended to assist folco in making the extortionate loans.see united states,cir to support a conviction for aiding and abetting,the government must prove,in addition to the commission of the offense by the principal,that the defendant consciously shared the principal knowledge of the underlying criminal act,and intended to help the principal.
count two charged perrotta with financing extortionate extensions of credit from folco to regine in violation of.to win a conviction on this count,the government had to establish that perrotta had advanced money to folco with reasonable grounds to believe that folco would use the money to make an extortionate extension of credit.id.if we conclude in evaluating the evidence that it was sufficient to establish that perrotta knew of folco extortionate practices,we necessarily also conclude that he had reasonable grounds to believe that folco would employ such practices.
perrotta does not deny having loaned to folco,or that folco then loaned the to regine.nor does he dispute the government claim that folco loan of to regine was extortionate.his sole contention is that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that perrotta knew of the intention of folco to employ violence in his collection efforts.
folco as loan shark 
in weighing perrotta challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence against him,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.united states benjamin,cir.there was ample evidence at trial that folco was a loan shark,including a notebook in which folco had recorded the principal amount,interest rate,and payment schedule of over a dozen debts owed to him.the interest folco charged on these loans was two to three percent per week.there was extensive evidence that it was folco practice to use violence and threats of violence to collect debts.for example,folco explained to gary cedroni a folco associate that one of his debt collectors,who had just got out of the can and was half fucking nuts,would crack a debtor in order to scare him enough to secure payment in a second conversation,folco told cedroni that one of his debt collectors had cracked a debtor on the mouth on folco behalf and said you better have the money by six or else.in a third conversation,george melillo another folco associate indicated to folco that the next time he encountered a certain debtor,melillo would smash him in the mouth k nock him out cold.folco suggested that the debtor be warned that if payment was not made within a week,he and his father would get a beating.the surveillance tapes contained several other accounts of folco extortionate techniques.
c.the transactions 
on april,folco agreed to loan regine at an interest rate of two percent per week.regine needed this money to pay off other loan sharks who were charging him even higher rates of interest folco told regine that he would get the money from a third party,who turned out to be perrotta,and regine expressed his understanding that folco would charge me a point,that is,one percent per week,on top of the interest the third party perrotta would be charging folco.
on april,folco told cedroni that he had said to the old man perrotta was years old in that he might need more.folco reported that he had asked perrotta who am i gon na go to if i need that kind of money,and the old man had responded me come to me i give you anything you want.that same day,perrotta telephoned folco,and the following conversation ensued 
perrotta hey,i got you a putter for ya.
folco yeah.
perrotta do you want me to bring it over tomorrow 
folco yeah.
they agreed that perrotta would deliver the putter at the next morning.also on april,folco told regine o ne guy is gon na give me g tomorrow morning.folco also indicated that he could get regine an additional in the near future.
at on april,folco told regine by telephone that guy coming at eight thirty he gon na bring me.perrotta arrived at folco home at,without a golf putter.perrotta asked folco,you want to count it folco replied,no,no,i let him presumably regine count it there is there perrotta indicated that there was.folco explained his understanding of the terms of the loan that be one percent of i give you every tuesday.perrotta indicated his assent.
three minutes after perrotta departed,regine arrived at folco residence.he thanked folco and explained that he would take it the to joe,another loan shark to whom regine was indebted at an even higher rate of interest.in an apparent reference to the second loan which folco and regine had discussed,folco said i talked to a guy,gon na get back to me.gave me the bullshit,jesus,ahh i want a point and a half one and a half percent,he give me that shit.folco told regine that he had rejected this proposal,but that he expected to hear from the guy before the end of the week.
indeed,perrotta phoned folco two days later about a second putter 
perrotta you did like that,you did like that ah that putter i got yah,i got you another one.
folco alright.
perrotta you know and then you you whichever one you like ah you keep and ah the one you do like you can give it to me back so i can give it to somebody else.
folco i be here.
later that day,perrotta showed up at folco residence,again without a golf putter.in what the jury could have found was a reference to the schedule for interest payments,folco said to perrotta e very wednesday,and there was evidence that folco and perrotta in fact met on subsequent wednesdays.folco also said i be like ten weeks,that all,which the jury could have found was a statement of the term of the loan.
the following day regine came to folco home.folco reported that t he guy that brought me the money yesterday had supplied a ll twenties.the two men counted the money and determined that it indeed amounted to thousand.regine promised to pay folco the other five hundred two percent of tuesdays earlier in the conversation he had reiterated his existing obligation to give folco five on tuesday for the original.in other words,folco got his money on tuesday and perrotta got his on wednesday.
consistent with the evidence summarized above,a notebook found in folco residence contained entries that the jury could have found were a record of two loans of each from perrotta to folco.fbi expert jerome simpson offered the opinion that these loans,at an interest rate of one percent per week below the rate of all of the other loans in this notebook,and below the rate of any other loan that i ever seen for a loan shark to make,putting money out on the street were probably loans from one loan shark to another.as folco explained his financial arrangements to regine,the guys i go see that lend money,i guarantee that money out.
this was not the first time perrotta had advanced money to folco,as evidenced by the following conversation between folco and eddie lato,one of his business partners 
lato you know,what he perrotta does sometimes you ask him for two thousand he freezes.he got something about i do know if he thinks you gon na try and rob him 
folco today it was that.last time i asked him,ya,anything you want took ten off him,remember.
in addition,folco made reference in a recorded conversation to an earlier deal he had done for a point with the source of the he was lending to regine.
d.the seizure of perrotta cash and weapons 
a search conducted on june,turned up in cash on perrotta person,in cash around perrotta house,two handguns and ammunition in a nightstand in a bedroom,a third handgun,brass knuckles,a fake bomb in perrotta garage,and a billy club in his car.the next day,folco had the following conversation with lato 
lato um.perrotta,they got.i afraid.
folco what they unintelligible on him 
lato bombs,guns,everything.
folco he ai worried about unintelligible.if he blows up.hm.unintelligible he dead 
lato then informed folco that presumably the police t ook off of perrotta,consistent with the seizure the day before of from perrotta.lato reported that he had spoken to perrotta after the raid,and that either he or perrotta had said to the other it over for us.folco expressed concern that s omebody will rat.lato agreed and they gon na say that we,we,we bankrolled the whole fucking thing.
e.the evidence of perrotta knowledge of folco business 
first,there was evidence tending to show that perrotta had repeated dealings with folco in relation to folco operation.the jury could have inferred from folco report to cedroni that he had told the old man that he might need more emphasis added that perrotta was an ongoing participant in folco loan sharking business.the same inference is supported by folco reference to a previous deal he had done with the source of the,and by the conversation in which lato and folco discussed what perrotta sometimes does when asked for money.based on this evidence,the jury could have concluded that perrotta was more than an unwitting,peripheral participant in folco loan sharking business.that inference could have been reinforced for the jury by the concern lato expressed to folco,after the search of perrotta home,that they got perrotta,i afraid b ombs,guns,everything,and by the statement by lato or perrotta that it all over for us.
second,if the jury found that perrotta knew that folco was the to a third folco statement to perrotta,i let him presumably regine count it the money perrotta had just delivered,could also have concluded that perrotta must have realized that folco and that person understood that violence or other criminal collection techniques might be used.this is because,for folco to turn a profit,he would have had to charge interest in excess of the one percent per week he was paying perrotta,which would make the obligation legally unenforceable in rhode island.see united states oreto,cir fact that loan was grossly usurious was a factor indicating violence might be used to collect.the jury could have credited simpson testimony that,in his opinion,the loan from perrotta to folco at the relatively low rate of one percent per week was probably a loan from one loan shark to another,and that folco role in the transactions was,as he explained to regine,to guarantee perrotta money out.if the jury believed that perrotta himself was a loan shark,it could have reasoned that he must have realized that folco was one too,and that folco might use extortionate methods to collect the he had borrowed from perrotta and loaned to regine.
in sum,while there was no direct evidence that perrotta understood the extortionate nature of folco transactions with regine,there is enough circumstantial evidence to support a jury finding that he must have realized how folco would enforce,if necessary,regine repayment obligations.
iii.admission of the weapons 
perrotta filed a motion in limine to exclude,as evidence against him,all tangible evidence seized from his residence as such evidence is inadmissible pursuant to federal rule of evidence b and introduction of the same would deny the defendant the fair trial to which he is entitled.at the motion hearing,perrotta argued that introduction of the
