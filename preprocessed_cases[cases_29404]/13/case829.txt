on december,richard reid tried unsuccessfully to destroy american airlines flight over the atlantic ocean by detonating explosives hidden in his shoes.the plane was diverted to boston,where reid was arrested.on october,reid pleaded guilty to eight offenses and on january,he was sentenced to serve the remainder of his life in prison.at the sentencing hearing,reid declared his continuing allegiance to the terrorist osama bin laden,adding i think i ought not apologize for my actions.i am at war with your country a few days later,reid was transferred from massachusetts to a maximum security federal prison in florence,colorado adx florence,where he remains today.
this interlocutory appeal concerns the conditions of reid confinement.reid contends that the government violated his first amendment rights by restricting his access to news media while he was detained in massachusetts.as a federal prisoner housed at the massachusetts correctional institute at cedar junction,reid was permitted to use funds from his prison account to purchase a subscription to time magazine.under a set of special administrative measures imposed on reid by the marshals service usms at the direction of the attorney general,an fbi special agent removed the letters to the editor section from each issue of time the time letters before giving the magazine to reid.the special agent also clipped two articles about terrorism from the magazine and withheld them from reid.reid petitioned the district court for access to the withheld material on first amendment grounds.after a hearing on january,the district court denied reid request.
we conclude this appeal has been overtaken by changes in the factual and legal circumstances of reid confinement.although there remains a substantial dispute between the parties concerning reid access to time,we nonetheless dismiss the appeal under the branch of the mootness doctrine barring courts from deciding a case when no practical consequences would flow from the decision.
special administrative measures 
reid challenges the special administrative measures sams that governed his confinement while in massachusetts.the attorney general power to promulgate sams for individual prisoners derives from prevention of acts of violence and terrorism.see yousef reno,cir.that regulation permits the attorney general,who has plenary power over the management of federal prisons,see b,to impose on any individual prisoner special administrative measures that are reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of death or serious bodily injury.a.to impose such sams,the attorney general or the head of any federal law enforcement or intelligence agency must certify that,with respect to the prisoner in question,
there is a substantial risk that the prisoner communications or contacts with persons could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons,or substantial damage to property that would entail the risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons.
id.once authorized,sams may impose restrictions on the inmate housing or privileges,including 
correspondence,visiting,interviews with representatives of the news media,and use of the telephone,as is reasonably necessary to protect persons against the risk of acts of violence or terrorism.
id.the affected prisoner must be notified of the sams and the basis for their imposition.b.
sams are not indefinite in duration.before the september,terrorist attacks,the risk assessment underlying a set of sams was deemed valid for days when that period expired,a new risk assessment had to be conducted before the sams could be reimposed.yousef,at united states johnson,cir.after the september attacks,the bureau of prisons amended to permit sams to remain in force for up to a full year with the approval of the attorney general.c see.the agency justified the extension by stating that the september attacks had demonstrated beyond question that some terrorist conspiracies are carried out over a long in excess of days.at.though a prisoner might have limited ability to assist such efforts,the agency found,that fact do es not diminish the urgent need for law enforcement authorities to curb the inmate ability to participate in planning or facilitating those acts through communications with others within or outside the detention facility.id.
sams imposed on reid 
in february,approximately two months after flight landed in boston,the attorney general authorized the usms to issue sams regulating reid confinement.f allowing branches of the justice department other than the bureau of prisons to issue sams for persons in their custody.after the district court objected to the initial version of reid sams,see united states reid,d,a new version was issued on june.it was under the june sams that the usms restricted reid access to time magazine.
the june sams purported to control all of reid written and recorded communications,including his receipt of written materials.under the caption inmate communications prohibitions,the document provided 
the inmate is prohibited from passing or receiving any written or recorded communications to or from any other inmate,visitor,or anyone else except as outlined and allowed by this document.
the sams then set forth detailed rules governing reid access to visitors,telephone calls,and legal,consular,and mail.reid time subscription qualified as incoming mail 
mail not clearly and properly addressed the inmate attorney and marked privileged,or consular mail incoming or outgoing 
be copied including the surface of the envelope by the warden,or designee,of the facility in which the inmate is housed.
ii.be forwarded,in copy form,to the location designated by the fbi.
iv.mail mail is determined by usms or fbi to contain overt or covert discussions of or requests for illegal activities,the soliciting or encouraging of acts of violence or terrorism,or actual or attempted circumvention of sam,the mail shall not be.the inmate shall be notified in writing of the seizure of any mail.
these were the only provisions in the june sams pertaining to reid time subscription.
reid motions for access to time 
reid initially challenged these restrictions in june,when he indicated his intent to subscribe to time and filed a motion to prevent the government from interfering with the magazine delivery.because reid had not yet subscribed to time,however,the district court denied the motion as not ripe.
reid actually began subscribing to time in september.initially,it appears,the magazine was delivered to him complete and without undue delay.then,on october,the government informed defense counsel that it had removed an article about terrorism from reid october,issue of time under the mail seizure provision of the sams.reid tried to challenge that decision through administrative channels,e providing that inmates subjected to sams may seek review through an administrative process,but the government successfully took the position that administrative remedies were unavailable to reid,apparently because he had not yet been sentenced.
reid responded by filing a renewed motion in the district court to enjoin the government from interfering with his time subscription.he argued that government censorship of his subscription violated his first amendment rights.reid also sought permission to purchase a radio,which was prohibited by the sams.
the government defended the sams and their application to reid time subscription and radio request as reasonably necessary for valid penological and national security purposes.the government justified this argument in part by reference to materials filed under seal.certain outbound correspondence from reid had been seized during his confinement in massachusetts.the substance of that correspondence is not at issue in this case the government submitted it simply to substantiate its claim articulated in public that reid had indeed attempted to communicate with others while in custody the government also emphasized that reid is an admitted member of al qaeda,a terrorist organization that,according to the government,trains its members to exploit communications to relay coded messages to and from prison
