congress enacted the americans with disabilities act,the ada,with a view toward eliminating discrimination against persons with disabilities.that is a laudable so is the policy of the state of maine,variously expressed in statutes,regulations,and judicial decisions,that constrains retailers against the profligate sale of alcoholic beverages to inebriates.this difficult case places those policies in tension with each other.
the underlying action arises out of a retailer refusal to sell alcoholic beverages to a disabled person whose symptoms mimic the traits of intoxication.the district court first concluded that title iii of the ada permitted the maintenance of a private cause of action.dudley hannaford,d,dudley i.the court then found,following a trial,that the retailer,hannaford.hannaford,had sanctioned a policy that forbade the manager of the store in question from reconsidering a clerk initial refusal to sell,even after the customer revealed his disability.dudley hannaford,d,dudley ii.in the court view,this rule violated the ada.id.at.
we agree with the district court that the ada requires a retail establishment to exhibit more flexibility in serving disabled patrons.accordingly,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
we rehearse the facts as found by the district court,consistent with record support.see sierra fria donald evans,cir.
in,david dudley suffered massive trauma to his head,legs,and internal organs in an automobile accident.he never fully recovered from the effects of those injuries.although he lost the manual dexterity needed to operate his appliance repair business,a regimen of therapy,stretching over several years,enabled him to resume a modicum of activities.his remaining symptomatology,however,included severely impaired speech,a pronounced loss of muscular control,an inability to take even breaths,and a tendency toward impulsive mood swings.the district court observed dudley during the trial and described his speech as awkward and often very difficult to comprehend.dudley ii,d at.the court concluded that his gait and balance had been severely affected by his injuries and found his movements exceedingly labored.id.the court added that the use of an appliance,such as a cane or a walker,would not significantly ameliorate his condition.id.
on saturday,february,dudley moved from augusta to a new abode in gardiner,maine.although friends assisted him in making the move,dudley found the day tiring that evening,he drove to a shop n save supermarket operated by hannaford,intending to purchase alcoholic beverages.he parked his van in a spot reserved for handicapped patrons,entered the store,and proceeded to the appropriate aisle.he then began slowly to inspect the available merchandise.
the store shift leader,armand cookson,noticed that dudley was spending what seemed to be an inordinate amount of time staring at the shelves.when dudley finally selected a of wine coolers and proceeded toward the checkout counter,cookson observed his rambling gait,drooping eyelids,and flushed face.cookson jumped to the conclusion that dudley was intoxicated.accordingly,cookson advised the cashier,erin donnell,not to sell dudley any alcoholic beverages.
dudley placed the wine coolers on the counter.donnell greeted him and received a slurred response.donnell,like cookson,already had concluded that dudley was drunk,and his slurred speech reinforced her mindset.she told dudley that she believed him to be intoxicated and,therefore,would not sell him any alcoholic beverages.dudley immediately became agitated,throwing his arms into the air and exclaiming,here we go again 
speaking loudly,dudley tried to explain that he was not besotted but disabled.donnell was taken aback by dudley aggressive manner and stepped away from the cash register.cookson then intervened,reiterating that the store would not sell any alcoholic beverages to dudley and removing the wine coolers from the counter.dudley became increasingly frustrated in his labored speech,he tried to impart that injuries from a car wreck,not the overindulgent consumption of alcohol,explained his behavior.admitted at trial that he thought this explanation plausible when dudley that the store had a strict rule prohibiting managers from reversing a cashier decision not to sell alcoholic beverages to a customer.dudley nonetheless persisted and asked to speak with the person in charge.
henry fossett,the night manager,responded.he had observed much of what had transpired.dudley calmly described the nature of his disability.he pointed out that his car clearly visible through the plate glass storefront was parked in a handicapped parking place and bore license plates denoting that its owner was a person with a disability.he also encouraged fossett to call the police so that he could take a breathalyzer test and prove conclusively that he was not intoxicated.after hearing dudley explanation,fossett considered it possible that dudley suffered from a disability.nevertheless,fossett fell back on the store policy,reiterating that management would not revisit a cashier refusal to purvey alcoholic beverages to a customer.
dudley left the store.since that evening,he has not attempted to purchase alcoholic beverages at the gardiner shop n save or at any of hannaford other locations despite hannaford relatively attractive prices.for its part,hannaford has not changed any of its policies or practices regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages.
ii.travel of the case 
on or about september,dudley filed a charge of discrimination with the maine human rights commission mhrc under the ada and the maine human rights act mhra.after the mhrc issued a letter,dudley brought suit in the federal district court under title iii of the ada,and the counterpart provisions of subchapter v of the mhra.ann.tit,to west.on july,the district court denied hannaford motion to dismiss,ruling that dudley could pursue a private right of action under a.see dudley i,d at.following a bench trial,the district court took the merits under advisement.
the court proceeded to write a thoughtful rescript delineating dudley incapacities,describing the events of february,and determining that dudley was disabled within the meaning of the ada.dudley ii,d at.the court found as a fact that a t the gardiner store it is an unwritten rule that once a cashier refuses to sell alcohol to a customer,the cashier supervisors will rarely,if ever,reverse that decision.id.at.based in part on this finding,the court concluded that hannaford actions and policies violated dudley rights under the ada.id.at.deeming the ada and the mhra coextensive,id.at,the district court further found that hannaford actions violated the mhra,id.at.
the court then turned to the question of relief.acting pursuant to both statutes,the court enjoined hannaford from continuing to enforce its discriminatory refusal to reconsider policy at its gardiner store.id.then,acting under the mhra,the court imposed a civil penalty and awarded dudley reasonable attorneys fees.id.at.hannaford now appeals.
iii.analysis 
we divide our analysis into several segments.we begin with an overview of the pertinent provisions of the ada.we then discuss hannaford two principal defenses to the ada claim.finally,we turn to the mhra claim.
a.the ada an overview.
the ada did not emerge in a vacuum.congress found that society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,thus creating a serious and pervasive social problem.a.such individuals continually encounter ed various forms of discrimination,id.a,and,as a group,occup ied an inferior status in our society,id.a.mindful of these inequities,congress enacted the ada to address the major areas of discrimination faced by people with disabilities,id.b,hoping to assure equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic for such individuals,id.a.
title iii of the ada targets discrimination by privately operated places of public accommodation including supermarkets and other types of retail shops.it sends a bluntly worded message to those establishments that fall within its purview you may not discriminate against an individual in the full and equal access to goods and services on the basis of a disability.
the case before us involves title iii.the law general prohibition stipulates that 
no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or leases to,or operates a place of public accommodation.
id.a.for purposes of section a,discrimination includes 
a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures,when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations to individuals with disabilities,unless the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations 
id.b a ii.the remedies contained in title iii are made available to 
a ny person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of title iii nothing in this section shall require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply with its provisions.
dudley invokes these sections,claiming that hannaford policies precluded him,because of his disability,from full and equal access to the store merchandise.
b.the existence of a private right of action.
hannaford initial response is that a single incident of discrimination is insufficient to support a private right of action under title iii of the ada.in mounting this argument,hannaford does not challenge the district court ruling that dudley had standing to bring his title iii suit.see dudley i,d at rather,hannaford attacks the court closely related determination,id.at,that the language of section a is broad enough to provide a private right of action for an individual who suffered a single incident of discrimination.
to the extent that this argument rests on the proposition that title iii is not intended to provide redress for past discrimination that is unlikely to recur,it is.section a of the ada incorporates the remedies set forth in a.that compendium of remedies allows only injunctive relief as opposed to money damages.see newman piggie park,d per curiam.it therefore requires some ongoing harm or,at least,a colorable threat of future harm.see a permitting a civil action for injunctive relief whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that any person is about to engage in any prohibited act or practice emphasis supplied.otherwise,an injunction would be pointless.
dudley envisions the persistence of hannaford refusal to reconsider policy as an ongoing harm.but dudley never attempted to purchase alcoholic beverages at the gardiner shop n save either before or after the night in question,and hannaford asserts that dudley,in order to establish an ongoing harm,must prove that a subsequent effort on his part to purchase alcoholic beverages at the gardiner store would have been a futile gesture.id.a.without this embellishment,hannaford says,dudley is not being subjected to discrimination on a current basis,as title iii requires.
the proposition that hannaford a disabled person must subject himself to repeated instances of discrimination in order to invoke the remedial framework of title iii of the the language of section a on its head.the futile gesture provision is designed to protect a disabled plaintiff from having to shoulder an undue evidentiary burden.pickern holiday quality foods,cir.yet hannaford rendition of the provision converts it into one that creates just such a burden.we do not believe that establishing a private right of action under title iii requires a plaintiff to perform such heroic measures.
under title iii of the ada,courts typically have gauged the discriminatory effect of a policy or practice by the degree to which that policy or practice denies access to a disabled individual,not merely by the specific instances in which the policy or practice frustrates the individual.see,id.at holding that a disabled individual suffers an injury once he has become aware of discriminatory conditions existing at a public accommodation and is thereby deterred from visiting or patronizing that accommodation steger franco,cir holding that a disabled individual may invoke title iii to demand that a building be brought into compliance with the ada even though he only entered the building once.in these cases,the existence of a private right of action under section a does not depend upon how many attempts a plaintiff has made to overcome a discriminatory barrier,but,rather,upon whether the barrier remains in place.
our analysis,however,can not stop there.this is not a physical barrier case and,as hannaford correctly observes,the likelihood that dudley would be denied a future right to purchase necessarily turns on an informed prophecy about a store clerk subjective judgment.moreover,hannaford suggests that the evening in question may have been atypical both because it was a saturday night and because it followed a grueling move that may have exacerbated dudley symptoms.were dudley to come into the gardiner store at a more tranquil time or after a less harrowing day,this thesis runs,he might not encounter the same difficulties.
this idiosyncratic fact pattern distinguishes the case at hand from the of title iii cases like the prototypical physical barrier cases.to the extent that those other cases enter into a discussion of probabilities,that discussion usually occurs in the context of determining whether a particular plaintiff enjoys standing to launch a title iii claim.consequently,the court scrutinizes the likelihood that a plaintiff,absent the barrier,would have frequented the public accommodation in the future.see,pickern,at schroedel nyu med.although those cases do not involve a direct inquiry as to whether the practice that blocked access once would do so again,they nonetheless articulate a standard that can be tailored to fit the unusual dimensions of the instant case.
as a general matter,recent title iii cases have required plaintiffs to show a real and immediate threat that a particular illegal barrier will cause future harm.see,steger,at deck am.haw.cruises,d,hoepfl barlow,schroedel.at aikins helena.this standard has been adapted from generic supreme court precedents discussing whether a plaintiff has standing to protest a particular injury.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d holding that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing includes suffering an injury in fact that is actual or imminent citations omitted city of los angeles lyons,d requiring a plaintiff requesting injunctive relief to establish a real and immediate threat that illegal conduct will occur littleton,d abstract injury is not enough the injury or threat of injury must be both real and immediate,not conjectural or hypothetical.citations omitted.even though no court has yet employed this standard to determine whether a plaintiff has a private right of action under section a,we deem it an appropriate way to answer that inquiry.
applying that standard,we conclude that dudley has shown a real and immediate threat of ongoing harm.after all,the offending policy remains firmly in place there is no dispute that dudley,having just moved to a small town,would have been likely to patronize the gardiner shop n save and the symptoms of his disability continue to mimic the side effects of intoxication.moreover,three hannaford employees donnell,cookson,and fossett all independently concluded that dudley was inebriated.these facts suggest that hannaford is overstating the degree of randomness involved in a store clerk perceptions.notably,even hannaford does not venture to predict a different result if the contributing circumstances of february a weary dudley entered the store on a saturday to recur.
we hasten to add that dudley experience on that evening was not wholly unique.the record shows three other incidents that are informative even though none of them involved a hannaford store.the first two occurred prior to february.in each instance,a sales clerk mistook dudley disability for intoxication and,before receiving an explanation,refused to sell him alcohol.on the third occasion after the events of february,a sales clerk again rebuffed dudley in an attempt to purchase alcoholic beverages.on all three occasions,dudley explained the situation and the store relented.if these establishments adhered to a strict refusal to reconsider policy,similar to hannaford,dudley efforts to purchase liquor would have been thwarted.thus,while there is no absolute certainty that dudley would be denied the right to purchase alcoholic beverages during a future visit to the gardiner shop n save,the likelihood of a denial seems substantial.no more is exigible to support a title iii right of action.
this conclusion rests,in part,on the background understanding that section a negates any requirement that a disabled person engage in a futile gesture to establish the existence of a discriminatory policy or practice.see pickern,at explaining that when a disabled plaintiff has actual knowledge of an illegal barrier at a public accommodation and is thereby deterred,he need not engage in the futile gesture of attempting to gain access to show ongoing harm steger,at similar.we have scant case law to guide us on how futile a gesture must be to satisfy this benchmark but congress clearly meant not to overburden title iii claimants.this is evident from the fact that title iii remedies mirror those contained in title ii of the civil rights act of.in enacting the latter statute,congress evinced its understanding that enforcement would prove difficult and that the nation would have to rely in part upon private litigation as a means of securing broad compliance.newman,at.it is fair to assume that congress had the same understanding when it enacted title iii of the ada.see generally rep ii,at,reprinted in,noting congress explicit intention to make section a consistent with title ii of the civil rights act of.limiting title iii relief to instances in which a future violation appears certain to occur would create a standard far more demanding than that contemplated by the congressional objectives that influenced the ada.
to sum up,the question before us is whether dudley has proffered enough evidence to establish a real and immediate threat that hannaford policy will again result in a title iii violation.given the remedial purpose underlying the ada,courts should resolve doubts about such questions in favor of disabled individuals.see arnold united parcel,cir see also tcherepnin knight,d recognizing the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.so viewed,we think that the record shows a sufficient probability of a repeat occurrence,and,in any event,hannaford points to nothing suggesting that dudley would be treated differently if the circumstances of february were replicated today.although the issue is close,we therefore hold that section provides dudley with a private right of action.
c.the merits of dudley ada claim.
to recover under section b a ii in a retail sale case,a plaintiff must show that he comes within the protections of the ada as a person with a disability,and that the defendant establishment is subject to the mandates of title iii as a place of public accommodation,id.above and beyond these two abecedarian points,the plaintiff must show that the defendant has a discriminatory policy or practice in effect that he the plaintiff requested a reasonable modification in that policy or practice which,if granted,would have afforded him access to the desired goods that the requested a modification like necessary to afford that access and that the defendant nonetheless refused to modify the policy or practice.pga tour,martin,d amir louis,cir johnson gambrinus spoetzl brewery,cir.upon such a showing,the defendant must make the modification unless it proves either that doing so would alter the fundamental nature of its business,see pga tour,at,or that the requested modification poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others,bragdon abbott,d.
in the lower court,hannaford contested dudley claim that he had a disability within the meaning of a.the district court resolved this point in dudley favor.dudley ii,d at.because hannaford does not renew this challenge on appeal,we deem the argument waived.see united states slade,cir united states zannino,cir.consequently,dudley meets the first prong of the test.dudley also meets the second,as hannaford concedes that its gardiner store is a place of public accommodation within the purview of title iii.
as to the other elements,it is incontrovertible that hannaford had a refusal to reconsider policy in place,that dudley requested hannaford to deviate from that policy,that such a deviation was necessary for dudley to gain access to the desired goods,and that his request was denied.what remains are questions concerning the reasonableness of the requested modification.as to those questions,hannaford makes four main points.its primary argument is that the district court erred in interpreting section b a ii to prohibit the unbending implementation of its refusal to reconsider policy.the argument takes two forms.we consider each of them.
first,hannaford posits that section b a ii only applies to individuals with known or obvious disabilities.it says that since dudley condition was not of this symptoms were ambiguous,and hannaford personnel were uncertain as to whether his behavior stemmed from a disability or from substance adherence to the store policy did not violate section b a ii.
hannaford derives this argument from b a,which prohibits employers from failing to mak e reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.emphasis supplied.its reliance on that provision is mislaid.section b a is a part of title i of the there is no principled basis for importing it into title iii.
while title iii imposes certain requirements on operators of public accommodations their interactions with the citizenry at large,title i places obligations on employers regarding their relations with employees and prospective employees.this distinction is significant.in an employment context,where relationships are personalized and employers typically have a basic familiarity with their employees,section b a limited applicability to known physical or mental disabilities makes sense it takes into account the possibility that an employee or prospective employee may,for whatever reason,choose not to disclose a disability.he may,for example,fear that if he discloses it,he will be disadvantaged the employer will,say,refrain from promoting or hiring him.when such a disability is concealed,it would be mindless to hold the employer liable for failing to accommodate the unknown disability.so viewed,under title i obviousness is relevant only as a proxy for actual knowledge.see hedberg.bell,cir explaining that the obviousness of symptomatology makes it reasonable to infer that an employer actually knew of the disability.
in contrast,title iii offers no incentive for an individual to conceal his or her disability.the operative provision,b a ii,requires a person with a disability to request a reasonable and necessary modification,thereby informing the operator of a public accommodation about the disability.it would be pointless to impose upon the plaintiff the burden to inform the public accommodation operator of his disability but then exempt the operator,by judicial fiat,from accommodating disabilities that are not obvious.congress did not place a limitation on the reach of title iii based on the obviousness of an individual disability,and it would be a usurpation of congressional authority for us to do so here.see bates united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.citations a
