plaintiffs valerie plame wilson,a former employee of the central intelligence agency cia or the agency,and simon schuster,the publisher of her memoir,fair game my life as a spy,my betrayal by the white house fair game,sued the cia,the cia director,and the director of national intelligence in the united states district court for the southern district of new york barbara jones,judge under the declaratory judgment act,and the administrative procedure act,et,for alleged violations of the first amendment.to vindicate their asserted constitutional rights,plaintiffs sought an order precluding defendants from enforcing a decision by the cia publication review board forbidding publication of any passages in wilson memoir relating to her possible service with the agency on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that plaintiffs could not demonstrate a first amendment violation and entered judgment in favor of defendants.see wilson mcconnell,d.
plaintiffs appeal,arguing that the district court erred when it determined,as a matter of law,that because any facts relating to wilson possible service with the cia remained properly classified,the agency could,consistent with the first amendment,forbid her from disclosing such information under the terms of a secrecy agreement that was a condition of her agency employment.plaintiffs assert that two reasons mandate a different conclusion the cia itself officially disclosed the dates of wilson agency service in a letter sent to her on february,and wilson dates of service are,in any event,now a matter of such widespread public knowledge as to render unreasonable the agency insistence on maintaining the information as classified.
the record does not support plaintiffs official disclosure claim as it was wilson,and not the agency,that permitted the information at issue to be revealed to the public.although the cia may have been negligent in communicating personnel information to wilson without proper classification,the information only became public when that the cia was insisting on maintaining the secrecy of her service authorized a member of congress to publish the cia communication in the congressional record.see infra at.
we also conclude that evidence of public disclosure does not deprive information of classified status and that the agency has demonstrated a reasonable basis for maintaining information about wilson agency service as classified.accordingly,because the information at issue on this appeal remains properly classified,and because wilson is obligated by the conditions of her employment with the cia not to disclose classified information,plaintiffs first amendment claim fails as a matter of law.we therefore affirm the award of summary judgment entered in favor of defendants 
factual background 
this is no routine dispute.rather,it involves highly publicized actions by all three branches of the federal government.although we here review only those facts necessary to our resolution of the issues raised on this appeal,that discussion is necessarily lengthy.
a.the initial public disclosure of valerie wilson cia employment 
during his state of the union address,president george bush told congress that t he british government has learned that iraq dictator saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa.address before a joint session of congress on the state of the union,pub.papers.a public debate ensued regarding the accuracy of this assertion.see generally wilson libby,describing debate,cert.denied,d,june,in re grand jury subpoena,judith miller,same.on july,the new york times published an piece written by plaintiff valerie plame wilson husband,joseph wilson iv,a former foreign service officer who had represented the united states in various capacities,including deputy chief of mission at the embassy in iraq from to and ambassador to gabon from to.see joseph wilson,the politics of truth inside the lies that put the white house on trial and betrayed my wife cia identity.in his piece,wilson disclosed that,in,the cia had sent him to africa to assess the accuracy of intelligence indicating that niger had sold uranium yellowcake to iraq in the late.see joseph wilson iv,what i did find in africa,times,july,at.wilson stated that,based on his investigation,he determined that it was highly doubtful that any such transaction had ever taken place,and that he had so informed the cia in march,nine months before president bush state of the union address.id.wilson suggested that if the bush administration ignored his report because it did not fit certain preconceptions about iraq,then a legitimate argument can be made that we went to war under false pretenses.id.
eight days later,syndicated columnist robert novak commented on wilson oped piece and,in doing so,revealed wilson employment with the cia joseph wilson never worked for the cia,but his wife,valerie plame,is an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction.two senior administration officials told me that wilson wife suggested sending him to niger to investigate the intelligence regarding iraq attempted uranium purchases.robert novak,mission to niger.post,july,at 
b.the cia official acknowledgment of wilson service with the agency 
at the time of the novak disclosure,wilson was in fact a covert cia employee for whom the cia was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the united states.unclassified summary of valerie wilson cia employment cover history at,united states libby,cr.may.as plaintiffs acknowledge,wilson employment affiliation with the cia was then highly classified.appellants br.at.
the revelation of wilson cia employment caused a public outcry,leading to the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate whether any government employees had violated federal law by disclosing the identity of a covert agent without authorization.see.as a consequence,the agency rolled back wilson cover,officially disclosed her status as a cia three stages.see declaration of cia deputy director stephen kappes at july,unclassified kappes declaration first,in december,as a result of the novak column and subsequent media reporting of wilson relationship with the cia,the agency lifted wilson cover effective december.id.emphasis added.second,in february,the agency rolled back wilson cover effective july,the date of the novak disclosure.id.emphasis added.third,in october,to facilitate the prosecution of lewis libby,the vice president chief of staff,for perjury and obstruction of justice the cia,exercising its discretion under section b of executive order,determined that the public interest in the disclosure of wilson employment and cover status for the period beginning january,the year of her husband trip to niger outweighed the damage to national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure of that information,and lifted and rolled back wilson cover as of that date.id thus,the cia officially disclosed that,as of january,wilson was working for the cia in its counterproliferation division,where she served as chief of the unit responsible for weapons proliferation issues related to iraq.see unclassified summary of valerie wilson cia employment and cover history at,united states libby,cr.may.
before this court,the agency emphatically maintains the limited nature of these official disclosures they do not mean that the cia acknowledges any other period of wilson employment,if any,nor do they declassify the nature and details of wilson cover,the cover methods employed by the cia to protect wilson or other covert cia employees,or the fact,nature and details of wilson classified intelligence activities as a cia employee at any time during her employment.unclassified kappes declaration at.
c.wilson retirement discussions with representative inslee and the cia february,letter 
perceiving that disclosure of her covert status with the cia significantly restricted her eligibility for future agency assignments and promotions,valerie wilson decided to retire.before serving formal notice of retirement,wilson and her husband had discussions with representative jay inslee,to explore the possibility of a private bill that would permit wilson to receive full retirement benefits despite the fact that she had not reached the requisite age.on november,inslee chief of staff,brian bonlender,sent wilson a draft of such legislation,which proposed to reference his wife years of agency service,information that was classified in january,valerie plame wilson will have been employed by the central intelligence agency for years and will be years of age.from bonlender to wilson,attachment at.the draft bill further stated valerie plame wilson should be able to receive retirement benefits from the central intelligence agency after having been employed for years without meeting the minimum age requirement.id the record also reveals that,in responding to inslee office the following week,wilson herself did not hesitate to discuss the classified fact of her years of agency service i resign on with redacted years of service.from wilson to bonlender,redaction in copy filed with district court.
in this same,wilson advised bonlender that she wanted to have a final decision from the agency regarding her retirement benefits prior to submitting any legislation in order to demonstrate that all other avenues of recourse have been attempted,id.emphasis in original.two weeks later,wilson reported that she pretty much had final word from the agency that she would not be eligible to receive her retirement benefits early,but that the agency will give me an official memo to that effect.from wilson to bonlender.
valerie wilson formally resigned from the cia effective january.one month later,on february,karen tumolo,then chief of the cia retirement and insurance services division,sent wilson a letter regarding her retirement benefits the february letter or letter.the letter was written on cia letterhead,sent via mail and contained no classification markings.it set forth the dates of wilson service with the cia and explained that,by statute,wilson was not yet eligible to receive her deferred annuity.
shortly thereafter,wilson reported to inslee chief of staff that she had received an official letter from the agency regarding her retirement benefits,and she offered to fax him the actual letter,if it would be helpful.from wilson to bonlender.the record does not indicate precisely when wilson forwarded the february letter to inslee office,but it is undisputed that she did so.no legislation pertaining to wilson retirement benefits was introduced in,however,and plaintiffs surmise that this was because of the unlikelihood of enactment by the congress.
d.wilson secrecy agreement with the cia 
when valerie wilson joined the cia,she signed a standard form secrecy agreement in which she agreed never to disclose in any form or any manner information or materials obtained in the course of her employment with the cia that are classified pursuant to executive order,or which reveal information,classifiable pursuant to executive order.cia form secrecy agreement.the form agreement placed the burden upon wilson to determine whether information or materials in her control were classified or classifiable,as well as to ascertain whom the cia had authorized to receive such information or materials.see id.in the agreement,wilson also promised as follows 
i hereby agree to submit for review by the cia all information or materials including works of fiction which contain any mention of intelligence data or activities,or contain data which may be based upon information classified pursuant to executive order,which i contemplate disclosing publicly or which i have actually prepared for public disclosure,either during my employment or other service with the cia or at any time thereafter,prior to discussing it with or showing it to anyone who is not authorized to have access to it.i further agree that i will not take any steps toward public disclosure until i have received written permission to do so from the cia.
id.the agreement explained that the purpose of the review process is to give the cia an opportunity to determine whether the information or materials which wilson contemplate d disclosing publicly contain any information which she ha d agreed not to disclose.id.wilson indicated that she understood and accepted that the conditions and obligations set forth in the agreement applied both during her employment and at all times thereafter.id.
e.wilson submission of her memoir to the cia publication review board 
in accordance with the terms of her secrecy agreement,in july,wilson submitted the first five chapters of her memoir to the cia publication review board prb,the entity charged with reviewing materials submitted by current and former employees that are intended for nonofficial publication or public dissemination,to determine whether they contain classified information.declaration of prb chairman richard puhl,at july.in september,wilson submitted her full manuscript to the prb.
an october meeting between wilson and the prb to discuss the memoir was delayed due to what wilson attorney later described as an internal agency debate about the propriety of rolling back wilson cover prior to.letter from david smallman to ginger wright,cia assistant general counsel,at,describing conversation between wilson and prb official.wilson asserts that,when she finally met with prb staff in november,she was told that the staff thought that prohibiting wilson from disclosing her cia affiliation prior to would lead to an absurd and ludicrous result nevertheless,a decision had been made by the seventh floor,senior agency management,not to permit her to make such disclosures.see also fair game at.
shortly after the november meeting,wilson received a letter from the prb disapproving publication of her manuscript as currently written.letter from prb chairman puhl to wilson,at.the prb explained that the first pages of the memoir were particularly problematic because the context in which certain matters were discussed and the timeframes associated with the material would reveal classified information.id.the prb offered to meet again with wilson to discuss the problems identified and the deletions or changes that would be required to permit publication.concluding that significantly fewer and less complex changes were necessary for pages of the manuscript,the prb offered nine pages of edits.
wilson responded by requesting edits to the first pages of her manuscript.the prb declined in a letter dated december,explaining that t he first pages of your manuscript are replete with statements that may be unclassified standing alone,but they become classified when they are linked with a specific time,such as an event in your personal life,or are included in another context that would reveal classified information.letter from prb chairman puhl to wilson,at.the letter suggested that wilson might address this problem by separat ing certain statements or vignettes from the timeframes in which they currently appear,remov ing the references to the times and events in your personal life,or,where no other option was feasible,recast ing or fictionaliz ing certain information.id.at.
in a responsive letter dated january,wilson counsel asserted that t he dates of wilson federal service and her government employment affiliation during specific time periods were disclosed officially by the agency in an unclassified letter to her in february,letter from smallman to wright,at.counsel also attached to his letter an chart of citations to public domain sources purporting to describe wilson affiliation with the cia,including articles discussing when she joined the agency,where she had served,and her cover methods counsel submitted that,in these circumstances,preventing wilson from telling her full story was nonsensical because the net effect of the agency limitation was that virtually anyone in the world can write about,publicly known aspects of wilson for her.id.at emphasis in original.
f.the valerie plame wilson compensation act and public disclosure of the february letter 
as the prb,wilson,and her attorney pursued negotiations about the permissible content of her book,inslee prepared to the now previously drafted private bill authorizing wilson early receipt of full retirement benefits.toward this end,inslee sought wilson permission to place in the congressional record a copy of the cia february,letter.wilson gave her approval in a january,letter,which states i have no objections to any otherwise permissible inclusion of my personal financial information as contained in the february letter.the letter does not contain any designation that its entire contents or any portion sets forth or references classified information.this letter was sent to me via first class mail.see letter from wilson to inslee,at.
on january,inslee introduced the valerie plame wilson compensation act,cong.in his floor statement,inslee specifically referenced wilson years of federal service.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of inslee.he further stated 
i am introducing legislation to allow plame wilson to qualify for her annuity,as one who has served her country for two decades,and waive the age requirement for collecting it.to best demonstrate the annuity for which plame wilson may qualify if this legislation were to pass,i am submitting for the record a document sent to plame wilson by the cia.it outlines her deferred annuity and testifies to years of service.the document bears no indications of classified material as required by cia procedures,and was sent via regular postal mail after plame wilson was no longer in the employ of the cia.legal experts have assured me that this is not a classified document.
id.inslee then placed in the record a modestly redacted version of the cia february letter,which stated,inter alia,o ur records show that since january,you have acquired years,month and days of overseas service.following is a list of your federal service cia,cia lwop,cia,from to of years,days.id.this version of the february letter was thereafter incorporated into the congressional record and is now permanently available to the public,both in print and on the internet 
three days later,karen agency official who authored the february to advise wilson that the letter was not properly marked to indicate its national security classification due to an administrative error,and that the information contained therein in fact remains classified.letter from tumolo to wilson,at.tumolo requested that wilson return the letter,along with any copies,to the agency.meanwhile,christopher walker,the cia director of congressional affairs,similarly informed the clerk of the house of representatives that the february letter introduced into the congressional record contains classified information that was not properly marked.letter from christopher walker,director of congressional affairs,cia,to karen haas,clerk,house of representatives,at.walker did not,however,request return of the letter or any other congressional action.
on january,wilson agreed to return a copy of the february letter to the cia and requested that the agency provide her with a redacted copy.the redacted letter so provided on april,discloses only wilson service dates.
final review 
after inslee public disclosure of the cia february letter,wilson continued to negotiate with the prb regarding its refusal to allow her to reference any cia affiliation in her memoir.in a series of letters,wilson counsel argued that the february,he asserted,was disclosed to wilson in an unclassified form and had since entered the public an official acknowledgment of wilson dates of service with the cia that necessarily undermined any justification for barring her from discussing those dates in her memoir.in turn,the agency maintained that the letter contained properly classified information that had never been officially disclosed or declassified.
after wilson rejected the cia suggestion that she fictionalize or otherwise alter the first half of her manuscript,the prb made extensive redactions to that portion of her book,explaining that w ith limited exceptions,the classified information identified in your manuscript relates to a single issue,of which you are aware,and reflects the classification determination made by the director of the agency.letter from prb chairman puhl to wilson,at,the prb also confirmed for wilson that she had exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to this issue.this litigation followed.
h.the district court proceedings 
on may,plaintiffs filed this action seeking an injunction preventing defendants from barring publication of those portions of wilson memoir that reference information officially acknowledged by defendant cia in the february,letter,and a declaration that,among other things,the prb prohibition on the publication of wilson service dates violates her first amendment rights.complaint at.the parties for summary judgment and,in an opinion dated august,the district court granted defendants motion and denied plaintiffs motion.see wilson mcconnell,d.
the district court noted that wilson is not challenging the prb process,the prb regulations,or her contractual secrecy obligation to the government.id.at.further,no party had asked the court to rule on any particular redaction to the memoir.id.at.the district court identified the sole issue for decision to be whether,or to what extent,the cia may use wilson dates of service as a basis for censor ship on national security grounds.id.
in ruling in favor of defendants,the district court determined that wilson service dates had been properly classified prior to the issuance of the february letter those dates were never formally declassified by the agency and the february letter was not an official acknowledgment of wilson service dates because a the letter was sent only to wilson and,thus,was not a public disclosure and b the subsequent public disclosure of the letter by wilson and inslee was not official because it was not attributable to the cia.id.at.
plaintiffs timely filed notice of this appeal on september.
publication of fair game 
approximately one month later,on october,simon schuster published fair game with the redactions required by the prb rendered in the text as lines.the book opens with a publisher note explaining that many of the cia required redactions relate to material that would disclose wilson dates of service,information that has already been widely disseminated.fair game at ix.the note advises readers that the redacted information is effectively being provided in an afterword written by someone other than wilson 
to enhance the reader experience simon schuster has added an afterword by reporter laura rozen.drawn from interviews and public sources,it provides historical background and recounts portions of wilson life and career that she was unable to include herself.when the afterword is read together with fair game,a full and vivid picture of valerie plame wilson emerges.wilson has had no input or involvement in the creation of the afterword,which she has not seen before publication of this book.
id.the afterword purports to describe,among other things,wilson entry into the cia in,see id.at her first foreign assignment to athens,greece,and the diplomatic cover she used on that tour,see id.at and her transition to nonofficial cover in the,during which time she posed as an energy consultant,id.at.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review an award of summary judgment de novo,and we will uphold the judgment if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom it is entered,demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the judgment is warranted as a matter of law.global network commc ns,city of new york,cir.before applying this standard to plaintiffs challenges to the judgment in this case,we outline the legal framework relevant to our analysis 
b.the legal framework relevant to plaintiffs first amendment claim 
cia employees have no first amendment right to disclose properly classified information 
it is a bedrock principle of first amendment jurisprudence that a ny system of prior restraints of expression bear s a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.new york times united states,d quoting bantam books,sullivan,d.the cia requirement that current and former employees obtain agency clearance before disseminating any material related to their employment is not,however,a system of prior restraints in the classic sense.see mcgehee casey,accord john doe,mukasey,cir.
as the supreme court has explained,when a government employee voluntarily assume s a duty of confidentiality,governmental restrictions on disclosure are not subject to the same stringent standards that would apply to efforts to impose restrictions on unwilling members of the public.united states aguilar,d see united states treasury employees union,d congress may impose restraints on the speech of public employees that would be plainly unconstitutional if applied to the public at large.john doe,mukasey,at distinguishing between former cia employees and entities that had no interaction with the government until the government imposed its nondisclosure requirement upon them.indeed,once a government employee signs an agreement not to disclose information properly classified pursuant to executive order,that employee simply has no first amendment right to publish such information stillman cia,see united states pappas,cir the government is entitled to enforce its agreements to maintain the confidentiality of classified information.alfred knopf,colby,cir holding that government employee subject to secrecy agreement has effectively relinquished his first amendment right to publish classified information.
this rule derives principally from snepp united states,d,in which the supreme court rejected a first amendment challenge to the cia enforcement of its secrecy agreement with former employee frank snepp iii,who had published a book about cia activities in south vietnam without submitting his manuscript for agency review.the court affirmed the district court order enjoining future breaches by snepp and imposing a constructive trust on profits already realized from the unauthorized publication,see id.at,concluding not only that snepp secrecy agreement was enforceable as an entirely appropriate exercise of the cia director statutory mandate to protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure,but also that even in the absence of an express cia could have acted to protect substantial government interests by imposing reasonable restrictions on employee activities that in other contexts might be protected by the first amendment,id.at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the court held that t he government has a compelling interest in protecting both the secrecy of information important to our national security and the appearance of confidentiality so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service,and that t he agreement that snepp signed is a reasonable means for protecting this vital interest.see also haig agee,d holding that employee speech intended to expose cia officers and agents is clearly not protected by the constitution.moreover,the court recognized the cia need to maintain a dependable prepublication review procedure in order to ensure in advance that information detrimental to national interest is not published.snepp united states,at.
defendants inability to prevent publication of information that is unclassified or not properly classified 
by contrast,t he government has no legitimate interest in censoring unclassified materials,and,thus,may not censor such material,contractually or otherwise.mcgehee casey,at internal quotation marks omitted see also snepp united states,at.if in fact information is unclassified or in the public domain,neither the cia nor foreign agencies would be concerned.consistent with this principle,cia regulations provide that t he prb will review material proposed for publication or public dissemination solely to determine whether it contains any classified information.agency prepublication review of certain material prepared for public dissemination f emphasis added.
moreover,if the agency censors a manuscript because it contains classified information,the author is entitled to judicial review of that decision to ensure that the information in question is,in fact,properly classified under the standards set forth in the applicable executive order.see mcgehee casey,at holding that agency employee retains a strong first amendment interest in ensuring that cia censorship of his work results from a proper classification of the censored portions united states marchetti,cir noting right to judicial review in this context see also snepp united states,at.observing that cia clearance procedure is subject to judicial review.such judicial review is necessarily deferential because the designation and protection of classified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible.department of navy egan,d.deferential review,however,does not equate to no review.see john doe,mukasey,at citing gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d.a court must satisfy itself from the record,in camera or otherwise,that the cia in fact had good reason to classify,and therefore censor,the materials at issue.mcgehee casey,at.to that end,a court may require that cia explanations justify censorship with reasonable specificity,demonstrating a logical connection between the deleted information and the reasons for classification.see also john doe,mukasey,at,the court task is not to the agency,but simply to ensure that its reasons for classification are rational and plausible ones.mcgehee casey,at 
defendants inability to prevent publication of information that has been officially disclosed by the cia 
finally,the cia can not prevent a former employee from publishing even properly classified information once the agency itself has officially disclosed it.see wolf cia,hudson river sloop clearwater,dep t of navy,cir.although this doctrine was developed in the foia context,the agency does not dispute that it may be invoked to challenge the prb censorship decision here.as the fourth circuit recognized in reviewing such a claim,a former cia agent should not be denied the right to publish information which any citizen could compel the cia to produce and,after production,could publish.alfred knopf,colby,at.
a strict test applies to claims of official disclosure.classified information that a party seeks to obtain or publish is deemed to have been officially disclosed only if it is as specific as the information previously released,match es the information previously disclosed,and was made public through an official and documented disclosure.wolf cia,at internal quotation marks omitted see also hudson river sloop clearwater,dep t of navy,at holding that government may not withhold information under foia exemption when the government has officially disclosed the specific information being sought emphasis in original.
the last factor acknowledges a critical difference between official and unofficial disclosures of information classified by the cia.fitzgibbon cia.as a practical matter,foreign governments can often ignore unofficial disclosures of cia activities that might be viewed as embarrassing or harmful to their interests.see afshar dep t of state.they can not,however,so easily cast a blind eye on official disclosures made by the cia itself,and they may,in fact,feel compelled to retaliate.see id.mindful of this reality,the law will not infer official disclosure of information classified by the cia from widespread public discussion of a classified matter,see wolf cia,at afshar dep t of state,at fitzgibbon cia,at statements made by a person not authorized to speak for the agency,hudson river sloop clearwater,dep t of navy,at or release of information by another agency,or even by congress,see frugone cia,earth pledge found.cia,aff cir.
with these principles in mind,we consider the record in this case.
c.wilson employment history with the cia has not been officially disclosed and remains properly classified 
plaintiffs do not challenge the district court determination that wilson employment history with the cia was,as an original matter,properly classified.see wilson mcconnell,d at appellants reply br.at.in fact,plaintiffs acknowledge that,prior to robert novak july,column,wilson employment affiliation with the cia was highly classified.appellants br.at.moreover,plaintiffs do not contend that novak column,the press reports that followed purporting to describe wilson cia career,or the cia decision to roll back her cover as of january,either declassified wilson status or officially disclosed that information.as the authority cited above makes clear,any such contention would be wholly without merit in any event,as neither press reports nor prior disclosures of information that do not match the information in question can officially disclose properly classified information.wolf cia,at 
instead,plaintiffs and their amici advance two different arguments,based almost exclusively on the cia february letter,to support their claim of a first amendment right to publish wilson dates of service.see appellants reply br.at conceding that absent agency voluntary release of this letter,present lawsuit would have been unwarranted.first,they submit that the february letter,sent by mail without any classification markings,constitutes an official cia disclosure of wilson service dates with the agency.they assert that this disclosure,in turn,proximately caused the public revelation of the letter by inslee.second,plaintiffs and amici argue that,even if this series of events did not officially disclose wilson service dates,the public availability of the letter and the information contained therein deprives the cia of its original justification for maintaining this information as classified,that the unauthorized disclosure of this information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.exec.order,a.at.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
the february letter does not constitute an official disclosure 
plaintiffs official disclosure argument is unpersuasive for two reasons a the february letter to wilson did not constitute a disclosure,and b the letter was not made public by the cia.moreover,we reject plaintiffs contention that the agency is chargeable with official disclosure because,through administrative negligence,it proximately caused public disclosure of the letter by wilson and inslee.
cia transmittal of the letter to wilson does not qualify as a disclosure 
the term disclosure does not reasonably encompass cia transmittal of classified information to a former employee who already knows the information in question,and is contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of classified and classifiable information.the most common meanings of disclose are to open up,to expose to view,and to lay open or uncover something hidden from view.webster third new international dictionary.plainly,wilson dates of service were not something hidden from her.to the extent the word disclose also suggests an open ing up to general knowledge,the transmittal of a letter containing personnel information only to the person referenced hardly demonstrates such a disclosure.finally,although wilson was no longer employed by the agency on february,neither party suggests that wilson was not authorized to receive the letter or the information contained therein.sending her the letter was thus akin to providing classified information to individuals with proper security clearance,which,we have held,can not constitute an official disclosure.hudson river sloop clearwater,dep t of navy,at.
b.the february letter was not made public by the cia 
the official disclosure doctrine applies only when classified information is made public.wolf cia,at.plaintiffs argue that the cia february letter qualifies as a public document under the federal records act,and federal rule of evidence.the letter might be considered a public document in the sense that it was created by a federal agency in connection with the transaction of public business,see also.providing that no extrinsic evidence of authenticity is required to admit domestic public documents not under seal under certain conditions,but this is beside the point.the letter was not public in the sense relevant to the official disclosure doctrine.specifically,the letter was not a matter of public record that could be easily discoverable by any interested member of the public,the twin factors we identified as critical to official disclosure in hudson river sloop clearwater,department of navy,at.the february letter was private correspondence sent wilson at her home.we conclude that such a limited transmittal of classified information to an employee contractually bound to maintain its secrecy does not constitute an official disclosure.
c.wilson decision to permit public release of the letter does not manifest official disclosure by the cia 
in urging us to reach a different conclusion,plaintiffs note that wilson sought the february letter to facilitate inslee legislative efforts on her that would foreseeably involve public disclosure of the letter contents on the floor of congress.the argument is defective in a critical respect plaintiffs adduce no evidence that,prior to transmittal of the february letter to wilson,anyone at the cia was aware that the wilsons were communicating with inslee,much less that they were urging him to introduce legislation on her behalf.
to be sure,the february letter did become a matter of public record when inslee placed it in the congressional record on january.plaintiffs contend that this public disclosure is chargeable to the cia as the equivalent of official disclosure because of the agency admitted negligence in failing to mark the letter as classified or to utilize appropriate procedures for transmitting classified information.see declaration of karen tumolo,senior benefits specialist,opr,cia,at acknowledging that cia neglected to perform classification review of wilson personnel file before sending the letter,and conceding that it was a mistake to mail the improperly marked letter containing classified information to wilson.plaintiffs submit that,in the absence of such markings or procedures,it was reasonably foreseeable to the cia that wilson would conclude that the information contained in the letter was unclassified and that there were no restrictions on its further dissemination,appellants reply br.at and ultimately make the letter public.this argument fails for two reasons.
first,even if we were to assume that when wilson and inslee decided to make the february letter public,they acted in the good that the information contained therein was no longer classified,that would not demonstrate official disclosure by the cia a former employee public disclosure of classified information can not be deemed an official act of the agency.like the retired admiral in hudson river sloop clearwater,wilson,as a retired cia employee,could not effect an official disclosure of information.at emphasis added.the decision to permit the public release of the letter by inslee was indisputably wilson,not the cia.she possessed,in the privacy of her home,the only copy of the letter outside of the agency walls,and it would have remained there but for her decision to send it to inslee,and to give her permission for him to place it in the congressional record.thus,even if agency negligence in transmitting the letter to wilson somehow excuses her actions in allowing inslee to make the classified information public,it can not,as a matter of law,support a finding that her actions and those of inslee effected an official disclosure of classified information by the cia 
second,we decline plaintiffs invitation to rely on the doctrine of proximate cause to conclude that the placement of the february letter into the congressional record is attributable to the cia as the foreseeable result of tumolo negligence in failing properly to mark or send the letter.even assuming that proximate cause could play a part in a determination of official disclosure,the principle can not be applied in this case.
wilson gave inslee permission to publish the cia letter on january.plaintiffs assert that this decision was the natural result of tumolo negligence,as wilson would have to have been a to understand that the information contained in the letter was classified in light of the letter unclassified form.appellants reply br.at appellants br.at.this argument confronts two hurdles executive order,which expressly states that i nformation assigned a level of classification under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings,exec.order,f.at emphasis added and the inquiry obligation imposed by the standard cia secrecy agreement,see supra at.both strongly suggest that even if a former cia employee might point to the lack of proper markings on a document to excuse her own disclosure of classified information,the law should not identify official disclosure in such circumstances on a theory of proximate cause.in any event,we reject plaintiffs proximate cause argument for a more fundamental reason,namely,that it is effectively refuted by the chronological record.
by january,when wilson authorized inslee to include the february letter in the congressional record,she and her attorney had already conducted months of negotiations with the prb over the content of her memoir.during these negotiations,by wilson own account,the prb repeatedly advised her that her status remained classified and could not be publicly disclosed indeed,the central purpose of the letter sent by wilson attorney to the prb on january,three days before wilson gave inslee permission to disclose the to object to the decision of senior agency management not to permit her to disclose her agency affiliation prior to,letter from smallman to wright,at.moreover,the cia position on this point was relayed to wilson personally and at some length in a november meeting.see id.at fair game.thus,even if agency negligence in the transmittal of the february letter could have prompted wilson mistakenly to assume that her dates of service with the cia were no longer classified,that misimpression was plainly corrected during her negotiations with the prb before she gave inslee permission to place the letter into the congressional record.in light of this sequence of events,wilson decision to permit public disclosure of the letter was not the normal or foreseeable consequence of the situation created by the defendant s negligence,but rather an action independent of defendants conduct.becker poling transp,cir quoting derdiarian felix contracting,discussing proximate cause generally.thus,we easily reject as without merit plaintiffs argument that cia negligence could be deemed the proximate cause of inslee public disclosure of wilson dates of service 
in sum,we reject as a matter of law plaintiffs reliance on official agency disclosure as a ground for challenging the award of summary judgment in favor of defendants.
wilson employment status with the cia remains properly classified 
a liberal reading of the briefs filed by plaintiffs and their amici reveals a possible alternative argument in support of wilson claimed first amendment right to publish her employment status.while acknowledging that protecting the secrecy of information important to our national security is a compelling interest that justifies censoring a former agent public statements,snepp united states,at,plaintiffs and their amici submit that where,as here,the information the former agent seeks to discuss is already in the public domain and,thus,no longer secret,that interest is weakened and,indeed,overcome by the former agent strong first amendment right to participate in the free discussion of governmental affairs,buckley valeo,d internal quotation marks omitted.they emphasize that,even if wilson dates of service were correctly classified at the outset and have not been officially disclosed by the cia,the form in which that information is present in the public signed letter from a cia employee in a position to know of the information officially,alfred knopf,colby,at one that leaves little doubt as to the information accuracy and serves clear notice on foreign intelligence services of wilson probable agency affiliation.further,plaintiffs and their amici note that wilson is required by cia regulations to include a disclaimer in her book stating that its contents should not be construed as asserting or implying government authentication of information.see fair game at copyright page.thus,they assert that any discussion by wilson of her employment status would not lend credence to the information already contained in the publicly available february letter,alfred knopf,colby,at nor would her disclosure have the same diplomatic repercussions as an official acknowledgment of that information by the cia,see afshar dep t of state,at.
the precise legal challenge underlying this argument is not clearly stated.nevertheless,we identify two possibilities,neither of which has merit.
a.the minimal harm argument 
plaintiffs argument could be construed to assert that,even if wilson dates of service have not been officially disclosed and remain properly classified,because identical information is already in the public domain,the harm that would result from her discussion of that information is either negligible or nonexistent and the cia interest in preventing such an imperceptible harm is insufficient to overcome her first amendment rights.this argument overlooks a critical fact as a condition of her employment with the cia,wilson signed a contract forever waiving her right to disclose in any form or in any manner information which is classified pursuant to executive order and which i have obtained during the course of my employment or other service with the central intelligence agency.cia form secrecy agreement.this contract is binding and enforceable.see,snepp united states,at united states pappas,at alfred knopf,colby,at.
wilson,of course,could have refused to sign a secrecy agreement with the cia,but then s he would not have been employed,and s he would not have been given access to the classified information s he may now want to broadcast.united states marchetti,at.having chosen to sign the required secrecy agreement,and not having received a release from her obligations thereunder,see cia form secrecy agreement,wilson remains bound by its terms,which do not include an exception permitting her to discuss information that remains classified provided that little or no harm would result.no different conclusion is warranted by the fact that wilson is obliged to disclaim in her memoir any cia authentication of facts discussed therein 
b.the continued classification argument 
plaintiffs and their amici might also be understood to challenge the cia continued classification of wilson dates of service on the ground that no further harm can come from discussion of these facts in light of the public availability of the february letter.see generally exec.order.at providing that information may only be classified if,inter alia,the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security,and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.as we noted supra at,when the propriety of a classification is challenged,a court appropriately reviews the record,in camera or otherwise,to ensure that the cia has good reason to classify,and therefore censor,the materials at issue,and that the agency has,with reasonable specificity,demonstrat ed a logical connection between the deleted information and the reasons for classification,mcgehee casey,at see also john doe,mukasey,at.
to the extent plaintiffs do not contest the agency initial classification of wilson dates of service,but only its decision to maintain that information as classified,defendants note that an administrative procedure is available to pursue declassification first with the cia and,if unsuccessful,on appeal to the interagency security classification appeals panel.see exec.order.at,see alfred knopf,colby,at discussing predecessor order see also exec.order.at permitting classification challenges by a uthorized holders of information a defining authorized holders to include individual s external to the agency,who ha ve been granted access to specific classified information in accordance with the provisions of the applicable executive order.this appeals panel consists of representatives of the departments of state,defense,and justice,the cia,the national archives,and the president assistant for national security affairs.see exec.order,a.at.thus,as the fourth circuit has observed,this panel members likely have a better background than any judge for making classification and declassification decisions.alfred knopf,colby,at.we need not,however,here decide a question not specifically briefed by the parties,whether a former cia employee should be required to pursue this administrative option before challenging the propriety of continued classification in a federal court action.we conclude that,in any event,plaintiffs continuing classification challenge is without merit.
in determining whether the cia still has good reason to classify wilson dates of service,we note that the agency underlying concern is not limited to the simple disclosure of a few dates.if wilson were to state in her memoir,i was a cia operative from date x,then any discussion of her activities after that date,whether by wilson or others,would necessarily reveal cia sources and methods,information that lies at the heart of all intelligence operations.cia sims,d for this reason,the supreme court has recognized the cia authority to preclude disclosure of even superficially innocuous information when it might facilitate the discovery of more sensitive matters.id.at.see also larson dep t of state,recognizing that seemingly trivial details may be of great significance to foreign intelligence services with a broad view of the intelligence landscape in their attempts to discover and thwart cia methods.indeed,the cia explained this precise concern to wilson in,observing that her disclosure of the specific time of her cia employment,when combined with other information in her memoir that may be unclassified standing alone,could reveal sources and methods of agency intelligence operations.letter from prb chairman puhl to wilson,at.accordingly,we must assess the impact of wilson proposed discussion of her dates of service not in isolation,but also with regard to what secrets those facts could divulge when viewed in light of other information available to interested observers.berman cia,cir 
plaintiffs do not disagree that wilson dates of service should be viewed in this broader context.rather,plaintiffs contend that whatever injury to our national security the cia could legitimately fear from the disclosure of wilson dates of service was sustained when the february letter became public.thereafter,continued classification is no longer reasonable.we are not convinced.
plaintiffs argument is at odds with section b of executive order,which provides that classified information is not declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information.at.to the extent plaintiffs suggest that this provision does not apply because tumolo transmittal of the february letter was authorized,we reiterate that this transmittal did not effect the public disclosure of the letter.that action was taken by wilson herself when she gave inslee the letter and her permission for its public release.see supra at.moreover,even if wilson actions could be attributed to a bona fide misunderstanding,we hold that a former agent can not use her own unauthorized disclosure of classified information as a springboard for challenging the cia ability to maintain that information as classified.see generally alfred knopf,colby,at holding that party who leaks information can not use such disclosure to claim right openly to discuss that information 
even putting aside wilson role in the public disclosure of the letter,however,her challenge to the continued classification of her dates of service is unavailing.to be sure,the february letter,written on cia letterhead and signed by an official from the agency personnel department,appears more reliable as evidence of wilson prior cia affiliation than the sort of public speculation generally dismissed in the case law.afshar dep t of state,at.nevertheless,a bureaucratic transmittal from the cia personnel department to a former employee is hardly akin to the cia director personally reading relevant information into the congressional record,as took place in wolf cia,at.the distinction is not only that the latter act constituted an official disclosure,see,but also that anything short of such a disclosure necessarily preserves some increment of doubt regarding the reliability of the publicly available information the cia refusal to permit the elimination of that remaining doubt with respect to wilson service itself protects valuable information,namely,the accuracy of the facts stated in the february letter and whether there is anything left to hide on the subject.see phillippi cia,there may be much left to hide,and if there is not,that itself may be worth hiding.we decline to discount the importance of such lingering doubts to maintaining the secrecy of cia sources and methods relating to unconfirmed periods of wilson agency service,military audit project casey,and to preserving the options of deniability and professed ignorance that remain important niceties of international relations,see afshar dep t of state,at see also snepp united states,at.recognizing government compelling interest in protecting the appearance of confidentiality so essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service.
having determined that defendants could demonstrate that wilson dates of service should remain classified,the question remains,of course,whether they have done so here with the specificity necessary to confirm the rationality of their decision.see mcgehee casey,at.in short,does the agency have good reason to conclude that full disclosure of wilson employment history reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security exec.order,a.at.we have reviewed defendants unclassified submissions as well objection by the classified materials provided to the court ex parte,and we conclude,as the district court did,that defendants have met their burden.
our discussion of the classified facts in this opinion is necessarily circumspect.nevertheless,we conclude from these facts that plaintiffs disclosure of the information presently censored by the cia would do more than reveal dates of service.it would facilitate the identification of particular intelligence sources and methods,thereby compromising the agency ability to use such sources and methods in the future.that the cia views these risks as real and substantial is demonstrated by the significant actions already taken by the agency and described in the classified submission.in sum,the cia has advanced good reason to maintain any agency service by wilson as classified and to prevent the inclusion of such information in her memoir.mcgehee casey,at.the cia having provided rational and plausible reasons for continued classification,our review obligations are satisfied,and we will not further agency judgment,see john doe,mukasey,at.
because we reject plaintiffs argument that no good reason supports the cia maintenance of wilson dates of agency service as classified,and because we have already determined that this information has not been officially disclosed by the cia,we necessarily conclude that plaintiffs first amendment challenge to defendants redactions to fair game fails as a matter of law.every other current and former agency employee who has signed a secrecy agreement simply has no first amendment right to publish the information here at issue,regardless of how public her past activities appear to have become.stillman cia,at.
the fact that others,not subject to such a secrecy obligation,are free to investigate wilson past and to compile and discuss all available information regarding her the february not,as plaintiffs insist,an absurd or anomalous result.the law has long distinguished between strangers,who may republish previously published material,and former intelligence agents,who are bound by formal agreements not to disclose classified information.alfred knopf,colby,at.as noted,when wilson elected to serve with the cia,she accepted a restriction on her ability to disclose classified and classifiable information.that wilson service may have been cut short by the failure of others to respect the classified status of her employment may well have warranted investigation.but these circumstances do not absolve wilson of her own secrecy obligations.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,because any dates of service by valerie plame wilson with the cia have not been officially disclosed by the agency and remain properly classified,and because wilson is obligated by a secrecy agreement with the cia not to disclose classified information,neither wilson nor the publisher of her memoir can assert a first amendment right to publish that information.accordingly,the district court award of summary judgment in favor of defendants is affirmed.
i agree with the majority that wilson dates of service,if any,were originally properly classified by the cia,have never been officially declassified,and were never officially disclosed by the cia.therefore,i also agree that this court has no power to free wilson from the secrecy agreement that she signed upon commencement of her employment with the cia.at the same time,i write to observe that the cia position in this litigation blinks reality in light of the unique facts of this case and the policies behind the doctrines at issue here.indeed,the cia litigation posture may very well be counterproductive to its purposes.
if the february,letter on cia letterhead had not surfaced in the congressional record february letter,and we were merely faced with the question of whether wilson should be permitted to disclose her possible service dates,despite the fact that they were already the subject of widespread media reports,the answer would clearly be no.the same would be true if the question was,even given the publication of the february letter,whether the cia should be forced to officially acknowledge any of wilson possible dates of service.however,that is not this case.
as it appeared in the congressional record,the february letter stated the following 
dear wilson,this letter is in response to your recent telephone conversation with regarding sic when you would be eligible to receive your deferred annuity.per federal statute,employees who have acquired a minimum of years of service,are eligible to receive their deferred annuity at their minimum retirement age 
following is a list of your federal service 
dates of service cia from to years,days.
please let me know if i can be of any further assistance.

further,in connection to this litigation,karen tumolo submitted an unclassified,public declaration attesting to the fact that she signed the february letter to valerie wilson at the time she signed the letter she was the chief of retirement and insurance services at the cia,responsible for managing the cia retirement and insurance benefits programs and,in the ordinary course,in responding to a request such as wilson for information on retirement annuity eligibility,her office would verify that the employee status was not classified.however,her declaration further stated,acknowledging the agency negligence,that t he employees in my office neglected to perform such a classification review of wilson personnel file.as a consequence,the summary of wilson service was not properly marked to indicate that the information was classified.see declaration of karen tumolo,senior benefits specialist,office of personnel resources,directorate of support,central intelligence agency.
relevant case law,developed largely in the context of the freedom of information act,has focused on the harm that could come to national security from an official cia disclosure of information that has already entered the public domain.three general concerns have been identified the benefits that come to the cia from plausible deniability the possibility of foreign retaliation and the effect on the cia capabilities,both in terms of intelligence sources and intelligence methods 
the cia and the majority rely on all three of these concerns in this case.the majority discusses plausible deniability and cia deputy director stephen kappes convincingly explains,both in his classified and unclassified declarations,what harm will come to national security,in terms of foreign retaliation and the effect on the cia capabilities,if wilson service dates,if any,are officially acknowledged by the cia kappes reasons are detailed,rational,and plausible on their face indeed they are compelling.see,mcgehee casey.
however,wilson is not asking the cia to officially acknowledge her possible dates of service.the purpose of kappes classified and unclassified declarations was to describe the harm to national security that would result from the cia officially acknowledging the information contained in the february letter.see declaration of stephen kappes,deputy director,central intelligence agency kappes decl.the purpose of this declaration is to describe the serious damage to the national security that reasonably could be expected to result if certain information in the february letter is officially acknowledged by the cia.classified in camera,ex parte declaration of stephen kappes,deputy director,central intelligence agency,secret,dated july,unclassified paragraph the purpose of this declaration is to describe the classified information that would be revealed if the cia acknowledged whether wilson was employed by the cia prior to january.i also describe in greater detail the serious damage to the national security that reasonably could be expected to result if the cia acknowledges the classified information in the february letter.yet the declarations do not address why publication of wilson memoir would be an official acknowledgment by the cia.
moreover,despite the publication of the february letter on cia letterhead in the congressional record,the declarations make no effort to explain how the harms described would be likely to result from the publication of wilson book,instead of,or in addition to,the publication of the february letter itself.instead,the declarations ignore the february letter entirely.while it is inherently plausible that a foreign government could learn of an official cia acknowledgment and conclude that the cia is not trustworthy,thereby causing harm to our national security,see kappes decl,it is not inherently plausible that a foreign government would consider wilson book,rather than the february letter coupled with tumolo public declaration submitted in connection with this case,to be an official acknowledgment by the cia.indeed,courts agree that books published by former cia agents are not official cia disclosures.see,afshar dep t of state,plaintiff points first to a number of books by former cia agents and officials,all of which were submitted to the agency for prepublication review n one of the books is an official and documented disclosure,as the release of cia cables would be.yet the cia ignores this issue,and,in doing so,assumes away a crucial component in this case.
finally,if there is some increment of doubt regarding the reliability of the february letter,despite the fact that the cia submitted a sworn,unclassified,public declaration from the letter author stating that the letter had been prepared in the ordinary course of business but was inadvertently not subjected to the normal classification review,it is unclear why the publication of wilson personal memoir would somehow erase that doubt and authoritatively establish the accuracy of the facts contained in the letter.if anything,tumolo,and not wilson,is the official of the united states in a position to know of what s he spoke.see alfred knopf,colby,at,cir it is one thing for a reporter or author to speculate or guess that a thing may be so or even,quoting undisclosed sources,to say that it is so it is quite another thing for one in a position to know of it officially to say that it is so.the reading public is accustomed to treating reports from uncertain sources as being of uncertain reliability,but it would not be inclined to discredit reports of sensitive information revealed by an official of the united states in a position to know of what he spoke.
indeed,the cia position in this litigation,set forth in unclassified,publicly filed court documents,has served only to give credence to the perception that the february letter accurately set forth wilson dates of service.senator daniel patrick moynihan,a student of secrecy,believed that the obvious need to protect legitimate secrets is undermined when agencies proceed reflexively without a fully reasoned assessment of the likely consequences of positions contemplated.see daniel patrick moynihan,secrecy,with a new preface by the author.this may have been such a case.
all references in this opinion to wilson possible agency affiliation are hypothetical and should not be understood to confirm or deny any information on that subject.
our concurring colleague,judge katzmann,agrees with us that wilson dates of service,if any,were originally properly classified by the cia,have never been officially declassified,and were never officially disclosed by the cia.post at.he also agree s that this court has no power to free wilson from the secrecy agreement that she signed upon commencement of her employment with the cia.id.nevertheless,he faults the cia litigation posture in this case for blink ing the reality of the unique facts of this case and the policies behind the doctrines at issue here.skepticism about the wisdom of a party litigation strategy can not,of course,prompt any different decision than that required by law.in any event,as we explain in this opinion,the factual background to this case hardly casts plaintiffs argument in a favorable light.while the cia negligence appears to have caused classified information about wilson service dates to be disclosed outside the agency,that disclosure was only to wilson,a person authorized to receive it.it was wilson herself who proceeded,without authorization,to approve public disclosure of the classified information.for the reasons stated herein,we hold that a former cia agent can not use her own unauthorized disclosure of classified information to challenge the agency ability to maintain the information as classified.see infra at.further,though wilson unauthorized action may have reduced the policy reasons for maintaining the challenged classification of her service dates,the agency classified submission demonstrates that,in the context of wilson memoir,sufficient reasons for continued classification persist to preclude a judicial reversal of agency judgment.see infra at.

the court record does not reflect with which legal experts inslee consulted prior to introducing the letter into the congressional record.the court record likewise does not reflect whether inslee consulted with the cia regarding the status of the information contained in the letter.

we note at the outset that defendants contend,somewhat halfheartedly,that the publication of wilson book renders this action moot.insofar as the book was published with the cia redactions,and plaintiffs represent that they will publish a revised,unredacted version of the book if they prevail here,defendants contention is rejected as without merit.
as explained in department of navy egan,d since world war i,the executive branch has engaged in efforts to protect national security information by means of a classification system graded according to sensitivity.after world war ii,certain civilian agencies,including the central intelligence agency,the national security agency,and the atomic energy commission,were entrusted with gathering,protecting,or creating information bearing on national security.presidents,in a series of executive orders,have sought to protect sensitive information and to ensure its proper classification throughout the executive branch by delegating this responsibility to the heads of.at.see generally daniel patrick moynihan et,report of the commission on protecting and reducing government secrecy,doc.no,app.a secrecy a brief account of the american experience harold relyea,cong.research,security classified and controlled information history,status and emerging management issues reviewing history of classification system.presidential authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security flows primarily from article ii,section of the constitution and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.department of navy egan,at.see also jennifer elsea,cong.research,the protection of classified information the legal framework discussing relatively limited congressional intervention in information classification moynihan et,report of the commission on protecting and reducing government secrecy discussing lack of statutory basis for classification regime.the procedure for classifying and declassifying information is currently governed by executive order.

john doe,mukasey addressed the constitutionality of statutes authorizing the fbi to prohibit communication service providers from disclosing receipt of national security letters upon certification by senior fbi officials that disclosure may result in danger to the national security,interference with a criminal,counterterrorism,or counterintelligence investigation,interference with diplomatic relations,or danger to the life or physical safety of any person.c see john doe,mukasey,at.by statute,congress empowered federal courts to modify or set aside a nondisclosure requirement if it found no reason to support the certification.b see john doe,mukasey,at.citing mcgehee casey,at,we accepted the government position that reason in the quoted phrase means good reason.john doe,mukasey,at.furthermore,echoing the standards outlined above,we required the government at least to indicate the nature of the apprehended harm and provide a court with some basis to assure itself based on in camera presentations where appropriate that the link between disclosure and risk of harm is substantial.id.at.
a similar standard applies in the foia context,see halpern fbi,cir,in which district courts are authorized to undertake de novo review of an agency decision to withhold records under one of the statute exemptions,including the exemption for properly classified information,see a b.likewise,when reviewing the government invocation of the privilege,the district court must be satisf ied from all the circumstances of the case that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.doe cia,cir quoting united states reynolds.
we reject on similar grounds plaintiffs for the first time on rebuttal at oral the reference to executive order in the,partially redacted version of wilson secrecy agreement officially disclosed the fact of her cia employment sometime before october,the date on which that order was revoked.see exec.order,revoking exec.order.this stray reference to an executive order is neither as specific as the information wilson seeks to publish,nor does it match that information.wolf cia,at.moreover,as defendants note,the secrecy agreement refers not simply to executive order,but to executive order as amended or superseded,or other applicable executive order.cia form secrecy agreement.
such an assumption requires overlooking at least two issues.first,wilson secrecy agreement with the cia placed the burden upon her to learn whether information or materials within her control are considered by the cia to be classified or classifiable,and whom the agency has authorized to receive it.cia form secrecy agreement.defendants did not assert in the district court that wilson violated the secrecy agreement in providing the february letter to inslee or in approving its public disclosure.we therefore do not address that possibility here.we note simply that,were a factfinder to conclude that wilson had violated her secrecy agreement in this manner,her claim would most certainly fail because a public official in a confidential relationship surely may not leak information in violation of the confidence reposed in him and use the resulting publication as legitimating his own subsequent open and public disclosure of the same information.alfred knopf,colby,at.second,the record indicates that wilson was speaking openly about the longevity of her cia service prior to her receipt of the letter in february.in exchanges in november months before she received the february.wilson and inslee chief of staff frankly discussed her total years of service with the cia,information that,plaintiffs concede,was then classified.see from bonlender to wilson,attachment at,stating in draft legislation that i n january,valerie plame wilson will have been employed by the cia for years and will be years of age from wilson to bonlender,stating years of service wilson would have when she resigned on january.we do not rely on this point,however,as the record does not indicate whether bonlender was properly authorized to receive this information.
the agency review process is,in fact,designed to avoid the sort of problems that can arise when former agents attempt to resolve for themselves any ambiguities in the classification status of certain information.see generally snepp united states,at.when a former agent relies on his own judgment about what information is detrimental,he may reveal information that the its broader understanding of what may expose classified information and confidential have identified as harmful.
plaintiffs are therefore mistaken when they state when wilson submitted the manuscript of her memoir for the required review,cia sought to prohibit her from republishing the identical information describing her dates of federal service that had entered the public domain through the legislative process.appellants br.at emphasis added.at the time wilson submitted her memoir to the first section in july,and the full manuscript in september introduction of the february letter into the congressional record was still several months away.
in light of this conclusion,we need not here decide whether,as defendants maintain,official disclosure requires a demonstration of specific agency intent at a high executive level.see alfred knopf,colby,at noting that prior official disclosures were the result of high level executive decisions that disclosure was in the public interest.
the prb regulations provide for the agency to consider the extent to which classified information has otherwise entered the public domain in reviewing publication requests by employees subject to secrecy agreements when otherwise classified information is also available independently in open sources and can be cited by the author,the prb will consider that fact in making its determination on whether that information may be published with the appropriate citations.nevertheless,the agency retains the right to disallow certain information or citations where,because of the author agency affiliation or position,the reference might confirm the classified prepublication review of certain material prepared for public dissemination f.
as the court observed at oral argument,the agency concern is,that if it known that wilson was a cia operative from date x rather than date y,and you then knew that she had been a butcher,a baker,or a candlestick maker during that period,that would disclose to those interested in finding out that the cia placed people in those positions,that she in particular,in dealing with people was a cia operative and not what she appeared to be t hat the concern arg.tr.at.
wilson cogently made a similar point to congress in describing the damage caused by the initial disclosure of her cia affiliation in the media the cia goes to great lengths to protect all of its employees,providing at significant taxpayer expense painstakingly devised covers for its most sensitive staffers.the harm that is done when a cia cover is blown is grave,but i ca provide details beyond that in this public hearing.but the concept is obvious.not only have breaches of national security endangered cia officers,it has jeopardized and even destroyed entire networks of foreign agents who,in turn,risk their own lives and those of their families to provide the united states with needed intelligence.lives are literally at house procedures for safeguarding classified information hearing before the comm.on oversight government reform,cong.statement of valerie plame wilson.
in these circumstances,we can not agree with our concurring colleague that the cia must explain how the harms described would be likely to result from the publication of wilson book,instead of,or in addit
