william sorrell,attorney general of the state of vermont,and john kassel,secretary of the vermont agency of natural resources vermont defendants,appeal from a preliminary injunction imposed by the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,chief district judge barring enforcement of a vermont labeling statute as it applies to manufacturers of light bulbs.because we find that national electrical manufacturers association nema failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of its commerce clause and first amendment claims,we vacate the preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,the vermont legislature enacted a statute.stat.ann.tit,a,that requires manufacturers of some products to label their products and packaging to inform consumers that the products contain mercury and,on disposal,should be recycled or disposed of as hazardous waste among the products so regulated are flourescent light bulbs,denominated as lamps in subsection of section a.the vermont agency of natural resources has promulgated a rule to implement the labeling requirement.see.
on july,nema,on behalf of its members,sued the vermont defendants claiming,among other things,that both the statute and its underlying regulations violate nema members rights under the united states constitution commerce clause and first amendment.following an extended hearing,the district court,on november,preliminarily enjoined the defendants from enforcing section a and its accompanying regulations,finding that nema had demonstrated irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits.mfrs.ass sorrell,d,hereinafter nema.according to the district court,nema was irreparably harmed because if nema ultimately prevailed,the state defendants would be shielded by the eleventh amendment from damages claims,and thus nema members could not recover money spent to comply with the statute,and the statute infringed nema first amendment rights by forcing its members to speak.id.at.
the district court determined that nema had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its commerce clause claim because the statute burdens outweighed its benefits,and as a practical matter,vermont was regulating conduct that would occur entirely beyond its borders.id.at.the district court also found that vermont was unable to justify the labeling law under the first amendment.id.at.
the vermont defendants appealed.the state of new york filed an amicus brief in support of the appeal,joined by the states of alaska,california,connecticut,maine,minnesota,new hampshire,new jersey,new mexico,and oklahoma.
discussion 
insofar as pertinent to our disposition,the vermont defendants argue in support of section a that,in finding a likelihood of success on the merits,the district court erred by applying heightened scrutiny under the commerce clause to a nondiscriminatory statute and balancing a hypothetical label against hypothetical costs,and by applying heightened scrutiny to the first amendment compelled speech claim.the amici argued in addition that the labeling law was authorized by congress in the federal hazardous waste management statute,the resource conservation and recovery act,and thus the state statute is not vulnerable to challenge under the commerce clause.because we conclude that nema has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its commerce clause and first amendment claims,we vacate the injunction.
commerce clause 
a statute may violate the dormant aspect of the commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,in one of two ways it may clearly discriminate against interstate commerce,in which case it is virtually invalid per se,see wyoming oklahoma,d,or even if it does not evince such discriminatory effect,it may still be unconstitutional if it imposes a burden on interstate commerce incommensurate with the local benefits secured,see pike bruce church,d.nema argues that section violates the commerce clause in the latter manner.we disagree and thus conclude that nema can not show likely success on the merits of its commerce clause claim.
in pike,the supreme court adopted a balancing test to determine whether state statutes that incidentally burden interstate commerce violate the commerce clause.the court held that 
w here the statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
id.citations omitted.for a state statute to run afoul of the pike standard,the statute,at a minimum,must impose a burden on interstate commerce that is qualitatively or quantitatively different from that imposed on intrastate commerce.see automated salvage,wheelabrator envtl,cir gary peake excavating town bd.of town of hancock,cir quoting state trawlers ass jorling,cir usa recycling,town of babylon,cir see also pac.northwest venison producers smitch,cir old bridge,dep t of envtl,cir k s pharmacies,am.home prods,cir.under pike,if no such unequal burden be shown,a reviewing court need not proceed further.
the focus of our disparate burden analysis is a state shifting the costs of regulation to other states.see state highway dep t barnwell.state regulations affecting interstate commerce,whose purpose or effect is to gain for those within the state an advantage at the expense of those without,or to burden those out of the state without any corresponding advantage to those within,have been thought to impinge upon the constitutional prohibition even though congress has not acted.see also ronald rotunda john nowak,treatise on constitutional law substance and procedure,at ed laurence tribe,american constitutional law,at ed.such circumstances raise the risk that state policymakers will not bear the true political costs of their decisions,because those costs will fall in some measure on the residents of other political jurisdictions.see pac.arizona.t he court has often recognized that to the extent that the burden of state regulation falls on interests outside the state,it is unlikely to be alleviated by the operation of those political restraints normally exerted when interests within the state are affected.state highway dep t,at.accordingly,the justification for judicial intervention in the absence of congressional action may outweigh the strong tradition of judicial deference to legislative decisions,see rotunda nowak,supra,tribe,supra,at,and the strain on judicial competence imposed by comprehensive balancing,cts dynamics of,d scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment stating that such a balancing inquiry is ill suited to the judicial function and should be undertaken rarely if at all.
while several types of burdens on interstate commerce would qualify as disparate to trigger pike balancing,see,pac.northwest venison producers,at,nema cites two in particular in this case control of commerce that occurs wholly beyond the state borders and risk of imposing regulatory requirements inconsistent with those of other states.regulations that fall into the first category may be said to have extraterritorial operation,while those in the second may be said to create interstate regulatory conflicts.
extraterritoriality.
a regulation may disproportionately burden interstate commerce if it has the practical effect of requiring commerce to be conducted at the regulating state direction.see,healy beer,d distillers state liquor,d.healy and distillers involved efforts by a state to control the prices at which goods are sold in the state by pegging them to the lowest price charged for the same goods in other states.the effect of those statutes on commerce in foreign states was inescapable they necessarily require d commerce to be conducted according to terms.cotto waxo williams,cir.
given the manufacturing and distribution systems used by its members,nema argues that,if its members continue selling in vermont,they would also be forced as a practical matter to label lamps sold in every other state.the district court agreed and concluded that vermont was presuming to legislate outside its own boundaries.nema,d at.we disagree.
nema extraterritoriality contention fails because the statute does not inescapably require manufacturers to label all lamps wherever distributed.the vermont statute,by its terms,is indifferent to whether lamps sold anywhere else in the united states are labeled or not.see,cotto waxo,at.unlike the restrictions involved in the supreme court cases,the statute here makes no mention of other states for any purpose.see.stat.ann.tit,a.to the extent the statute may be said to require labels on lamps sold outside vermont,then,it is only because the manufacturers are unwilling to modify their production and distribution systems to differentiate between and lamps.
to avoid the statute alleged impact on other states,lamp manufacturers could arrange their production and distribution processes to produce labeled lamps solely for the vermont market and then pass much of the increased costs along to vermont consumers in the form of higher prices.this fact distinguishes the present case from the supreme court price regulation cases.in cases like healy,the state necessarily prevented firms from recouping any of the costs imposed by the state statute from the residents of the state itself.here,the manufacturers remain free to charge higher prices only to vermonters without risking violation of the statute.
to be sure,manufacturers will rarely be able to fully pass through to consumers the costs of a new tax or regulation.a lamp manufacturer ability to pass costs along depends on the price elasticity of demand for lamps the more responsive demand is to changes in price,the more added costs the manufacturer will be forced to absorb.but that manufacturers must bear some of the costs of the vermont regulation in the form of lower profits does not cause the statute to violate the commerce clause.such a burden is simply attributable to legitimate intrastate regulation.the manufacturers are not required to adhere to the vermont rule in other states.
it is possible,as the district court suggested,that the cost of labeling lamps solely for the vermont market might cause them to be prohibitively expensive.see nema,d at.in other words,the demand for lamps in vermont may be such that their increased price would so severely reduce consumption that the lamps could no longer be sold profitably in vermont.in that event,lamp manufacturers might be compelled by economic necessity to withdraw from the vermont market altogether 
nema lament that vermont labeling requirement violates the commerce clause because it effectively forces manufacturers not to sell lamps in vermont is nonetheless unpersuasive for three reasons.first,it is axiomatic that the increased cost of complying with a regulation may drive up the sales price of the product and thus erode demand for the product such that production becomes unprofitable.consequently,any regulation may drive some or all producers or distributors from the regulating state.but in every such case,a decision to abandon the state market rests entirely with individual manufacturers based on the opportunity cost of capital,their individual production costs,and what the demand in the state will bear.because none of these variables is controlled by the state in this case,we can not say that the choice to stay or leave has been made for manufacturers by the state legislature,as the commerce clause would prohibit.although a regulation might violate the commerce clause by creating market incentives that encourage manufacturers to abandon a state market while encouraging manufacturers to pick up the slack,the instant regulation is evenhanded such that lamp producers both inside and outside vermont would face the same putative need to develop separate production and distribution systems to accommodate simultaneously the vermont market and other state markets.
second,the manufacturers choice to discontinue vermont sales would not amount to a special,disproportionate injury to interstate commerce of the sort required by our precedents.if lamp manufacturers were to withdraw from the vermont market,only vermont residents would feel any appreciable effect,in the lost utility of bulbs.any loss felt by residents of other states would be minor by comparison.
the considerations here are quite different from those in cases cited by nema that involve state restrictions on interstate transporters.see,raymond motor,rice,d bibb navajo freight lines,d pac,at.transporters forced either to abide by state rules or avoid the state entirely would necessarily be impeded,if they chose the latter course,in their efforts to conduct commerce with the surrounding states because they would be unable to pass through the regulating state.that sort of distinct interstate burden is not presented in this case,however.
finally,nema directs to the wrong forum its complaint that manufacturers will choose not to sell in vermont.the risk that the labeling requirement would erode manufacturers profits and thus encourage them to abandon the state is an appropriate consideration for the vermont legislature,not the federal courts.whether the unavailability of lamps in the state redounds to the benefit of state residents is a question that the political branches of the state of vermont were entitled to decide.see exxon,at.it may be true that the consuming public will be injured by the effect of the challenged regulation,but again that argument relates to the wisdom of the statute,not to its burden on commerce.paint coatings ass city of chicago,cir noting that the commerce clause does not protect the citizens of a state against the questionable wisdom of decisions made by their own lawmakers.
interstate regulatory conflicts.
nema also contends that the statute burdens interstate commerce by exposing its members to the possibility of multiple,inconsistent labeling requirements imposed by other states.a state regulation might impose a disproportionate burden on interstate commerce if the regulation is in substantial conflict with a common regulatory scheme in place in other states.see raymond motor,at.bibb,at.silver woolf,cir.but donald regan,siamese essays i cts dynamics of america and dormant commerce doctrine ii extraterritorial state legislation,suggesting that inconsistent regulation as a dormant commerce clause problem may be limited to transportation cases.it is not enough to point to a risk of conflicting regulatory regimes in multiple states there must be an actual conflict between the challenged regulation and those in place in other states.see silver,at see also c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d,concurring this is not a hypothetical inquiry.procter gamble city of chicago,cir the supreme court has indicated that in a case involving environmental legislation it is actual conflict,not potential conflict,that is relevant.
no such conflict has been shown here.nema concedes that no other state even regulates the labeling of bulbs,much less does so in conflict with vermont approach.indeed,there is record evidence that the vermont statute is consistent with regimes under consideration by other states.while the scope of conflict required to state a dormant commerce clause claim is somewhat unclear,it is clear that the present case involves no conflict whatsoever.
additional considerations.
were we to adopt nema theory of the commerce clause,we would constitutionalize policy choices legitimately in the hands of congress.whatever the policy reasons may be in support of a nationally uniform regulatory framework for products,such a framework is not compelled by the commerce clause.the idea that there is a general interest in regulatory uniformity is inconsistent with our society decision to have separate states with separate legislative competencies,including separate competences to regulate commerce.regan,supra,at.such policy considerations appropriately rest with congre
