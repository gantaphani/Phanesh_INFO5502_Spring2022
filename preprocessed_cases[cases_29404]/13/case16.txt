new york general business law provides that n o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.petitioners,five new york businesses and their owners who wish to impose surcharges for credit card use,filed suit against state officials,arguing that the law violates the first amendment by regulating how they communicate their prices,and that it is unconstitutionally vague.the district court ruled in favor of the merchants,but the court of appeals vacated the judgment with instructions to dismiss.the court of appeals concluded that in the context of pricing where merchants post one price and would like to charge more to customers who pay by credit card the law required that the sticker price be the same as the price charged to credit card users.in that context,the law regulated a relationship between two prices.relying on this court precedent holding that price regulation alone regulates conduct,not speech,the court of appeals concluded that did not violate the first amendment.the court of appeals abstained from reaching the merits of the constitutional challenge to pricing practices outside the context.
this court review is limited to whether is unconstitutional as applied to the particular pricing scheme that,before this court,petitioners have argued they seek to employ a regime,in which merchants post a cash price and an additional credit card surcharge.
section prohibits the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ.section does not define surcharge.relying on the term ordinary meaning,the court of appeals concluded that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he posts a single sticker price and charges a credit card user more than that sticker price.this court generally accord s great deference to the interpretation and application of state law by the courts of appeals.pembaur cincinnati.because the interpretation of the court of appeals is not clearly wrong,brockett spokane arcades,this court follows that interpretation.
section regulates speech.the court of appeals concluded that posed no first amendment problem because price controls regulate conduct,not speech.section,however,is not like a typical price regulation,which simply regulates the amount a store can collect.the law tells merchants nothing about the amount they are allowed to collect from a cash or credit card payer.instead,it regulates how sellers may communicate their prices.in regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves,regulates speech.
because the court of appeals concluded otherwise,it did not determine whether survives first amendment scrutiny.on remand the court of appeals should analyze as a speech regulation.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
each time a customer pays for an item with a credit card,the merchant selling that item must pay a transaction fee to the credit card issuer.some merchants balk at paying the fees and want to discourage the use of credit cards,or at least pass on the fees to customers who use them.one method of achieving those ends is through differential pricing charging credit card users more than customers using cash.merchants who wish to employ differential pricing may do so in two ways relevant here impose a surcharge for the use of a credit card,or offer a discount for the use of cash.in bus.law,new york has banned the former practice.the question presented is whether regulates merchants speech and if so whether the statute violates the first amendment.we conclude that does regulate speech and remand for the court of appeals to determine in the first instance whether that regulation is unconstitutional.
when credit cards were first introduced,contracts between card issuers and merchants barred merchants from charging credit card users higher prices than cash customers.congress put a partial stop to this practice in the amendments to the truth in lending act tila.the amendments prohibited card issuers from contractually preventing merchants from giving discounts to customers who paid in cash.see,stat.the law,however,said nothing about surcharges for the use of credit.
two years later,congress refined its dissimilar treatment of discounts and surcharges.first,the version of tila barred merchants from imposing surcharges on customers who use credit cards.act of,c,stat.second,congress added definitions of the two terms.a discount was a reduction made from the regular price,while a surcharge was any means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash,check,or similar means.a,ibid.
in,congress further delineated the distinction between discounts and surcharges by defining regular price.where a merchant tagged or posted a single price,the regular price was that single price.cash discount act,a,stat.if no price was tagged or posted,or if a merchant employed a approach posting one price for credit and another for cash the regular price was whatever was charged to credit card users.ibid.because a surcharge was defined as an increase from the regular price,there could be no credit card surcharge where the regular price was the same as the amount charged to customers using credit cards.the effect of all this was that a merchant could violate the surcharge ban only by posting a single price and charging credit card users more than that posted price.
the federal surcharge ban was short lived.congress allowed it to expire in and has not renewed the ban since.see,ibid.the provision preventing credit card issuers from contractually barring discounts for cash,however,remained in place.with the lapse of the federal surcharge ban,several states,new york among them,immediately enacted their own surcharge bans.passed in,bus.law adopted the operative language of the federal ban verbatim,providing that n o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.bus.law ann.west see also a ed.unlike the federal ban,the new york legislation included no definition of surcharge.
in addition to these state legislative bans,credit card companies though barred from prohibiting discounts for cash included provisions in their contracts prohibiting merchants from imposing surcharges for credit card use.for most of its history,the new york law was essentially coextensive with these contractual prohibitions.in recent years,however,merchants have brought antitrust challenges to contractual provisions.those suits have created uncertainty about the legal validity of such contractual surcharge bans.the result is that otherwise redundant legislative surcharge bans like have increasingly gained importance,and increasingly come under scrutiny.
petitioners,five new york businesses and their owners,wish to impose surcharges on customers who use credit cards.each time one of their customers pays with a credit card,these merchants must pay some transaction fee to the company that issued the credit card.the fee is generally two to three percent of the purchase price.those fees add up,and the merchants allege that they pay tens of thousands of dollars every year to credit card companies.rather than increase prices across the board to absorb those costs,the merchants want to pass the fees along only to their customers who choose to use credit cards.they also want to make clear that they are not the bad guys that the credit card companies,not the merchants,are responsible for the higher prices.the merchants believe that surcharges for credit are more effective than discounts for cash in accomplishing these goals.
in,after several major credit card issuers agreed to drop their contractual surcharge prohibitions,the merchants filed suit against the new york attorney general and three new york district attorneys to challenge the only remaining obstacle to their charging surcharges for credit card use.as relevant here,they argued that the law violated the first amendment by regulating how they communicated their prices,and that it was unconstitutionally vague because liability under the law turn ed on the blurry difference between surcharges and discounts.app,complaint.
the district court ruled in favor of the merchants.it read the statute as draw ing a line between prohibited surcharges and permissible discounts based on words and labels,rather than economic realities.supp,sdny.the court concluded that the law therefore regulated speech,and violated the first amendment under this court commercial speech doctrine.in addition,because the law turned on the virtually incomprehensible distinction between what a vendor can and can not tell its customers,the district court found that the law was unconstitutionally vague,at.
the court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the judgment of the district court with instructions to dismiss the merchants claims.it began by considering pricing,where merchants post one price and would like to charge more to customers who pay by credit card.all the law did in this context,the court of appeals explained,was regulate a relationship between two prices the sticker price and the price charged to a credit card user by requiring that the two prices be equal.relying on our precedent holding that price regulation alone regulates conduct,not speech,the court of appeals concluded that did not violate the first amendment.
the court also considered other types of pricing regimes for example,posting separate cash and credit prices.the court of appeals thought it far from clear that prohibited such pricing schemes.the federal surcharge ban on which was modeled did not apply outside the context,and the merchants had not clearly shown that had a broader reach than the federal law.ibid.deciding that petitioners challenge in this regard turn ed on an unsettled question of state law,the court of appeals abstained from reaching the merits of the constitutional question beyond the context,at citing railroad comm of pullman.
we granted certiorari.
as a preliminary matter,we note that petitioners present us with a limited challenge.observing that the merchants were not always particularly clear about the scope of their suit,the court of appeals deemed them to be bringing a facial attack on as well as a challenge to the application of the statute to two particular pricing regimes pricing and pricing.before us,however,the merchants have disclaimed a facial challenge,assuring us that theirs is an challenge only.see tr.of oral arg.
there remains the question of what precise application of the law they seek to challenge.although the merchants have presented a wide array of hypothetical pricing regimes,they have expressly identified only one pricing scheme that they seek to employ posting a cash price and an additional credit card surcharge,expressed either as a percentage surcharge or a additional amount.see,app,tr.of oral arg.under this pricing approach,petitioner expressions hair design might,for example,post a sign outside its salon reading haircuts we add a surcharge if you pay by credit card.or,petitioner brooklyn farmacy soda fountain might list one of the sundaes on its menu as costing with a surcharge for credit card users.we take petitioners at their word and limit our review to the question whether is unconstitutional as applied to this particular pricing practice 
the next question is whether prohibits the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ.the court of appeals concluded that it does.the court read surcharge in to mean an additional amount above the seller regular price,and found it basically how applies to sellers who post a single sticker price the sticker price is the regular price,so sellers may not charge customers an additional amount above the sticker price that is not also charged to cash customers.at.under this interpretation,signs of the kind that the merchants wish to post with a surcharge for credit card users violate because they identify one sticker price and indicate that credit card users are charged more than that amount.
we generally accord great deference to the interpretation and application of state law by the courts of appeals.pembaur cincinnati.this deference is warranted to render unnecessary review of their decisions in this respect and because lower federal courts are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective states.brockett spokane arcades,quoting cort ash,internal quotation marks omitted.w e surely have the authority to differ with the lower federal courts as to the meaning of a state statute,and have done so in instances where the lower court construction was clearly wrong or plain error.at,and internal quotation marks omitted.but that is not the case here.section does not define surcharge,but the court of appeals looked to the ordinary meaning of the term a charge in excess of the usual or normal amount.at quoting webster third new international dictionary internal quotation marks omitted.where a seller posts a single sticker price,it is reasonable to treat that sticker price as the usual or normal amount and conclude,as the court below did,that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he charges a credit card user more than that sticker price.in short,we can not dismiss the court of appeals interpretation of as clearly wrong.accordingly,consistent with our customary practice,we follow that interpretation.
having concluded that bars the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ,we turn to their constitutional arguments that the law unconstitutionally regulates speech and is impermissibly vague.
the court of appeals concluded that posed no first amendment problem because the law regulated conduct,not speech in reaching this conclusion,the court of appeals began with the premise that price controls regulate conduct alone.see liquormart,rhode island,plurality opinion,at thomas,concurring in part and concurring in judgment,at,concurring in judgment.section regulates the relationship between the seller sticker price and the price the seller charges to credit card customers,requiring that these two amounts be equal,at.a law regulating the relationship between two prices regulates speech no more than a law regulating a single price.the court of appeals concluded that was therefore simply a conduct regulation.
but is not like a typical price regulation.such a regulation for example,a law requiring all new york delis to charge for their sandwiches would simply regulate the amount that a store could collect.in other words,it would regulate the sandwich seller conduct.to be sure,in order to actually collect that money,a store would likely have to put on its menus or have its employees tell customers that price.those written or oral communications would be speech,and the law by determining the amount charged would indirectly dictate the content of that speech.but the law effect on speech would be only incidental to its primary effect on conduct,and it has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated,evidenced,or carried out by means of language,either spoken,written,or printed.rumsfeld forum for aca demic and institutional rights,quoting giboney empire storage ice,internal quotation marks omitted see also sorrell ims health.
section is different.the law tells merchants nothing about the amount they are allowed to collect from a cash or credit card payer.sellers are free to charge for cash and,or any other amount for credit.what the law does regulate is how sellers may communicate their prices.a merchant who wants to charge for cash and for credit may not convey that price any way he pleases.he is not free to say with a credit card surcharge or plus for credit because both of those displays identify a single sticker price that is less than the amount credit card users will be charged.instead,if the merchant wishes to post a single sticker price,he must display as his sticker price.accordingly,while we agree with the court of appeals that regulates a relationship between a sticker price and the price charged to credit card users,we can not accept its conclusion that is nothing more than a price regulation.in regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves,regulates speech.
because it concluded otherwise,the court of appeals had no occasion to conduct a further inquiry into whether,as a speech regulation,survived first amendment scrutiny.on that question,the parties dispute whether is a valid commercial speech regulation under central hudson gas public serv.comm of,and whether the law can be upheld as a valid disclosure requirement under zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of supreme court of ohio.
w e are a court of review,not of first view.nautilus,biosig instruments,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we decline to consider those questions in the first instance.instead,we remand for the court of appeals to analyze as a speech regulation 
given the way the merchants have presented their case,their vagueness challenge gives us little pause.before this court,the only pricing practice they express an interest in employing is a regime,listing one price and a separate surcharge amount.as we have explained,bars them from doing so.a plaintiff whose speech is clearly proscribed can not raise a successful vagueness claim.holder humanitarian law project.although the merchants argue that no one can seem to put a finger on just how far the law sweeps,brief for petitioners,it is at least clear that proscribes their intended speech.accordingly,the law is not vague as applied to them 
the judgment of the court of appeals for the second circuit is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice breyer,concurring in the judgment.
i agree with the court that new york statute regulates speech.but that is because virtually all government regulation affects speech.human relations take place through speech.and human relations include community activities of all kinds commercial and otherwise.
when the government seeks to regulate those activities,it is often wiser not to try to distinguish between speech and conduct.see post,democracy,expertise,and academic freedom.instead,we can,and normally do,simply ask whether,or how,a challenged statute,rule,or regulation affects an interest that the first amendment protects.if,for example,a challenged government regulation negatively affects the processes through which political discourse or public opinion is formed or expressed interests close to the first amendment protective core,courts normally scrutinize that regulation with great care.see,boos barry.if the challenged regulation restricts the informational function provided by truthful commercial speech,courts will apply a lesser but still elevated form of scrutiny.central hudson gas public serv.comm of.if,however,a challenged regulation simply requires a commercial speaker to disclose purely factual and uncontroversial information,courts will apply a more permissive standard of review.zauderer office of disciplinary counsel of supreme court of ohio.because that kind of regulation normally has only a minimal effect on first amendment interests,it normally need only be reasonably related to the state interest in preventing deception of consumers.ibid.courts apply a similarly permissive standard of review to regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions.united states carolene products.since that legislation normally does not significantly affect the interests that the first amendment protects,we normally look only for assurance that the legislation rests upon some rational basis.ibid.
i repeat these general standards or judicial approaches both because i believe that determining the proper approach is typically more important than trying to distinguish speech from conduct,see sorrell ims health,breyer,dissenting,and because the parties here differ as to which approach applies.that difference reflects the fact that it is not clear just what new york law does.on its face,the law seems simply to tell merchants that they can not charge higher prices to users.if so,then it is an ordinary piece of commercial legislation subject to rational basis review.see liquormart,rhode island,opinion of stevens.it may,however,make more sense to interpret the statute as working like the expired federal law that it replaced.if so,it would require a merchant,who posts prices and who wants to charge a higher price,simply to disclose that price.see q,x,a ed.see also post,at sotomayor,concurring in judgment.in that case,though affecting the merchant speech,it would not hinder the transmission of information to the public the merchant would remain free to say whatever it wanted so long as it also revealed its price to customers.accordingly,the law would still receive a deferential form of review.see zauderer,supra,at.
nonetheless,petitioners suggest that the statute does more.see,brief for petitioners arguing that the statute forbids f raming the price difference as a credit surcharge because the statute operation is unclear and because its interpretation is a matter of state law,i agree with the majority that we should remand the case to the second circuit.i also agree with justice sotomayor that on remand,it may well be helpful for the second circuit to ask the new york court of appeals to clarify the nature of the obligations the statute imposes.see comp.code,rules,tit,rule a permitting any united states court of appeals to certify dispositive questions of new york law to the new york court of appeals

justice sotomayor,with whom justice alito joins,concurring in the judgment.
the court addresses only one part of one half of petitioners first amendment challenge to the new york statute at issue here.this outcome is worse than none.i would vacate the judgment below and remand with directions to certify the case to the new york court of appeals for a definitive interpretation of the statute that would permit the full resolution of petitioners claims.i thus concur only in the judgment.
new york prohibits its merchants from impos ing a surcharge on a customer who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.bus.law ann.west.a merchant who violates this prohibition commits a misdemeanor and risks a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars or a term of imprisonment up to one year,or both.ibid.
section can be interpreted in several ways.on first read,its prohibition on impos ing a surcharge on credit card customers appears to prohibit charging customers who pay with a credit card more than those who pay by other means.see black law dictionary ed.surcharge means a n additional tax,charge,or cost that is,may require a merchant to charge all customers the same price,no matter the form of payment.
an earlier federal law containing an almost identical prohibition muddies the path to this plain text reading.a amendment to the truth in lending act set out a temporary prohibition barring a seller in any sales transaction from impos ing a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash,check,or similar means.c,stat.the amendment also defined a surcharge as any means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash,check,or similar means.a,ibid.r egular price was later defined to mean the displayed price if a merchant displayed only one price or the credit card price if the merchant either did not display prices or displayed both cash and credit card prices.a,stat.under that definition,a merchant violated the federal prohibition on impos ing a surcharge by displaying in form only one price the cash price and then charging credit card customers a higher price 
when the federal law lapsed in,new york enacted,which sets out the same ban on impos ing a surcharge.new york borrowed the federal prohibition almost verbatim.but it chose,without explanation,not to borrow the federal definitions or to enact clarifying definitions of its own.
the difference between the laws leaves open to at least three interpretations.it could be read in line with its plain text to require that a merchant charge the same price to all his customers.it could be read in line with the lapsed federal ban to permit a merchant to charge different prices to cash and credit card customers but to prohibit a merchant from displaying in form only the cash price and then charging credit card customers a higher price.on this reading,would not apply where a merchant displays in form only the credit card price and then charges a lower price to cash customers,or where a merchant displays both the cash and credit card prices in form.or it could be read more broadly,based on the omission of the definitions that had limited the federal ban scope.on this reading,might prohibit a merchant from characterizing the difference between the cash and credit card prices as a surcharge,no matter how he displays his prices 
confirming the elusive nature of,new york has pressed almost all of these interpretations during this litigation.before the district court,it viewed as mirroring the lapsed federal ban.see supp,sdny.before the second circuit,it offered the lapsed federal ban as a narrowing interpretation,thus suggesting that applies more broadly than that provision.see.and before this court,it explained that other prosecutorial entities in new york are not bound by its interpretation of or the interpretations of the state district attorneys who are parties to this case,leaving open the possibility of still other interpretations.see tr.of oral arg.
petitioners here are five new york merchants.when a customer pays with a credit card,petitioners like all merchants are charged a processing fee by the card issuer.petitioners want to pass that fee on to their credit card paying customers,but not their cash paying customers.they want to charge cash customers one price and credit card customers a higher price that includes the processing fee.one petitioner,expressions hair design,currently does pass the costs of credit card processing fees on to its credit card paying customers.the other four charge one price to all customers.they set their prices to account for the processing fees they predict they will incur.
all five would prefer to use a different pricing system or display than the ones they use now.expressions hair design and five points academy would like to charge cash and credit card customers two different prices and to display a cash price alongside the extra charge for credit card customers say,with a credit card charge or with a credit card charge.brooklyn farmacy soda fountain,brite buy wines spirits,and want to charge cash and credit card customers two different prices and to characterize the difference in prices as a surcharge when they display or convey their prices to customers.app.
all five do not use their preferred pricing systems or displays for fear of violating.expressions hair design and five points academy believe prohibits their pricing display because it would convey the credit card processing costs impermissibly as a surcharge,rather than permissibly as a discount say,with a discount for cash payment or with a discount for cash payment.the other three petitioners believe that regulates how they can describe the difference between cash and credit card prices.because does not,in their view,clearly state just how it regulates those descriptions,they have decided that the uncertainty counsels against a change.
petitioners view as an unconstitutional restriction on their ability to display and describe their prices to their customers.and so they sued and challenged the law on first amendment grounds.
resolving petitioners challenge to requires an accurate picture of how,exactly,the statute works.that understanding is needed both to decide whether prohibits petitioners preferred pricing systems and displays and,if so,whether that prohibition is consistent with the first amendment.see,at ante,at.
but the second circuit did not decide just how far extends.it instead decided how applies to part of the petitioners challenge the pricing display expressions hair design and five points academy wish to use and declined to decide how,or even if,applies to the rest of the challenge.while evades easy interpretation,a partial decision was neither required nor right.the court below erred by not asking the new york court of appeals for a definitive interpretation of,and this court errs by not correcting it.
given a constitutional challenge that turned on the interpretation of an ambiguous state statute not yet definitively interpreted by the state courts,the second circuit faced a problem.any interpretation it gave would not be authoritative since state courts,not federal courts,have the final word on the interpretation of state statutes.but it had before it two routes abstention and certification to a solution.both would have allowed it to secure an authoritative interpretation of before resolving the constitutional challenge.
in this context,abstention and certification serve the same goals.both recognize that when the outcome of a constitutional challenge turns on the proper interpretation of state law,a federal court resolution of the constitutional question may turn out to be unnecessary.the state courts could later interpret the state statute differently.and the state court different interpretation might result in a statute that implicates no constitutional question,or that renders the federal court constitutional analysis irrelevant.see,arizonans for official english arizona,brockett spokane arcades,concurring.abstention and certification avoid this risk by deferring a federal court decision on the constitutionality of the state statute until a state court has authoritatively resolved the antecedent question.
abstention is a blunt instrument.under railroad comm of pullman,a federal court decision to abstain sends the plaintiff to state court.once the plaintiff obtains the state courts views on the statute,he may return to federal court,state court decision in hand,for resolution of the constitutional question.pullman abstention thus entail s a full round of litigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in federal court.arizonans for official english,at.
certification offers a more precise tool.in states that have authorized certification,a federal court may put the question directly to the state highest court,reducing the delay,cutting the cost,and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response.ibid.the rule relevant here is typical of certification statutes.new york allows a federal court of appeals to certify determinative questions of new york law involved in a case pending before that court for which no controlling precedent of the court of appeals exists to the new york court of appeals.comp.code,rules,tit,rule a
