the university of texas at austin university uses an undergraduate admissions system containing two components.first,as required by the state top ten percent law,it offers admission to any students who graduate from a texas high school in the top of their class.it then fills the remainder of its incoming freshman class,some,by combining an applicant academic index the student sat score and high school academic performance with the applicant personal achievement index,a holistic review containing numerous factors,including race.the university adopted its current admissions process in,after a of its admissions process undertaken in the wake of grutter bollinger,and gratz bollinger,led it to conclude that its prior system did not reach its goal of providing the educational benefits of diversity to its undergraduate students.
petitioner abigail fisher,who was not in the top of her high school class,was denied admission to the university freshman class.she filed suit,alleging that the university consideration of race as part of its process disadvantaged her and other caucasian applicants,in violation of the equal protection clause.the district court entered summary judgment in the university favor,and the fifth circuit affirmed.this court vacated the judgment,fisher university of at austin,fisher i,and remanded the case to the court of appeals,so the university program could be evaluated under the proper strict scrutiny standard.on remand,the fifth circuit again affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the university.
held the admissions program in use at the time of petitioner application is lawful under the equal protection clause.
a fisher i sets out three controlling principles relevant to assessing the constitutionality of a public university affirmative action program.first,a university may not consider race unless the admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny,it must show that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial,and that its use of the classification is necessary to accomplish that purpose,at.second,the decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity is,in substantial measure,an academic judgment to which some,but not complete,judicial deference is proper.at.third,when determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve the university permissible goals,the school bears the burden of demonstrating that available and workable alternatives do not suffice,at.
b the university approach to admissions gives rise to an unusual consequence here.the component with the largest impact on petitioner chances of admission was not the school consideration of race under its process but the top ten percent plan.because petitioner did not challenge the percentage part of the plan,the record is devoid of evidence of its impact on diversity.remand for further factfinding would serve little purpose,however,because at the time of petitioner application,the current plan had been in effect only three years and,in any event,the university lacked authority to alter the percentage plan,which was mandated by the texas legislature.these circumstances refute any criticism that the university did not make good faith efforts to comply with the law.the university,however,does have a continuing obligation to satisfy the strict scrutiny burden by periodically reassessing the admission program constitutionality,and efficacy,in light of the school experience and the data it has gathered since adopting its admissions plan,and by tailoring its approach to ensure that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interests.
c drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor,petitioner has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied equal treatment at the time her application was rejected.
petitioner claims that the university has not articulated its compelling interest with sufficient clarity because it has failed to state more precisely what level of minority enrollment would constitute a critical mass.however,the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students,but an interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.fisher i,at.since the university is prohibited from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students,it can not be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority enrollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.
on the other hand,asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient.a university goals can not be elusory or amorphous they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.the record here reveals that the university articulated concrete and precise goals,ending stereotypes,promoting understanding,preparing students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,and cultivating leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry that mirror the compelling interest this court has approved in prior cases.it also gave a reasoned,principled explanation for its decision,at,in a proposal written after a study revealed that its policies and programs did not meet its goals.
petitioner also claims that the university need not consider race because it had already achieved critical mass by under the top ten percent plan and holistic review.the record,however,reveals that the university studied and deliberated for months,concluding that programs had not achieved the university diversity goals,a conclusion supported by significant statistical and anecdotal evidence.
petitioner argues further that it was unnecessary to consider race because such consideration had only a minor impact on the number of minority students the school admitted.but the record shows that the consideration of race has had a meaningful,if still limited,effect on freshman class diversity.that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring,not evidence of unconstitutionality.
finally,petitioner argues that there were numerous other means to achieve the university goals.however,as the record reveals,none of those alternatives was a workable means of attaining the university educational goals,as of the time of her application.

abigail noel fisher,petitioner university of texas at austin,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the court is asked once again to consider whether the admissions program at the university of texas is lawful under the equal protection clause.
the university of texas at austin or university relies upon a complex system of admissions that has undergone significant evolution over the past two decades.until,the university made its admissions decisions primarily based on a measure called academic index or ai,which it calculated by combining an applicant sat score and academic performance in high school.in assessing applicants,preference was given to racial minorities.
in,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit invalidated this admissions system,holding that any consideration of race in college admissions violates the equal protection clause.see hopwood texas.
one year later the university adopted a new admissions policy.instead of considering race,the university began making admissions decisions based on an applicant ai and his or her personal achievement index pai.the pai was a numerical score based on a holistic review of an application.included in the number were the applicant essays,leadership and work experience,extracurricular activities,community service,and other special characteristics that might give the admissions committee insight into a student background.consistent with hopwood,race was not a consideration in calculating an applicant ai or pai.
the texas legislature responded to hopwood as well.it enacted,commonly known as the top ten percent law.educ.code ann.west cum.supp.as its name suggests,the top ten percent law guarantees college admission to students who graduate from a texas high school in the top percent of their class.those students may choose to attend any of the public universities in the state.
the university implemented the top ten percent law in.after first admitting any student who qualified for admission under that law,the university filled the remainder of its incoming freshman class using a combination of an applicant ai and pai scores again,without considering race.
the university used this admissions system until,when this court decided the companion cases of grutter bollinger,and gratz bollinger.in gratz,this court struck down the university of michigan undergraduate system of admissions,which at the time allocated predetermined points to racial minority candidates.see,at.in grutter,however,the court upheld the university of michigan law school system of holistic review a system that did not mechanically assign points but rather treated race as a relevant feature within the broader context of a candidate application.see,at.in upholding this nuanced use of race,grutter implicitly overruled hopwood categorical prohibition.
in the wake of grutter,the university embarked upon a study seeking to ascertain whether its admissions policy was allowing it to provide the educational benefits of a diverse student body to all of the university undergraduate students.app.affidavit of bruce walker walker aff.see also,at.the university concluded that its admissions policy was not providing these benefits.supp.app.
to change its system,the university submitted a proposal to the board of regents that requested permission to begin taking race into consideration as one of the many ways in which an academically qualified individual might contribute to,and benefit from,the rich,diverse,and challenging educational environment of the.at.after the board approved the proposal,the university adopted a new admissions policy to implement it.the university has continued to use that admissions policy to this day.
although the university new admissions policy was a direct result of grutter,it is not identical to the policy this court approved in that case.instead,consistent with the state legislative directive,the university continues to fill a significant majority of its class through the top ten percent plan or plan.today,up to percent of the places in the freshman class are filled through the plan.as a practical matter,this percent cap,which has now been fixed by statute,means that,while the plan continues to be referenced as a top ten percent plan,a student actually needs to finish in the top seven or eight percent of his or her class in order to be admitted under this category.
the university did adopt an approach similar to the one in grutter for the remaining percent or so of the incoming class.this portion of the class continues to be admitted based on a combination of their ai and pai scores.now,however,race is given weight as a subfactor within the pai.the pai is a number from to is the best that is based on two primary components.the first component is the average score a reader gives the applicant on two required essays.the second component is a review that results in another score,the personal achievement score or pas.the pas is determined by a separate reader,who rereads the applicant required essays,reviews any supplemental information the applicant submits letters of recommendation,resumes,an additional optional essay,writing samples,artwork,and evaluates the applicant potential contributions to the university student body based on the applicant leadership experience,extracurricular activities,community service,and other special circumstances.
special circumstances include the socioeconomic status of the applicant family,the socioeconomic status of the applicant school,the applicant family responsibilities,whether the applicant lives in a home,the applicant sat score in relation to the average sat score at the applicant school,the language spoken at the applicant home,and,finally,the applicant race.see app.
both the essay readers and the readers who assign applicants their pai undergo extensive training to ensure that they are scoring applicants consistently.deposition of brian breman,record in,wd,doc.the admissions office also undertakes regular reliability analyses to measure the frequency of readers scoring within one point of each other.app.affidavit of gary lavergne see also,at deposition of kedra ishop ishop dep.both the intensive training and the reliability analyses aim to ensure that similarly situated applicants are being treated identically regardless of which admissions officer reads the file.
once the essay and readers have calculated each applicant ai and pai scores,admissions officers from each school within the university set a cutoff score combination for admission,and then admit all of the applicants who are above that cutoff point.in setting the cutoff,those admissions officers only know how many applicants received a given score combination.they do not know what factors went into calculating those applicants scores.the admissions officers who make the final decision as to whether a particular applicant will be admitted make that decision without knowing the applicant race.race enters the admissions process,then,at one stage and one stage only the calculation of the pas.
therefore,although admissions officers can consider race as a positive feature of a minority student application,there is no dispute that race is but a factor of a factor of a factor in the calculus.supp,wd.furthermore,consideration of race is contextual and does not operate as a mechanical plus factor for underrepresented minorities,at plaintiffs cite no evidence to show racial groups other than and hispanics are excluded from benefitting from ut consideration of race in admissions.as the defendants point out,the consideration of race,within the full context of the entire application,may be beneficial to any ut austin applicant including whites and see also brief for asian american legal defense and education fund et as amici curiae the contention that the university discriminates against is entirely unsupported by evidence in the record or empirical data there is also no dispute,however,that race,when considered in conjunction with other aspects of an applicant background,can alter an applicant pas score.thus,race,in this indirect fashion,considered with all of the other factors that make up an applicant ai and pai scores,can make a difference to whether an application is accepted or rejected.
petitioner abigail fisher applied for admission to the university freshman class.she was not in the top percent of her high school class,so she was evaluated for admission through holistic,review.petitioner application was rejected.
petitioner then filed suit alleging that the university consideration of race as part of its process disadvantaged her and other caucasian applicants,in violation of the equal protection clause.see,amdt,no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws the district court entered summary judgment in the university favor,and the court of appeals affirmed.
this court granted certiorari and vacated the judgment of the court of appeals,fisher university of at austin,fisher i,because it had applied an overly deferential standard in assessing the constitutionality of the university program.the court remanded the case for the court of appeals to assess the parties claims under the correct legal standard.
without further remanding to the district court,the court of appeals again affirmed the entry of summary judgment in the university favor.this court granted certiorari for a second time,and now affirms.
fisher i set forth three controlling principles relevant to assessing the constitutionality of a public university program.first,because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,richmond croson,r ace may not be considered by a university unless the admissions process can withstand strict,fisher i,at slip,at.strict scrutiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial,and that its use of the classification is necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose.ibid.
second,fisher i confirmed that the decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity is,in substantial measure,an academic judgment to which some,but not complete,judicial deference is proper.at slip op,at.a university can not impose a fixed quota or otherwise define diversity as some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin.ibid.once,however,a university gives a reasoned,principled explanation for its decision,deference must be given to the university conclusion,based on its experience and expertise,that a diverse student body would serve its educational goals.ibid.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
third,fisher i clarified that no deference is owed when determining whether the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve the university permissible goals,at slip,at.a university,fisher i explained,bears the burden of proving a nonracial approach would not promote its interest in the educational benefits of diversity about as well and at tolerable administrative expense.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.though n arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable alternative or require a university to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence and fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities to members of all racial groups,grutter,at,it does impose on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating that alternatives that are both available and workable do not suffice.fisher i,at slip,at.
fisher i set forth these controlling principles,while taking no position on the constitutionality of the admissions program at issue in this case.the court held only that the district court and the court of appeals had confined the strict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring to the university good faith in its use of racial classifications.at slip,at the court remanded the case,with instructions to evaluate the record under the correct standard and to determine whether the university had made a showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the educational benefits that flow from diversity,at slip,at.on remand,the court of appeals determined that the program conformed with the strict scrutiny mandated by fisher see,at.judge garza dissented.
the university program is sui generis.unlike other approaches to college admissions considered by this court,it combines holistic review with a percentage plan.this approach gave rise to an unusual consequence in this case the component of the university admissions policy that had the largest impact on petitioner chances of admission was not the school consideration of race under its process but rather the top ten percent plan.because petitioner did not graduate in the top percent of her high school class,she was categorically ineligible for more than of the slots in the incoming freshman class.it seems quite plausible,then,to think that petitioner would have had a better chance of being admitted to the university if the school used holistic review to select its entire incoming class,as was the case in grutter.
despite the top ten percent plan outsized effect on petitioner chances of admission,she has not challenged it.for that reason,throughout this litigation,the top ten percent plan has been taken,somewhat artificially,as a given premise.
petitioner acceptance of the top ten percent plan complicates this court review.in particular,it has led to a record that is almost devoid of information about the students who secured admission to the university through the plan.the court thus can not know how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review.
in an ordinary case,this evidentiary gap perhaps could be filled by a remand to the district court for further factfinding.when petitioner application was rejected,however,the university combined approach to admission had been in effect for just three years.while studies undertaken over the eight years since then may be of significant value in determining the constitutionality of the university current admissions policy,that evidence has little bearing on whether petitioner received equal treatment when her application was rejected in.if the court were to remand,therefore,further factfinding would be limited to a narrow sample,review of which might yield little insight.
furthermore,as discussed above,the university lacks any authority to alter the role of the top ten percent plan in its admissions process.the plan was mandated by the texas legislature in the wake of hopwood,so the university,like petitioner in this litigation,has likely taken the plan as a given since its implementation in.if the university had no reason to think that it could deviate from the top ten percent plan,it similarly had no reason to keep extensive data on the plan or the students admitted under it particularly in the years before fisher i clarified the stringency of the burden for a school that employs review.
under the circumstances of this case,then,a remand would do nothing more than prolong a suit that has already persisted for eight years and cost the parties on both sides significant resources.petitioner long since has graduated from another college,and the university policy and the data on which it first was based may have evolved or changed in material ways.
the fact that this case has been litigated on a somewhat artificial basis,furthermore,may limit its value for prospective guidance.the texas legislature,in enacting the top ten percent plan,can not much be criticized,for it was responding to hopwood,which at the time was binding law in the state of texas.that legislative response,in turn,circumscribed the university discretion in crafting its admissions policy.these circumstances refute any criticism that the university did not make efforts to comply with the law.
that does not diminish,however,the university continuing obligation to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny in light of changing circumstances.the university engages in periodic reassessment of the constitutionality,and efficacy,of its admissions program.see supp.app.app.going forward,that assessment must be undertaken in light of the experience the school has accumulated and the data it has gathered since the adoption of its admissions plan.
as the university examines this data,it should remain mindful that diversity takes many forms.formalistic racial classifications may sometimes fail to capture diversity in all of its dimensions and,when used in a divisive manner,could undermine the educational benefits the university values.through regular evaluation of data and consideration of student experience,the university must tailor its approach in light of changing circumstances,ensuring that race plays no greater role than is necessary to meet its compelling interest.the university examination of the data it has acquired in the years since petitioner application,for these reasons,must proceed with full respect for the constraints imposed by the equal protection clause.the type of data collected,and the manner in which it is considered,will have a significant bearing on how the university must shape its admissions policy to satisfy strict scrutiny in the years to come.here,however,the court is necessarily limited to the narrow question before it whether,drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor,petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied equal treatment at the time her application was rejected.
in seeking to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals,petitioner makes four arguments.first,she argues that the university has not articulated its compelling interest with sufficient clarity.according to petitioner,the university must set forth more precisely the level of minority enrollment that would constitute a critical mass.without a clearer sense of what the university ultimate goal is,petitioner argues,a reviewing court can not assess whether the university admissions program is narrowly tailored to that goal.
as this court cases have made clear,however,the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in college admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students.rather,a university may institute a admissions program as a means of obtaining the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity.fisher i,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted see also grutter,at.as this court has said,enrolling a diverse student body promotes understanding,helps to break down racial stereotypes,and enables students to better understand persons of different races.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.equally important,student body diversity promotes learning outcomes,and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to these educational benefits,but it is not,as petitioner seems to suggest,a goal that can or should be reduced to pure numbers.indeed,since the university is prohibited from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students,it can not be faulted for failing to specify the particular level of minority enrollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.
on the other hand,asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient.a university goals can not be elusory or amorphous they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.
the record reveals that in first setting forth its current admissions policy,the university articulated concrete and precise goals.on the first page of its proposal to consider race and ethnicity in admissions,the university identifies the educational values it seeks to realize through its admissions process the destruction of stereotypes,the promot ion of understanding,the preparation of a student body for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,and the cultivat ion of a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.supp.app.see also,at app.deposition of bruce walker walker dep,walker aff.setting forth the same goals.later in the proposal,the university explains that it strives to provide an academic environment that offers a robust exchange of ideas,exposure to differing cultures,preparation for the challenges of an increasingly diverse workforce,and acquisition of competencies required of future leaders.supp.app.all of these objectives,as a general matter,mirror the compelling interest this court has approved in its prior cases.
the university has provided in addition a reasoned,principled explanation for its decision to pursue these goals.fisher i,supra,at slip,at.the university proposal was written following a study,which concluded that t he use of policies and programs ha d not been successful in provid ing an educational setting that fosters understanding,provid ing enlightened discussion and learning,or prepar ing students to function in an increasingly diverse workforce and society.supp.app.see also app.walker aff.describing the thoughtful review the university undertook when it faced the important decision whether or not to use race in its admissions process further support for the university conclusion can be found in the depositions and affidavits from various admissions officers,all of whom articulate the same,consistent reasoned,principled explanation.see,at ishop dep,walker dep,defendant statement of facts,walker aff.petitioner contention that the university goal was insufficiently concrete is rebutted by the record.
second,petitioner argues that the university has no need to consider race because it had already achieved critical mass by using the top ten percent plan and holistic review.brief for petitioner.petitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a plan.the record reveals,however,that,at the time of petitioner application,the university could not be faulted on this score.before changing its policy the university conducted months of study and deliberation,including retreats,interviews,and review of data,app,and concluded that t he use of policies and programs ha d not been successful in achieving sufficient racial diversity at the university,supp.app.at no stage in this litigation has petitioner challenged the university good faith in conducting its studies,and the court properly declines to consider the extrarecord materials the dissent relies upon,many of which are tangential to this case at best and none of which the university has had a full opportunity to respond to.see,post,at opinion of alito,describing a report regarding the admission of applicants who are related to politically connected individuals.
the record itself contains significant evidence,both statistical and anecdotal,in support of the university position.to start,the demographic data the university has submitted show consistent stagnation in terms of the percentage of minority students enrolling at the university from to.in,for example,freshmen enrolled,a total that constituted percent of the incoming class.in,the year grutter was decided,students enrolled again,percent of the incoming class.the numbers for hispanic and students tell a similar story.see supp.app.although demographics alone are by no means dispositive,they do have some value as a gauge of the university ability to enroll students who can offer underrepresented perspectives.
in addition to this broad demographic data,the university put forward evidence that minority students admitted under the hopwood regime experienced feelings of loneliness and isolation.see,app.
this anecdotal evidence is,in turn,bolstered by further,more nuanced quantitative data.in,percent of undergraduate classes with at least five students had no students enrolled in them,and percent had only one student.supp.app.in other words,only percent of undergraduate classes with five or more students in them had more than one student enrolled.twelve percent of these classes had no hispanic students,as compared to percent in,at.though a college must continually reassess its need for review,here that assessment appears to have been done with care,and a reasonable determination was made that the university had not yet attained its goals.
third,petitioner argues that considering race was not necessary because such consideration has had only a minimal impact in advancing the university compelling interest.brief for petitioner see also tr.of oral arg.again,the record does not support this assertion.in,percent of the texas residents enrolled through holistic review were hispanic and percent were.supp.app.in,by contrast,percent of the texas freshmen were hispanic and percent were.ibid.those increases of percent and percent,respectively show that consideration of race has had a meaningful,if still limited,effect on the diversity of the university freshman class.
in any event,it is not a failure of narrow tailoring for the impact of racial consideration to be minor.the fact that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring,not evidence of unconstitutionality.
petitioner final argument is that there are numerous other available means of achieving the university compelling interest.brief for petitioner.a review of the record reveals,however,that,at the time of petitioner application,none of her proposed alternatives was a workable means for the university to attain the benefits of diversity it sought.for example,petitioner suggests that the university could intensify its outreach efforts to and hispanic applicants.but the university submitted extensive evidence of the many ways in which it already had intensified its outreach efforts to those students.the university has created three new scholarship programs,opened new regional admissions centers,increased its recruitment budget by dollars,and organized over recruitment events.supp.app.app.citing affidavit of michael orr.perhaps more significantly,in the wake of hopwood,the university spent seven years attempting to achieve its compelling interest using holistic review.none of these efforts succeeded,and petitioner fails to offer any meaningful way in which the university could have improved upon them at the time of her application.
petitioner also suggests altering the weight given to academic and socioeconomic factors in the university admissions calculus.this proposal ignores the fact that the university tried,and failed,to increase diversity through enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and other factors.and it further ignores this court precedent making clear that the equal protection clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence.grutter,at.
petitioner final suggestion is to uncap the top ten percent plan,and admit more if not all the university students through a percentage plan.as an initial matter,petitioner overlooks the fact that the top ten percent plan,though facially neutral,can not be understood apart from its basic purpose,which is to boost minority enrollment.percentage plans are adopted with racially segregated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.fisher i,at ginsburg,dissenting slip,at.it is race consciousness,not blindness to race,that drives such plans.ibid.consequently,petitioner can not assert simply that increasing the university reliance on a percentage plan would make its admissions policy more race neutral.
even if,as a matter of raw numbers,minority enrollment would increase under such a regime,petitioner would be to find convincing support for the proposition that college admissions would be improved if they were a function of class rank alone.that approach would sacrifice all other aspects of diversity in pursuit of enrolling a higher number of minority students.a system that selected every student through class rank alone would exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training.it would exclude a talented young biologist who struggled to maintain grades in humanities classes.and it would exclude a student whose grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three years of school,only to find herself just outside of the top decile of her class.
these are but examples of the general problem.class rank is a single metric,and like any single metric,it will capture certain types of people and miss others.this does not imply that students admitted through holistic review are necessarily more capable or more desirable than those admitted through the top ten percent plan.it merely reflects the fact that privileging one characteristic above all others does not lead to a diverse student body.indeed,to compel universities to admit students based on class rank alone is in deep tension with the goal of educational diversity as this court cases have defined it.see grutter,supra,at explaining that percentage plans may preclude the university from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially diverse,but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university at pointing out that the top ten percent law leaves out students who fell outside their high school top ten percent but excelled in unique ways that would enrich the diversity of the university educational experience and leaves a gap in an admissions process seeking to create the diversity that regents of of cal.bakke,envisions at its center,the top ten percent plan is a blunt instrument that may well compromise the university own definition of the diversity it seeks.
in addition to these fundamental problems,an admissions policy that relies exclusively on class rank creates perverse incentives for applicants.percentage plans encourage parents to keep their children in segregated schools,and discourage students from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point averages.gratz,at,ginsburg,dissenting.
for all these reasons,although it may be true that the top ten percent plan in some instances may provide a path out of poverty for those who excel at schools lacking in resources,the plan can not serve as the admissions solution that petitioner suggests.wherever the balance between percentage plans and holistic review should rest,an effective admissions policy can not prescribe,realistically,the exclusive use of a percentage plan.
in short,none of petitioner suggested alternatives nor other proposals considered or discussed in the course of this litigation have been shown to be available and workable means through which the university could have met its educational goals,as it understood and defined them in.fisher i,supra,at slip,at.the university has thus met its burden of showing that the admissions policy it used at the time it rejected petitioner application was narrowly tailored.
a university is in large part defined by those intangible qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness.sweatt painter.considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics,like student body diversity,that are central to its identity and educational mission.but still,it remains an enduring challenge to our nation education system to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity.
in striking this sensitive balance,public universities,like the states themselves,can serve as laboratories for experimentation.united states lopez,kennedy,concurring see also new state ice liebmann,brandeis,dissenting.the university of texas at austin has a special opportunity to learn and to teach.the university now has at its disposal valuable data about the manner in which different approaches to admissions may foster diversity or instead dilute it.the university must continue to use this data to scrutinize the fairness of its admissions program to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a policy and to identify the effects,both positive and negative,of the measures it deems necessary.
the court affirmance of the university admissions policy today does not necessarily mean the university may rely on that same policy without refinement.it is the university ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies.
the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice alito,with whom the chief justice and justice thomas join,dissenting.
something strange has happened since our prior decision in this case.see fisher university of at austin,fisher i.in that decision,we held that strict scrutiny requires the university of texas at austin ut or university to show that its use of race and ethnicity in making admissions decisions serves compelling interests and that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve those ends.rejecting the argument that we should defer to ut judgment on those matters,we made it clear that ut was obligated to identify the interests justifying its plan with enough specificity to permit a reviewing court to determine whether the requirements of strict scrutiny were met,and to show that those requirements were in fact satisfied.on remand,ut failed to do what our prior decision demanded.the university has still not identified with any degree of specificity the interests that its use of race and ethnicity is supposed to serve.its primary argument is that merely invoking the educational benefits of diversity is sufficient and that it need not identify any metric that would allow a court to determine whether its plan is needed to serve,or is actually serving,those interests.this is nothing less than the plea for deference that we emphatically rejected in our prior decision.today,however,the court inexplicably grants that request.
to the extent that ut has ever moved beyond a plea for deference and identified the relevant interests in more specific terms,its efforts have been shifting,unpersuasive,and,at times,less than candid.when it adopted its plan,ut said that the plan was needed to promote classroom diversity.see supp.app,app.it pointed to a study showing that,hispanic,and students were underrepresented in many classes.see supp.app.but ut has never shown that its plan actually ameliorates this situation.the university presents no evidence that its admissions officers,in administering the holistic component of its plan,make any effort to determine whether an,hispanic,or student is likely to enroll in classes in which minority students are underrepresented.and although ut records should permit it to determine without much difficulty whether holistic admittees are any more likely than students admitted through the top ten percent law.educ.code ann.west cum.supp,to enroll in the classes lacking racial or ethnic diversity,ut either has not crunched those numbers or has not revealed what they show.nor has ut explained why the underrepresentation of students in many classes justifies its plan,which discriminates against those students.
at times,ut has claimed that its plan is needed to achieve a critical mass of and hispanic students,but it has never explained what this term means.according to ut,a critical mass is neither some absolute number of or hispanic students nor the percentage of or hispanics in the general population of the state.the term remains undefined,but ut tells us that it will let the courts know when the desired end has been achieved.see app.this is a plea for deference indeed,for blind deference the very thing that the court rejected in fisher 
ut has also claimed at times that the component of its plan is needed because the top ten percent plan admits the wrong kind of and hispanic students,namely,students from poor families who attend schools in which the student body is predominantly or hispanic.as ut put it in its brief in fisher i,the component of its admissions plan is needed to admit t he or hispanic child of successful professionals in dallas.brief for respondents.
after making this argument in its first trip to this court,ut apparently had second thoughts,and in the latest round of briefing ut has attempted to disavow ever having made the argument.see brief for respondents petitioner argument that ut interest is favoring affluent minorities is a fabrication see also,at.but it did,and the argument turns affirmative action on its head.programs were created to help disadvantaged students.
although ut now disowns the argument that the top ten percent plan results in the admission of the wrong kind of and hispanic students,the fifth circuit majority bought a version of that claim.as the panel majority put it,the top ten and hispanic admittees can not match the holistic and hispanic admittees when it comes to records of personal achievement,a variety of perspectives and life experiences,and unique skills.all in all,according to the panel majority,the top ten percent students can not enrich the diversity of the student body in the same way as the holistic admittees,at.as judge garza put it in dissent,the panel majority concluded that the top ten percent admittees are somehow more homogenous,less dynamic,and more undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review.at garza,dissenting.
the fifth circuit reached this conclusion with little direct evidence regarding the characteristics of the top ten percent and holistic admittees.instead,the assumption behind the fifth circuit reasoning is that most of the and hispanic students admitted under the component of ut plan were able to rank in the top decile of their high school classes only because they did not have to compete against white and students.this insulting stereotype is not supported by the record.and hispanic students admitted under the top ten percent plan receive higher college grades than the and hispanic students admitted under the program.see supp.app.
it should not have been necessary for us to grant review a second time in this case,and i have no greater desire than the majority to see the case drag on.but that need not happen.when ut decided to adopt its plan,it had every reason to know that its plan would have to satisfy strict scrutiny and that this meant that it would be its burden to show that the plan was narrowly tailored to serve compelling interests.ut has failed to make that showing.by all rights,judgment should be entered in favor of petitioner.
but if the majority is determined to give ut yet another chance,we should reverse and send this case back to the district court.what the majority has now done awarding a victory to ut in an opinion that fails to address the important issues in the case is simply wrong.
over the past years,ut has frequently modified its admissions policies,and it has generally employed race and ethnicity in the most aggressive manner permitted under controlling precedent.
before,race was considered directly as part of the general admissions process,and it was frequently a controlling factor.admissions were based on two criteria the applicant academic index ai,which was computed from standardized test scores and high school class rank,and the applicant race.in,the last year this system was in place,of enrolled freshmen were,were,and were hispanic.supp.app.
the fifth circuit decision in hopwood texas,prohibited ut from using race in admissions.in response to hopwood,beginning with the admissions cycle,ut instituted a holistic review process in which it considered an applicant ai as well as a personal achievement index pai that was intended,among other things,to increase minority enrollment.the pai was a composite of scores from two essays and a personal achievement score,which in turn was based on a holistic review of an applicant leadership qualities,extracurricular activities,honors and awards,work experience,community service,and special circumstances.special consideration was given to applicants from poor families,applicants from homes in which a language other than english was customarily spoken,and applicants from households.because this plan gave a preference to disadvantaged students,it had the effect of disproportionately benefiting minority candidates.supp,wd.
the texas legislature also responded to hopwood.in,it enacted the top ten percent plan,which mandated that ut admit all texas seniors who rank in the top of their high school classes.this facially law served to equalize competition between students who live in relatively affluent areas with superior schools and students in poorer areas served by schools offering fewer opportunities for academic excellence.and by benefiting the students in the latter group,this plan,like the holistic plan already adopted by ut,tended to benefit and hispanic students,who are often trapped in inferior public schools,at.
starting in,when the top ten percent plan took effect,ut holistic,system continued to be used to fill the seats in the entering class that were not taken by top ten percent students.the system was also used to determine program placement for all incoming students,including the top ten percent students.
the university revised admissions process,coupled with the operation of the top ten percent law,resulted in a more racially diverse environment at the university.fisher i,at slip,at.in,ut announced that its enrollment levels for african american and hispanic freshmen have returned to those of,the year before the hopwood decision prohibited the consideration of race in admissions policies.app.see also supp.app.diversity levels were restored in app.the top percent law is working for texas and has enabled us to diversify enrollment at ut austin with talented students who succeed and in,ut proclaimed that it had effectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action.at see also,at diversity efforts at the university of texas at austin have brought a higher number of freshman minority students african americans,hispanics and to the campus than were enrolled in,the year a court ruling ended the use of affirmative action in the university enrollment process by the last year under the holistic,system ut entering class was,and hispanic.supp.app.the entering class thus had a higher percentage of,and hispanics than the class that entered in,when ut had last employed racial preferences.
notwithstanding these lauded results,ut leapt at the opportunity to reinsert race into the process.on june,this court decided grutter bollinger,which upheld the university of michigan law school admissions system.in grutter,the court warned that a university contemplating the consideration of race as part of its admissions process must engage in serious,good faith consideration of workable alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.at.nevertheless,on the very day grutter was handed down,ut president announced that t he university of texas at austin will modify its admissions procedures in light of grutter,including by implementing procedures at the undergraduate level that combine the benefits of the top percent law with affirmative action programs.app.emphasis added ut purports to have later engaged in almost a year of deliberations,at,but there is no evidence that the reintroduction of race into the admissions process was anything other than a foregone conclusion following the president announcement.
the university plan to resume admissions was given formal expression in june in an internal document entitled proposal to consider race and ethnicity in admissions proposal.fisher i,supra,at slip,at.the proposal stated that ut needed admissions because it had not yet achieved a critical mass of racial diversity.supp.app.in support of this claim,ut cited two pieces of evidence.first,it noted that there were significant differences between the racial and ethnic makeup of the university undergraduate population and the state population.at.second,the proposal relied in substantial part,fisher i,supra,at slip,at,on a study of a subset of undergraduate classes containing at least five students,see supp.app.the study showed that among select classes with five or more students,had no,had no,and had no hispanics.ibid.moreover,the study showed,only of these classes had two or more,had two or more,and had two or more hispanics.see ibid.based on this study,the proposal concluded that ut has not reached a critical mass at the classroom level.at.the proposal did not analyze the backgrounds,life experiences,leadership qualities,awards,extracurricular activities,community service,personal attributes,or other characteristics of the minority students who were already being admitted to ut under the holistic,process.
to implement the proposal the university included a student race as a component of the pai score,beginning with applicants in the fall of.fisher i,at slip,at.the university asks students to classify themselves from among five predefined racial categories on the application.ibid.race is not assigned an explicit numerical value,but it is undisputed that race is a meaningful factor.ibid.ut decided to use racial preferences to benefit and hispanic students because it considers those groups underrepresented minorities.supp.app.see also app.defining underrepresented minorities as hispanic s and african americans even though ut classroom study showed that more classes lacked students than lacked hispanic students,supp.app,ut deemed overrepresented based on state demographics,supp,at see also ibid.it is undisputed that ut considers and hispanics to be underrepresented but does not consider to be underrepresented 
although ut claims that race is but a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor,at,ut acknowledges that race is the only one of its holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application,tr.of oral arg.because an applicant race is identified at the front of the admissions file,reviewers are aware of it throughout the evaluation.supp,at see also,at a candidate race is known throughout the application process consideration of race therefore pervades every aspect of ut admissions process.see app.we are certainly aware of the applicant race.it on the front page of the application that being read and is used in context with everything else that part of the applicant file this is by design,as ut considers its use of racial classifications to be a benign form of social engineering.powers,why schools still need affirmative action,national,editorial by bill powers,president of ut from opponents accuse defenders of admissions of being in favor of social engineering,to which i believe we should reply,guilty as charged 
notwithstanding the omnipresence of racial classifications,ut claims that it keeps no record of how those classifications affect its process.the university does keep any statistics on how many students are affected by the consideration of race in admissions decisions,and it does not know how many minority students are affected in a positive manner by the consideration of race.app.according to ut,it has no way of making these determinations.see,at.ut says that it does not tell its admissions officers how much weight to give to race.see deposition of gary lavergne,record in wd,doc.lavergne deposition.and because the influence of race is always contextual,ut claims,it can not provide even a single example of an instance in which race impacted a student odds of admission.see app.could you give me an example where race would have some impact on an applicant personal achievement score to be honest,not really i t impossible to say to give you an example of a particular student because it all contextual accordingly,ut asserts that it has no idea which students were admitted as a result of its system and which students would have been admitted under a process.ut thus makes no effort to assess how the individual characteristics of students admitted as the result of racial preferences differ or do not differ from those of students who would have been admitted without them.
ut admissions program can not satisfy strict scrutiny.ut says that the program furthers its interest in the educational benefits of diversity,but it has failed to define that interest with any clarity or to demonstrate that its program is narrowly tailored to achieve that or any other particular interest.by accepting ut rationales as sufficient to meet its burden,the majority licenses ut perverse assumptions about different groups of minority students the precise assumptions strict scrutiny is supposed to stamp out.
the moral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving force of the equal protection clause.richmond croson,kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.at the heart of the constitution guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the government must treat citizens as individuals,not as simply components of a racial,religious,sexual or national class.miller johnson,internal quotation marks omitted.assignments embody stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their race,evaluating their thoughts and efforts their very worth as citizens according to a criterion barred to the government by history and the constitution.at internal quotation marks omitted.given our constitutional commitment to the doctrine of equality,d istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people.rice cayetano,quoting hirabayashi united states.
b ecause racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,the equal protection clause demands that racial classifications be subjected to the most rigid scrutiny.fisher i,at slip,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.j udicial review must begin from the position that any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect.see also grutter,at kennedy,dissenting racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination under strict scrutiny,the use of race must be necessary to further a compelling governmental interest,and the means employed must be specifically and narrowly tailored to accomplish the compelling interest,at,for the court.
the higher education dynamic does not change this standard.fisher i,supra,at slip,at.racial discrimination is invidious in all contexts,edmonson leesville concrete,and t he analysis and level of scrutiny applied to determine the validity of a racial classification do not vary simply because the objective appears acceptable,fisher i,supra,at slip,at.
nor does the standard of review depen d on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification.gratz bollinger,quoting adarand constructors,peña,see also miller,supra,at this rule obtains with equal force regardless of the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification quoting croson,supra,at plurality opinion of.thus,any person,of whatever race,has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest of judicial scrutiny.gratz,supra,at quoting adarand,supra,at.
in short,in all contexts,edmonson,supra,at,racial classifications are permitted only as a last resort,when all else has failed,croson,supra,at opinion of kennedy.strict scrutiny is a searching examination,and it is the government that bears the burden of proof.fisher i,at slip,at.to meet this burden,the government must demonstrate with clarity that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial,and that its use of the classification is necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose.at slip,at emphasis added.
here,ut has failed to define its interest in using racial preferences with clarity.as a result,the narrow tailoring inquiry is impossible,and ut can not satisfy strict scrutiny.
when ut adopted its challenged policy,it characterized its compelling interest as obtaining a critical mass of underrepresented minorities,at slip,at.the proposal claimed that t he use of policies and programs has not been successful in achieving a critical mass of racial diversity.supp.app.see fisher university of at austin,t he proposal explained that ut had not yet achieved the critical mass of underrepresented minority students needed to obtain the full educational benefits of diversity but to this day,ut has not explained in anything other than the vaguest terms what it means by critical mass.in fact,ut argues that it need not identify any interest more specific than securing the educational benefits of diversity.brief for respondents.
ut has insisted that critical mass is not an absolute number.see tr.of oral arg,declaring that ut is not working toward any particular number of or hispanic students app.confirming that ut has not defined critical mass as a number and has not projected when it will attain critical mass.instead,ut prefers a deliberately malleable we know it when we see it notion of critical mass.it defines critical mass as an adequate representation of minority students so that the educational benefits that can be derived from diversity can actually happen,and it declares that it will know that it has reached critical mass when it see s the educational benefits happening.at.in other words trust us.
this intentionally imprecise interest is designed to insulate ut program from meaningful judicial review.as judge garza explained 
t o meet its narrow tailoring burden,the university must explain its goal to us in some meaningful way.we can not undertake a rigorous narrow tailoring analysis when the university will not define the ends.we can not tell whether the admissions program closely fits the university goal when it fails to objectively articulate its goal.nor can we determine whether considering race is necessary for the university to achieve critical mass,or whether there are effective alternatives,when it has not described what critical mass requires.at dissenting opinion.
indeed,without knowing in reasonably specific terms what critical mass is or how it can be measured,a reviewing court can not conduct the requisite careful judicial inquiry into whether the use of race was necessary.fisher i,supra,at slip,at.
to be sure,i agree with the majority that our precedents do not require ut to pinpoint an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students.ante,at.but in order for us to assess whether ut program is narrowly tailored,the university must identify some sort of concrete interest.classifying and assigning students according to race requires more than an amorphous end to justify it.parents involved in community schools seattle school dist.because ut has failed to explain with clarity,fisher i,supra,at slip,at,why it needs a policy and how it will know when its goals have been met,the narrow tailoring analysis can not be meaningfully conducted.ut therefore can not satisfy strict scrutiny.
the majority acknowledges that asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient,and that a university goals can not be elusory or amorphous they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny of the policies adopted to reach them.ante,at.according to the majority,however,ut has articulated the following concrete and precise goals the destruction of stereotypes,the promot ion of understanding,the preparation of a student body for an increasingly diverse workforce and society,and the cultivat ion of a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
these are laudable goals,but they are not concrete or precise,and they offer no limiting principle for the use of racial preferences.for instance,how will a court ever be able to determine whether stereotypes have been adequately destroyed or whether understanding has been adequately achieved if a university can justify racial discrimination simply by having a few employees opine that racial preferences are necessary to accomplish these nebulous goals,see ante,at citing only statements from ut officials,then the narrow tailoring inquiry is meaningless.courts will be required to defer to the judgment of university administrators,and policies will be completely insulated from judicial review.
by accepting these amorphous goals as sufficient for ut to carry its burden,the majority violates decades of precedent rejecting blind deference to government officials defending inherently suspect classifications.miller,at citing regents of of cal.bakke,opinion of powell,see also,miller,supra,at our presumptive skepticism of all racial classifications prohibits us from accepting on its face the justice department conclusion citation omitted croson,at t he mere recitation of a benign or legitimate purpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no weight at the history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis most troublingly,the majority uncritical deference to ut claims blatantly contradicts our decision in the prior iteration of this very case,in which we faulted the fifth circuit for improperly deferring to the university good faith in its use of racial classifications.fisher i,at slip,at.as we emphasized just three years ago,our precedent ma kes clear that it is for the courts,not for university administrators,to ensure that an admissions process is narrowly tailored,at slip,at.
a court can not ensure that an admissions process is narrowly tailored if it can not pin down the goals that the process is designed to achieve.ut vague policy goals are so broad and imprecise that they can not withstand strict scrutiny.parents involved,supra,at kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.
although ut primary argument is that it need not point to any interest more specific than the educational benefits of diversity,brief for respondents,it has at various points in this litigation identified four more specific goals demographic parity,classroom diversity,intraracial diversity,and avoiding racial isolation.neither ut nor the majority has demonstrated that any of these four goals provides a sufficient basis for satisfying strict scrutiny.and ut arguments to the contrary depend on a series of invidious assumptions.
first,both ut and the majority cite demographic data as evidence that and hispanic students are underrepresented at ut and that racial preferences are necessary to compensate for this underrepresentation.see,supp.app.ante,at.but neither ut nor the majority is clear about the relationship between texas demographics and ut interest in obtaining a critical mass.
does critical mass depend on the relative size of a particular group in the population of a state for example,is the critical mass of and hispanics in texas,where are about of the population and hispanics are about,different from the critical mass in neighboring new mexico,where the population is much smaller about and the hispanic population constitutes a higher percentage of the state total about see united states census bureau,quickfacts,online at https all internet materials as last visited june.
ut answer to this question has veered back and forth.at oral argument in fisher i,ut lawyer indicated that critical mass could vary from group to group and from state to state.see tr.of oral arg.and ut initially justified its plan at least in part on the ground that significant differences between the racial and ethnic makeup of the university undergraduate population and the state population prevent the university from fully achieving its mission.supp.app.see also,at a critical mass in texas is necessarily larger than a critical mass in michigan,because a majority of the population in texas is african american or hispanic fisher,at,concluding that ut reliance on texas demographics reflects measured attention to the community it serves brief for respondents in,at noting that critical mass may hinge,in part,on the communities that universities serve ut extensive reliance on state demographics is also revealed by its substantial focus on increasing the representation of hispanics,but not,see,supp,at supp.app.app,because hispanics,but not,are underrepresented at ut when compared to the demographics of the state 
on the other hand,ut counsel asserted that the critical mass for the university is not at all dependent on the demographics of texas,and that ut concept of critical mass is tied to demographic s.tr.of oral arg.and ut fisher i brief expressly agreed that a university can not look to racial demographics and then work backward in its admissions process to meet a target tied to such demographics.brief for respondents in,at see also brief for respondents disclaiming any interest in demographic parity.
to the extent that ut is pursuing parity with texas demographics,that is nothing more than outright racial balancing,which this court has time and again held patently unconstitutional.fisher i,at slip,at see grutter,at o utright racial balancing is patently unconstitutional freeman pitts,racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake croson,at rejecting goal of outright racial balancing bakke,at opinion of powell,if petitioner purpose is to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin,such a preferential purpose must be rejected as facially invalid an interest linked to nothing other than proportional representation of various races would support indefinite use of racial classifications,employed first to obtain the appropriate mixture of racial views and then to ensure that the program continues to reflect that mixture.metro broadcasting,fcc,dissenting.and as we held in fisher i,r acial balancing is not transformed from patently unconstitutional to a compelling state interest simply by relabeling it racial diversity.at slip,at quoting parents involved,at.
the record here demonstrates the pitfalls inherent in racial balancing.although ut claims an interest in the educational benefits of diversity,it appears to have paid little attention to anything other than the number of minority students on its campus and in its classrooms.ut proposal illustrates this approach by repeatedly citing numerical assessments of the racial makeup of the student body and various classes as the justification for adopting a plan.see,supp.app.instead of focusing on the benefits of diversity,ut seems to have resorted to a simple racial census.
the majority,for its part,claims that a lthough demographics alone are by no means dispositive,they do have some value as a gauge of the university ability to enroll students who can offer underrepresented perspectives.ante,at.but even if ut merely view s the demographic disparity as cause for concern,brief for united states as amicus curiae,and is seeking only to reduce rather than eliminate the disparity,that undefined goal can not be properly subjected to strict scrutiny.in that case,there is simply no way for a court to know what specific demographic interest ut is pursuing,why a alternative could not achieve that interest,and when that demographic goal would be satisfied.if a demographic discrepancy can serve as a gauge that justifies the use of racial discrimination,ante,at,then racial discrimination can be justified on that basis until demographic parity is reached.there is no logical stopping point short of patently unconstitutional racial balancing.demographic disparities thus can not be used to satisfy strict scrutiny here.see croson,supra,at rejecting a municipality assertion that its racial program was justified in light of past discrimination because that assertion had no logical stopping point and could continue until the percentage of government contracts awarded to minorities mirrored the percentage of minorities in the population as a whole wygant jackson bd.of,plurality opinion rejecting the government asserted interest because it had no logical stopping point 
the other major explanation ut offered in the proposal was its desire to promote classroom diversity.the proposal stressed that ut has not reached a critical mass at the classroom level.supp.app.emphasis added see also,at,app.in support of this proposition,ut relied on a study of select classes containing five or more students.as noted above,the study indicated that of these classes had no,had no,and had no hispanics.supp.app.the study further suggested that only of these classes had two or more,had two or more,and had two or more hispanics.see ibid.based on this study,ut concluded that it had a compelling educational interest in employing racial preferences to ensure that it did not have large numbers of classes in which there are no students or only a single student of a given underrepresented race or ethnicity.at.
ut now equivocates,disclaiming any discrete interest in classroom diversity.see brief for respondents.instead,ut has taken the position that the lack of classroom diversity was merely a red flag that ut had not yet fully realized the constitutionally permissible educational benefits of diversity.brief for respondents in,at.but ut has failed to identify the level of classroom diversity it deems sufficient,again making it impossible to apply strict scrutiny a reviewing court can not determine whether ut program was necessary to remove the red flag without understanding the precise nature of that goal or knowing when the red flag will be considered to have disappeared.
putting aside ut effective abandonment of its interest in classroom diversity,the evidence cited in support of that interest is woefully insufficient to show that ut plan was necessary to achieve the educational benefits of a diverse student body.as far as the record shows,ut failed to even scratch the surface of the available data before reflexively resorting to racial preferences.for instance,because ut knows which students were admitted through the top ten percent plan and which were not,as well as which students enrolled in which classes,it would seem relatively easy to determine whether top ten percent students were more or less likely than holistic admittees to enroll in the types of classes where diversity was lacking.but ut never bothered to figure this out.see ante,at acknowledging that ut submitted no evidence regarding how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review nor is there any indication that ut instructed admissions officers to search for and hispanic applicants who would fill particular gaps at the classroom level.given ut failure to present such evidence,it has not demonstrated that its policy would promote classroom diversity any better than options,such as expanding the top ten percent plan or using holistic admissions.
moreover,if ut is truly seeking to expose its students to a diversity of ideas and perspectives,its policy is poorly tailored to serve that end.ut own study which the majority touts as the best nuanced quantitative data supporting ut position,ante,at demonstrated that classroom diversity was more lacking for students classified as than for those classified as hispanic.supp.app.but the ut plan discriminates against students ut is apparently unconcerned that may be made to feel isolated or may be seen as spokesperson s of their race or ethnicity.at see,at.and unless the university is engaged in unconstitutional racial balancing based on texas demographics where hispanics outnumber,see part,supra,it seemingly views the classroom contributions of students as less valuable than those of hispanic students.in ut view,apparently,asian americans are not worth as much as hispanics in promoting understanding,breaking down racial stereotypes,and enabling students to better understand persons of different races.brief for asian american legal foundation et as amici curiae representing organizations.the majority opinion effectively endorses this view,crediting ut reliance on the classroom study as proof that the university assessed its need for racial discrimination including racial discrimination that undeniably harms with care.ante,at.
while both the majority and the fifth circuit rely on ut classroom study,see ante,at,at,they completely ignore its finding that hispanics are better represented than in ut classrooms.in fact,they act almost as if students do not exist.see ante,at mentioning only a single time outside of parentheticals,and not in the context of the classroom study,at mentioning only a single time only the district court acknowledged the impact of ut policy on students.but it brushed aside this impact,concluding astoundingly that ut can pick and choose which racial and ethnic groups it would like to favor.according to the district court,nothing in grutter requires a university to give equal preference to every minority group,and ut is allowed to exercise its discretion in determining which minority groups should benefit from the consideration of race.supp,at.
this reasoning,which the majority implicitly accepts by blessing ut reliance on the classroom study,places the court on the tortuous path of decid ing which races to favor.metro broadcasting,at kennedy,dissenting.and the court willingness to allow this discrimination against individuals of asian descent in ut admissions is particularly troubling,in light of the long history of discrimination against asian americans,especially in education.brief for asian american legal foundation et as amici curiae see also,at discussing the placement of in separate but equal public schools gong lum rice,holding that a girl could be denied entry to a white school because she was a member of the mongolian or yellow race in sum,w hile the court repeatedly refers to the preferences as favoring minorities,it must be emphasized that the discriminatory policies upheld today operate to exclude students,who have not made ut list of favored groups.metro broadcasting,supra,at kennedy,dissenting.
perhaps the majority finds discrimination against students benign,since are overrepresented at ut.supp,at.but h istory should teach greater humility.metro broadcasting,at,dissenting.b enign carries with it no independent meaning,but reflects only acceptance of the current generation conclusion that a politically acceptable burden,imposed on particular citizens on the basis of race,is reasonable.at.where,as here,the government has provided little explanation for why it needs to discriminate based on race,there is simply no way of determining what classifications are benign and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.parents involved,at opinion of kennedy,quoting croson,at plurality opinion of.by accepting the classroom study as proof that ut satisfied strict scrutiny,the majority move s us from separate but equal to unequal but benign.metro broadcasting,supra,at kennedy,dissenting.
in addition to demonstrating that ut discriminates against students,the classroom study also exhibits ut use of a few crude,overly simplistic racial and ethnic categories.under the ut plan,both the favored and the disfavored groups are broad and consist of students from enormously diverse backgrounds.see supp.app.see also fisher i,at slip,at five predefined racial categories because c rude measures of this sort threaten to reduce students to racial chits,parents involved,at opinion of kennedy,ut reliance on such measures further undermines any claim based on classroom diversity statistics,see,at majority opinion criticizing school policies that viewed race in rough or black other terms,at opinion of kennedy,faulting government for relying on crude racial categories metro broadcasting,supra,at,kennedy,dissenting concluding that the very attempt to define with precision a beneficiary qualifying racial characteristics is repugnant to our constitutional ideals,and noting that if the government is to make a serious effort to define racial classes by criteria that can be administered objectively,it must study precedents such as the first regulation to the reichs citizenship law of november,
for example,students labeled asian american,supp.app,seemingly include individuals of chinese,japanese,korean,vietnamese,cambodian,hmong,indian and other backgrounds comprising roughly of the world population,brief for asian american legal foundation et as amici curiae,it would be ludicrous to suggest that all of these students have similar backgrounds and similar ideas and experiences to share.so why has ut lumped them together and concluded that it is appropriate to discriminate against students because they are overrepresented in the ut student body ut has no good answer.and ut makes no effort to ensure that it has a critical mass of,say,filipino americans or cambodian americans.tr.of oral arg.as long as there are a sufficient number of asian americans,ut is apparently satisfied.
ut failure to provide any definition of the various racial and ethnic groups is also revealing.ut does not specify what it means to be hispanic,asian american,native american,or white.supp.app.and ut evidently labels each student as falling into only a single racial or ethnic group,see,at,without explaining how individuals with ancestors from different groups are to be characterized.as racial and ethnic prejudice recedes,more and more students will have parents or grandparents who fall into more than one of ut five groups.according to census figures,individuals describing themselves as members of multiple races grew by from to a recent survey reported that of hispanics and of marry a spouse of a different race or ethnicity ut crude classification system is ill suited for the more integrated country that we are rapidly becoming.ut assumes that if an applicant describes himself or herself as a member of a particular race or ethnicity,that applicant will have a perspective that differs from that of applicants who describe themselves as members of different groups.but is this necessarily so if an applicant has one grandparent,or who was a member of a favored group,is that enough to permit ut to infer that this student classroom contribution will reflect a distinctive perspective or set of experiences associated with that group ut does not say.it instead relies on applicants to classify themselves.fisher i,at slip,at.this is an invitation for applicants to game the system.
finally,it seems clear that the lack of classroom diversity is attributable in good part to factors other than the representation of the favored groups in the ut student population.ut offers an enormous number of classes in a wide range of subjects,and it gives undergraduates a very large measure of freedom to choose their classes.ut also offers courses in subjects that are likely to have special appeal to members of the minority groups given preferential treatment under its challenged plan,and this of course diminishes the number of other courses in which these students can enroll.see,supp.app.indicating that the representation of and hispanics in ut classrooms varies substantially from major to major.having designed an undergraduate program that virtually ensures a lack of classroom diversity,ut is poorly positioned to argue that this very result provides a justification for racial and ethnic discrimination,which the constitution rarely allows.
ut purported interest in intraracial diversity,or diversity within diversity,brief for respondents,also falls short.at bottom,this argument relies on the unsupported assumption that there is something deficient or at least radically different about the and hispanic students admitted through the top ten percent plan.
throughout this litigation,ut has repeatedly shifted its position on the need for intraracial diversity.initially,in the proposal,ut did not rely on this alleged need at all.rather,the proposal examined two metrics classroom diversity and demographic disparities that it concluded were relevant to its ability to provide the benefits of diversity.brief for united states as amicus curiae.those metrics looked only to the numbers of and hispanics,not to diversity within each group.
on appeal to the fifth circuit and in fisher i,however,ut began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument.ut complained that the top ten percent law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of texas where there are schools.these students,ut argued,tend to come from poor,disadvantaged families,and the university would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented minorities.in particular,ut asserted a need for more and hispanic students from privileged backgrounds.see,brief for respondents in,at explaining that ut needs admissions in order to admit t he or hispanic child of successful professionals in dallas ibid.claiming that privileged minorities have great potential for serving as a bridge in promoting understanding,as well as in breaking down racial stereotypes ibid.intimating that the underprivileged minority students admitted under the top ten percent plan reinforc e stereotypical assumptions tr.of oral arg,a lthough the percentage plan certainly helps with minority admissions,by and large,the the minorities who are admitted tend to come from segregated,schools,and we want minorities from different backgrounds thus,the top ten percent law is faulted for admitting the wrong kind of and hispanic students.
the fifth circuit embraced this argument on remand,endorsing ut claimed need to enroll minorities from high schools,at.according to the fifth circuit,these more privileged minorities bring a perspective not captured by students admitted under the top ten percent law,who often come from highly segregated,underfunded,and underperforming schools.ibid.for instance,the court determined,privileged minorities can enrich the diversity of the student body in distinct ways because such students have higher levels of preparation and better prospects for admission to ut austin more demanding colleges than underprivileged minorities,at see also fisher,at,concluding that the top ten percent plan widens the credentials gap between minority and students at the university,which risks driving away matriculating minority students from difficult majors like business or the sciences 
remarkably,ut now contends that petitioner has fabricat ed the argument that it is seeking affluent minorities.brief for respondents.that claim is impossible to square with ut prior statements to this court in the briefing and oral argument in fisher moreover,although ut reframes its argument,it continues to assert that it needs affirmative action to admit privileged minorities.for instance,ut brief highlights its interest in admitting t he black student with high grades from andover.brief for respondents.similarly,at oral argument,ut claimed that its interests in the educational benefits of diversity would not be met if all of the minority students were coming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds.tr.of oral arg,see also,at.
ultimately,ut intraracial diversity rationale relies on the baseless assumption that there is something wrong with and hispanic students admitted through the top ten percent plan,because they are from the,racially identifiable schools.at see,at explaining that the basis for ut conclusion that it was not getting a variety of perspectives among or hispanics was the fact that the top ten percent plan admits underprivileged minorities from highly segregated schools.in effect,ut asks the court to assume without any evidence that minorities admitted under the top ten percent law are somehow more homogenous,less dynamic,and more undesirably stereotypical than those admitted under holistic review.at garza,dissenting.and ut assumptions appear to be based on the pernicious stereotype that the and hispanics admitted through the top ten percent plan only got in because they did not have to compete against very many whites and.see tr.of oral arg.these are the very stereotypical assumptions that the equal protection clause forbids.miller,at.ut can not satisfy its burden by attempting to substitute racial stereotype for evidence,and racial prejudice for reason.calhoun united states,slip,at sotomayor,respecting denial of certiorari.
in addition to relying on stereotypes,ut argument that it needs racial preferences to admit privileged minorities turns the concept of affirmative action on its head.when affirmative action programs were first adopted,it was for the purpose of helping the disadvantaged.see,bakke,at opinion of powell,explaining that the school affirmative action program was designed to increase the representation of economically educationally disadvantaged applicants now we are told that a program that tends to admit poor and disadvantaged minority students is inadequate because it does not work to the advantage of those who are more fortunate.this is affirmative action gone wild.
it is also far from clear that ut assumptions about the socioeconomic status of minorities admitted through the top ten percent plan are even remotely accurate.take,for example,parental education.in,when petitioner applied to ut,approximately of texans aged years or older had a high school diploma,had a bachelor degree,and had a graduate or professional degree.of,nat.center for educ.statistics,snyder dillow,digest of education statistics.in contrast,of admitted through the top ten percent plan had a parent with a high school diploma,had a parent with a bachelor degree,and had a parent with a graduate or professional degree.see ut,office of admissions,student profile,admitted freshman class of,student profile,online at https.com s.similarly,of hispanics admitted through the top ten percent plan had a parent with a high school diploma,had a parent with a bachelor degree,and had a parent with a graduate or professional degree.ibid.as these statistics make plain,the minorities that ut characterizes as coming from depressed socioeconomic backgrounds,tr.of oral arg,generally come from households with education levels exceeding the norm in texas.
or consider income levels.in,the median annual household income in texas was.united states census bureau,noss,household income for states and,online at.the household income levels for top ten percent and hispanic admittees were on par roughly half of such admittees came from households below the texas median,and half came from households above the median.see student profile.and a large portion of these admittees are from households with income levels far exceeding the texas median.specifically,of and of hispanics admitted through the top ten percent plan in were raised in households with incomes exceeding.ibid.in light of this evidence,ut actual argument is not that it needs affirmative action to ensure that its minority admittees are representative of the state of texas.rather,ut is asserting that it needs affirmative action to ensure that its minority students disproportionally come from families that are wealthier and better educated than the average texas family.
in addition to using socioeconomic status to falsely denigrate the minority students admitted through the top ten percent plan,ut also argues that such students are academically inferior.see,brief for respondents in,at t he top law systematically hinders ut efforts to assemble a class that is academically excellent on average,ut claims,and hispanic holistic admits have higher sat scores than their top counterparts.brief for respondents.as a result,ut argues that it needs admissions to enroll academically superior minority students with higher sat scores.regrettably,the majority seems to embrace this argument as well.see ante,at t he equal protection clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence 
this argument fails for a number of reasons.first,it is simply not true that top ten percent minority admittees are academically inferior to holistic admittees.in fact,as ut president explained in,top percent high school students make much higher grades in college than percent students,and s trong academic performance in high school is an even better predictor of success in college than standardized test scores.app.see also lavergne deposition agreeing that it generally true that students admitted pursuant to hb the top ten percent law have a higher level of academic performance at the university than students admitted outside of hb indeed,the statistics in the record reveal that,for each year between and,freshmen who were admitted under the top ten percent law earned a higher mean grade point average than those admitted outside of the top ten percent law.supp.app.the same is true for hispanic students,at.these conclusions correspond to the results of nationwide studies showing that high school grades are a better predictor of success in college than sat scores 
it is also more than a little ironic that ut uses the sat,which has often been accused of reflecting racial and cultural bias as a reason for dissatisfaction with poor and disadvantaged and hispanic students who excel both in high school and in college.even if the sat does not reflect such bias and i am ill equipped to express a view on that subject,sat scores clearly correlate with wealth 
ut certainly has a compelling interest in admitting students who will achieve academic success,but it does not follow that it has a compelling interest in maximizing admittees sat scores.approximately institutions do not require the sat or act as part of the admissions process.see soares,sat wars the case for college admissions.this includes many excellent schools 
to the extent that intraracial diversity refers to something other than admitting privileged minorities and minorities with higher sat scores,ut has failed to define that interest with any clarity.ut has not provided any concrete targets for admitting more minority students possessing the unique characteristics it desires,at garza,dissenting.nor has ut specified which characteristics,viewpoints,and life experiences are supposedly lacking in the and hispanics admitted through the top ten percent plan.in fact,because ut administrators make no collective,qualitative assessment of the minorities admitted automatically,they have no way of knowing which attributes are missing.see ante,at admitting that there is no way of knowing how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review at garza,dissenting the university does not assess whether top ten percent law admittees exhibit sufficient diversity within diversity,whether the requisite change agents are among them,and whether these admittees are able,collectively or individually,to combat pernicious stereotypes furthermore,ut has not identified when,if ever,its goal which remains undefined for qualitative diversity will be reached.at.ut intraracial diversity rationale is thus too imprecise to permit strict scrutiny analysis.
finally,ut shifting positions on intraracial diversity,and the fact that intraracial diversity was not emphasized in the proposal,suggest that it was not the actual purpose underlying the discriminatory classification.mississippi for women hogan.instead,it appears to be a post hoc rationalization.
ut also alleges and the majority embraces an interest in avoiding feelings of loneliness and isolation among minority students.ante,at see brief for respondents.in support of this argument,they cite only demographic data and anecdotal statements by ut officials that some students we are not told how many feel isolated.this vague interest can not possibly satisfy strict scrutiny.
if ut is seeking demographic parity to avoid isolation,that is impermissible racial balancing.see part,supra.and linking racial loneliness and isolation to state demographics is illogical.imagine,for example,that an student attends a university that is.if racial isolation depends on a comparison to state demographics,then that student is more likely to feel isolated if the school is located in mississippi which is than if it is located in montana which is.see united states census bureau,quickfacts,online at https.in reality,however,the student may feel if anything less isolated in mississippi,where are more prevalent in the population at large.
if,on the other hand,state demographics are not driving ut interest in avoiding racial isolation,then its treatment of students is hard to understand.as the district court noted,the gross number of hispanic students attending ut exceeds the gross number of students.supp,at.in,for example,ut enrolled hispanic freshmen and freshmen.supp.app.ut never explains why the hispanic students but not the students are isolated and lonely enough to receive an admissions boost,notwithstanding the fact that there are more hispanics than in the student population.the anecdotal statements from ut officials certainly do not indicate that hispanics are somehow lonelier than.
ultimately,ut has failed to articulate its interest in preventing racial isolation with any clarity,and it has provided no clear indication of how it will know when such isolation no longer exists.like ut purported interests in demographic parity,classroom diversity,and intraracial diversity,its interest in avoiding racial isolation can not justify the use of racial preferences.
even assuming ut is correct that,under grutter,it need only cite a generic interest in the educational benefits of diversity,its plan still fails strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored.narrow tailoring requires a careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.fisher i,at slip,at.if a nonracial approach could promote the substantial interest about as well and at tolerable administrative expense,then the university may not consider race.at slip,at citations omitted.here,there is no evidence that,holistic review would not achieve ut goals at least about as well as ut policy.in addition,ut could have adopted other approaches to further its goals,such as intensifying its outreach efforts,uncapping the top ten percent law,or placing greater weight on socioeconomic factors.
the majority argues that none of these alternatives is a workable means for the university to attain the benefits of diversity it sought.ante,at.tellingly,however,the majority devotes only a single,conclusory sentence to the most obvious alternative,holistic review that considers the applicant unique characteristics and personal circumstances.see ibid under a system that combines the top ten percent plan with,holistic review,ut could still admit the star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training,the talented young biologist who struggled to maintain grades in humanities classes,and the student whose grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself back on track in her last three years of school.ante,at.all of these unique circumstances can be considered without injecting race into the process.because ut has failed to provide any evidence whatsoever that holistic review will achieve its diversity objectives more effectively than holistic review,it can not satisfy the heavy burden imposed by the strict scrutiny standard.
the fact that ut racial preferences are unnecessary to achieve its stated goals is further demonstrated by their minimal effect on ut diversity.in,when race was not a factor,of ten percent texas enrollees were and were hispanic.see supp.app.it would stand to reason that at least the same percentages of and hispanic students would have been admitted through holistic review in even if race were not a factor.if that assumption is correct,then race was determinative for only students and hispanic students in representing and,respectively,of the total enrolled freshmen from texas high schools.see ibid 
the majority contends that t he fact that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of narrow tailoring,not evidence of unconstitutionality.ante,at.this argument directly contradicts this court precedent.because racial classifications are a highly suspect tool,grutter,s,at,they should be employed only as a last resort,croson,at opinion of kennedy,see also grutter,supra,at r acial classifications,however compelling their goals,are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands where,as here,racial preferences have only a slight impact on minority enrollment,a alternative likely could have reached the same result.see parents involved,at holding that the minimal effect of school districts racial classifications casts doubt on the necessity of using such classifications and suggests that other means of achieving their objectives would be effective as justice kennedy once aptly put it,the small number of students affected suggests that the schoo l could have achieved its stated ends through different means.at opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment.and in this case,a alternative could accomplish ut objectives without gratuitously branding the covers of tens of thousands of applications with a bare racial stamp and tell ing each student he or she is to be defined by race.at.
the majority purports to agree with much of the above analysis.the court acknowledges that because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,r ace may not be considered by a university unless the admissions process can withstand strict scrutiny.ante,at.the court admits that the burden of proof is on ut,ante,at,and that a university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a plan,ante,at.and the court recognizes that the record here is almost devoid of information about the students who secured admission to the university through the plan,and that t he court thus can not know how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review.ante,at.this should be the end of the case without identifying what was missing from the and hispanic students it was already admitting through its process,and without showing how the use of admissions could rectify the deficiency,ut can not demonstrate that its procedure is narrowly tailored.
yet,somehow,the majority concludes that petitioner must lose as a result of ut failure to provide evidence justifying its decision to employ racial discrimination.tellingly,the court frames its analysis as if petitioner bears the burden of proof here.see ante,at.but it is not the petitioner burden to show that the consideration of race is unconstitutional.to the extent the record is inadequate,the responsibility lies with ut.for w hen a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny,it can not construe ambiguities in favor of the state,parents involved,supra,at opinion of kennedy,particularly where,as here,the summary judgment posture obligates the court to view the facts in the light most favorable to petitioner,see matsushita industrial zenith radio.
given that the university bears the burden of proof,it is not surprising that ut never made the argument that it should win based on the lack of evidence.ut instead asserts that if the court believes there are any deficiencies in the record that cast doubt on the constitutionality of ut policy,the answer is to order a trial,not to grant summary judgment.brief for respondents see also,at i f this court has any doubts about how the top law works,or how ut holistic plan offsets the tradeoffs of the top law,the answer is to remand for a trial nevertheless,the majority cites three reasons for breaking from the normal strict scrutiny standard.none of these is convincing.
first,the court states that,while th e evidentiary gap perhaps could be filled by a remand to the district court for further factfinding in an ordinary case,that will not work here because w hen petitioner application was rejected,the university combined approach to admission had been in effect for just three years,so further factfinding might yield little insight.ante,at.this reasoning is dangerously incorrect.the equal protection clause does not provide a grace period for racial discrimination.under strict scrutiny,ut was required to identify evidence that admissions were necessary to achieve a compelling interest before it put them in place not three or more years after.see ante,at petitioner is correct that a university bears a heavy burden in showing that it had not obtained the educational benefits of diversity before it turned to a plan emphasis added fisher i,at slip,at s trict scrutiny imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating,before turning to racial classifications,that available,workable alternatives do not suffice emphasis added.ut failure to obtain actual evidence that racial preferences were necessary before resolving to use them only confirms that its decision to inject race into admissions was a reflexive response to grutter and that ut did not seriously consider whether means would serve its goals as well as a process.
second,in an effort to excuse ut lack of evidence,the court argues that because the university lacks any authority to alter the role of the top ten percent plan,it similarly had no reason to keep extensive data on the plan or the students admitted under it particularly in the years before fisher i clarified the stringency of the burden for a school that employs review.ante,at.but ut has long been aware that it bears the burden of justifying its racial discrimination under strict scrutiny.see,brief for respondents in,at it is undisputed that ut consideration of race in its holistic admissions process triggers strict scrutiny,and that inquiry is undeniably rigorous in light of this burden,ut had every reason to keep data on the students admitted through the top ten percent plan.without such data,how could ut have possibly identified any characteristics that were lacking in top ten percent admittees and that could be obtained via admissions how could ut determine that employing a process would serve its goals better than,for instance,expanding the top ten percent plan ut could not possibly make such determinations without studying the students admitted under the top ten percent plan.its failure to do so demonstrates that ut unthinkingly employed a process without examining whether the use of race was actually necessary.this is not as the court claims a effor t to comply with the law.ante,at.
the majority willingness to cite ut good faith as the basis for excusing its failure to adduce evidence is particularly inappropriate in light of ut absence of good faith.since ut described its admissions policy to this court in fisher i,it has been revealed that this description was incomplete.as explained in an independent investigation into ut admissions,ut maintained a clandestine admissions system that evaded public scrutiny until a former admissions officer blew the whistle in.see kroll,university of texas at austin investigation of admissions practices and allegations of undue influence,kroll report.under this longstanding,secret process,university officials regularly overrode normal holistic review to allow politically connected individuals such as donors,alumni,legislators,members of the board of regents,and ut officials and faculty to get family members and other friends admitted to ut,despite having grades and standardized test scores substantially below the median for admitted students,at see also blanchard hoppe,influential texans helped underqualified students get into ut,dallas morning news,july,online at education headlines influential.ece dozens of highly influential texans including lawmakers,millionaire donors and university regents helped underqualified students get into the university of texas,often by writing to ut officials,records show 
ut officials involved in this covert process intentionally kept few records and destroyed those that did exist.see,kroll report efforts were made to minimize paper trails and written lists during this process.at one meeting,the administrative assistants tried not keeping any notes,but this proved difficult,so they took notes and later shredded them.one administrative assistant usually brought to these meetings a stack of index cards that were subsequently destroyed see also,at finding that written records or notes of the secret admissions meetings are not maintained and are typically shredded and in the course of this litigation,ut has been less than forthright concerning its treatment of applicants.compare,tr.of oral arg,university of texas does not do legacy,your honor and app.o ur legacy policy is such that we do consider legacy with kroll report discussing evidence that influence results each year in certain applicants receiving a competitive boost or special consideration in the admissions process,and noting that this is an aspect of the admissions process that does not appear in the public representations of admissions process despite ut apparent readiness to mislead the public and the court,the majority is willing to be satisfied by ut profession of its own good faith.grutter,at kennedy,dissenting 
notwithstanding the majority claims to the contrary,ut should have access to plenty of information about how students admitted solely based on their class rank differ in their contribution to diversity from students admitted through holistic review.ante,at.ut undoubtedly knows which students were admitted through the top ten percent plan and which were admitted through holistic review.see,supp.app.and it undoubtedly has a record of all of the classes in which these students enrolled.see,ut,office of the registrar,transcript official,online at https instructing graduates on how to obtain a transcript listing a comprehensive record of classes taken.ut could use this information to demonstrate whether the top ten percent minority admittees were more or less likely than the holistic minority admittees to choose to enroll in the courses lacking diversity.
in addition,ut assigns pai scores to all students including those admitted through the top ten percent plan for purposes of admission to individual majors.accordingly,all students must submit a full application containing essays,letters of recommendation,a resume,a list of courses taken in high school,and a description of any extracurricular activities,leadership experience,or special circumstances.see app,at,garza,dissenting.unless ut has destroyed these files it could use them to compare the unique personal characteristics of top ten minority admittees with those of holistic minority admittees,and to determine whether the top ten admittees are,in fact,less desirable than the holistic admittees.this may require ut to expend some resources,but that is an appropriate burden in light of the strict scrutiny standard and the fact that all of the relevant information is in ut possession.the cost of factfinding is a strange basis for awarding a victory to ut,which has a huge budget,and a loss to petitioner,who does not.
finally,while i agree with the majority and the fifth circuit that fisher i significantly changed the governing law by clarifying the stringency of the strict scrutiny standard that does not excuse ut from meeting that heavy burden.in adarand,for instance,another case in which the court clarified the rigor of the strict scrutiny standard,the court acknowledged that its decision alter ed the playing field in some important respects.at.as a result,it remand ed the case to the lower courts for further consideration in light of the principles it had announced.ibid.emphasis added.in other words,the court made clear that notwithstanding the shift in the law the government had to meet the clarified burden it was announcing.the court did not embrace the notion that its decision to alter the stringency of the strict scrutiny standard somehow allowed the government to automatically prevail.
third,the majority notes that this litigation has persisted for many years,that petitioner has already graduated from another college,that ut policy may have changed over time,and that this case may offer little prospective guidance.at most,these considerations counsel in favor of dismissing this case as improvidently granted.but see,gratz,at,and,rejecting the dissent argument that,because the case had already persisted long enough for the petitioners to graduate from other schools,the case should be dismissed,at stevens,dissenting.none of these considerations has any bearing whatsoever on the merits of this suit.the majority can not side with ut simply because it is tired of this case.
it is important to understand what is and what is not at stake in this case.what is not at stake is whether ut or any other university may adopt an admissions plan that results in a student body with a broad representation of students from all racial and ethnic groups.ut previously had a plan that it claimed had effectively compensated for the loss of affirmative action,app,and ut could have taken other steps that would have increased the diversity of its admitted students without taking race or ethnic background into account.
what is at stake is whether university administrators may justify systematic racial discrimination simply by asserting that such discrimination is necessary to achieve the educational benefits of diversity,without explaining much less proving why the discrimination is needed or how the discriminatory plan is well crafted to serve its objectives.even though ut has never provided any coherent explanation for its asserted need to discriminate on the basis of race,and even though ut position relies on a series of unsupported and noxious racial assumptions,the majority concludes that ut has met its heavy burden.this conclusion is remarkable and remarkably wrong.
because ut has failed to satisfy strict scrutiny,i respectfully dissent.

in particular,the fifth circuit willful blindness to students is absolutely shameless.for instance,one of the fifth circuit primary contentions which ut repeatedly highlighted in its brief and at argument is that,given the sat score gaps between whites on the one hand and and hispanics on the other,holistic admissions would approach an enterprise in the absence of racial preferences,at.in making this argument,the court below failed to mention.the reason for this omission is obvious as indicated in the very sources that the fifth circuit relied on for this point,on the very pages it cited,enrollees admitted to ut through holistic review have consistently higher average sat scores than white enrollees admitted through holistic review.see ut,office of admissions,implementation and results of the texas automatic admissions law hb at the university of texas at austin,demographic analysis of entering freshmen fall of,cited at,at,ut,office of admissions,implementation and results of the texas automatic admissions law hb at the university of texas at austin,demographic analysis of entering freshmen fall of,cited at,at.the fifth circuit intentional omission of from its analysis is also evident in the appendices to its opinion,which either omit any reference to or misleadingly label them as other.see,at.the reality of how ut treats applicants apparently does not fit into the neat story the fifth circuit wanted to tell.
