federal law statutes of limitations in certain tort actions involving personal injury or property damage arising from the release of a hazardous substance,pollutant,or contaminant into the environment.petitioner cts corporation sold property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an electronics plant.years later,respondents,the owners of portions of that property and adjacent landowners,sued,alleging damages from the stored contaminants.cts moved to dismiss,citing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than years after the defendant last culpable act.because cts last act occurred when it sold the property,the district court granted the motion.finding ambiguous,the fourth circuit reversed,holding that the statute remedial purpose favored.
held the judgment is reversed.
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court with respect to all but part,concluding that does not state statutes of repose.
a the outcome here turns on whether distinguishes between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose,which are both used to limit the temporal extent or duration of tort liability.there is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two,but their specified time periods are measured differently and they seek to attain different purposes and objectives.statutes of limitations are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues.statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time and are measured from the date of the defendant last culpable act or omission.the application of equitable tolling underscores their difference in purpose.because a statute of limitations purpose is not furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing,equitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute.the purpose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances,and equitable tolling does not apply.
b the text and structure of resolve this case.under that provision,is characterized as an e xception,a,to the regular rule that the the statute of limitations established under state law applies.the applicable limitations period,the commencement date of which is subject to,is defined as the period specified in a statute of limitations.b.that term appears four times,and statute of repose does not appear at all.while it is apparent from the historical development of the two terms that their general usage has not always been precise,their distinction was well enough established to be reflected in the study group report that guided enactment,acknowledged the distinction,and urged the repeal of both types of statutes.because that distinction is not similarly reflected in,it is proper to conclude that congress did not intend to statutes of repose.
other textual features further support this conclusion.it would be awkward to use the singular applicable limitations period to mandate of two different time periods with two different purposes.and the definition of that limitations period as the period during which a civil action under state law may be brought,b,presupposes that a civil action exists.a statute of repose,in contrast,can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into existence.section inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that the statute reach is limited to statutes of limitations,which traditionally have been subject to tolling.respondents contend that also effects an implied because statutes of repose create an obstacle to congress purposes and objectives,see wyeth levine.but the level of generality at which the statute purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will further or hinder that purpose.here,where congress chose to leave many areas of state law untouched,respondents have not shown that statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of statutory purposes.

section adopts what is known as the discovery rule.under this framework,statutes of limitations in covered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers,or reasonably should have discovered,that the harm in question was caused by the contaminant.a person who is exposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show signs of resulting injury for many years,and so congress enacted out of concern for long latency periods.
it is undoubted that the discovery rule in state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with its terms.the question presented in this case is whether also state statutes of repose.
a divided panel of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit held that does statutes of repose.that holding was in error,and,for the reasons that follow,the judgment of the court of appeals must be reversed.
congress enacted cercla in to promote the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.burlington united states,quoting consolidated edison of new york ugi utilities.the act provided a federal cause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable entities but not a federal cause of action for personal injury or property damage.instead,cercla directed preparation of an expert report to determine the adequacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in providing legal redress for harm to man and the environment caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment,including barriers to recovery posed by existing statutes of limitations.e,f.

congress did not wait long for states to respond to some or all of the report recommendations.instead,congress decided to act at the federal level.congress amended cercla in to add the provision now codified in.whether repeals statutes of repose,as the study group report recommended,is the question to be addressed here.

the courts of appeals,as well as the supreme court of south dakota,have rendered conflicting judgments on this question.compare burlington poole chemical,and clark county sioux equipment,with mcdonald sun oil.this court granted certiorari.
the outcome of the case turns on whether makes a distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.statutes of limitations and statutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the temporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.both types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff suit,and in each instance time is the controlling factor.there is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two types of statute.but the time periods specified are measured from different points,and the statutes seek to attain different purposes and objectives.and,as will be explained,mandates a distinction between the two.
in the ordinary course,a statute of limitations creates a time limit for suing in a civil case,based on the date when the claim accrued.black law dictionary ed.black see also heimeshoff hartford life accident ins,slip,at as a general matter,a statute of limitations begins to run when the cause of action accrues that is,when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief quoting bay area laundry and dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of.measured by this standard,a claim accrues in a or action when the injury occurred or was discovered.black.for example,north carolina,whose laws are central to this case,has a statute of limitations that allows a person three years to bring suit for personal injury or property damage,beginning on the date that damage becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant,whichever event first occurs.stat.ann.
a statute of repose,on the other hand,puts an outer limit on the right to bring a civil action.that limit is measured not from the date on which the claim accrues but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.a statute of repose bar s any suit that is brought after a specified time since the defendant acted such as by designing or manufacturing a product,even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a resulting injury.black.the statute of repose limit is not related to the accrual of any cause of action the injury need not have occurred,much less have been discovered.limitations of actions,hereinafter.the repose provision is therefore equivalent to a cutoff,lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,in essence an absolute bar on a defendant temporal liability,at.
although there is substantial overlap between the policies of the two types of statute,each has a distinct purpose and each is targeted at a different actor.statutes of limitations require plaintiffs to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims.black.statutes of limitations promote justice by preventing surprises through plaintiffs revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared.railroad telegraphers railway express agency.statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to bring actions in a timely manner,and for many of the same reasons.but the rationale has a different emphasis.statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.at see also school board of norfolk united states gypsum,s tatutes of repose reflect legislative decisions that as a matter of policy there should be a specific time beyond which a defendant should no longer be subjected to protracted liability internal quotation marks omitted.like a discharge in bankruptcy,a statute of repose can be said to provide a fresh start or freedom from liability.indeed,the double jeopardy clause has been described as a statute of repose because it in part embodies the idea that at some point a defendant should be able to put past events behind him.jones thomas,scalia,dissenting.
one central distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose underscores their differing purposes.statutes of limitations,but not statutes of repose,are subject to equitable tolling,a doctrine that pauses the running of,or tolls,a statute of limitations when a litigant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action.lozano montoya alvarez,slip,at.statutes of repose,on the other hand,generally may not be tolled,even in cases of extraordinary circumstances beyond a plaintiff control.see,lampf,supra,at a period of repose is inconsistent with tolling wright miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.a critical distinction is that a repose period is fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling restatement second of torts,comment g.
equitable tolling is applicable to statutes of limitations because their main thrust is to encourage the plaintiff to pursu e his rights diligently,and when an extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action,the restriction imposed by the statute of limitations does not further the statute purpose.lozano,supra,at slip,at.but a statute of repose is a judgment that defendants should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time,beyond which the liability will no longer exist and will not be tolled for any reason.at.as an illustrative example,under north carolina law statutes of limitations may be tolled but statutes of repose may not.see,monson paramount homes,app.

exception to state statutes 
in the case of any action brought under state law for personal injury,or property damages,which are caused or contributed to by exposure to any hazardous substance,or pollutant or contaminant,released into the environment from a facility,if the applicable limitations period for such action as specified in the state statute of limitations or under common law provides a commencement date which is earlier than the federally required commencement date,such period shall commence at the federally required commencement date in lieu of the date specified in such state statute.
state law generally applicable 
except as provided in paragraph,the statute of limitations established under state law shall apply in all actions brought under state law for personal injury,or property damages,which are caused or contributed to by exposure to any hazardous substance,or pollutant or contaminant,released into the environment from a facility.
b definitions.
applicable limitations period 
the term applicable limitations period means the period specified in a statute of limitations during which a civil action referred to in subsection a of this section may be brought.
commencement date 
the term commencement date means the date specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning of the applicable limitations period.
federally required commencement date 
a in general 
except as provided in subparagraph b,the term federally required commencement date means the date the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that the personal injury or property damages referred to in subsection a of this section were caused or contributed to by the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant concerned.
b special rules 
in the case of a minor or incompetent plaintiff,the term federally required commencement date means the later of the date referred to in subparagraph a or the following 
i in the case of a minor,the date on which the minor reaches the age of majority,as determined by state law,or has a legal representative appointed.
ii in the case of an incompetent individual,the date on which such individual becomes competent or has had a legal representative appointed.
on the facts of this case,petitioner does not contend that north carolina statute of limitations bars respondents suit.though the suit was filed in,more than years after petitioner sold the property at issue,respondents allege that they learned about the contamination only in.
the court now examines in more detail the question whether the state statute of repose is by the federal statute.
the court of appeals supported its interpretation of by invoking the proposition that remedial statutes should be interpreted in a liberal manner.the court of appeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute for a conclusion grounded in the statute text and structure.after all,almost every statute might be described as remedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to remedy some problem.and even if the court identified some subset of statutes as especially remedial,the court has emphasized that no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.rodriguez united states,per curiam.congressional intent is discerned primarily from the statutory text.in any event,were the court to adopt a presumption to help resolve ambiguity,substantial support also exists for the proposition that the states coordinate role in government counsels against reading federal laws such as to restrict the states sovereign capacity to regulate in areas of traditional state concern.ftc phoebe putney health system,slip,at.
turning to the statutory text,the court notes first that,in the caption of subsection a,characterizes as an e xception to the regular rule.a.section contains another subsection,with the heading state law generally applicable,that provides the rule that the statute of limitations established under state law shall apply.a.under this structure,state law is not unless it fits into the precise terms of the exception.
the statute defines the applicable limitations period,the commencement date of which is subject to,as a period specified in a statute of limitations.b.indeed,uses the term statute of limitations four times not including the caption,but not the term statute of repose.this is instructive,but it is not dispositive.while the term statute of limitations has acquired a precise meaning,distinct from statute of repose,and while that is its primary meaning,it must be acknowledged that the term statute of limitations is sometimes used in a less formal way.in that sense,it can refer to any provision restricting the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit.see black see also ernst ernst hochfelder.congress has used the term statute of limitations when enacting statutes of repose.see,h b iii i aa ed.creating a statute of repose and placing it in a provision entitled statute of limitations same.and petitioner does not point out an example in which congress has used the term statute of repose.so the court must proceed to examine other evidence of the meaning of the term statute of limitations as it is used in.the parties debate the historical development of the terms statute of limitations and statute of repose in an effort to show how these terms were likely understood in,when congress enacted.it is apparent that the distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose was understood by some courts and scholars before.the restatement of torts noted that i n recent years special statutes of repose have been adopted in some states.the statutory period in these acts is usually longer than that for the regular statute of limitations,but may have run before a cause of action came fully into existence.restatement second of torts,comment 
but that usage,now predominant,then was not the only definition of the two terms.one scholar,writing in,described multiple usages of the terms,including both a usage in which the terms are equivalent and also the modern,more precise usage.mcgovern,the variety,policy and constitutionality of product liability statutes of repose,am,describing a statute of repose as distinct from a statute of limitation because a statute of repose begins to run at a time unrelated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action 
respondents note that an entry in black law dictionary from describes a statute of limitations as follows statutes of limitations are statutes of repose.black ed.that statement likely reflects an earlier,broader usage in which the term statute of repose referred to all provisions delineating the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit.see,pillow roberts,how,statutes of limitation are statutes of repose,and should not be evaded by a forced construction rosenberg north bergen,all statutes limiting in any way the time within which a judicial remedy may be sought are statutes of repose black ed.defining statute of limitations as a statute declaring that no suit shall be maintained unless brought within a specified period after the right accrued.statutes of limitation are statutes of repose ballentine law dictionary ed.similar.that usage does not necessarily support respondents interpretation,because the broad usage of the term statute of repose does not mean that the term statute of limitations must refer to both types of statute.
from all this,it is apparent that general usage of the legal terms has not always been precise,but the concept that statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are distinct was well enough established to be reflected in the study group report,commissioned by congress.in one of its recommendations,the study group report called on states to adopt the discovery rule now embodied in.study group report,pt,at.the report acknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent to statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to the latter did not necessarily include the former.for immediately it went on to state
