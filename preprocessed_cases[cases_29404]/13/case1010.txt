plaintiffs david rajamin et,who mortgaged their homes in or,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,laura taylor swain,judge,dismissing their claims against four trusts the defendant trusts to which their loans and mortgages were assigned in transactions involving the mortgagee bank,and against those trusts trustee,defendant deutsche bank national trust company deutsche bank or the trustee.plaintiffs sought,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated the alleged class members,monetary and equitable relief and a judgment declaring that defendants do not own plaintiffs loans and mortgages,on the ground,inter alia,that parties to the assignment agreements failed to comply with certain terms of those agreements.no class action was certified.the district court,finding that plaintiffs were neither parties to nor beneficiaries of the assignment agreements,and hence lacked standing to pursue these claims,granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that they plausibly asserted standing and asserted plausible claims for relief.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the facts alleged by plaintiffs do not give them standing to pursue the claims they asserted,and we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
we accept the factual allegations in plaintiffs third amended complaint or complaint which incorporated certain factual assertions,declarations,and attached exhibits submitted by defendants at earlier stages of this action as true for purposes of reviewing the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted,see,rothstein ubs ag,cir,or for lack of standing,to the extent that the dismissal was based on the pleadings,see,rent stabilization ass dinkins,cir.the principal factual allegations were as follows.
a.the third amended complaint 
plaintiffs are five individuals and two married couples who had homes in california and who,in or,borrowed sums ranging from to,totaling,from a bank called first franklin,a division of national city bank of indiana first franklin.each plaintiff executed a promissory note secured by a deed of trust on the home equivalent to a mortgage under california law,monterey partnership bangham,cal d,in favor of first franklin.
the notes signed by plaintiffs stated that plaintiffs promise d to pay the stated amounts of principal,plus interest to the order of first franklin third amended complaint emphasis added.see generally,a note payable to order is a type of negotiable instrument.the deeds of trust signed by plaintiffs,samples of which were attached to the complaint,provided in part,in sections titled uniform covenants,that the parties agreed that 
t he note or a partial interest in the note together with this security instrument can be sold one or more times without prior notice to borrower.a sale might result in a change in the entity known as the loan servicer that collects periodic payments due under the note and this security instrument 
third amended complaint exhibit e id.exhibit g.
deutsche bank is the trustee of the four defendant trusts,which were created under the laws of new york.see third amended complaint.the defendant trusts whose names begin with first franklin mortgage loan trust or the initials ffmlt maintain that they were created in connection with securitization transactions involving mortgage loans originated by first franklin between january,and january.see id.see generally blackrock financial management segregated account of ambac assurance,cir residential mortgage loans,rather than being retained by the original mortgagee,may be pooled and sold into trusts created to receive the stream of interest and principal payments from the mortgage borrowers.the right to receive trust income is parceled into certificates and sold to investors,called certificateholders.the trustee hires a mortgage servicer to administer the mortgages by enforcing the mortgage terms and administering the payments.the terms of the securitization trusts as well as the rights,duties,and obligations of the trustee,seller,and servicer are set forth in a pooling and servicing agreement 
the complaint alleged that defendants claim to have purchased plaintiffs loans and mortgages,through intermediaries,from first franklin see third amended complaint and to have the right to collect and receive payment on plaintiffs loans pursuant to written agreements id.each securitization transaction involved written agreements the assignment agreements,one of which was called a pooling and servicing agreement psa.the psas,which by their terms are to be governed by new york law see id,provided,inter alia,for the formation of the relevant trust,the conveyance of a pool of mortgages to deutsche bank,as trustee,the issuance of securities representing interests in the pooled loans,and the servicing of the pooled loans by a loan servicer id.internal quotation marks omitted.defendants claim that in each such transaction,first franklin sold a pool of mortgage loans to a sponsor which,at closing,sold the loans through its affiliate,a depositor,to a trust.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the intention of the parties to the sales and securitization transactions was that deutsche bank would become,as trustee,the legal owner and holder of the notes and deeds of trust originated by first franklin id.internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs challenges to the assignments 
the complaint challenged defendants a ownership of plaintiffs loans and mortgages,b right to collect and receive payment on the loans,and c right to commence or authorize the commencement of foreclosure proceedings where payments have not been made or received see,third amended complaint,on the ground,inter alia,that there was a lack of compliance with provisions of the assignment agreements.first,the complaint alleged that the assignments were defective because plaintiffs mortgage loans were not specifically list ed in mortgage loan schedules or other attachments to the assignment agreements.id,see also id.indeed,according to the complaint,the assignment agreements did not specifically list any promissory note,mortgage or deed of trust that was allegedly sold,transferred,assigned,or conveyed to defendants.id,emphasis added see also id.
the complaint also alleged that assignments by first franklin to deutsche bank of four of plaintiffs deeds of trust were executed and publicly recorded in or,after first franklin had ceased operations and years after the securitization transactions took place.see id.plaintiffs argue that the execution and recordation of these mortgage assignments after the securitization transactions that created the defendant trusts indicate that these mortgages were not included in the mortgage loan pools that were sold to those trusts.
in addition,the complaint alleged that two psa provisions as to documents that were to accompany the conveyance of loans and mortgages to the trusts were not complied with at the time of the securitization transactions.these were a a provision stating that an affiliate of the sponsor has delivered or caused to be delivered to a named custodian the original mortgage note bearing all intervening endorsements necessary to show a complete chain of endorsements from the original payee third amended complaint internal quotation marks omitted see id,and b a similar provision as to delivery of the originals of all intervening assignments of mortgage with evidence of recording thereon evidencing a complete chain of ownership from the originator of the mortgage loan to the last assignee id.internal quotation marks omitted see id.see also id.
alleged injury to plaintiffs 
the complaint implied that plaintiffs made their loan payments to deutsche bank and the defendant trusts.it alleged that defendants claim ed and assert ed that payments we re due to them monthly third amended complaint,and that defendants received and collected money from payments made by lead plaintiffs and class members id.see also id,based upon defendants claims of rights,title and interest in the loans in issue in this action id.see also id.the proposed class is all persons who took loans originated by first franklin in,and and for which deutsche bank claims to act as the trustee and for which defendant trusts have received or collected payments since january.the complaint also alleged that defendants have commenced or authorized the commencement of foreclosure proceedings where payments have not been made or received id,and that i ndividuals and families have lost their homes and real property in foreclosure proceedings based upon the loans including promissory notes,deeds of trust and mortgages in issue in this action id.
the complaint alleged that and sought a declaratory judgment that as a result of the alleged failures with regard to the assignment agreements,deutsche bank and defendant trusts have not obtained ownership over and do not own plaintiffs promissory notes and deeds of trust third amended complaint and have no right to collect and receive payment on the mortgage loans id.and no right to foreclose on plaintiffs real property in the event that payments are not made id.
while alleging that defendants received and collected money from plaintiffs that defendants were not entitled to receive and collect third amended complaint and seeking as restitution and as damages all payments on the mortgage loans in issue money sic collected and received by deutsche bank and defendant trusts and their servicers,agents,employees and representatives id.wherefore a and b see also id,the complaint did not allege or imply that any plaintiff or putative class member made loan payments in excess of amounts due,made loan payments to any entity other than defendants,or was subjected to duplicate billing or duplicate foreclosure actions.
b.the dismissal of the complaint 
defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint on the ground,inter alia,that plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue claims based on alleged violations of agreements to which plaintiffs are not parties.in an opinion filed on march,the district court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted,finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge defendants ownership of the notes and mortgages based on alleged noncompliance with the terms of the psas.see rajamin deutsche bank national trust,civ,wl,at.the court pointed out that 
plaintiffs do not claim to have been parties to the psas,and none of the psas includes provisions indicative of party status for borrowers or mortgagors.the weight of caselaw throughout the country holds that a to a psa lacks standing to assert noncompliance with the psa as a claim or defense unless the is an intended not merely incidental third party beneficiary of the psa.
id.at.the court stated that t he intent to render a a beneficiary must be clear from the face of the psa,and that 
plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that would support plausibly a claim that they are intended beneficiaries of the psas.thus,plaintiffs lack standing to challenge defendants alleged ownership of the notes and deeds of trust or authority to foreclose based on with the psas.
in addition,the district court noted the complaint allegation that mortgage loan schedules accompanying the assignment agreements did not reflect plaintiffs loans.the court rejected that allegation as baseless,finding that the mortgage loan schedules in question,submitted by defendants in support of their motion to dismiss the third amended complaint,do in fact identify the relevant loans.see id.at.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint,arguing,inter alia,that they have a concrete interest in putting to the test defendants claims to own plaintiffs mortgages and mortgage documents.plaintiffs brief on appeal at.although it is not clear whether the status of plaintiffs mortgages was in the record before the district court in when it dismissed the complaint,it is now undisputed that i n or,each plaintiff was declared to be in default on his sic mortgage,and foreclosure proceedings were instituted id.at that i n connection with the institution of said foreclosure proceedings,deutsche bank,as trustee of one of the defendant trusts,claimed to own each plaintiff mortgage id.citing the third amended complaint and that plaintiffs are not seeking to enjoin foreclosure proceedings plaintiffs brief on appeal at.assuming that these concessions have not rendered plaintiffs claims moot,we affirm the district court ruling that plaintiffs lack standing to pursue their challenges to defendants ownership of the loans and entitlement to payments.
t he question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.this inquiry involves both constitutional limitations on jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise.warm seldin.the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing such standing.see,lujan defenders of wildlife,constitutional standing premium mortgage equifax,cir prudential standing.we review de novo a decision as to a plaintiff standing to sue based on the allegations of the complaint and the undisputed facts evidenced in the record.see,rent stabilization ass dinkins,at.i f the court also resolved disputed facts in ruling on standing,we will accept the court findings unless they are clearly erroneous.id.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that plaintiffs established neither constitutional nor prudential standing to pursue the claims they asserted.
constitutional standing 
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing under article iii of the constitution includes the requirement that the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,at internal quotation marks omitted.the record in this case reveals that plaintiffs third amended complaint alleged only injuries that were hypothetical.the chronology of the events alleged helps to make this clear.
plaintiffs alleged that their loan and mortgage transactions with first franklin took place in or see third amended complaint that defendants claim ed and assert ed that payments we re due to them monthly id.and that,for the loans taken out by plaintiffs and the members of the class they seek to represent,defendant trusts have received or collected payments since january,id.plaintiffs asserted that they we re suffering damages with each and every payment to defendants,on the theory that defendants we re not proper parties to receive and collect such payments.id.but plaintiffs acknowledge that they took out the loans in or and were obligated to repay them,with interest and they have not pleaded or otherwise suggested that they ever paid defendants more than the amounts due,or that they ever received a bill or demand from any entity other than defendants.thus,there is no allegation that plaintiffs have paid more than they owed or have been asked to do so.
further,plaintiffs challenge to defendants claim of ownership of plaintiffs loans,implying that the loans are owned by some other entity or entities,is highly implausible,for that would mean that since there was no billing or other collection effort by owners of loans whose principal alone totaled.the suggestion that plaintiffs were in imminent danger or,indeed,any danger of having to make duplicate loan payments is thus entirely hypothetical.
for the same reason,the complaint assertion that defendants have commenced or authorized the commencement of foreclosure proceedings where payments have not been made or received third amended complaint does not indicate an actual or imminent,rather than a conjectural or hypothetical,injury.plaintiffs have acknowledged on this appeal that they were declared in default on their mortgages,and that foreclosure proceedings were instituted by deutsche bank,claiming to own those mortgages,in or.just as there was no allegation in the complaint that any entity other than defendants had demanded payments,there was no allegation of any threat or institution of foreclosure proceedings against any plaintiff by any entity other than defendants.and had there been any entity that asserted a claim conflicting with the right of deutsche bank to foreclose on plaintiffs mortgages,surely the interposition of such a claim would have been alleged in the third amended complaint,which was not filed until.
on appeal,plaintiffs purport to assert injury by arguing that the alleged defects in the assignments of their mortgages would prevent deutsche bank from being able to reconvey clear title to plaintiffs when they pay off their mortgage loans.see plaintiffs brief on appeal at.we note that such an injury was not alleged in the complaint,and it is difficult to view it as other than conjectural or hypothetical,given that plaintiffs,several years ago,defaulted on their loans.see,rajamin deutsche bank national trust,no,wl,at d dist,rajamin california case affirming dismissal,for lack of standing,of rajamin claim for declaratory relief as to deutsche bank ownership of his promissory note,and noting that rajamin home had been sold in foreclosure.
we conclude that plaintiffs failed to allege injuries sufficient to show constitutional standing to pursue their claims.
prudential standing 
even if plaintiffs had article iii standing,we conclude that they lack prudential standing.the prudential standing rule normally bars litigants from asserting the rights or legal interests of others in order to obtain relief from injury to themselves.warth seldin,at.t he plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.id.at.plaintiffs have advanced several theories for prudential standing.each fails.
the breach of contract theory 
the principles that any contractual provision may be waived by implication or express intention of the party for whose benefit the provision inures,wolff munier,whiting turner contracting,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and that strangers may not assert the rights of those who do not wish to assert them,singleton wulff,plurality opinion,underlie the rule adhered to in new york whose law governs the assignment agreements see third amended complaint that the terms of a contract may be enforced only by contracting parties or intended beneficiaries of the contract,see,mendel henry phipps plaza west,mere incidental beneficiaries of a contract are not allowed to maintain a suit for breach of the contract see also restatement second of contracts an incidental beneficiary acquires by virtue of the promise no right against the promisor or the promisee.
this rule has been applied to preclude claims where mortgagors have sought relief from their loan obligations on grounds such as those asserted here.see,cimerring merrill lynch mortgage investors,wl,at n.kings.june,plaintiffs lack standing to allege a claim for breach of the psa because they are not parties to this contract,nor do they allege that they are beneficiaries to the agreement see generally reinagel deutsche bank national trust,cir courts invariably deny mortgagors status to enforce psas.indeed,in an action brought by a successor trustee of another first franklin mortgage loan trust,the appellate division of the new york supreme court appellate division ruled that mortgagors lack standing to assert such breaches,citing as authority the opinion of the district court in this very case while holding that the plaintiff bank was not entitled to summary judgment in its action to foreclose the defendants mortgage,the appellate division affirmed the lower court denial of the defendant mortgagors motion to dismiss the foreclosure complaint,ruling that the defendants 
did not have standing to assert noncompliance with the subj ect lender pooling service agreement see rajamin deutsche bank trust,wl,dist lexis sd.
bank of new york mellon gales,dep t.
here,plaintiffs contend that their loans were not acquired by the defendant trusts pursuant to the assignment agreements of which the psas were part because,plaintiffs allege,parties to those agreements did not perform all of their obligations under the psas.although noncompliance with psa provisions might have made the assignments unenforceable at the instance of parties to those agreements,the district court correctly noted that plaintiffs were not parties to the assignment agreements.and plaintiffs have not shown that the entities that were parties to those agreements intended that plaintiffs whose financial obligations were being bought and sold would in any way be beneficiaries of the assignments.we conclude that the district court properly ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing to enforce the agreements to which they were not parties and of which they were not intended beneficiaries.
plaintiffs also argue that the district court analysis was flawed because plaintiffs are first parties to their mortgage notes and deeds of trust plaintiffs brief on appeal at emphasis added.this argument is far wide of the mark.plaintiffs are not suing for breach or nonperformance of their loan and mortgage agreements those agreements provide,inter alia,that plaintiffs loans can be sold one or more times without prior notice to the b orrower third amended complaint exhibit e id.exhibit g.the notes and deeds of trust to which plaintiffs were parties did not confer upon plaintiffs a right against nonparties to those agreements to enforce obligations under separate agreements to which plaintiffs were not parties.
the breach of trust theory 
in an effort to circumvent their lack of standing to make their contract arguments,plaintiffs argue that assignments failing to comply with the psas violated laws governing trusts.they rely on a new york statute that provides if the trust is expressed in the instrument creating the estate of the trustee,every sale,conveyance or other act of the trustee in contravention of the trust,except as authorized by law,is void.estates,powers and trusts law eptl mckinney.here,the psas are the instruments creating the trust estates,and plaintiffs argue that the psas were contraven ed by the trustee acceptance of mortgage loans conveyed in a manner that did not comply with the procedural formalities that the psas specified,thereby rendering those conveyances void under the statute,plaintiffs brief on appeal at.plaintiffs reliance on trust law is misplaced.
first,as the district court concluded,this argument depends on plaintiffs contention that parties to the assignment agreements violated the terms of the psas.if those agreements were not breached,there is no foundation for plaintiffs contention that any act by the trusts trustee was unauthorized.but as discussed above,plaintiffs,as nonparties to those contracts,lack standing to assert any nonperformance of those contracts.
second,under new york law,only the intended beneficiary of a private trust may enforce the terms of the trust.see,matter of the estate of mcmanus,mcmanus persons who were not beneficially interested in the trust lack ed standing to challenge the actions of its trustee cashman petrie,mere incidental beneficiaries of a trust can not maintain a suit to enforce the trust naversen gaillard,dep t see also restatement third of trusts a suit against a trustee of a private trust to enjoin or redress a breach of trust or otherwise to enforce the trust may be maintained only by a beneficiary or by a,successor trustee,or other person acting on behalf of one or more beneficiaries.rajamin california case,wl,at a homeowner who gives a deed of trust to secure his repayment of a home loan does not have standing to challenge the foreclosing party authority to act on behalf of the deed of trust beneficiary.where the challengers to a trustee actions are not beneficiaries,and hence lack standing,the court need not decide whether the conduct of the trustee comported with the terms of the trust.mcmanus,at,at.
third,even if plaintiffs had standing to make an argument based on eptl,on the theory that a mortgagor has standing to challenge a mortgage assignment as invalid,ineffective,or void,woods wells fargo bank,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the weight
