luis noel cruz appeals from a final judgment of conviction entered on january,in the united states district court for the western district of new york arcara,judge.he argues that his convictions for drug distribution under a must be dismissed as lesser included offenses of his convictions for drug distribution within feet of a school under the district court misunderstood its authority to depart from a sentence of years imprisonment the district court sentencing cruz to years based on its own findings of drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence violated his right to due process under apprendi new jersey,d cruz was denied a fair trial due to the admission of testimony suggesting that he had taken part in other crimes and the district court improperly enhanced his offense level based on his attempted obstruction of justice.cruz prevails on his first two arguments,and we therefore vacate the convictions under a and remand the case to the district court for resentencing,which shall include a determination of whether a downward departure would be appropriate.we find,however,that cruz remaining arguments are without merit,and so affirm the district court as to those issues.
background 
following a jury trial,cruz was convicted of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute grams or more of cocaine base,in violation of two counts of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base and cocaine,respectively,in violation of a two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and cocaine,respectively,within feet of a public school,in violation of a the schoolyard counts and one count of use of a person under to assist in the distribution of cocaine base and cocaine,in violation of a and a.
the evidence presented to the jury showed that cruz had engaged in three separate drug transactions on august,august,and september.the parties stipulated to the quantity and type of drugs recovered in each transaction together,the sales involved a total of grams of cocaine base or crack cocaine and grams of cocaine.the sale of this quantity of drugs would normally result in a base offense level of.see united states sentencing guidelines c.
however,the united states probation office,in its presentence report,recommended that the district court use a base offense level of in calculating cruz sentence,based on relevant conduct,see id,and also recommended several enhancements,which would result in an adjusted offense level of.regarding relevant conduct,the probation office stated that the confidential informant who was involved in two of the three drug sales charged in the indictment,edwin williams,would testify that he purchased an or approximately grams of cocaine base from cruz every day over a period of two years.taking a conservative estimate of sales over that period of time,the probation office estimated that during this period,cruz sold grams of cocaine base to williams.the probation office also included grams of cocaine base that cruz allegedly offered to sell the undercover officer,timothy taylor,on september.the probation office deemed the grams of powder cocaine sold by cruz on august,to be inconsequential,and so did not include that amount in its calculation of drug quantity.nor did it apparently include the grams of cocaine base cruz sold on august.the probation office calculated the total quantity of drugs to be grams of cocaine base,the distribution of which constitutes a base offense level of.
both the government and the defendant submitted objections to the probation office presentence report,and,on june,the district court held an evidentiary hearing to help determine the quantity of drugs that should be taken into account in calculating cruz sentence.the court heard the testimony of three witnesses,edwin williams the confidential informant,carol belcer williams longtime girlfriend,and rosa santiago,cruz girlfriend at the time of his arrest.following the hearing,the probation office revised its calculations to grams of cocaine base.the district court noted that williams testimony was not altogether clear or consistent regarding the dates when he dealt with defendant or amounts involved in these transactions.nonetheless,the court,in a decision and order dated september,found that williams and belcer testimony was credible enough to allow the court to determine based on a preponderance of the evidence that cruz had sold a quarter ounce of cocaine base to williams every day for a period of six months in,and that he sold varying amounts to williams two or three times a week from april to september of.based on these findings,the court estimated that cruz sold grams of cocaine base in,and grams in.it discounted evidence of other sales as insufficient to meet the evidentiary standard,and declined to resolve whether the grams of cocaine base cruz allegedly offered to sell officer taylor could be used in determining the total drug quantity,as that additional amount would have no effect on the defendant sentence in any event.the court thus found that the defendant had sold grams,or kilograms of cocaine base,and that his base offense level was therefore.because the offense was committed near a school,the court added one level under section a,for a total base offense level of.it then applied the following enhancements two levels for obstruction of justice under section of the sentencing guidelines based on cruz attempt to get his,santiago,to claim that the drugs sold on september,were hers two levels for possession of a firearm under section b and two levels for the use of a minor in committing the offense under section for his use of santiago,then a minor,to hide the drugs involved in the september,deal.thus,the court calculated cruz offense level at,which carries a sentence of life imprisonment under the sentencing guidelines.see ch,pt.a 
because a sentence of life imprisonment exceeds the statutory maximum sentence for any one of the crimes of which cruz was convicted,the district court applied section d of the sentencing guidelines,which provides 
if the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment,then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively,but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.in all other respects,sentences on all counts shall run concurrently,except to the extent otherwise required by law.
d.the court therefore sentenced cruz to the maximum sentence on each count and ran the sentences consecutively,to achieve a sentence equivalent to life imprisonment years.in so doing,the court stated that there no leeway for the court,based on the findings of the court.
ii.discussion 
a.the drug distribution counts 
on double jeopardy grounds,cruz asks that we vacate his convictions on counts two and three of the indictment,which charge him with drug distribution in violation of a,arguing that his conviction on those counts is duplicative of his convictions on the schoolyard counts in violation of a.the government concedes that the a counts are lesser included offenses of the schoolyard counts.we would typically review this double jeopardy argument,which is a question of law,de novo.see united states chacko,cir.however,because it does not appear that this argument was made before the district court,we review for plain error.see.b johnson united states,d.b efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson,at.quoting united states olano,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
in determining whether two counts are duplicative and thus violate a defendant rights under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment,we ask whether each count contains an element not contained in the other.see chacko,at citing blockburger united states.united states dixon,d.if so,the offenses are not the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy,and they can both be prosecuted.chacko,at.if,however,either offense does not contain an element not contained in the other,the offenses are considered the same offense for double jeopardy purposes,and a defendant can not be convicted of both.here,counts two and four both charge the defendant with the knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute and with distribution of cocaine base on august.the only difference between the two counts is that count four,the schoolyard count,contains the additional element that a statement that the defendant committed the acts alleged within one thousand feet of a public school.similarly,counts three and five both charge the defendant with the knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute and with distribution of cocaine on august,with count five containing the additional element that the possession and distribution occurred within one thousand feet of a school.thus,while counts four and five each contain an element not contained in counts two and three,the reverse is not true.no element of possession and distribution of cocaine base and cocaine under a is not also an element of distribution within one thousand feet of a school under.see,united states kakatin,cir,cert.denied,d finding that a is a lesser included offense of united states,cir,cert.denied sub nom.united states,d same.hence,cruz can not be convicted under both a and for the same transactions.
although we have never explicitly stated that a and constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes,the elements test cited above dates back to the supreme court decision in blockburger united states,its application is routine,and the matter before us yields but one conclusion.we now join our sister circuits who,in addressing this issue,have uniformly held that a is a lesser included offense of a violation of.see kakatin,at,at united states scott,cir.in the instant case,the overlap between the distribution counts and the schoolyard counts is clear on the face of the indictment.we therefore find that the error here was plain.it certainly also affects substantial rights here,the right of the defendant under the fifth amendment not to be convicted twice for the same offense.moreover,the error seriously affects the fairness of judicial proceedings.the judgment of conviction entered on counts two and three must thus be vacated,and the case remanded to the district court for entry of a new judgment and sentence based solely on the remaining counts of the indictment.
apprendi new jersey 
cruz advances three distinct challenges to his sentence based on the supreme court recent decision in apprendi new jersey,d.as there was understandably no objection below the proceedings having occurred before the supreme court pronouncement,we review for plain error.see.b johnson,at.in apprendi,the supreme court held that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.the court therefore held that a statutory scheme that allowed a sentencing court to increase the maximum punishment for possession of a firearm from ten to twenty years based on its own determination by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race,color,gender,handicap,religion,sexual orientation or ethnicity violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at,citation omitted.rejecting a formalistic distinction between elements of the offense and sentencing factors,the court ruled that it was impermissible to rely on a fact not found by the jury other than a prior conviction to impose a sentence above a statutory maximum.id.at.
cruz first argument is based on the penalty provisions contained in sections and of title of the united states code.section a defines the crime of distribution of a controlled substance,and section b sets forth different penalties for violations of section a depending on the quantity and type of drugs involved.see,quoted at notes and,supra,and note,infra.section provides that the penalty for conspiracy is the same as the penalty for the crime that was the object of the conspiracy.see.cruz argues that because the jury in this case was not instructed to determine the quantity of drugs involved,the maximum sentence for counts one,two and three,which allege violations of sections and,should be governed by b c,which sets forth the penalty for selling an indeterminate amount of drugs.section b c provides a maximum sentence of years imprisonment.see b c the district court applied instead section b b,which provides a maximum penalty of years imprisonment for distribution of grams or more of cocaine or grams or more of cocaine base 
in the case at hand,we need not consider whether drug quantity must be found by a jury in order to allow a court to sentence a defendant under any provision other than b c at trial,the parties entered stipulations regarding the type and quantity of drugs involved in the three charged transactions.even if we consider the quantity of drugs involved in the august and,transactions to be inconsequential,as did the district court,see mem.decision and order dated december,at,the parties still stipulated that the september,transaction involved grams of cocaine base,well over the gram minimum required for sentencing under section b b.see stipulation dated.because cruz entered into this stipulation,and because he did not object to the failure of the district court to include drug quantity as an element of the offense in its charge to the jury,any error was harmless see united states champion,cir per curiam united states gonzalez,cir.
cruz second argument is that the district court use of section d of the sentencing guidelines to run his sentences consecutively rather than concurrently effectively increased the penalty to which cruz was subject to a life sentence,based solely on facts determined by a judge by a mere preponderance of the evidence.appellant br.at.we think this contention is problematic.first,in apprendi itself,the supreme court stated that the issue of consecutive sentences in the context of the case at hand was irrelevant to the court determination whether the sentencing court had impermissibly exceeded the statutory maximum for the particular count in question.see apprendi.at.that is,the supreme court concern in apprendi was whether the sentencing court had,on the basis of facts found by the court and not the jury,exceeded the sentence for a particular count.here,the district court did not exceed the maximum for any individual count.it can not therefore be said that,as to any individual count,the court findings resulted in the imposition of a greater punishment than was authorized by the jury verdict.see id.at see united states moreno,no.cr,wl,at,finding that apprendi did not affect the application of section d.
second,and perhaps more important,we are aware of no constitutionally cognizable right to concurrent,rather than consecutive,sentences.providing that for sentences on multiple counts the terms may run concurrently or consecutively.the presumption when congress creates distinct offenses is that it intends to permit cumulative sentences,garrett united states,d,and such sentences are prohibited only if congress did not intend separate punishments,see united states thomas,cir,cert.denied sub nom fisher united states,d.if the offenses charged are set forth in different statutes or in distinct sections of a statute,and each section unambiguously authorizes punishment for a violation of its terms,it is ordinarily to be inferred that congress intended to authorize punishment under each provision.id.at quoting united states marrale,cir.in the case before us,the statutory provisions pursuant to which cruz was convicted do not have the effect of barring consecutive sentences.see moreno,wl,at.moreover,with the exception of his argume
