this appeal requires us to revisit an issue last considered in gibbons savage,cir under what circumstances does the exclusion of the public from a courtroom during voir dire violate a defendant sixth amendment right to a public trial.in gibbons and earlier cases,we identified an exception to this right applicable to situations where the exclusion of the public,though improper,was too trivial to implicate the sixth amendment public trial guarantee,making vacatur of the defendant conviction unnecessary.we conclude that this exception applies here.we further conclude that this exception is consistent with the supreme court recent decision in presley georgia.
accordingly,we reject gupta sixth amendment challenge and affirm his conviction and sentence.we dispose of gupta other arguments on appeal in a separate summary order filed today.
background 
defendant raghubir gupta was charged with one count of immigration fraud under a.trial began on march,at approximately.after the venire panel was seated,the district court gave preliminary remarks concerning the nature of the case,the general responsibilities of jurors,the anticipated length of the trial,and the format of voir dire.the court also identified gupta as the defendant and summarized the indictment.the court then read various questions to the venire from a written questionnaire,which was distributed to the prospective jurors to review.following a short recess,the court called prospective jurors up to a sidebar to discuss their answers to the questionnaire,and after a second recess for lunch,the court posed questions to individual jurors regarding their background and interests.during the course of these questions,eleven jurors were dismissed for cause with the consent of both parties.thereafter,counsel for both parties went to the jury room to exercise their peremptory challenges outside the presence of the venire neither party objected to any of the challenges.the parties then returned to the courtroom,and the courtroom deputy empaneled the jury.after trial,the jury returned a guilty verdict,and the district court sentenced gupta to months imprisonment.gupta appealed.
in april,we granted gupta motion for remand for additional based on his allegation that a friend and a member of his family had been excluded from the courtroom during voir dire.on remand,gupta submitted affidavits from his brother and girlfriend,sudhir gupta and maria young,who affirmed that on the morning of the first day of trial a court officer had asked them to leave the courtroom during voir dire both stated that when they reentered the room later in the day,the jury had already been empaneled.gupta counsel affirmed that he was unaware at the time of trial that gupta brother and girlfriend had been excluded from the courtroom.in lieu of an evidentiary hearing,the district court directed william delaney,the courtroom deputy on duty on the first day of gupta trial,to submit an affidavit describing what had occurred.delaney affirmed that after the venire panel was seated in the courtroom 
at the court direction,in order to accommodate the large number of jurors in the venire panel,and to protect the panel from hearing anything about the case from any member of the public present,i requested that individuals who were not venire panel members leave the courtroom during the jury selection.i conveyed to those individuals that once the jury selection was complete,and there was again space in the public area of the courtroom,they were more than welcome to attend the proceedings.
the district court adopted delaney affidavit as its factual findings,after which jurisdiction was restored to us pursuant to the procedures set forth in united states jacobson,cir.
discussion 
a defendant right to a public trial is guaranteed by the sixth amendment,see waller georgia,and this right extends to voir dire,presley.at t he sixth amendment right to a public trial extends to the voir dire of prospective jurors.citing press enterprise superior court of california,riverside county,the press and public have a first amendment right to attend voir dire,and waller,at the sixth amendment right to a public trial is at least as broad as the first amendment right to a public trial recognized in press enterprise accord gibbons,at.although the public trial guarantee creates a presumption of openness,press enterprise,at,this is not absolute.four criteria must be satisfied to overcome this presumption and justify closure of a courtroom during a criminal proceeding the party seeking to close the proceeding must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding and the trial court must make findings adequate to support the closure.waller,at quoted in presley.at gibbons,at ayala speckard,cir en banc.
based on delaney affidavit,gupta brother and girlfriend were excluded from voir dire because of the large number of jurors in the venire panel and the need to protect the panel from hearing anything about the case from any member of the public present.under waller,these reasons are insufficient to justify a courtroom point the government concedes.see brief of appellee at t he district court exclusion of members of the public from the courtroom during voir dire violated the waller test.see also gibbons,at holding that under waller,insufficient space because of the size of the venire and the risk of tainting the jury pool are not compelling reasons for closure.notwithstanding this fact,the government argues that under our triviality exception,identified in gibbons and earlier cases,the closure of the courtroom did not violate gupta sixth amendment public trial right.gupta counters that gibbons is distinguishable because there,the exclusion of the public was partial and temporary,and that our triviality exception is no longer valid.we address each of these arguments in turn.
i.the triviality exception 
because the parties agree that under waller the district court exclusion of gupta brother and girlfriend during voir dire was unjustified,we must determine whether that error violated gupta sixth amendment rights under these circumstances,our starting point is the triviality exception see smith hollins,cir w hen addressing whether an unjustified closure is a sixth amendment violation,a triviality standard is the proper benchmark.we first identified a triviality exception to the public trial guarantee in peterson 
a triviality standard,properly understood,does not dismiss a defendant claim on the grounds that the defendant was guilty anyway or that he did not suffer prejudice or specific injury.it is,in other words,very different from a harmless error inquiry.it looks,rather,to whether the actions of the court and the effect that they had on the conduct of the trial deprived the defendant whether otherwise innocent or guilty of the protections conferred by the sixth amendment.
at see carson fischer,cir under a triviality analysis,the determination that the exclusion was trivial is tantamount to conclud ing that the error was not significant enough to rise to the level of a constitutional violation.we observed that the core values protected by the sixth amendment were to ensure a fair trial to remind the prosecutor and judge of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions to encourage witnesses to come forward and to discourage perjury.peterson,at citing waller,at.since peterson,we have used these values to determine whether an unjustified closure of a courtroom violates the public trial guarantee.see carson,at t he question of whether a particular closure implicates the sixth amendment turns on whether it undermines the values the amendment is aimed to protect.if a courtroom closure subverts these values,it violates the sixth amendment,but if the closure is consistent with these values,it is trivial and does not implicate a defendant right to a public trial.see morales united states,cir triviality is gauged by the degree to which a particular closure undermines the values the sixth amendment was designed to protect.citing gibbons,at.
we most recently considered the triviality exception in gibbons,which is analogous to the circumstances in this case.there,trial began in the early afternoon,and before inviting the venire into the courtroom,the trial judge excluded the defendant mother,citing the large number of prospective jurors and the need to limit potential contact between the venire and any spectators.see gibbons,at.no spectators were permitted to observe the afternoon proceedings,during which the trial judge gave general instructions to prospective jurors,read the indictment,and questioned individual jurors as to their impartiality.see id.the trial judge,the prosecutor,and defense counsel also went to an adjacent room to talk privately with each prospective juror who had claimed an inability to serve.see id.by the end of the proceedings that day,several prospective jurors were excused with the consent of both parties.see id.and when voir dire resumed the following morning,the defendant mother was allowed into the courtroom to observe the rest of the proceedings.see id.at.
based on these facts,we first held that the reasons articulated by the trial court to justify the exclusion of the defendant mother failed to satisfy the requirements of waller.id.at.applying the triviality exception,however,we concluded that although the exclusion was unjustified,it did not subvert the values underlying the sixth amendment public trial guarantee.see id.at.with regard to the third and fourth values encouraging witnesses to come forward and discouraging perjury we held that these values were not implicated by voir dire because no witnesses testified.id.and as to the first and second values ensuring a fair trial and reminding the prosecutor and judge of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions we held that limiting the presence at the voir dire proceedings to only the attorneys,judge,defendant,and prospective jurors for one afternoon did not subvert these values.id.we emphasized 
even if the trial judge had not excluded gibbons mother from the courtroom,she would not have been able to watch a significant portion of what occurred during that afternoon session because the private interviews of the individual jurors as to their reasons for inability to serve were justifiably conducted in an adjacent room out of the hearing and sight of the other jurors.further,nothing of significance happened during the part of the session that took place in the courtroom.the judge read the indictment,asked questions of a few jurors,and provided administrative details on what the jurors should expect if chosen.no prospective jurors were excused except with the consent of both parties.no peremptory challenges were made,and no obligations were asserted by either party to anything that occurred.the next morning,when voir dire resumed,gibbons mother was allowed to watch the proceedings.
we reach the same conclusion here.because the closed proceedings in the instant case were limited to voir dire,the third and fourth values were not implicated.and as to the first and second values,these too were not implicated because nothing of significance happened.id.the district court gave prospective jurors general information about gupta case,described the charging indictment,and presented jurors with a written questionnaire listing possible grounds for ineligibility.the court also conducted a short sidebar discussion with each prospective juror concerning their responses to the written questionnaire a process that would not have been audible to members of the public,and then posed general questions to the jurors in open court about their background and interests.finally,the court and counsel for both parties adjourned to the jury room to exercise peremptory challenges no objections were made to any of the challenges,and no jurors were dismissed without the consent of both parties.
we find no material difference between these facts and those in gibbons.indeed,the only actual difference is that in the instant case,the parties exercised their peremptory challenges while the proceedings were closed.but because this was done outside the presence of the venire,even if gupta brother and sister had been in the courtroom,they would not have been able to observe these challenges additionally,we reject gupta attempt to distinguish gibbons by characterizing the exclusion in that case as partial and temporary.although the exclusion in gibbons was limited to the first afternoon of voir dire,and not,as in the instant case,to all of the voir dire proceedings,we are not persuaded that this distinction warrants a different outcome.that the public was not excluded for all of voir dire in gibbons was because the jury selection began in the afternoon,leaving insufficient time to complete voir dire before the end of the day.in gupta case,jury selection began in the morning,which allowed the court to complete voir dire that same day.regardless,nowhere in gibbons did we intimate that our holding was limited to situations involving a partial,as opposed to a complete closure,of the voir dire proceedings.the focus of our analysis was what transpired during the closed proceedings.and because what transpired during voir dire in gibbons did not implicate the values underlying the public trial guarantee,and because voir dire in gibbons and the instant case are substantially identical,we see no reason to reach a different conclusion 
finally,we identify a broader,institutional reason that the exclusion here was trivial.historically,public trials emerged in england in response to the excesses and abuses of secret tribunals.see in re oliver,discussing the evolution of the public trial guarantee see generally amar,foreword sixth amendment first principles,geo,cited in peterson,at radin,m,the right to a public trial,temp.cited in in re oliver,at.this was of paramount concern in in re oliver,where a state judge sitting as a grand jury charged,convicted,and sentenced a defendant with contempt during a secret session held in chambers.see in re oliver,at.finding this unconstitutional,justice black,writing for the majority,opined that w hatever other benefits the guarantee to an accused that his trial be conducted in public may confer upon our society,the guarantee has always been recognized as a safeguard against any attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.id.at.for in this respect,t he knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power.see gannett,depasquale,the public trial is rooted in the principle that justice can not survive behind walls of silence.blackmun,concurring in part and dissenting in part quoting sheppard maxwell,cox broadcasting cohn,u,holding that publicity serves to guarantee the fairness of trials and to bring to bear the beneficial effects of public scrutiny upon the administration of justice.
there is no question that a secret trial,insulated from the tempering effect of public witnesses,subverts the core values of the public trial guarantee.but if a public presence best ensures a fair criminal proceeding,then voir dire,by its very nature,is always subject to contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion,in re oliver,at,because the venire is drawn from the public itself.indeed,from their inception,jury trials guaranteed public scrutiny of the criminal process because the presence of a jury insured the presence of a large part of the public.press enterprise,at quoting radin at see radin at we need scarcely be reminded that the jury was the patria,the country and that it was in that capacity and not as judges,that it was summoned.and unlike the jury,which loses its status as mere spectator and becomes an impartial trier of fact once empaneled,members of the venire remain public witnesses during much of the voir dire proceedings,listening to the court questions and observing the conduct of counsel,until such time as they are chosen for the jury,disqualified,or excused for this reason,even where a trial court unjustifiably excludes spectators from the courtroom during voir dire,the presence of the venire lessens the extent to which that closure implicates the defendant public trial right because the venire,derived from and representative of the public,guarantees that the voir dire proceedings will be subject to a substantial degree of continued public review.
we do not mean to say,however,that voir dire is not subject to the same sixth amendment guarantees as other parts of a criminal trial waller,presley,and our own precedent make clear that a defendant right to a public trial unquestionably extends to voir dire.we emphasize only that in many cases the presence of the venire as a public witness safeguards the two relevant values of the public trial a fair trial and reminding the prosecutor and judge of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions.see gibbons,at.indeed,there is little basis to presume that the impartial,public citizens comprising a venire would be any less vigilant in ensuring that the voir dire was fair and that the judge and the prosecutor remained cognizant of their responsibilities as would ordinary spectators observing the voir dire from the back of the courtroom.
ii.the impact of presley georgia 
alternatively,gupta argues that we need not consider whether the triviality exception applies to the exclusion in his case because that exception is no longer valid after presley.we disagree.
presley presented the narrow question of whether the supreme court of georgia correctly applied waller in finding that a trial court exclusion of a spectator during voir dire was proper.presley had argued before the supreme court of georgia that prior to excluding the spectator from the courtroom,the trial court was required to consider alternatives to closure.see.at.but the supreme court of georgia held that based on its review of supreme court precedent,it was not clear whether a court must,sua sponte,advance its own alternatives to closure,and that presley was obliged to present the court with any alternatives that he wished the court to consider.id.alteration in original.the supreme court reversed in a brief per curiam opinion 
in upholding exclusion of the public at juror voir dire,the supreme court of georgia concluded,despite our explicit statements to the contrary,that trial courts need not consider alternatives to closure absent an opposing party proffer of some alternatives.while the supreme court of georgia concluded this was an open question under this court precedents,the statement in waller that the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding settles the point.
id.at quoting waller,at.
presley did not expand the supreme court precedent with respect to the public trial guarantee.see id.the conclusion that trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties is clear from this court precedents.it simply reaffirmed the holding in waller.and because the supreme court held that the supreme court of georgia had misapplied waller from the onset,it had no occasion to consider a triviality exception to the public trial guarantee.accordingly,because it is undisputed that the district court exclusion of gupta brother and girlfriend did not meet the waller test,and because presley simply reaffirms that test,presley does not alter the triviality exception in peterson and our other cases,under which,notwithstanding an unjustified closure,vacatur of a defendant conviction is not warranted if the closure did not subvert the values underlying the public trial guarantee see also morales,at assuming,without deciding,that the triviality exception still applies after presley.
conclusion 
to summarize,we hold although the district court exclusion of gupta brother and girlfriend during voir dire failed to meet the test set forth in waller and now presley,the exclusion was too trivial to implicate gupta sixth amendment right to a public trial and presley does not alter our triviality exception to the public trial guarantee 
we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this case involves the undisclosed exclusion of the public by the trial judge from the entire voir dire in a criminal trial in a federal court.the closure was not requested by anyone and the government readily concedes that the courtroom should not have been closed.neither defense counsel nor government counsel was advised that the closure had occurred.the closure did not come to light until nearly two years after the trial,and the circumstances surrounding the closure did not come to light until this court remanded to the district court for fact finding.
the excuses generated from the district court for the closure insufficient courtroom capacity and the need to protect veniremen from contact with the public do not withstand even the most casual scrutiny.adding insult to serious constitutional injury,the majority air brushes all of this as trivial,reasoning that nothing of significance happened during voir dire and that the veniremen were adequate proxies for the excluded public.this reasoning,which is inconsistent with supreme court law and which would be difficult to take seriously were not the stakes so large,insults the values inherent in the sixth amendment.although other courts have recognized narrow de minimis exceptions to the sixth amendment public trial right,no other court has come close to blessing an undisclosed,complete,unrequested,and intentional closure of an entire voir dire.because the majority approach is misguided and dangerous,i respectfully dissent.
the facts are undisputed.jury selection took place on march,beginning at before the proceedings commenced,the district judge,unbeknownst to counsel,directed her deputy to tell anyone who was not a prospective juror to leave the courtroom for the duration of voir dire.gupta brother and girlfriend and any other spectators present were required to leave.long after the fact,when the closure came to light,the district court,at our direction,offered two purported justifications for excluding the public from voir dire to accommodate the large number of jurors in the venire panel and to protect the panel from hearing anything about the case from any member of the public.the government concedes that neither rationale justified the closure.majority op.at.
with the courtroom closed,the judge,the prosecutors,and defense counsel set about picking a jury.around midday,the court broke for lunch.voir dire resumed at,and concluded in the late afternoon,when the clerk read the names of the fourteen men and women who had been selected.when gupta brother and girlfriend were permitted to reenter the courtroom,the jury had already been seated for opening statements.after a trial that lasted about a week,gupta was convicted of preparing and filing fraudulent immigration documents,and sentenced to months in prison.
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a public trial.const.amend.vi.last year,in presley georgia,the supreme court confirmed that the sixth amendment right to a public trial extends to the voir dire of prospective jurors,accord gibbons savage,cir recognizing that sixth amendment guarantees defendant right to an open,public trial,including during the jury selection.presley built upon the supreme court earlier decision in press enterprise superior court of california,which held that voir dire must be open to the public under the first amendment.in press enterprise,the supreme court found,based on its review of the historical evidence,that jury selections have always been open to the public,for systemically essential reasons since the development of trial by jury,the process of selection of jurors has presumptively been a public process t his open process gave assurance to those not attending trials that others were able to observe the proceedings and enhanced public confidence.at the process of juror selection is itself a matter of importance,not simply to the adversaries but to the criminal justice system.
it is well established that the violation of
