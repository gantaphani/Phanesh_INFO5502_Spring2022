this is an appeal from a july,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york brian cogan,judge,granting the defendants motion to plaintiff esteban gonzalez first,fifth,and eighth amendment claims,brought pursuant to bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,relating to his confinement in the special housing units in two federal prison facilities,both located within the city of new york.the district court concluded that the plaintiff failed to file his complaint within the statute of limitations applicable to bivens claims.the result was premised principally on a determination that the continuing violation doctrine did not apply to any of gonzalez claims.we conclude that the continuing violation doctrine does apply to gonzalez eighth amendment claim,but that it does not apply to his first or fifth amendment claims.certain aspects of his fifth amendment claim may nevertheless be timely.
background 
on february,gonzalez stabbed a fellow inmate at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan the mcc,with a object gonzalez was placed under administrative detention in the special housing unit the shu later that day,and remained confined therein for more than two years,until july.
on july,gonzalez was transferred from the mcc to the metropolitan detention center the mdc in brooklyn,new york.when he arrived,he was immediately placed in the mdc shu.he remained there for more than nine additional months,until on or about may,gonzalez alleges that the mcc warden,defendant dennis hasty,ordered gonzalez transfer to the mdc prior to his reassignment to the post of mdc warden so that hasty could continue to supervise gonzalez.an mcc corrections officer told gonzalez,y ou going to mdc to be with your friend warden hasty.compl.pl.app x.defendant salvatore lopresti,captain of security at the mdc brooklyn,accepted that transfer with the knowledge that it was being made to enable hasty to continue to exercise control over and abuse plaintiff gonzalez.id.
hasty made it known that he had a personal vendetta against gonzalez,and that hasty would not release gonzalez from the shu under any circumstances compl.pl.app x.gonzalez contends that this vendetta was motivated by racial animus,as evidenced by the fact that the federal bureau of prisons bop previously had ordered hasty to remove a confederate flag from his office.
while in the shu,gonzalez was not afforded all of the procedural protections to which he asserts he was entitled under c this rule required that within three work days of an inmate confinement in the shu,a segregation review officer sro review the administrative detention.the sro was further required to review the case outside of the inmate presence for every week of confinement,and hold a formal hearing and review with the inmate present every days.c.the bop was also required to conduct a psychological assessment every days to determine,inter alia,whether the inmate posed an ongoing threat to himself or others.id.
instead of complying with these regulations,the defendants falsified forms to make it appear as though they were in compliance,held unauthorized weekly meetings to determine which inmates were to be released from the shu and returned to general population,compl.pl.app x,and ignored psychological assessments suggesting that gonzalez was not in need of further shu confinement,compl.pl.app x.in sum,gonzalez alleges that the defendants agreed,confederated and conspired with defendant hasty throughout the period of gonzalez confinement in the shu to keep gonzalez unlawfully confined to the shu under harsh conditions compl.pl.app x capitalization altered.
while at the mcc manhattan shu,gonzalez filed at least administrative complaints.six of them,the first of which was filed on may,related to his shu confinement.he exhausted his mcc administrative remedies on november,when the bop denied his last appeal.
while confined in the mdc brooklyn shu,gonzalez filed at least administrative complaints,three of which related to his mdc shu confinement.he filed his first mdc request on february.the bop denied this request on july.he administratively exhausted all of his mdc remedies on august,when the bop denied his last request.
as noted,gonzalez was released from the mdc shu on may,which was shortly after hasty retired.the district court accordingly concluded that the statute of limitations should be tolled for as few as or as many as days,representing the period during which gonzalez was exhausting his administrative remedies gonzalez hasty,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.
gonzalez commenced this bivens action on may,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that his confinement in the mcc and mdc shus violated his first,fifth,and eighth amendment rights.as a result,his suit was timely under the applicable statute of limitations insofar as it relates to claims dating back to on or about february,assuming a day tolling period or december,assuming a day tolling period.because the parties do not discuss which,if either,of these dates represents the correct tolling period,and such a determination is not necessary to the analysis that follows,we leave it to the district court on remand to determine the date by which any timely claims must have accrued.we hereinafter refer to that date as the cutoff date.
a summary of key dates is as follows 
procedural history 
on may,gonzalez brought suit against hasty,in his capacity as warden of both the mcc manhattan and mdc brooklyn,and various other personnel from both facilities,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.on march,the district court richard berman,judge dismissed gonzalez mcc claims as.gonzalez hasty,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,vacated,cir.it concluded that the applicable statute of limitations had run because gonzalez claims ripened when he was transferred out of the mcc,on july.id.the district court dismissed gonzalez mdc claims for improper venue,explaining that none of the events underlying those claims had occurred in the southern district,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
gonzalez appealed.we decided that the district court erred in failing to apply tolling to the statute of limitations during the time in which gonzalez was exhausting his administrative remedies.gonzalez hasty,cir.because it was not clear from the record when gonzalez first initiated his administrative claim,thereby commencing the tolling period,we vacated the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court.id.at.we also directed the district court to transfer gonzalez mdc claims to the eastern district of new york if it once again determined that venue did not lie in the southern district.id.at.we expressly decline d to decide on th e record before us whether the continuing violation doctrine allows the two confinements to be aggregated in order to preserve mcc claims that might otherwise have been lost absent prolonged tolling,and to lengthen the period of confinement in the shu.id.at.
on remand,the district court granted the defendants motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that gonzalez claims against all of the mcc defendants except for hasty were gonzalez hasty,cv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court rejected gonzalez argument that the continuing violation doctrine,described at some length in the discussion section of this opinion below,applied to delay the start of the limitations period as to the mcc claims,reasoning that the second circuit has never applied the doctrine to a bivens action,and even if the doctrine did apply to bivens claims,gonzalez failed to allege that the mcc defendants committed any wrongful acts within the limitations period,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.because the parties acknowledged that at least some of gonzalez claims against hasty and the mdc defendants might be timely,the court transferred the case to the eastern district pursuant to the second circuit instruction,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
after the case was transferred,the remaining defendants moved to dismiss or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.gonzalez hasty,motion,cv,dkt.gonzalez argued that the continuing violation doctrine should apply to his bivens claims to delay the start of the limitations period until the date of his release from the mdc shu.doing so,he argued,would render his claims timely after taking into account administrative tolling.the district court rejected this argument and granted the defendants motion to dismiss,concluding that even if the continuing violation doctrine could apply in some bivens actions,it would not apply in this case.gonzalez,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court observed that a claim typically accrues when a plaintiff has full knowledge of the material facts that give rise to it,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court further reasoned that gonzalez had complained that his lengthy shu confinement at the mcc manhattan was improper,and if that were so,he was thereby demonstrating knowledge that his placement in the mdc brooklyn shu similarly was improper,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.but gonzalez did not commence the mdc action until may,which was more than three years after he entered the mdc shu,taking into account administrative tolling,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court also failed to rule on gonzalez request for discovery.
gonzalez appeals from the district court dismissal,arguing that the continuing violation doctrine applies to his claims against hasty,which relate to his confinement at both the mcc and mdc,and his claims against the other mdc defendants james sherman,salvatore lopresti,ortiz,inspector barrere,and white,which involve only his incarceration in the mdc.he also appeals from the district court implicit denial of his discovery request and requests reassignment of his case to another judge on remand.

ii.statute of limitations 
a.the nature and scope of the continuing violation doctrine 
the statute of limitations for bivens claims is governed by the statute of limitations applicable to new york state law personal injury claims not sounding in intentional tort.chin bowen,cir.new york civil practice law and rules section provides a statute of limitations for such claims.federal law,however,governs the determination of when the statute of limitations begins to run.kronisch united states,cir.a bivens claim accrues under federal law for statute of limitations purposes when a plaintiff either has knowledge of his or her claim or has enough information that a reasonable person would investigate and discover the existence of a claim.see id.at.
the continuing violation doctrine,where applicable,provides an exception to the normal accrual date.harris city of new york,cir.it applies to claims composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful practice.washington cty.of rockland,cir quoting passenger morgan.the continuing violation doctrine thus applies not to discrete unlawful acts,even where those discrete acts are part of a serial violation,but to claims that by their nature accrue only after the plaintiff has been subjected to some threshold amount of mistreatment.morgan,at.
accordingly,where the continuing violation doctrine applies,the limitations period begins to run when the defendant has engaged in enough activity to make out an actionable claim.id.at.a claim will be timely,however,only if the plaintiff allege s some acts contributing to the alleged violation.harris,at.
the continuing violation doctrine typically arises in the context of a complaint of unlawful workplace discrimination challenged under title vii of the civil rights act of,et u nder the continuing violation exception to the title vii limitations period,if a title vii plaintiff files an equal employment opportunity commission charge that is timely as to any incident of discrimination in furtherance of an ongoing policy of discrimination,all claims of acts of discrimination under that policy will be timely even if they would be untimely standing alone.chin port auth.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
to prevail,a plaintiff alleging a hostile work environment claim under title vii,for example,must show that under the totality of the circumstances,the alleged conduct was so severe or pervasive as to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment.patterson cty.of oneida,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the alleged conduct in many hostile work environment cases must be repeated or ongoing before it is adequately severe or pervasive to constitute a violation.alfano costello,cir as a general rule,incidents must be more than episodic they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive.internal quotation marks omitted.
while the doctrine use is most often encountered in connection with actions asserting title vii violations,its application is by no means limited to that context.we have,for example,applied it to an eighth amendment claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs brought under where the prisoner challenge d a series of acts that together comprise d his claim.shomo city of new york,cir.we have also applied it to an unlawful takings claim under section.sherman town of chester,cir.other circuits also have invoked the doctrine more broadly.see,turley rednour,cir applying the continuing violation doctrine to an eighth amendment claim concerning the cumulative impact of numerous imposed lockdowns on the plaintiff.
we see no reason why the doctrine thus applied from time to time to eighth amendment claims against state actors brought under section would not in a proper case be applicable to an eighth amendment claim against federal officials brought under bivens.chin bowen,at both bivens and section actions are designed to provide redress for constitutional violations.though the two actions are not precisely parallel,there is a general trend in the appellate courts to incorporate law into bivens suits.internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.the controlling feature of the doctrine is not the source of the right of action,but rather the characteristics of the claim.
in an attempt to rebut the plaintiff position that the continuing violation doctrine can apply in a bivens action,the defendants rely on our decision in mix delaware hudson railway,cir.there we concluded that the continuing violation doctrine did not apply to a claim for injury under the federal employers liability act fela.id.at.the plaintiff had argued that morgan supported the continuing violation doctrine application to his claim for hearing loss,which he sustained gradually during his employment at various railway yards.id.at.we rejected that argument,drawing a distinction between title vii trigger for the statute of limitations,by which the statute of limitations begins to run when the unlawful employment practice has occurred,and fela trigger,by which the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff discovers or has enough information from which he or she should have discovered the injury and its cause.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
bivens and section claims,like those under fela,typically are subject to a trigger.but we do not read mix as recognizing a categorical bar to the continuing violation doctrine application to claims that otherwise would be subject to the discovery rule.doing so would cast serious doubt on our decision to apply the continuing violation doctrine to a claim otherwise subject to the discovery rule,as we did in shomo,and would render our prior characterization of the continuing violation doctrine as an exception to the discovery rule senseless.see harris,at.we therefore do not read mix as a barrier to the application of the doctrine to gonzalez constitutional claims.
b.the continuing violation doctrine application to gonzalez claims 
the defendants argue that the district court was correct to conclude that gonzalez claims accrued on july,when he was transferred from the mcc manhattan shu to the mdc brooklyn shu,because he knew of his alleged injury on that date.br.they also cont
