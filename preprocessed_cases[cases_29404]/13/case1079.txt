dad and mom enrolled,their autistic child,in a private school after concluding that the new york city department of education doe individualized education program failed to provide him with a free and appropriate public education as required by the individuals with disabilities education improvement act idea,et.subsequently,the parents filed a complaint against the doe seeking tuition reimbursement.after twelve hearing days,an impartial hearing officer granted them that relief.the doe appealed to a state review officer,who reversed that decision.the parents then filed a civil action in united states district court for the eastern district of new york weinstein,which affirmed the order denying tuition reimbursement.the parents appeal principally contending that the individualized education program integrated services violated the idea least restrictive environment mandate by placing their child in a classroom with as many as twelve other students who also had individualized education programs.we affirm.
background 
i.the legal framework 
the idea requires new york state to provide disabled children with a free and appropriate public education fape.n.city dep t of,cir citation omitted.accordingly,the doe,through a committee on special education cse,must produce,in writing,an individualized education program iep,see d,that describes the specially designed instruction and services that will enable the child to meet stated educational objectives and is reasonably calculated to give educational benefits to the child,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.should a parent believe that the school district breached these idea duties by failing to provide their disabled child a fape,the parent may unilaterally place their child in a private school at their own financial risk and seek tuition reimbursement.see florence cnty.sch.dist.four carter.
to begin the process,a parent must first file a complaint which triggers an process that begins with a hearing in front of an impartial hearing officer iho.see b,f educ.the test,as construed by new york education law c,governs that hearing the doe must establish that the student iep actually provided a fape should the doe fail to meet that burden,the parents are entitled to if they establish that their unilateral placement was appropriate and the equities favor them.see,at citing carter,at sch.comm.of town of burlington dep t of.a state review officer sro evaluates appeals from an iho decision,see educ.law,and either party may seek review of an sro decision by bringing a civil action in federal court,see i a.
ii.statement of facts 
is an autistic boy with pervasive developmental disorder,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,certain speech and language disorders,and fine and gross motor deficits.despite these setbacks,has an average iq he is bright and can learn.his autism and developmental disorders,however,present behavioral and problems that have resulted in academic and have required speech,occupational,and physical therapies.also requires direct,supervision during the school day from a paraprofessional,who helps him stay focused when his attention strays and calm in the event of a behavioral crisis.
after the parents rejected the iep for the school year,attended luria,a montessori school,where he had the support of his paraprofessional in a classroom designed for typically developing students.on january,mom sent an email to luria indicating a desire to for the school year before the cse developed the contested iep subject to this appeal.shortly thereafter,mom submitted an application to luria which included a tuition contract and down payment to hold spot.
luria teachers do not use formal assessments to track progress and rely on a lot of and observation to track the child progress.see tr.though progressed socially during the school year,he continued to have a lot of behavioral issues that we re getting in the way of his progress through the school year.id.at.when these behavioral issues disrupted the class,his paraprofessional removed him from the classroom to work with him outside,sometimes on the floor id.at.
individualized education program 
on june,the cse convened to develop iep.the following individuals constituted the cse mom sara malas ky,general education teacher,who participated via telephone chanie graus,a school psychologist who acted as a representative a special education teacher and a parent representative.was seven years old,and the iep was for his year.
the iep described as a autistic child of average intelligence with pervasive developmental disorder.despite his disorders,the iep recognized that had made progress in the area of peer interactions and,during the previous year at luria,had made friends and was able to participate in a continuous flow of back and forth interactions with his peers.sealed app x.the iep,however,also noted that had significant difficulties,became frustrated easily,and struggled to calm himself down in the event of a behavioral crisis.id.
the iep recommended placement in a general education environment with integrated ict services with a staffing ratio,five days a week,for a tenmonth school year the iep also provided with a fulltime behavioral management paraprofessional to give him help in times of behavioral crisis,and these other related services 
sealed app x.
finally,the iep concluded that behavior seriously interfere d with instruction and require d additional adult support.id.based on those conclusions,the iep required a behavioral intervention plan bip,which was incorporated in the iep.id.at.the bip identified emotional meltdowns,poor,and poor attention as the behavioral difficulties that impaired academic progress and recommended a reward system,praise and encouragement,and positive modeling as strategies to modify those behaviors.id.at.the goal was to teach to become more attentive and focused and to better control himself when frustrated.id.to implement those strategies,teacher,paraprofessional,and the parents were to collaborate.the bip did not quantify data relating to the frequency of meltdowns because luria did not provide a functional behavior assessment fba,and the doe did not request or develop one.
on july,the doe sent a letter to parents that classified as an autistic student and recommended an ict at,the ocean school,with the related services that the iep recommended.mom visited the school,decided to keep at luria,and immediately began the process seeking reimbursement for the school year.
administrative review 
on july,the parents filed their demand for due process and requested a hearing.the parents subsequently amended their demands on september.on may,the parents submitted their closing brief after hearing days that took place over the entire school year.in relevant parts,the parents argued that the iep would have denied a fape because the iep team created a bip without the benefit of an fba and the iep failed to provide parent counseling and training as a related service.the parents also argued that the placement was defective because the recommended month program exposed to regression risks.finally,the parents argued that the iep assigned to an overly restrictive environment.
the iho expressly agreed with the parents regarding the bip,the omission of parental counseling,and the inadequacy of a month program.though the iho mentioned the least restrictive environment requirement in passing,she made no explicit findings as to whether a general education environment with ict services would be too restrictive see sealed app x.the iho found luria to be an appropriate placement and that the equities favored the parents.accordingly,the iho ordered that the parents be reimbursed,and the doe sought review by a sro.the sro reversed the iho determinations and denied tuition reimbursement.relying heavily on the sro analysis,the district court affirmed that decision,and the parents appealed.
discussion 
standard of review and burdens of proof 
we undergo a circumscribed de novo review of a district court grant of summary judgment in the idea context because the responsibility for determining whether a challenged iep will provide a child with a fape rests in the first instance with administrative hearing and review officers.new york city dep t of,cir.summary judgment in the idea context,therefore,is only a pragmatic procedural mechanism for reviewing administrative decisions.ex rel mamaroneck union free sch,cir per curiam internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this review requires a more critical appraisal of the agency determination than review but falls well short of complete de novo review,at quoting lenn portland sch,cir internal citations omitted.accordingly,our de novo review only seeks to independently verify that the administrative record supports the district court determination that a student iep was adequate.see,at.
in undertaking this independent review,we are further restrained by our lack of specialized knowledge and educational expertise we must defer to the administrative decision particularly where the state officer review has been thorough and careful.see id.quoting walczak florida union free sch,cir.while we will not rubber stamp administrative decisions,we remain equally mindful that we can not substitute our own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities under review,at.furthermore,when,as here,an iho and sro reach conflicting conclusions,w e defer to the final decision of the state authorities,that is,the sro decision,at quoting ex rel.bd.of educ.of chappaqua cent.sch,cir.
recently,we parsed the amount of deference an sro determination deserves and concluded that it depends on the quality of that opinion.see,at.reviewing courts must look to the factors that normally determine whether any particular judgment is persuasive,for example,whether the decision being reviewed is,and whether it was based on substantially greater familiarity with the evidence and the witnesses than the reviewing court.id.at quoting,at.where an sro has clearly demonstrated a better command of the record and supported her conclusions through better legal and factual analysis than an iho,we will have little difficulty deferring to the sro opinion.see id.accordingly,an appellant seeking to have a reviewing court credit an iho determination over an sro determination would benefit from calling our attention to an sro specific errors in law,fact,or reasoning 
ii.procedural violations 
in determining whether an iep complies with the idea,courts make a inquiry that is,first,procedural,and second,substantive.id.at.procedural violations warrant tuition reimbursement only if they impeded the child right to a fape,significantly impeded the parents opportunity to participate in the decision making process,or caused a deprivation of educational benefits.id.at quoting f e ii,at.that is,parents must articulate how a procedural violation resulted in the iep substantive inadequacy or affected the process.of course,m ultiple procedural violations may cumulatively result in the denial of a fape even if the violations considered individually do not.id.
here,the parents allege that the doe committed two procedural violations it failed to undertake an fba in developing the bip and it failed to include parental training and counseling in the iep.the parents also assert that the sro impermissibly relied on retrospective testimony to justify those omissions.
behavioral intervention plan 
an fba provides an identification of a disabled student problem behavior,the definition of the behavior in concrete terms,the identification of the contextual factors that contribute to the behavior and the formulation of a hypothesis regarding the general conditions under which a behavior usually occurs and probable consequences that serve to maintain it.regs.tit.r.new york regulations require the department to conduct an fba for a student whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others.see,at quoting regs.tit.b v.those regulations,however,only require an fba as necessary to ascertain the physical,mental,behavioral and emotional factors which contribute to a suspected disabilit y.regs.tit.b v emphasis added.
though the idea incorporates some but not all state law concerning special education,these regulations do not raise the idea bar by rendering iep developed without an fba legally inadequate.see,at quoting bay shore union free sch.dist.kain ex rel.kain,cir.the idea only requires a school district to consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports,and other strategies when a child behavior impedes learning.see id.at quoting d b i internal quotation marks omitted.an fba omission does,however,cause us to take particular care to ensure that the iep adequately addresses the child problem behaviors,at.two cases chart our course.see,at,f d at.
in,we concluded that the failure to conduct an fba did not make an iep legally inadequate because it noted the student attention problems the student need for a personal aide to help the student focus during class and the student need for psychiatric and psychological services,at.in we considered the effect of an fba omission for three separate students.see,at.for one student,we concluded that an fba omission did not deny a fape where the cse reviewed documents regarding the student behavior,and the iep provided strategies to address those behaviors,including the use of a aide to help him focus.id.at.moreover,we have decided that whether an iep adequately addresses a disabled student behaviors and whether strategies for dealing with those behaviors are appropriate are precisely the type of issue s upon which the idea requires deference to the expertise of the administrative officers,at quoting grim rhinebeck cent.sch,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
failure to conduct an fba,therefore,does not render an iep legally inadequate under the idea so long as the iep adequately identifies a student behavioral impediments and implements strategies to address that behavior.see,id.where the iep actually includes a bip,parents should at least suggest how the lack of an fba resulted in the bip inadequacy or prevented meaningful.see at.for example,parents could argue that an fba would have exposed a bip obsolete assessment of the student behavioral problems or that the recommended strategies failed to accommodate the frequency or intensity of the student behavioral problems.here,however,the parents summarily argue that failure to conduct an fba made the iep legally defective the record belies those assertions.
as an initial matter,the iho fba and bip analysis consisted of a single sentence without citation to the administrative record lastly,i find there was no fba developed and the bip was developed without parent or teacher involvement and i find the bip was not appropriate.iho decision at.by contrast,the sro provided an indepth,discussion of the issue replete with legal and factual analysis.see sro decision at.the sro found that the iho finding was unsubstantiated by a record which clearly established behavioral problems,identified strategies to manage those problems,and recommended a collaborative intervention plan between the parents,teacher,and paraprofessional.
the sro concluded that the bip accurately described the behaviors that interfered with learning emotional meltdowns,poor,and poor attention.in support of her analysis,the sro relied upon,inter alia,the luria progress reports,the floor time therapist report,and graus observations of,all of which describe those behavioral difficulties in detail.see sro decision at citing dist.ex.the parents confirm the accuracy of those descriptions and do not contend that the iep misidentified or overlooked their son behavioral issues.see parents local rule statement of material facts.accordingly,we agree with the sro determination that the bip adequately described behavioral impediments.
the sro also concluded that the bip was consistent with the information available to the cse and that the intervention services were adequate because they provided a broad,collaborative approach to implement specific strategies to modify those behaviors on a daily,basis.the parents do not contend that needed more or less attention.additionally,the bip recommended that be provided with a reward system,praise,encouragement,and positive modeling to learn to adjust his behavior within a collaborative support system between parent,teacher,and paraprofessional.the parents do not attack those strategies.the parents have simply failed to articulate a single reason why an fba was required for a legally valid bip.
we therefore affirm the sro determination that the hearing record does not support the impartial hearing officer determination that the lack of an fba rose to the level of denying the student a fape where the iep addressed behavioral needs.sro decision at.as in,the cse reviewed documents regarding the student behavior,and the iep provided strategies to address those behaviors,including the use of a paraprofessional,at.
parental counseling 
next,the parents argue that the iep failure to include parental counseling denied a fape.to enable parents to perform appropriate intervention activities at home,new york requires that an iep provide parents of autistic students training and counseling.see regs.tit.d.parent counseling and training means assisting parents in understanding the special needs of their child providing parents with information about child development and helping parents to acquire the necessary skills that will allow them to support the implementation of their child individualized education program.id.kk emphasis omitted.the regulations contemplate parental counseling for the educational benefit of the disabled student by ensuring that the parents are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to continue and implement the student iep at home.
we have previously described counseling omissions as procedural violations less serious than the omission of an fba because the presence or absence of a provision does not necessarily have a direct effect on the substantive adequacy of the plan,at.moreover,because school districts are required to provide parent counseling,they remain accountable for their failure to do so no matter the contents of the iep.id.citing regs.tit.d.if a parent wants counseling for her own sake,new york provides her a remedy.accordingly,failure to provide counseling ordinarily does not result in a fape denial or warrant tuition reimbursement.see id.
here,the iho again summarily decided that parent counseling and training was required and that parent workshops that would have been provided to the parents by the ocean school would not give the parents the tools necessary to perform at home.iho decision at.the iho,however,did not explain those conclusions.the sro concluded that the counseling omission did not deny a fape because mom was a certified special education teacher who had received,through her own initiative,training and counseling in the therapies that had previously used,and because the public school assigned to provided training and counseling.the sro also noted that the bip required collaboration between paraprofessional,the parents,and teacher in order to implement and support the recommended strategies.
we defer to that analysis.the parents have not persuaded us that the parental counseling omission would deprive of fape.the sro analysis noted that mom experience and the supports in the bip provide adequate assurance that developmental plan and education would continue at home.
retrospective justifications 
the parents assert that the sro routinely relied upon impermissible retrospective justifications to fill in the iep inadequacies.in,we held that retrospective testimony that the school district would have provided additional services beyond those listed in the iep may not be considered in a proceeding,at.emphasis added.however,the case also expressly reject ed a rigid four corners rule prohibiting testimony that goes beyond the face of the iep.while testimony that materially alters the written plan is not permitted,testimony may be received that explains or justifies the services listed in the iep.id.emphasis added.for example 
i f an iep states that a specific teaching method will be used to instruct a student,the school district may introduce testimony at the subsequent hearing to describe that teaching method and explain why it was appropriate for the student.the district,however,may not introduce testimony that a different teaching method,not mentioned in the iep,would have been used.
here,parents contend that the sro impermissibly credited retrospective testimony that justified the fba omission based on the bip broad,collaborative support strategies and how those strategies would change as the student needs changed.that argument,however,misses the sro central analysis the bip was developed with specific goals,strategies,and supports,but the collaborative approach ensured that implementation could change as m.needs changed and ensured that behavioral modification strategies would continue at home.that seems especially appropriate when a student autism presents unique challenges each day.accordingly,the analysis did not rely on retrospective justifications.the doe admits that there was no fba,and the sro did not rely upon a promise not contained in the iep to address the omission.
the parents also assert that reliance on mom educational background and the placement school counseling programs retrospectively justifies the omission of parental counseling.but,as we have just stated,when the iep suffers from a conceded procedural infirmity,we first review whether that procedural violation substantively deprived the student of a fape before determining whether the sro corrected the substantive failure by impermissibly crediting future promises.in making her determination,the sro did not conclude that the iep omission of parental counseling denied of a fape and that the omission was made sound by promises not contained in the iep.instead,the sro concluded that the parental counseling omission did not deny a fape in the first instance because of the bip collaborative approach to behavior modification,mom education,and the school workshops.the sro concluded that the parents were equipped to manage needs without new york mandated counseling.accordingly,the sro did not rely upon impermissible retrospection and we defer to her analysis.
iii.substantive adequacy and least restrictive environment 
the parents also challenge the substantive adequacy of the iep.substantive inadequacy automatically entitles the parents to reimbursement,at.the state need not maximize the potential of handicapped children,but the door of public education must be opened in a meaningful way.ex.rel.and newington bd.of,cir quoting walczak,at internal quotation marks omitted.that is,the iep must provide the opportunity for more than only trivial advancement.id.
least restrictive environment 
the idea expresses a strong preference for educating disabled students alongside their peers that is,in their least restrictive environment lre.walczak,at.specifically,the idea provides that disabled children be educated t o the maximum extent appropriate with children who are not disabled,and cautions that special classes,separate schooling,or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment should only occur when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services can not be achieved satisfactorily.a a emphasis added.
w hile mainstreaming is an important objective,we are mindful that the presumption in favor of mainstreaming must be weighed against the importance of providing an appropriate education to handicapped students.newington,at quotation marks and citation omitted.the tension between the idea goal of providing an education suited to a student particular needs and its goal of educating that student with his peers as much as circumstances allow dictates a analysis in reviewing whether both of those goals have been optimally accommodated under particular circumstances.id.emphasis added 
we have previously used a test to determine whether a school district has met the lre mandate mindful of our deferential position with respect to state educational authorities crafting educational policy wh
