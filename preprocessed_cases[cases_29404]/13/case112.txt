petitioner fifth third bancorp maintains a retirement savings plan for its employees.plan participants may direct their contributions into any of a number of investment options,including an employee stock ownership plan esop,which invests its funds primarily in fifth third stock.respondents,former fifth third employees and esop participants,filed this lawsuit against petitioners,fifth third and several of its officers who are alleged to be fiduciaries of the esop.the complaint alleges that petitioners breached the fiduciary duty of prudence imposed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a b.specifically,the complaint alleges that petitioners should have known on the basis of both publicly available information and inside information available to petitioners because they were fifth third officers that fifth third stock was overpriced and excessively risky.it further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners position would have responded to this information by selling off the esop holdings of fifth third stock,refraining from purchasing more fifth third stock,or disclosing the negative inside information so that the market could correct the stock price downward.according to the complaint,petitioners did none of these things,and the price of fifth third stock ultimately fell,reducing respondents retirement savings.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,but the sixth circuit reversed.it concluded that esop fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence that does not apply to other erisa fiduciaries but that the presumption is an evidentiary one and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage.the court went on to hold that the complaint stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
esop fiduciaries are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence.rather,they are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to erisa fiduciaries in general,a b,except that they need not diversify the fund assets,a.this conclusion follows from the relevant provisions of erisa.section a b imposes a prudent person standard by which to measure fiduciaries investment decisions and disposition of assets.massachusetts mut.life ins.russell.section a c requires erisa fiduciaries to diversify plan assets.and a establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the esop context by providing that the diversification requirement of a c and the prudence requirement only to the extent that it requires diversification of a b are not violated by acquisition or holding of employer stock.section a makes no reference to a special presumption in favor of esop fiduciaries and does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was,on the brink of collapse.it simply modifies the duties imposed by a in a precisely delineated way.thus,aside from the fact that esop fiduciaries are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify,they are subject to the duty of prudence like other erisa fiduciaries.
on remand,the sixth circuit should reconsider whether the complaint states a claim by applying the pleading standard as discussed in ashcroft iqbal,and bell atlantic twombly,in light of the following considerations.
a where a stock is publicly traded,allegations that a fiduciary should have recognized on the basis of publicly available information that the market was overvaluing or undervaluing the stock are generally implausible and thus insufficient to state a claim under twombly and iqbal.
b to state a claim for breach of the duty of prudence,a complaint must plausibly allege an alternative action that the defendant could have taken,that would have been legal,and that a prudent fiduciary in the same circumstances would not have viewed as more likely to harm the fund than to help it.where the complaint alleges that a fiduciary was imprudent in failing to act on the basis of inside information,the analysis is informed by the following points.first,erisa duty of prudence never requires a fiduciary to break the law,and so a fiduciary can not be imprudent for failing to buy or sell stock in violation of the insider trading laws.second,where a complaint faults fiduciaries for failing to decide,based on negative inside,to refrain from making additional stock purchases or for failing to publicly disclose that information so that the stock would no longer be overvalued,courts should consider the extent to which imposing an obligation either to refrain from making a planned trade or to disclose inside information to the public could conflict with the complex insider trading and corporate disclosure requirements set forth by the federal securities laws or with the objectives of those laws.third,courts confronted with such claims should consider whether the complaint has plausibly alleged that a prudent fiduciary in the defendant position could not have concluded that stopping purchases or publicly disclosing negative information would do more harm than good to the fund by causing a drop in the stock price and a concomitant drop in the value of the stock already held by the fund.

fifth third bancorp et,petitioners john dudenhoeffer et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et,requires the fiduciary of a pension plan to act prudently in managing the plan assets.a b.this case focuses upon that duty of prudence as applied to the fiduciary of an employee stock ownership plan esop,a type of pension plan that invests primarily in the stock of the company that employs the plan participants.
we consider whether,when an esop fiduciary decision to buy or hold the employer stock is challenged in court,the fiduciary is entitled to a standard that the lower courts have called a presumption of prudence.the courts of appeals that have considered the question have held that such a presumption does apply,with the presumption generally defined as a requirement that the plaintiff make a showing that would not be required in an ordinary case,such as that the employer was on the brink of collapse.
we hold that no such presumption applies.instead,esop fiduciaries are subject to the same duty of prudence that applies to erisa fiduciaries in general,except that they need not diversify the fund assets.a.
petitioner fifth third bancorp,a large financial services firm,maintains for its employees a retirement savings plan.employees may choose to contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan as retirement savings,and fifth third provides matching contributions of up to of an employee compensation.the plan assets are invested in separate funds,including mutual funds and an esop.plan participants can allocate their contributions among the funds however they like fifth third matching contributions,on the other hand,are always invested initially in the esop,though the participant can then choose to move them to another fund.the plan requires the esop funds to be invested primarily in shares of common stock of fifth third.app.
respondents,who are former fifth third employees and esop participants,filed this putative class action in federal district court in ohio.they claim that petitioners,fifth third and various fifth third officers,were fiduciaries of the plan and violated the duties of loyalty and prudence imposed by erisa.see a,a.we limit our review to the claims.
the complaint alleges that by july,the fiduciaries knew or should have known that fifth third stock was overvalued and excessively risky for two separate reasons.first,publicly available information such as newspaper articles provided early warning signs that subprime lending,which formed a large part of fifth third business,would soon leave creditors high and dry as the housing market collapsed and subprime borrowers became unable to pay off their mortgages.second,nonpublic information which petitioners knew because they were fifth third insiders indicated that fifth third officers had deceived the market by making material misstatements about the company financial prospects.those misstatements led the market to overvalue fifth third stock the esop primary investment and so petitioners,using the participants money,were consequently paying more for that stock than it was worth.
the complaint further alleges that a prudent fiduciary in petitioners position would have responded to this information in one or more of the following ways by selling the esop holdings of fifth third stock before the value of those holdings declined,by refraining from purchasing any more fifth third stock,by canceling the plan esop option,and by disclosing the inside information so that the market would adjust its valuation of fifth third stock downward and the esop would no longer be overpaying for it.
rather than follow any of these courses of action,petitioners continued to hold and buy fifth third stock.then the market crashed,and fifth third stock price fell by between july and september,when the complaint was filed.since the esop funds were invested primarily in fifth third stock,this fall in price eliminated a large part of the retirement savings that the participants had invested in the esop.the stock has since made a partial recovery to around half of its july price.
the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.supp.sd ohio.the court began from the premise that where a lawsuit challenges esop fiduciaries investment decisions,the plan fiduciaries start with a presumption that their decision to remain invested in employer securities was reasonable.at quoting kuper iovenko.the court next held that this rule is at the pleading stage and then concluded that the complaint allegations were insufficient to overcome it.supp,at.
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit reversed.although it agreed that esop fiduciaries are entitled to a presumption of prudence,it took the view that the presumption is evidentiary only and therefore does not apply at the pleading stage,at.thus,the sixth circuit simply asked whether the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty,at.it held that they were,at.
in light of differences among the courts of appeals as to the nature of the presumption of prudence applicable to esop fiduciaries,we granted the fiduciaries petition for certiorari.compare in re citigroup erisa litigation,presumption of prudence applies at the pleading stage and requires the plaintiff to establish that the employer was in a dire situation that was objectively unforeseeable by the settlor quoting edgar avaya,with pfeil state street bank trust,presumption of prudence applies only at summary judgment and beyond and only requires the plaintiff to establish that a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision quoting kuper,supra,at.
in applying a presumption of prudence that favors esop fiduciaries purchasing or holding of employer stock,the lower courts have sought to reconcile congressional directives that are in some tension with each other.on the one hand,erisa itself subjects pension plan fiduciaries to a duty of prudence.in a section titled fiduciary duties,it says 
a prudent man standard of care 
subject to sections c and d,and of this title,a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
i providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and 
ii defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan 
b with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims 
c by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses,unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so and 
d in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter iii of this chapter.
see also central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund central transport,section a imposes strict standards of trustee conduct derived from the common law of trusts most prominently,a standard of loyalty and a standard of care 
on the other hand,congress recognizes that esops are designed to invest primarily in the stock of the participants employer,d a,meaning that they are not prudently diversified.and it has written into law its interest in encouraging their use.one statutory provision says 
intent of congress concerning employee stock ownership plans.the congress,in a series of laws including erisa has made clear its interest in encouraging esops as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees.the congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat esops as conventional retirement plans,which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans,and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans.tax reform act of,h,stat.
in addition,and in keeping with this statement of intent,congress has given esop fiduciaries a statutory exemption from some of the duties imposed on erisa fiduciaries.erisa specifically provides that,in the case of esops and other eligible individual account plans,
the diversification requirement of a c and the prudence requirement only to the extent that it requires diversification of a b are not violated by acquisition or holding of employer stock.a.
thus,an esop fiduciary is not obliged under a c to diversif y the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses or under a b to act with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence of a prudent man insofar as that duty diversification.
several courts of appeals have gone beyond erisa express provision that esop fiduciaries need not diversify by giving esop fiduciaries a presumption of prudence when their decisions to hold or buy employer stock are challenged as imprudent.thus,the third circuit has held that an esop fiduciary who invests the esop assets in employer stock is entitled to a presumption that it acted consistently with erisa in doing so.moench robertson.the ninth circuit has said that to overcome the presumption of prudent investment,plaintiffs must make allegations that clearly implicate the company viability as an ongoing concern or show a precipitous decline in the employer stock combined with evidence that the company is on the brink of collapse or is undergoing serious mismanagement.quan computer sciences,brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.and the seventh circuit has described the presumption as requiring plaintiffs to allege and ultimately prove that the company faced impending collapse or dire circumstances that could not have been foreseen by the founder of the plan.white marshall ilsley.
the sixth circuit agreed that some sort of presumption favoring an esop fiduciary purchase of employer stock is appropriate.but it held that this presumption is an evidentiary rule that does not apply at the pleading stage.it further held that,to overcome the presumption,a plaintiff need not show that the employer was on the brink of collapse or the like.rather,the plaintiff need only show that a prudent fiduciary acting under similar circumstances would have made a different investment decision.at quoting kuper,at.
petitioners argue that the lower courts are right to apply a presumption of prudence,that it should apply from the pleading stage onward,and that the presumption should be strongly in favor of esop fiduciaries purchasing and holding of employer stock.
in particular,petitioners propose a rule that a challenge to an esop fiduciary decision to hold or buy company stock can not prevail unless extraordinary circumstances,such as a serious threat to the employer viability,mean that continued investment would substantially impair the purpose of the plan.brief for petitioners.in petitioners view,the purpose of the plan,in the case of an esop,is promoting employee ownership of the employer stock over the long term.and,petitioners assert,that purpose is substantially impair ed rendering continued investment imprudent only when a serious threat to the employer viability makes it likely that the employer will go out of business.this is because the goal of employee ownership will be substantially impaired only if the employer goes out of business,leaving the employees with no company to own,at.
we must decide whether erisa contains some such presumption.
in our view,the law does not create a special presumption favoring esop fiduciaries.rather,the same standard of prudence applies to all erisa fiduciaries,including esop fiduciaries,except that an esop fiduciary is under no duty to diversify the esop holdings.this conclusion follows from the pertinent provisions of erisa,which are set forth above.
section a b imposes a prudent person standard by which to measure fiduciaries investment decisions and disposition of assets.massachusetts mut.life ins.russell.section a c requires erisa fiduciaries to diversify plan assets.and a establishes the extent to which those duties are loosened in the esop context to ensure that employers are permitted and encouraged to offer esops.section a makes no reference to a special presumption in favor of esop fiduciaries.it does not require plaintiffs to allege that the employer was on the brink of collapse,under extraordinary circumstances,or the like.instead,a simply modifies the duties imposed by a in a precisely delineated way it provides that an esop fiduciary is exempt from a c diversification requirement and also from a b duty of prudence,but only to the extent that it requires diversification.a emphasis added.
thus,esop fiduciaries,unlike erisa fiduciaries generally,are not liable for losses that result from a failure to diversify.but aside from that distinction,because esop fiduciaries are erisa fiduciaries and because a b duty of prudence applies to all erisa fiduciaries,esop fiduciaries are subject to the duty of prudence just as other erisa fiduciaries are.
petitioners make several arguments to the contrary.first,petitioners argue that the special purpose of an esop investing participants savings in the stock of their employer calls for a presumption that such investments are prudent.their argument is as follows erisa defines the duty of prudence in terms of what a prudent person would do in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.a b.the character and aims of an esop differ from those of an ordinary retirement investment,such as a diversified mutual fund.an ordinary plan seeks to maximize retirement savings for participants while avoiding excessive risk.but an esop also seeks to promote employee ownership of employer stock.for instance,fifth third plan requires the esop assets to be invested primarily in shares of common stock of fifth third.app.in light of this additional goal,an esop fiduciary decision to buy more shares of employer stock,even if it would be imprudent were it viewed solely as an attempt to secure financial retirement benefits while avoiding excessive risk,might nonetheless be prudent if understood as an attempt to promote employee ownership of employer stock,a goal that congress views as important.see tax reform act of,h,stat.thus,a claim that an esop fiduciary investment in employer stock was imprudent as a way of securing retirement savings should be viewed unfavorably because,unless the company was about to go out of business,that investment was advancing the additional goal of employee ownership of employer stock.
we can not accept the claim that underlies this argument,namely,that the content of erisa duty of prudence varies depending upon the specific nonpecuniary goal set out in an erisa plan,such as what petitioners claim is the nonpecuniary goal here.taken in context,a b reference to an enterprise of a like character and with like aims means an enterprise with what the immediately preceding provision calls the exclusive purpose to be pursued by all erisa fiduciaries providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries while defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan.a a i,ii.read in the context of erisa as a whole,the term benefits in the provision just quoted must be understood to refer to the sort of financial benefits such as retirement income that trustees who manage investments typically seek to secure for the trust beneficiaries.a defining employee pension plan and pension plan to mean plans that provide employees with retirement income or other deferral of income the term does not cover nonpecuniary benefits like those supposed to arise from employee ownership of employer stock.
consider the statute requirement that fiduciaries act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter.a d emphasis added.this provision makes clear that the duty of prudence trumps the instructions of a plan document,such as an instruction to invest exclusively in employer stock even if financial goals demand the contrary.see also a with irrelevant exceptions,any provision in an agreement or instrument which purports to relieve a fiduciary from responsibility for any duty under this part shall be void as against public policy this rule would make little sense if,as petitioners argue,the duty of prudence is defined by the aims of the particular plan as set out in the plan documents,since in that case the duty of prudence could never conflict with a plan document.
consider also a,which exempts an esop fiduciary from a b duty of prudence but only to the extent that it requires diversification.what need would there be for this specific provision were the nature of a b duty of prudence altered anyway in the case of an esop in light of the esop aim of promoting employee ownership of employer stock arlington central school dist.bd.of ed.murphy,i t is generally presumed that statutes do not contain surplusage 
petitioners are right to point out that congress,in seeking to permit and promote esops,was pursuing purposes other than the financial security of plan participants.see,tax reform act of,h,stat.intended esops to help secur e capital funds for necessary capital growth and brin g about stock ownership by all corporate employees congress pursued those purposes by promoting esops with tax incentives.see e,k.and it also pursued them by exempting esops from erisa diversification requirement,which otherwise would have precluded their creation.a.but we are not convinced that congress also sought to promote esops by further relaxing the duty of prudence as applied to esops with the sort of presumption proposed by petitioners.
second,and relatedly,petitioners contend that the duty of prudence should be read in light of the rule under the common law of trusts that the settlor can reduce or waive the prudent man standard of care by specific language in the trust instrument.bogert bogert,law of trusts and trustees,ed.see also restatement second of trusts,comment d by the terms of the trust the requirement of care and skill may be relaxed or modified the argument is that,by commanding the esop fiduciary to invest primarily in fifth third stock,the plan documents waived the duty of prudence to the extent that it comes into conflict with investment in fifth third stock at least unless extraordinary circumstances arise that so threaten the goal of employee owne
