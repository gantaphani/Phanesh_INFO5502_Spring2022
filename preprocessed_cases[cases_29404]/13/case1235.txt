in these cases,which we heard in tandem and now consolidate for disposition,john torraco and william winstanley appeal from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york cogan,dismissing their claims against sergeant lawrence goldberg,police officers anthony espinal and paulsen,and other appellees.matthew weasner appeals from an april,judgment,also of the eastern district of new york,dismissing his claims against police officer anthony passalaqua and other appellees.the district court resolved both cases through summary judgment.
all three appellants complain of the actions taken by appellee police officers when appellants attempted to transport unloaded firearms in checked baggage through various new york airports.appellants followed transportation safety administration tsa regulations,see c and relied upon section,a statute which allows individuals to transport firearms from one state in which they are legal,through another state in which they are illegal,to a third state in which they are legal,provided that several conditions are met,without incurring criminal liability under local gun laws.all three appellants were interviewed and delayed from traveling,and and arrested by officers seeking to enforce new york gun laws criminalizing the possession of a firearm without a new york firearm license.see penal law,see also bach pataki,cir describing new york gun laws in detail torraco and weasner do not possess new york firearm licenses,and are precluded from acquiring such licenses because they neither reside nor work in new york state.see penal law a.
in this suit,all appellants seek to enforce section through,all appellants allege infringements of their constitutional rights to travel,and torraco and weasner complain of false arrest.the district court rejected these claims,and upon review,we affirm.before explaining our reasons for doing so,however,we first describe the relevant individual circumstances of each case,stating them,as we must,in the light most favorable to appellants.see pyke cuomo,cir.
factual background 
john torraco 
on october,torraco,who is a citizen and resident of the state of florida,and his wife,who is not a party to this action,flew from florida into laguardia airport laguardia,new york,from which they went to franklin lakes,new jersey,to stay with torraco mother.two days later,the couple set out for laguardia to return to florida.torraco mother first drove them to a friend house in queens,new york following a brief visit,the friend drove the couple to the airport.during this time,torraco unloaded,disassembled gun was in a carrying case kept in the car trunk.
upon arrival at laguardia,torraco informed the airline ticket agent that he had a gun in a carrying case,which he wanted to check through.the agent tagged the firearm with an orange firearms declaration tag,and advised torraco that it was standard operating procedure to notify the port authority police when a passenger declares a weapon,which she did.appellee officer espinal responded and asked torraco whether he had a new york license for the firearm.torraco,who,as noted above,does not,informed officer espinal that he was traveling from new jersey to florida,and that section preempted local licensing requirements.being unfamiliar with section,officer espinal called his superior,appellee sergeant goldberg.upon joining the group,sergeant goldberg was informed that torraco had voluntarily declared his gun at the ticket counter,was coming from new jersey where he had a residence,and was going to florida where,in torraco view,he was legally authorized to carry the gun without a license.sergeant goldberg asked torraco for paperwork that would establish that he was lawfully in possession of the gun.a tsa supervisor arrived and took the position that torraco was permitted to transport the weapon without regard to local law.sergeant goldberg took the position that torraco needed to first establish that his possession of the gun was lawful,before the question of whether he could legally possess the gun in new jersey or florida became relevant.he and officer espinal arrested torraco for violating new york penal law,which provides that a person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree when h e possesses any firearm without a license torraco was held for hours,when he was arraigned in queens county criminal court on that charge,and subsequently released on recognizance.his attorney moved to dismiss on the ground of federal preemption,and though the district attorney did not respond to the motion,he to dismiss in the interests of justice.the court denied the district attorney motion and granted torraco motion,finding that the state failure to respond to torraco motion was a concession on the merits.
torraco subsequently brought this suit in federal court alleging that appellees violated a his right to carry firearms under section,and b his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.he sought to enforce both of these claimed rights under section.
william winstanley 
approximately six months later,on april,winstanley,a citizen and resident of the state of new york,and who,unlike torraco,has a new york firearm license,underwent a somewhat similar experience at john kennedy international airport jfk,new york,from where winstanley was scheduled to fly to phoenix,arizona.winstanley was traveling with more than one unloaded firearm,packed in accordance with tsa regulations.upon arrival,winstanley declared his firearms to the ticket agent who,in accordance with protocol,contacted the port authority police.appellee officer paulsen arrived,asked winstanley for his new york firearm license,which winstanley presented,asked winstanley where he was going,to which winstanley,arizona,and asked winstanley for his concealed weapons permit for arizona,to which winstanley responded that he did not have one,nor did he need one because he had a florida concealed weapons permit,which allowed him to carry a concealed weapon in arizona.officer paulsen disagreed,stating that winstanley needed a concealed weapons permit for arizona and when winstanley asked for a supervisor,threatened to place him under arrest and informed him that he could not board the aircraft as the airline with which he was traveling apparently only had one flight a day to tucson,winstanley changed his flight to the next day,anticipating that the delay would cause him to miss his flight.he then proceeded to the port authority police headquarters at jfk and spoke to a lieutenant who agreed that winstanley did not need a permit to openly carry a weapon in arizona.when the lieutenant left the room,winstanley also spoke to a sergeant,who,he testified,showed him,but would not let him examine,a matrix in a folder entitled gun laws of the united states.the next day,winstanley returned to jfk,and again declared his firearms at the ticket counter.as with the previous day,the agent gave him a declaration tag and contacted the port authority police.an unidentified officer asked him for his new york gun license,which winstanley produced.the officer then inspected the gun case and told winstanley that he had the wrong type of carrying case.when winstanley responded that he had transported firearms in that carrying case multiple times from jfk,the officer informed winstanley that he was free to travel,just not with the carrying case.winstanley then purchased a compliant gun case from the airline and would have made the flight,except that it was canceled due to weather.on april,winstanley called the port authority headquarters before heading to jfk,recounted the incidents of his previous two attempts to an officer,and after some back and forth was told that he could travel with his firearms.upon arrival at jfk,winstanley was permitted to board the flight to arizona.
together with torraco,winstanley subsequently brought this suit in federal court alleging that a section creates an independent right to transport firearms,and b his right to travel was infringed.like torraco,he contends that both of these rights are enforceable by an action for damages under section.
matthew weasner 
weasner describes himself as a citizen and resident of the state of ohio.in early june,however,he was employed by a defense contractor and was staying at a hotel in new jersey.he had recently traveled to california and arizona while awaiting a military transport to iraq.
almost immediately upon checking into the new jersey hotel,weasner received a call notifying him of a family emergency.he purchased the cheapest plane ticket he could find,which departed from long island macarthur airport lima,new york in route to ohio,and,with all of his property,drove straight from new jersey to the airport in new york.included in this property was a ruger pistol,purchased by his grandfather and given to him by his father,properly unloaded and packaged according to tsa regulations.weasner had carried that firearm,apparently without incident,on his various trips to or from ohio and california.
when weasner arrived at the airport ninety minutes before his flight,he informed the agent at the airline ticket counter that he had a firearm to declare.the agent made a call and soon after appellee officer passalaqua arrived and asked weasner to accompany him to a tsa office,which weasner did.weasner explained to officer passalacqua that he was passing through new york on his way from new jersey to his home state,ohio,and showed officer passalaqua his plane ticket.officer passalacqua left for about thirty minutes,and when he returned told weasner that there was no record of the firearm in the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives batf database.weasner stated that the gun had been purchased by his grandfather before record keeping rules were in effect and thus would only show up in the database if he had used it to commit a crime.during the course of these interactions,weasner did not alert officer passalaqua to section,though he did tell him that he had complied with the packaging regulations for transporting a firearm and had traveled with it frequently,noting that his gun case included a check tag from the tsa in california.at some point,officer passalaqua handcuffed weasner and led him to a back room,where he was kept,handcuffed,for about twenty minutes.he was then taken to the police station,where he was fingerprinted,and subsequently charged with illegal possession of a firearm under new york penal law.weasner made bail that day and flew home to ohio without his gun.the charges against weasner were subsequently dismissed 
weasner later filed suit,alleging that appellees violated a his right to carry firearms under section,and b his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.weasner also seeks to hold the town of islip liable under a failure to train or deliberate indifference theory.
ii.discussion 
claims under section 
as we have explained,all three appellants filed suit under section premised on violations of section.the district court concluded that a violation of section can not be enforced though section,and we affirm.
section imposes liability on anyone who,under color of state law,deprives a person of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,and allows parties to seek damages against state actors for alleged violations of federal rights.it is enforceable only for violations of federal rights,not merely violations of federal laws.see gonzaga doe,golden state transit city of los angeles.the three blessing factors enumerated by the supreme court in blessing freestone are traditionally used to determine the existence of a federal right enforceable under section 
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than precatory terms.
citations omitted.this court,however,has cautioned against applying these factors too strictly,explaining that courts should not find a federal right based on a rigid or superficial application of the blessing factors where other considerations show that congress did not intend to create federal rights actionable under.wachovia bank,burke,cir see also gonzaga,at s tatute books are too many,the laws too diverse,and their purposes too complex,for any single formula to offer more than general guidance.breyer,concurring.
with these guidelines in mind,we turn to the firearm law implicated in this case.section states 
notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or regulation of a state or any political subdivision thereof,any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter et from transporting,shipping,or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if,during such transportation the firearm is unloaded,and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle provided,that in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.
the district court determined section satisfies the first blessing factor because it is phrased in terms of the persons benefitted,and we agree.see gonzaga univ,at.indeed,congress explicitly entitle d persons to transport firearms under the terms of section.
the district court concluded,however,that section failed to meet the second blessing the right protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence 
in authorizing interstate transport of firearms for any lawful purpose from any place where a traveler may lawfully possess and carry such firearm,section offers no standard by which an officer can determine whether the interstate transport is lawful.it would require a local officer,faced with clear evidence of a gun carried in violation under local law,to know the law of all states and their localities to evaluate whether firearms possession in the departure and destination states is lawful and thus preempts local law,an unworkable requirement.
appellants argue that this analysis erroneously focused on the practical problems involved for police officers complying with section instead of the competency of the judiciary.appellants are correct that the language of the second factor focuses on whether the rights conferred would be difficult for the judiciary,as opposed to law enforcement officials,to identify and enforce.this rigid and superficial application of the blessing factors,however,is insufficient.see wright roanoke redevelopment hous,stating that the benefits congress intended to confer on tenants are sufficiently specific and definite to qualify as enforceable rights which were not beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce emphasis added.these practical problems,and the accompanying possibility that the fear of increased liability could chill enforcement of firearm regulations,undermine the argument that congress granted a benefit that was intended to be a individual right.we find no evidence either in the text or structure of section that would indicate that congress intended that police officers tasked with enforcing state gun laws should be liable for damages when they fail to correctly apply section.see gonzaga,at w here the text and structure of a statute provide no indication that congress intends to create new individual rights,there is no basis for a private suit under.appellees explain this point well 
i f,as blessing teaches,the supreme court believes that judicial difficulty in applying a federal statute in the courthouse is a strong indicator that congress did not intend to create a damages remedy for violation of that statute,then certainly it is reasonable to presume that a statute such as,which requires a police officer to know the applicable firearm laws of at least two states in each encounter and apply them at the airport ticket counter,was not intended by congress to create a damages remedy for its violation,especially given the absence of any indication in the statute text,structure,or legislative history that such a remedy was necessary or desired.
applying section to weasner and torraco claims illustrates the difficulties,faced by judiciary and law enforcement officers,inherent its application.prong one of section asks whether a person is not otherwise prohibited by the firearms chapter from transporting,shipping,or receiving a firearm.section g describes various categories of felons,fugitives from justice,and unlawful aliens,among are not permitted under the firearms chapter to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,or possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.g.problematically,however,section is silent as to how a police officer encountering an unlicensed person with a firearm is to ascertain that this prong of the statute is met,that said person is not prohibited by the firearms chapter from transporting the firearm.both weasner and torraco claim that the laws of their states of residence,ohio and florida,do not require a license for gun possession and that their possession was not prohibited by the firearms chapter.asked to produce documentation of lawful possession,however,neither could.appellants would have us conclude that congress intended that a police officer faced with this factual scenario must mutely accept appellants assurances that their possession is lawful,or potentially be subject to suit for damages.
similarly,whether weasner and torraco satisfied factor three of section,that the guns were lawful in the state of origin,is,contrary to what one might expect,no simple matter.because both weasner and torraco began the pertinent legs of their travels in new jersey,their possession and carriage of the firearms in that state needed to be lawful.the new jersey code of criminal justice makes it unlawful to carry a handgun without a permit.see.the code provides certain narrow exceptions to the permit requirements including that a person may keep a firearm in his residence,premises or other land owned or possessed by him without a permit,or may carry said firearm between one residence and another when moving.e.that law further provides that guns being carried under subsection e in the course of travel shall include only such deviations as are reasonably necessary under the circumstances.g.thus,in weasner case,a police officer liability could turn on the correctness of his determination about whether weasner hotel in new jersey constituted a residence,and whether his trip to ohio constituted a move.in torraco case,a police officer would be obligated to speculate whether torraco brief stop in new york prior to proceeding to the airport was reasonably necessary under the circumstances.
and of course this complexity,though illustrated by,is not limited to the facts of this case.as the district court astutely observed,
multiply the fluidity of that scenario by jurisdictions putting aside issues that might arise as a result of international travel with interim domestic stopovers,and nearly a billion passengers moving through airports per year,and it becomes apparent that providing a damage remedy under for a failure to adequately apply would be unworkable.
torraco port,d.given this complexity and uncertainty,we conclude that congress did not intend to create federal rights in section actionable under section.
we are unconvinced by appellants response that section creates a presumption of lawfulness,and is therefore quite simply applied,making a damages remedy under section workable.they contend that congress intended a per se rule that such travel is lawful under unless probable cause exists to believe otherwise.appellants seem to suggest that officers encountering an individual checking a gun at the airport in a state that does not permit unlicensed gun possession should not even inquire as to whether possession is lawful so long as the individual complied with the carrying case and unload requirements.section does not state that it is creating any such merely provides that gun owners may travel interstate with their guns unloaded and in carrying cases,as long as a number of other conditions are we decline to read a presumption into the statute.moreover,the firearms chapter explicitly cautions against finding that congress intended section to operate at the exclusion of state gun laws 
no provision of this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any state on the same subject matter,unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such provision and the law of the state so that the two can not be reconciled or consistently stand together.
as both the district court and this court conclude that the second blessing factor prevents the plaintiffs from showing the existence of an individual right,we need not discuss the third factor.
false arrest 
we now turn to torraco and weasner claims that they were the victims of false arrest when they were arrested for possession of a firearm without a license under new york penal law.appellees respond that there was probable cause to execute the arrests,and that in any event,the officers are entitled to qualified immunity.the district court agreed with appellees,as do we.
the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures includes the right to be free from arrest absent probable cause.jaegly couch,cir.thus,the existence of probable cause is an absolute defense to a false arrest claim,id.at,and the question with which we are presented is not whether torraco and weasner were in fact guilty of violation of the new york statute,but rather whether there was probable cause to believe that they were.probable cause to arrest exists when the arresting officer has knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a crime.escalera lunn,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t he probable cause inquiry is based upon whether the facts known by the arresting officer at the time of the arrest objectively provided probable cause to arrest,jaegly,at,it is objective rather than subjective.id.at.
with these points in mind,we conclude that the officers had probable cause to believe that weasner and torraco were in violation of new york penal law,even assuming that they were aware of the terms of section.it is undisputed that neither torraco nor weasner had a new york license for their weapons.thus,absent section,they would be in clear violation of new york law.moreover,there was also probable cause to believe that appellants did not satisfy section.
we look to the facts of weasner arrest to flesh out these points at the time of his arrest,officer passalaqua knew that weasner possessed an unloaded firearm in a carrying case,did not have a license or some other documentation of lawful possession such as a receipt of purchase,and declared that he was flying through new york on his way from new jersey to ohio.officer passalaqua took the extra step of searching the batf database to ascertain whether the gun was lawfully possessed,and failing to see weasner name,he had probable cause to believe that weasner possession was not lawful under new york law.further,assuming the officer knew about section,there was probable cause to believe that weasner did not meet its requirements.as noted supra in our discussion of the section claim based on,a person acting with reasonable caution could conclude that weasner was not in lawful possession of the firearm at his point of origin because he may have been in violation of new jersey gun laws when he kept a gun in his hotel and traveled with it to ohio.officer passalaqua had two options on these weasner at his word and release him,or arrest him.he justifiably choose the latter.
given the facts and circumstances of the arrests,a person of reasonable caution would be warranted in believing that new york penal law had been violated and that the requirements of section were not met.therefore,appellants were not subject to false arrests.
in view of our conclusion that there was probable cause for the arrests,we also conclude that weasner claim against the town of islip can not go forward.t o hold a city liable under for the unconstitutional actions of its employees,a plaintiff is required to plead and prove three elements an official policy or custom that causes the plaintiff to be subjected to a denial of a constitutional right.wray city of new york,cir quoting batista rodriguez,cir.we need not address the first two prongs of this showing since weasner can not show that his constitutional rights were violated.
right to travel 
the appellants allege that their right to travel was violated.the right to travel is implicated in three circumstances when a law or action deters such travel when impeding travel is its primary objective and when a law uses any classification which serves to penalize the exercise of that right.see town of southold town of east hampton,cir.categories two and three are clearly inapplicable york firearm laws are facially neutral and are not designed primarily to impede travel.further,we have made clear that travelers do not have a constitutional right to the most convenient form of travel,and minor restrictions on travel simply do not amount to the denial of a fundamental right.id.at internal citation omitted.assuming that the actions the defendants took did in fact deter these plaintiffs under category,the plaintiff was delayed a little over one day.this was a minor restriction that did not result in a denial of the right to travel.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons explained,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
i join the majority holdings affirming the dismissal of plaintiffs claims based on their legal theories of false arrest under the fourth amendment municipal liability against the town of islip and violations of the constitutional right to travel.i also agree with the majority that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to plaintiffs claims based on.nevertheless,i am unpersuaded by the path the majority takes to reach that conclusion,and write to describe the alternative basis upon which i would resolve the difficult questions presented by this appeal.
the majority holds that does not create a federal right.in doing so,it reasons that the second factor from blessing freestone,which relates to the institutional competence of the judiciary to adjudicate a claim prevents the plaintiffs from showing the existence of an individual federal right under.op.at.i disagree.in my view,a review of the text of leads to the inescapable conclusion that congress created an individual federal right by enacting this provision.specifically,the statute provides a limited right to a safe harbor from convictions based on charges relating to the unlawful possession of firearms.the right arising out of is available if,and only if,the statutory prerequisites to its application are satisfied.the right is therefore qualified and narrow,but not,as the majority holds.and,of course,individuals transporting firearms are not without other legal protections their interactions with law enforcement are subject to a number of constitutional rights,the violation of which may be redressed through several theories brought pursuant to.
but remedies under are not available for the violation of every federal right.in my view,the right created by provides an example of this principle.consequently,my disagreement with the majority does not necessitate a dissent.two of the statute features are central to this analysis creates a right to a defense that may be raised to avoid a criminal conviction,which must be analyzed against the backdrop of remedies available through direct appeals,writs of habeas corpus and other collateral attacks,and claims based on constitutional violations and the prerequisites to the availability of the right arising out of are legal in nature,and raise the sort of questions that are rarely,if ever,foisted upon officers in the field.i agree with the majority that potential liability for police officers under based on violations of would unduly hamstring law enforcement and pose troubling practical problems.these concerns,however,do not allow us to ignore the text of.accordingly,for the reasons set forth below,i am of the view that creates an individual federal right,but that violations of this right are not redressable in a private action pursuant to.
i.the analytical framework 
the issue of whether is available as a means of redressing violations of presents,at bottom,a question of statutory interpretation.the basic tools at our disposal for engaging in such an inquiry are.see,sec dorozhko,cir.in undertaking this task,however,the majority declines to fully explain the legal framework that guides our analysis.
the majority focuses on the principle that a claim will lie only where an individual federal merely a federal alleged to have been violated.see,gonzaga.doe.in determining whether a statute creates such a right,the three factors identified in blessing provide general guidance.id.at breyer,j,concurring.as the majority notes rather emphatically,courts should not find a federal right based on a rigid or superficial application of the blessing factors.wachovia bank,burke,cir.we must also be mindful,though,that means what it says and authorizes suits to enforce individual rights under federal statutes as well as the constitution.city of rancho palos verdes,cal.abrams,quoting maine thiboutot.in the usual case,if the words of a statute are unambiguous,judicial inquiry should end,and the law is interpreted according to the plain meaning of its words.devine united states,cir.thus,we may not interpret the blessing court general guidance as a license to disregard unambiguous statutory text in order to avoid the implications of its plain meaning.
but a finding that congress has created an individual federal right marks the beginning,not the end,of any inquiry into the availability of claims,abrams,at.under the second step of the blessing framework,e ven if a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individual right,there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under.blessing,at see also doe,at bd.of educ.of chester union free sch,cir.in this second step,the issue is whether congress foreclosed a remedy under.blessing,at quoting smith robinson.i would resolve the issues presented by plaintiffs claims based on under this second step,and hold that congress has impliedly foreclosed claims based on alleged violations of this statute.
ii.creates an individual federal right 
does create an individual federal right the blessing court identified a list of three factors to consider whether the plaintiffs fit within the statute intended class of beneficiaries whether the entitlement arising out of the statute is so vague and amorphous that its enforcement in a claim would strain judicial competence and whether the statute impose s a binding obligation on the states.blessing,at see also burke,at.in holding that does not confer an individual federal right,the majority takes an overly broad view of the second blessing factor.
congress enacted as part of the firearms owners protection act fopa,a,stat.may,amended by,a,stat.july.the statute is the product of a tortured legislative history,which,as one scholar said,gives meaning to the expression that those who care for the law or for sausages should not watch either being made.david hardy,the firearms owners protection act a historical and legal perspective,cumb.section originated in a bill proposed by senator robert dole in the congress the record from the senate debate regarding this provision contains a memorandum stating that the language of senator dole proposal was unambiguous in its creation of a federal right,but far too vague to serve as the basis for preempting state laws coming into conflict with that right.cong.rec.july.in light of that concern,the senate revised the bill,see,which was ultimately enacted as part of fopa,a just months after its enactment,was amended to its current form 
the present version of remains as unambiguous as its predecessors with regard to whether the statute creates a federal right.subject to a series of prerequisites that limit the manner and circumstances in which a firearm may be transported,states that any person shall be entitled to transport a firearm through certain jurisdictions,n otwithstanding any other provision of any law of a state.emphasis added.thus,when the statutory prerequisites are satisfied,allows individuals to transfer a firearm without being convicted for unlawfully possessing the weapon under the laws of any state through which they pass,or any political subdivision thereof,between the origin and destination of the transfer hereinafter,jurisdictions.id.
based on this text,two of the blessing factors plainly weigh against the majority conclusion that does not create a federal right.first,as the majority acknowledges,plaintiffs fall within the class of intended beneficiaries referenced in the text of.see op.at.the statute also employs strong language a ny person shall be entitled to invoke the entitlement the statute creates.see doe,at providing examples of right or language.therefore,the first blessing factor militates in favor of the conclusion that confers an individual federal right 
second,there can be no question that this statute is couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.blessing,at muscarello united states,observing,in dicta,that specifically entitle s a person not otherwise prohibited from transporting,shipping,or receiving a firearm to transport a firearm from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry it to any other place where he may do so emphasis added,alteration in original quoting.section therefore unambiguously impose s a binding obligation on the states.blessing,at.thus,the first and third blessing factors support the conclusion that the statute creates an individual federal right.
the principal source of my disagreement with the majority relates to its application of the second blessing competence of the judiciary to ascertain whether the right has been violated.see blessing,at.in holding that the second blessing factor prevents the plaintiffs from showing the existence of an individual right,see op.at,the majority refers almost exclusively to concerns that would arise out of requiring law enforcement to apply the statute under pain of liability pursuant to.see op.at.i share these concerns.i am also aware that blessing is not to be applied in a rigid or superficial manner.burke,at.however,in my view,the issues identified by the majority are not relevant to the second blessing factor,irregardless of the manner of its application.
when the blessing court articulated this factor,the basis for its concern was that,if the right assertedly protected by the statute is vague and amorphous,then a trial court may lack the tools in the context of an individual claim to determine whether the putative right has been violated.see,livadas bradshaw,a particular statutory provision may be so vague and amorphous that determining whether a deprivation might have occurred would strain judicial competence.internal citations and quotation marks omitted suter artist,holding that no federal right arises out of a statutory provision stating that reasonable efforts will be made to prevent removal of children from their homes.in my view,raises no such concerns.
plaintiffs claims based on,had they proceeded,would have required the district court to simply apply chapter of title and several states firearms laws to the facts of these cases.i am confident that the district court,and any other court charged with such a task,would be capable of making those legal determinations.it seems to me that this observation resolves the application of the second blessing factor,which is at best neutral as to the question of whether creates an individual federal right.therefore,the text of the statute demonstrates that congress created an individual federal right,a result confirmed by reference to the blessing factors.
of course,that the application of may be expeditiously resolved from an ex post perspective in a courtroom does nothing to obviate the difficulties that may arise out of requiring officers to apply this statute in the field on a basis.however,the issues of whether local law enforcement officers are capable of readily enforcing a federal statute,and whether placing such a burden on those officers is advisable as a policy matter,are distinct from any of the concerns raised by the blessing court that might militate against a finding that creates an individual federal right.it can not be a defense to a claim for a state actor to appear in court and assert that,because a federal right is difficult to enforce or apply,it is no right at all if congress has created a right that strains state actors resources or competence to enforce,the remedy lies with the political branches.courts are not at liberty to congressional determinations and policy judgments of this order,however debatable or arguably unwise they may be.eldred ashcroft.thus,i do not find the practical concerns relied upon by the majority to provide an adequate basis for holding that does not create a federal right.
in reaching the opposite conclusion,the majority seems to rely on the canon that we should avoid endorsing statutory interpretations that would lead to absurd results,corley.united states.in essence,the majority reasons that,whatever the text of,it would be absurd to interpret the statute to confer an individual federal right because of the complexity and uncertainty attendant in the application of by local law enforcement.see op.at.however,even if courts are empowered to employ such reasoning,but see,hamilton lanning,wl,at june,scalia,j,dissenting,my view that confers an individual federal right does not necessarily lead to the absurd result that the majority seeks to avoid.rather,my conclusion requires only that the analysis of plaintiffs claims based on proceed to the second step of the blessing framework.
in sum,i am loath to imply from the fact that presents enforcement difficulties that congress mistakenly,or inartfully,used specific terms when crafting this statute.c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.bank germain,quoting rubin united states,internal citations omitted.we lack the authority to ignore the words chosen by congress in,which,in my view,create an individual federal right.
iii.the nature of the right arising out of 
in blessing,the supreme court criticized the plaintiffs for paint ing with too broad a brush by failing to specifically describe the rights they sought to vindicate through their claims.at.
it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to identify with particularity the rights they claimed,since it is impossible to determine whether the statute,as an undifferentiated whole,gives rise to undefined rights.only when the complaint is broken down into manageable analytic bites can a court ascertain whether each separate claim satisfies the various criteria we have set forth for determining whether a federal statute creates rights.
id.thus,under blessing,a discussion of the nature of the individual right arising out of is in order.
i agree with the majority that,like the blessing plaintiffs,plaintiffs here have framed their claims around an overly broad reading of.in each of their pleadings,they refer without specification to a right to travel in compliance with.however,the text of does not create an individual right to transport a firearm at any time of the transporter choosing,free from regulatory investigation or delays.nor,as the majority points out,does the statute require local law enforcement to apply a presumption that an individual possession of a firearm is lawful,notwithstanding the lack of a permit from the jurisdiction in question or some other form of proof.see op.at.
rather,creates a negative right to avoid convictions and related sanctions in jurisdictions between the origin and destination of a firearm transfer this limited right is qualified by five prerequisites that must be satisfied before the transferor may invoke the statute protection 
the firearm transfer must not be otherwise prohibited by chapter of title,which relates to federal firearms offenses 
the purpose of the transfer must be lawful 
the origin of the transfer must be a place where the individual may lawfully possess and carry such firearm 
the destination of the transfer must also be a place where the transferor may lawfully possess and carry such firearm and 
the firearm must be unloaded during the transfer,and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported may be readily accessible or directly accessible from the passenger compartment of the transporting vehicle.
the first four of these prerequisites require applications of state and federal law,and the right only attaches where all five prerequisites are established to the satisfaction of either local law enforcement or a court.
when the right does attach,it functions as a criminal defense that may be employed to avoid a conviction based on charges of illegal gun possession.in addition to its text,this interpretation of the statute is supported by the references to as a safe harbor in the congressional debates that led to its enactment.for example,in the words of representative betty mccollum 
this provision is designed to be a safe harbor for interstate travelers.no one is required to follow the procedures set forth in section,but any traveler who does can not be convicted of violating a more restrictive state or local law in any jurisdiction through which he travels.
cong.rec.june,emphasis added see also cong.rec.june,statement of thurmond a safe harbor is a provision in a statute or regulation that affords protection from liability or penalty.black law dictionary ed emphasis added.in my view,that is precisely how provides a right to protection against a conviction on charges.
the teeth of this negative statutory right and the criminal defense that it makes available come from the supremacy clause.in other words,when the right arising out of applies,the state law in question must yield to the federal law that congress enacted to create this safe harbor this characteristic of the statute was acknowledged,and its efficacy as a policy decision was debated,throughout the legislative history of.see,at,reprinted in,see also cong.rec,memorandum from the staff of the house judiciary committee cong.rec.june,statement of hatch.indeed,one of the most noticeable differences between the original and amended versions of is that congress moved the preemption language n otwithstanding any other provision of any law of a state to the beginning of the provision.compare,a may,with,a july.
finally,applying would not strain judicial competence,blessing,at instead,the statute calls for judicial intervention.four of the prerequisites to the attachment of the right present the sort of legal questions that we rarely,if ever,require officers in the field to resolve on the spot.in the majority words,the statute is silent as to how a police officer encountering an unlicensed person with a firearm is to determine whether these prerequisites are satisfied.op.at.i agree.i also infer from this silence that,if the application of the prerequisites to the safe harbor are unclear in a given case,then the ambiguities are to be resolved by judges in courts instead of by police officers at busy airport terminals.if a judge determines that the prerequisites were satisfied at the time of the firearm transfer,then the right attaches and the transferor may not be convicted of a offense relating to the unlawful possession of the weapon.
therefore,having conducted the inquiry called for by the blessing court relating to the specific nature of the federal right upon which plaintiffs claims are premised,i am of the view that provides a negative right to a safe the form of a criminal convictions in jurisdictions.this right is only available where the statutory prerequisites are satisfied,and the application of the right will often have to be resolved in courts in the context of criminal cases brought under the laws of jurisdictions.
this right is qualified and narrow.contrary to plaintiffs assertions,nothing in affords private citizens a right to immediately check a firearm as part of their luggage and board an airplane.nor does the text of the statute provide a right to avoid delays that may result from law enforcement efforts to determine whether a firearm is lawfully possessed,so long as the investigation is consistent with the federal constitution and the laws of the jurisdiction in question.however,to the extent my construction of this federal right appears to be exceedingly narrow,nothing about my interpretation of would limit citizens access to the full panoply of constitutional claims that may be brought pursuant to based on allegations of unlawful searches,seizures,detentions,or prosecutions.claims for,inter alia,false arrest,excessive force,and malicious prosecution remain available as means for seeking redress where a state actor goes too far.
iv.the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants 
once the scope of the right arising out of is properly framed,two insights emerge.first,because is only violated when an individual is convicted of unlawfully possessing a weapon in a jurisdiction despite complying with the five prerequisites of the statute,plaintiffs rights under the statute were not abridged torraco successfully relied on as a defense to the new york state criminal charge against him.similarly,although the record is unclear as to the basis for the dismissal,there is no dispute that the charge against weasner was also dismissed.finally,while the travel delays experienced by winstanely were unfortunate,the inconvenience that resulted did not violate the terms of.therefore,as no plaintiff established that the federal right arising out of was violated,defendants were entitled to summary judgment.
the second insight yielded by careful attention to the contours of applies more broadly.in my view,even if plaintiffs rights under this statute were violated,congress has impliedly foreclosed access to as a means of seeking redress for such harms.the supreme court has not often reached this conclusion.see fitzgerald barnstable sch.however,this holding is the sounder way to resolve the vexing issues arising out of the interaction between and.
