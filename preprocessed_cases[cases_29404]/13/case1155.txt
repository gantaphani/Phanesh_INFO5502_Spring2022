on appeal from the district court grant of a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment,this case presents two issues whether the due process rights of plaintiffs appellants terence sudler sudler and timothy batthany batthany collectively,plaintiffs were violated by a host of officers and employees of the new york state and new york city prison systems collectively,defendants,and whether these officers and employees are entitled to qualified immunity for the conduct forming the predicate of plaintiffs suits.because we conclude that,regardless whether plaintiffs due process rights were violated,defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for the conduct in question,we affirm the district court.
background 
plaintiffs sentences and incarceration 
while the parties hotly dispute many of the alleged facts in this case,the basic facts relevant to disposition of this appeal are not contested.
terence sudler 
in,terence sudler was imprisoned following his conviction in new york state of robbery in the third degree and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.he was sentenced to serve concurrent,indeterminate sentences of to years on the robbery count and to years on the criminal sale count.sudler was released from prison and placed on parole on september.while on parole,sudler was arrested for petit larceny.on june,he pled guilty to a parole violation and was sentenced to serve the remaining seven months and two days of his sentence in prison 
about one month later,on july,sudler appeared in new york supreme court,bronx county,on the petit larceny charges for which he had recently been arrested.at the hearing,sudler withdrew his earlier plea of not guilty as to the two counts of petit larceny and entered guilty pleas on each of these misdemeanor counts.he was sentenced by justice clancy of the new york supreme court as follows sentence imposed on docket ending is nine months.sentence imposed on docket ending is also nine months.those sentences to run concurrent,and those sentences to run concurrent with the parole violation.sudler sentence and commitment form confirmed that his sentences on the petit larceny counts would run concurrent with his parole time.
sudler served the two concurrent sentences for petit larceny in the custody of the new york city department of correction nycdoc at rikers island rikers.when these sentences expired which occurred in december,due to a variety of credits,he was transferred from rikers into the custody of the new york state department of correctional services docs to serve the remainder of his undischarged felony sentence 
at the time of his transfer to docs custody,sudler release date the date on which he would be released from docs custody was calculated.defendant linda stevens stevens,an employee of the new york state department of parole dop,reviewed sudler file and determined that he was not entitled to parole jail time credit for the period of time he spent serving his misdemeanor sentences for petit larceny at rikers.parole jail time pjt credits may be given to a prisoner in docs custody for some or all of his time in nycdoc custody and serve to reduce the number of days the prisoner must spend in docs custody.although there is evidence that the parole file that stevens reviewed contained a copy of sudler sentence and commitment form describing his misdemeanor sentences,which indicated that the sentences served at rikers were to run concurrently with his sentence for violation of parole,stevens did not give sudler pjt credits for time spent serving his sentences at rikers,apparently because she misunderstood docs policy to require all sentences in cases such as sudler to run consecutively,not concurrently as a result,sudler release date was calculated to be july.
sudler twice objected in writing that his release date had been calculated incorrectly,but each time was assured that the release date was correct.so far as the record shows,sudler did not file a formal grievance with the relevant inmate grievance resolution committee,see regs.tit,establishing inmate grievance resolution committees to resolve complaint s about the substance or application of any written or unwritten policy,regulation,procedure or rule of docs or the lack of a policy,regulation,procedure,or rule,id.at a see also in re isaac fischer,involving an inmate who challenged his release date by means of the inmate grievance system nor did he file a state habeas corpus petition or a petition under new york civil practice law and rules article challenging his release date calculation.sudler was ultimately discharged from docs custody on july,approximately six months later than he would have been released had he received pjt credits for the time spent serving his sentences at rikers.
timothy batthany 
timothy batthany story is similar to sudler.he was convicted on a guilty plea of second degree attempted burglary,a felony under new york law,in state court,and was sentenced,inter alia,to a determinate prison term.on may,batthany was released on parole,but was subsequently arrested on new charges on september,he pled guilty to violating his parole and was sentenced to serve the remaining seven months and nineteen days of his sentence in prison.on december,batthany pled guilty to one count of criminal contempt and one count of third degree assault,both misdemeanors.judge harrington of the new york criminal court sentenced batthany to six months jail on these two offenses,to run concurrently,as well as with the parole violation.
after serving the requisite time on his misdemeanor charges at rikers,batthany was transferred back into docs custody in january to serve the remainder of his first sentence,and his release date was calculated.although she did not have batthany sentence and commitment form describing the misdemeanor charges and thus did not know whether the judge had ordered these more recent sentences to run concurrently with,or consecutively to,his sentence for the parole violation,dop employee defendant charlotte wright declined to give batthany pjt credits for the time spent serving his sentence at rikers.batthany release date was calculated to be august.he complained to the relevant authorities that his release date had been miscalculated and was repeatedly told that if he wanted to receive pjt credit,he needed to produce documentation that the judge who sentenced him on the misdemeanor charges had indicated that these sentences were to be served concurrently with his earlier,felony sentence.on june,batthany lawyer from the prisoner legal services of new york obtained a copy of his sentence and commitment form and provided it to dop.batthany was released from docs custody the next day,approximately six weeks later than he would have been if he had promptly received credit for the time served at rikers.
relevant new york state prison regulations and policies 
plaintiffs allege that dop failure to credit sudler,or to credit batthany promptly,for the amount of time served at rikers on local sentences was a violation of their right to due process.they also allege that this failure was not accidental.rather,they argue that dop default policy is not to credit an inmate returned for violation of his or her parole a returned parole violator or rpv for time served pursuant to a local sentence,but rather to credit the rpv for such time served only when dop is presented with certain forms indicating that the judge who sentenced the rpv to the local sentence instructed that the local sentence run concurrently with the older state sentence.
at the relevant time,dop official policy with respect to local sentences ordered to run concurrently with a sentence for a violation of parole was as follows t he violator will receive parole jail time credit from the date of the arrest or the date of the lodging of the parole warrant,whichever occurs first,up to the day before the date of return to a new york state correctional facility.however,as the state defendants admit,where an rpv file failed to indicate whether the sentencing judge ordered the local sentence to run concurrently with the parole violation sentence,dop considered the sentences consecutive.furthermore,dop policy at the relevant time was to accept only a sentence and commitment form or a certificate of disposition as indicating that the sentencing judge intended the rpv sentences to run concurrently.on at least some occasions,dop staff would place the burden of providing either a sentence and commitment form or a certificate of disposition on the rpv contending that his or her release date had been miscalculated,rather than themselves seeking out the needed documents.
plaintiffs also argue that nycdoc staff contributed to the violation of their due process rights by failing to send sentence and commitment forms to dop when rpvs were transferred from nycdoc custody to docs custody.plaintiffs allege that nycdoc did not transmit sudler and batthany sentence and commitment form s to docs when plaintiff s were transferred into their custody,and that nycdoc as a matter of policy and practice does not send paperwork for misdemeanor sentences to docs,even when the sentence reflected on that paperwork bears directly on the time to be served in docs custody.
procedural history 
on december,sudler brought suit against dozens of individuals who had,at the relevant time,been docs,dop,and nycdoc officers and employees,seeking compensatory and punitive damages for violation of plaintiff constitutional rights as guaranteed under and the united states constitution,including its fourth and fourteenth amendments.compl.on july,the district court lynch,granted the city defendants motion to dismiss the action as against them pursuant to.b.see sudler city of new york,civ gel,wl,at july.the district court noted that the complaint only concrete allegation against the city defendants is that they did not transmit plaintiff sentence and commitment form to docs when plaintiff was transferred into state custody.id.at alteration in original quoting compl.the district court noted that the complaint also charges that the state of new york was fully aware of the concurrent nature of sudler sentence,and detained him pursuant to a deliberate policy and practice of disregarding the terms of such concurrent sentences.id.furthermore,the district court opined that the defendants associated with docs had the responsibility for determining the legal basis of the custody they exercised over sudler,and could have themselves requested the sentence and commitment form.id.thus,the district court determined that any harm suffered by sudler did not expose the city defendants to liability,and therefore dismissed sudler action as against them.id.at 
upon judge lynch elevation to this court,sudler case was reassigned to judge daniels,who referred the case to magistrate judge peck.judge peck then consolidated sudler action with batthany for pretrial purposes.batthany had filed a complaint on july,which he had amended on november.the two plaintiffs then filed a consolidated complaint on february,in which for the first time they sought class certification,defining the putative class as all persons who were expressly sentenced to incarceration for a local misdemeanor and parole violation to run concurrently,but whom nevertheless have been,or will be,subjected to an administrative alteration of that judicial sentence to consecutive sentences.they later amended this complaint,filing their second consolidated class action complaint the complaint on march.
on january,the same day judge peck consolidated the two actions,he also issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court grant the city defendants motion to dismiss batthany amended complaint,relying on judge lynch earlier decision dismissing sudler action as against the city defendants.judge daniels adopted this report and recommendation on march.batthany city of new york,civ gbd ajp,wl.he noted batthany argument that his case has additional facts demonstrating the involvement of the city defendants as a causal factor in the unlawful deprivation of his liberty that make it distinguishable from the sudler case,and also the fact that batthany action involved claims under new york state law that did not exist in the sudler case,but found these objections to be without merit.id.at.
in july the state defendants,who remained in the case,moved for summary judgment.on october,judge peck issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court grant the motion.sudler goord,civ gbd ajp,civ gbd ajp,wl,at,report and recommendation or r r.judge peck began by rejecting the state defendants argument that,because it is the sole responsibility of parole authorities to calculate pjt credits under new york law,prison officials are not bound by a sentencing judge order that a new sentence should run concurrently with the undischarged portion of a prior sentence on which an inmate has been paroled.see id.at.judge peck determined that a new york state judge has the authority to order that an rpv sentence for parole violation run concurrently with another sentence.see id.at.
next,citing hill united states ex rel.wampler,judge peck noted that a jailor authority to confine a prisoner begins and ends with the sentence pronounced by the judge.r r at.the conduct of the state defendants,he wrote,had the practical effect of alter ing the length of the sentence pronounced by the judge,a state of affairs impermissible,he concluded,under the supreme court and this circuit constitutional cases.id.judge peck went on to explain that his conclusion would stand even if,under new york law,state court judges do not have the authority to order that an rpv sentence for parole violation run concurrently with another state sentence even if this court were wrong,and new york law did not permit rpv inmates such as sudler and batthany to receive concurrent sentences,dop still had no authority to unilaterally correct the sentence as imposed by the sentencing judge.see id.at.judge peck found defendants argument that they had no duty to seek out any inmate sentence and commitment document both abhorrent and absurd,since the authority to detain inmates derives exclusively from the sentence or judgment of the court,and therefore it is axiomatic that parole and prison officials know,or should know,the nature and duration of each prisoner sentence.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
having concluded that the state defendants violated plaintiffs constitutional rights,judge peck then considered whether recovery for these violations is barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity.he concluded that qualified immunity applies.id.at.noting that the official conduct disputed here,administrative alteration of the sentence pronounced by the judge,may have been required by state statute,judge peck observed that the conduct underlying sudler suit occurred prior to our decision in earley murray,cir,the first case in this circuit that might have suggested the illegality of the state defendants conduct in such circumstances.see r r at.as to the conduct underlying batthany suit,judge peck pointed out that,even after earley was decided,new york state courts have continued to find permissible the challenged conduct of imposing consecutive sentences for the parole violation sentence.id.where state judges do not themselves comprehend that particular conduct violates the law,judge peck opined,it can not be said that the law was clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity.id.at.furthermore,judge peck determined that no case had been decided that clearly established that the precise conduct at issue here dop placing the burden on the inmate to prove the terms of his sentence was illegal.id.judge peck concluded by recommending that class certification,injunctive relief,and leave to amend be denied.id.at.
on february,judge daniels issued a memorandum decision and order adopting the r sudler goord,cv gbd ajp,cv gbd ajp,wl,at.judge daniels agreed with judge peck that the policy implemented by dop is unconstitutional.in reasoning that largely tracked the r r,judge daniels held that an inmate has a constitutional right to serve only the sentence imposed by a sentencing judge.id.at.judge daniels also agreed,however,that qualified immunity prevented recovery in this case.no previous cases,judge daniels noted,consider ed or otherwise implicate d dop parole violator policy nor did they involve analogous conduct or facts.id.at.thus,the constitutional right which the state defendants violated was not clearly established at the time the violation occurred,and qualified immunity applied.accordingly,judge daniels granted the state defendants motion for summary judgment.id.at.he also agreed with the r r as to the proper disposition of plaintiffs pending motions and therefore denied class certification and leave to amend,as well as plaintiffs request for injunctive relief.see id.at.

alleged violation of plaintiffs constitutional rights 
we begin with the state defendants plaintiffs argument that the state defendants violated their constitutional rights is straightforward they have a due process right,as articulated in hill united states ex rel.wampler,to serve only the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge,until such time as this sentence is modified by a judge the state defendants held plaintiffs in custody for longer than the period contemplated by the sentencing judge ergo,the state defendants violated plaintiffs due process rights the state defendants do not dispute the minor premise listed above.rather,they focus the bulk of their argument to this court on the major premise that plaintiffs,in the circumstances of this case,had a constitutional right to serve only the term imposed by the sentencing judge.
the seminal case for the constitutional right at issue here is wampler.in that case,wampler was convicted of tax evasion in federal court.id.at.the sentencing judge pronounced the following sentence fine five thousand dollars and eighteen months in penitentiary on each count of the indictment,said terms of imprisonment to be computed as beginning this day of december fines to be cumulative and terms of imprisonment to run concurrently and that wampler pay costs of proceedings.id.the clerk of the federal court in which the sentence had been pronounced,however,issued a commitment form bearing the following 
that wampler pay a fine of five thousand dollars and be imprisoned for eighteen months on each count of the indictment said term of imprisonment to be computed as beginning this day of december the fines to be cumulative and the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently and that wampler pay the costs of prosecution and in default of payment of said fines and costs,he stand further committed until the payment of said fines and costs or until discharged by due process of law.
id.at.wampler filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,arguing that his detention beyond the term originally imposed by the sentencing judge was illegal.see id.at.
the united states supreme court agreed with wampler.the court speaks through its judgment,and not through any other medium,the court held id.at.thus,the clerk addition of the requirement that wampler be detained until payment of the fines and costs assessed even though the clerk addition of this requirement was assertedly a common practice in the district in which wampler was sentenced was insufficient to incorporate that requirement into the sentence.see id.accordingly,the court held that issuance of the writ was appropriate.see id.at.wampler did not make clear which provision of the federal constitution rendered issuance of the writ appropriate,or even whether the constitution was,in fact,the source of the infirmity in the petitioner sentence.
some seventy years after wampler,this court had occasion to consider its import in earley murray,earley,a convicted criminal defendant,disputed his obligation to serve a term of supervision prs to which he would be subject upon release from prison.earley sentencing judge failed to mention that this mandatory term of prs would be imposed as required by penal law.see id.at.nevertheless,after his sentencing,docs administratively added a term of prs to earley sentence without informing earley.id.earley,having exhausted his state administrative remedies,sought relief in state court,seeking to be resentenced according to the terms imposed by the sentencing judge.see id.the state court found that,because the prs term is mandatory under new york law,earley request to eliminate it from his sentence could not be granted.id.earley then sought a writ of habeas corpus.see id.at.
addressing his claim,we began by noting that pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted unless a state court adjudication of a constitutional claim is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we then held that clearly established supreme court precedent renders the prs term added to earley sentence by docs invalid.id.at.we characterized wampler as holding that t he judgment of the court establishes a defendant sentence,and that sentence may not be increased by an administrator amendment.id.at.we also clarified that the right recognized in wampler sounds in procedural due process see id.at.because p supervision is considered to be custody,id.at,docs was not permitted to impose the period of prs at issue,despite the fact that new york law required the imposition of a period of prs in earley case,see id.at accordingly,we vacated the district court judgment and remanded with instructions to issue a writ of habeas corpus in the event the district court determined that earley petition was timely.see id.at.
thus,wampler and earley together stand for the proposition that administrative authorities have no power to alter a sentence,because t he imposition of a sentence is a judicial act only a judge can do it.earley,at.a person in custody by virtue of such conduct is,in appropriate circumstances,entitled to habeas relief.these two cases leave open,however,several questions which the state defendants argue are important to resolution of the present claims.
at the start,earley makes clear that even the illegality of a judge sentence does not affect a prisoner right under wampler to serve only the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge,until such time as that sentence is lawfully modified by a judge.see earley murray,denying petition for rehearing.neither earley nor wampler addresses a situation like the one at bar,however,involving not one sentence but the relationship between one sentence and another sentence imposed by a different judge in a separate proceeding.the state defendants argue that this distinction is important,even critical,to this matter resolution.
first,the state defendants suggest,the characterization of a later sentence as either concurrent or consecutive to an earlier sentence is not itself a part of either sentence,and therefore does not fall within the terms of earley holding.for this reason,the new york court of appeals in people ex rel.gill greene,held that a sentencing court need not pronounce at sentencing that a sentence is to be served consecutively to previous undischarged sentences as required in gill case by new york law in order for correctional authorities properly to calculate a release date based on the assumption of consecutive time 
the problem in earley was that a part of the sentence the prs term was never imposed that was indeed an error that only a court could correct.but here,the sentence at issue a term of imprisonment for to years was imposed.all that was omitted was the characterization of the sentence as either concurrent or consecutive.
that characterization is provided by the statute,penal law a,which says the sentence must be consecutive.nothing in the statute and nothing in the constitution requires the sentencing court to say the word consecutive,either orally or in writing.

the state defendants next argue that earley should not be extended to the present context for the reason that it was impossible under state law for sudler and batthany parole revocation sentences to run concurrently with their misdemeanor sentences,as ordered by their sentencing judges,so that the state defendants whatever policy they might follow in affording pjt credits in the circumstances here could not carry out the sentences actually imposed.according to the state defendants,the orders that sudler and batthany local sentences run concurrently with their parole violation sentences could not be executed by docs because the parole violation penalty imposed on both sudler and batthany required each one to serve the remainder of his old sentence in prison,and new york law provided that these sentences could not begin to run until sudler and batthany were returned to a facility under docs jurisdiction.see penal law a when a person is alleged to have violated the terms of parole and the state board of parole has declared such person to be delinquent,the declaration of delinquency shall interrupt the person sentence as of the date of the delinquency and such interruption shall continue until the return of the person to an institution under the jurisdiction of the state department of corrections and community supervision.thus,on the state defendants view,it was impossible for sudler and batthany local sentences to run concurrently with their parole violation sentences,entitling plaintiffs to pjt credits upon transfer to docs,because the parole violation sentences were not running at the time of plaintiffs incarceration at rikers 
the state defendants argue that the present case is thus analogous to the circuit decision in tippitt wood,which was decided only a few years after wampler.tippitt pled guilty in federal court in connection with a crime he committed while on parole and was sentenced to a term of four years to run concurrently with any revocation of the present suspended sentence and conditional release.id.at.the circuit nonetheless determined that the parole board had not acted unlawfully in holding tippitt after the expiration of his term to serve,consecutively,the entire remaining portion of the sentence on which he had been paroled,noting that it was a legal impossibility for the j udge to make the second sentence run concurrently with the first sentence,for this first sentence was not then running but had been suspended.id.at see also hendrix bradt,civ,wl,at,distinguishing earley on similar grounds.setser united states,d reserving judgment on whether an inmate would be entitled to habeas relief if the bureau of prisons declined to credit his time served in state prison where the federal sentencing judge had ordered that his federal sentence run concurrently with one state sentence but consecutively to another,and the state court later decided that both state sentences should run concurrently with each other,rendering execution of the district court instructions impossible.
sudler and batthany argue,to the contrary,that the state defendants are incorrect as to new york law that of new york penal law clearly authorized their sentencing judges to direct that the time they served for their misdemeanor violations run concurrently with the time they were to serve for violating parole,and that these directions could have and should have been carried out they reiterate,moreover,that even if their interpretation of new york law is incorrect,earley makes clear that the illegality of a sentencing order does not affect an individual right to serve only the sentence imposed by a sentencing court,until such time as this sentence is modified by a judge.they contend,finally,that there is no reason this precept should apply not only with regard to a single sentence,but also in the context of a sentencing judge pronouncement as to the relationship between the sentence he is imposing and another sentence imposed in a separate proceeding.
we do not resolve the parties substantial disagreements as to new york law,nor their disagreement as to the scope of wampler and earley.for the reasons that follow,we instead conclude that the district court correctly determined that the state defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on the claim that their due process rights were violated when docs officials failed promptly to afford them pjt credits for the time served on their local sentences.having also concluded,moreover,that in the circumstances here,we best follow that older,wiser judicial counsel not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable,pearson callahan,d quoting scott harris,d breyer,concurring internal quotation marks omitted,we reach the determination that the state defendants are entitled to qualified immunity without deciding the due process questions that this case presents.
qualified immunity 
qualified immunity protects government officials from liability where the officials conduct was not in violation of a clearly established constitutional right.see,doninger niehoff,cir.qualified immunity is an affirmative defense,on which the defendant officials bear the burden of proof.see lore city of syracuse,cir.if the conduct did not violate a clearly established constitutional right,or if it was objectively reasonable for the official to believe that his conduct did not violate such a right,then the official is protected by qualified immunity.doninger,at alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.qualified immunity thus shields government officials from liability when they make reasonable mistakes about the legality of their actions,saucier katz,d,abrogated on other grounds by pearson,d,and applies regardless of whether the government official error is a mistake of law,a mistake of fact,or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact,pearson,at internal quotation marks omitted.as we have said before,i n this respect,the supreme court has observed that qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.walczyk rio,cir quoting malley briggs,d.
the state defendants are clearly entitled to qualified immunity in the sudler action.to repeat,sudler claim sounds in procedural due process he alleges that,whatever new york law provides as to whether his misdemeanor sentences could properly run concurrently with his parole revocation sentence,the state defendants violated his due process right,made explicit in earley,to serve only the sentence pronounced by justice clancy until such time as this sentence was lawfully modified by a judge.sudler release date,however,was calculated by dop personnel prior to this court decision in earley,and sudler was released from prison approximately one month after the issuance of our decision and one month before our denial of rehearing in that case.
it is true that earley held that clearly established supreme court precedent namely,wampler rendered invalid the prs term added to earley sentence by prison administrators,on the ground that the prs term was not imposed by the sentencing court.id.at.in scott fischer,however,we noted that the
