the district court dismissed without prejudice,for lack of article iii standing,this challenge to a new hampshire statute that has not been activated or enforced since its enactment in.we agree that the challenge is not ripe and that there is no present article iii case or controversy before the court.we affirm the dismissal without prejudice.
the statute in question is new hampshire senate bill,entitled an act relative to access to reproductive health care facilities the act,which governor maggie hassan signed into law on june.see stat.ann.rsa.the act permits but does not require a reproductive health care facility to demarcate a zone extending up to feet onto public property adjacent to any of the facility private entrances,exits,or driveways.id,i.if a facility has demarcated a zone by posting the required signs,following the procedure specified,then members of the public with certain listed exceptions may not knowingly enter or remain on the portion of the public way or sidewalk within that zone.id.the act is enforced civilly,by its terms.see id.
mccullen coakley,which held unconstitutional a buffer zone statute in massachusetts,was decided by the supreme court on june,shortly after the signing of the act.soon thereafter,the plaintiffs commenced this action in federal district court.their complaint seeks to enjoin enforcement of the act and to have the act declared facially unconstitutional under mccullen.they filed the lawsuit before any facility had demarcated a buffer zone,and it remains true that no facility has ever created one.the parties agreed to a protracted stay,during which they agreed to preserve the status quo,and which was in effect until they agreed to dissolve the stay in part on august,see reddy foster,wl,at.the district court ultimately granted the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of standing.id.at.
we agree with the district court that this facial challenge to the act constitutionality relies on overly speculative allegations of injury in fact and is premature.id.the plaintiffs have shown neither standing nor ripeness.first,the plaintiffs have not alleged that the act has meaningfully altered their expressive activities,nor that it has objectively chilled their exercise of first amendment rights.because no facility in new hampshire has yet demarcated a zone,and there is no present evidence that a zone will ever be demarcated,the plaintiffs alleged injury is too speculative for article iii purposes.clapper amnesty int l usa,quoting lujan defs.of wildlife.second,the plaintiffs have failed to establish standing either by arguing that case law about prior restraint applies,see van wagner,llc davey,cir,or by arguing from the fact that the act authorizes private clinics to create buffer zones.the act is not a prior restraint,and there are no factual allegations that a clinic has used its power as a tool to change the plaintiffs behavior.third,because the plaintiffs have not alleged a present chill,and because they have failed to allege the contours or location of any buffer zone,or why such a zone was created,we have no ripe case to adjudicate and no facts that would allow us to fashion judicial relief.see texas united states.

legislative history of the act 
in its statement of findings and purposes accompanying the passage of the act,the new hampshire legislature found that r ecent demonstrations outside of reproductive health care facilities had resulted in the fear and intimidation of patients and employees of the facilities,caused patients and employees to believe that their safety and right of privacy we re threatened,and resulted in the fear and intimidation of residents and patrons seeking to enter or leave their homes or other private businesses adjacent to the facilities.the legislature simultaneously found,however,that t he exercise of a person right to protest or counsel against certain medical procedures is a first amendment activity that must be protected.accordingly,the legislature concluded that 
establishing a limited buffer zone outside of some reproductive health care facilities located in the state of new hampshire wa s necessary to ensure that patients and employees of reproductive health care facilities ha d unimpeded access to reproductive health care services while accommodating the first amendment right of people to communicate their message to their intended audience without undue burdens or restrictions.
aiming to accommodate those interests,the act provides that n o person shall knowingly enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk within a buffer zone demarcated by a reproductive health care facility.rsa,i.that prohibition does not apply to four classes of persons 
a persons entering or leaving such facility.
b employees or agents of such facility acting within the scope of their employment for the purpose of providing patient escort services only.
c law enforcement,ambulance,firefighting,construction,utilities,public works and other municipal agents acting within the scope of their employment.
d persons using the public sidewalk or the adjacent to such facility solely for the purpose of reaching a destination other than such facility.
id,i a d.the act also provides that facilities must first consult with law enforcement and with local authorities with authority over signage p rior to posting the signage to ensure compliance with local ordinances,id,iii,and then must clearly demarcate any zone they wish to create by means of signage bearing specified language,id,ii.a zone created pursuant to the act is effective only during the facility business hours.id,iv.
law enforcement officers may not impose sanctions,which are civil sanctions,for violating the act unless the signage authorized in rsa,ii was in place at the time of the alleged violation.id,iii.if that precondition is satisfied,an officer is restricted to giving a written warning for an individual first violation of the act,and then a citation for subsequent violations.id,i.the citation carries with it a minimum fine of,and the attorney general or the appropriate county attorney may bring an action for injunctive relief to prevent further violations.id,ii.the act also has a severability clause.id.
in the past,some of new hampshire clinics have resolved or attempted to resolve disputes with protestors by asking local police officers to enforce generally applicable local civil ordinances relating to public peace,safety,and crowd control.
mccullen coakley 
sixteen days after governor hassan signed the act into law,the supreme court decided mccullen,and that decision affected the parties in this case.mccullen held unconstitutional a massachusetts statute that categorically excluded most individuals from the area within a fixed radius of any portion of an entrance,exit or driveway of a reproductive health care facility during the facility business hours.at.the statute was enforceable both civilly and criminally,with fines,imprisonment,or both.id.
the massachusetts statute,the court said,was a time,place,or manner regulation of speech.see id.at.the court applied the test for such regulations,as articulated in ward rock against racism,and concluded that the statute was not narrowly tailored,see mccullen,at,because it burden ed substantially more speech than wa s necessary to further the government legitimate interests,id.at quoting ward,at.hence,massachusetts statute violated the first amendment.see id.at.
the court narrow tailoring analysis in mccullen placed particular weight on two key factors.first,the massachusetts statute created buffer zones of a fixed size,feet,around every abortion clinic in the state,see id.at,although the record reflected that congestion problems occurred mainly in one place at one time the boston planned parenthood clinic on saturday mornings,id.at.the court saw a mismatch between the narrowness of the problem and the breadth of the solution.second,massachusetts ha d not shown that it seriously undertook to address the problem of obstruction and harassment by protestors outside clinics with less intrusive tools readily available to it.id.nor ha d it shown that it considered different methods that other jurisdictions ha d found effective.id.
c.this lawsuit 
the parties 
the complaint alleges that all seven plaintiffs regularly engage in peaceful prayer,leafleting,sidewalk counseling,advocacy,and other peaceful expressive activities outside various reproductive health care facilities in new hampshire.it further alleges that the plaintiffs sidewalk counseling regularly occurs on areas of the public sidewalks and ways that will be encompassed by buffer zones authorized by the act,and so they fear prosecution under the act if they continue to engage in expressive activities in those public locations.
defendant joseph foster is the attorney general of new hampshire.the other defendants are the municipalities containing the clinics at which the plaintiffs wish to continue engaging in expressive activities,as well as the county attorneys responsible for enforcing the law in those municipalities.the complaint names the municipal defendants as parties because they are authorized to enforce the act buffer zones in their respective jurisdictions 
district court proceedings 
on july,soon after the supreme court decided mccullen and three days before the act was scheduled to take effect,the plaintiffs initiated this action.their complaint seeks to enjoin enforcement of the act and to have it struck down as facially unconstitutional under mccullen,as well as unconstitutional as applied.when the district court lifted its stay on further proceedings in august,the state attorney general moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss on march,and then entered judgment and a corrected opinion on april.reddy,wl.the plaintiffs timely appealed.
standing and ripeness 
article iii restricts federal court jurisdiction to cases and controversies.const.art.iii.that limitation on t he judicial power of the united states is fundamental to the federal judiciary role within our constitutional separation of powers.spokeo,robins,alteration in original quoting const.art.iii,see also warth seldin,discussing the proper and properly limited role of the courts in a democratic society.two of the limitation manifestations are the justiciability doctrines of standing and ripeness,which are interrelated each is rooted in article iii.see susan anthony list driehaus sba list,t he article iii standing and ripeness issues in this case boil down to the same question.quoting medimmune,genentech,warth,at noting the close affinity between standing,ripeness,and mootness see also richard fallon et,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed.observing that ripeness substantially replicate s the standing inquiry in many respects.this case implicates both doctrines.
the f irst and foremost concern in standing analysis is the requirement that the plaintiff establish an injury in fact,spokeo,at alteration in original quoting steel citizens for a better env t,which helps to ensure that the plaintiff has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,sba list,at quoting warth,at.to satisfy article iii,the injury must be concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.quoting lujan,at.
in certain circumstances,the threatened enforcement of a law may suffice as an imminent article iii injury in fact.id.at.the rationale for standing is that a plaintiff should not have to expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.steffel thompson.an allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending,or if there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur.sba list,at quoting clapper,at.but if a future injury is too speculative for article iii purposes and no prosecution is even close to impending,then there is no standing to sue.blum holder,cir.quoting clapper,at.
because sba list both postdated and cited clapper,we follow its disjunctive framing of the test injury is imminent if it is certainly impending or if there is a substantial risk that harm will occur.we hold that the plaintiffs have made neither showing here.it is their burden to do so.see lujan,at.
ripeness,another aspect of justiciability,has roots in both the article iii case or controversy requirement and in prudential considerations.roman catholic bishop of springfield city of springfield,cir.quoting mangual,cir.much as standing doctrine seeks to keep federal courts out of disputes involving conjectural or hypothetical injuries,the supreme court has reinforced that ripeness doctrine seeks to prevent the adjudication of claims relating to contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas,at quoting thomas union carbide agric.prods.t he facts alleged,under all the circumstances,must show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of the judicial relief sought.labor relations div.of constr.indus.of,healey,wl,at cir,quoting medimmune,at.
insofar as ripeness is rooted in article iii,we must consider it as part of our assessment of whether we have jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit see warth,at.the plaintiffs bear the burden of alleging facts sufficient to demonstrate ripeness.see labor relations,wl,at citing nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon impson,cir.even a facial challenge to a statute is constitutionally unripe until a plaintiff can show that federal court adjudication would redress some sort of imminent injury that he or she faces.see texas,at here,as is often true,d etermination of the scope of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.alterations in original quoting int l longshoremen warehousemen union,local boyd,labor relations,wl,at finding a lawsuit seeking relief not ripe for adjudication no matter how it is best characterized along the spectrum.
ripeness analysis has two prongs fitness and hardship.see texas,at quoting abbott labs.gardner.the fitness prong has both jurisdictional and prudential components.roman catholic bishop,at.the jurisdictional component of the fitness prong concerns whether there is a sufficiently live case or controversy,at the time of the proceedings,to create jurisdiction in the federal courts.id.we find that the jurisdictional component has not been satisfied here,independently of any failure to establish the prudential component.
the prudential component of the fitness prong concerns whether resolution of the dispute should be postponed in the name of judicial restraint from unnecessary decision of constitutional issues.id.quoting mangual,at.the hardship prong is wholly prudential,id.at quoting mangual,at,and concerns the harm to the parties seeking relief that would come to those parties from our withholding of a decision at this time,labor relations,wl,at quoting me.med,cir.we find that these prudential dimensions of ripeness also have not been satisfied here.
application of justiciability doctrines 
our review of the district court dismissal is de novo.see blum,at.
we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs lack standing,at this time and on this record,to challenge the act.the record does not contain allegations that the plaintiffs are currently facing a certainly impending injury,nor have the plaintiffs shown that they face a substantial risk of injury.sba list,at quoting clapper,at.
a.a precondition to enforcement has not been satisfied,and the plaintiffs behavior has not been affected
