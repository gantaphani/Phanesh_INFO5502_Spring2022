akamai technologies,a respondent here,is the exclusive licensee of a patent that claims a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network cdn.petitioner,limelight networks,also operates a cdn and carries out several of the steps claimed in the patent,but its customers,rather than limelight itself,perform a step of the patent known as tagging.under federal circuit case law,liability for direct infringement under a requires performance of all steps of a method patent to be attributable to a single party.this position was most recently refined in muniauction,thomson.the district court concluded that limelight could not have directly infringed the patent at issue because performance of the tagging step could not be attributed to it.the en banc federal circuit reversed,holding that a defendant who performed some steps of a method patent and encouraged others to perform the rest could be liable for inducement of infringement even if no one was liable for direct infringement.the en banc court concluded that the evidence could support liability for limelight on an inducement theory and remanded for further proceedings.
held a defendant is not liable for inducing infringement under b when no one has directly infringed under a or any other statutory provision.
a liability for inducement must be predicated on direct infringement.aro convertible top replacement.assuming that muniauction holding is correct,respondents method has not been infringed because the performance of all of its steps is not attributable to any one person.since direct has not occurred,there can be no inducement of infringement under b.the federal circuit contrary view would deprive b of ascertainable standards and require the courts to develop two parallel bodies of infringement law.this court reading of b is reinforced by f,which illustrates that congress knows how to impose inducement liability predicated on conduct when it wishes to do so.the notion that conduct which would be infringing in altered circumstances can form the basis for contributory infringement has been rejected,see deepsouth packing laitram,and there is no reason to apply a different rule for inducement.
b respondents claim that principles from tort law and criminal aiding and abetting doctrine,as well as patent law principles in existence before the patent act,support the federal circuit reading of the statute,but their arguments are unpersuasive.though a infringer could evade liability by dividing performance of a method patent steps with another whose conduct can not be attributed to the defendant,this is merely a result of the federal circuit interpretation of a,and a desire to avoid this consequence does not justify fundamentally altering the rules of inducement liability clearly required by the patent act text and structure.
c because the question presented here is clearly focused on b and presupposes that limelight has not committed direct infringement under a,the court declines to address whether the federal circuit decision in muniauction is correct.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
this case presents the question whether a defendant may be liable for inducing infringement of a patent under b when no one has directly infringed the patent under a or any other statutory provision.the statutory text and structure and our prior case law require that we answer this question in the negative.we accordingly reverse the federal circuit,which reached the opposite conclusion.
respondent the massachusetts institute of technology is the assignee of patent patent,which claims a method of delivering electronic data using a content delivery network,or cdn.respondent akamai technologies,is the exclusive licensee.akamai maintains many servers distributed in various locations.proprietors of web sites,known as content providers,contract with akamai to deliver their web sites content to individual internet users.the patent provides for the designation of certain components of a content provider web site often large files,such as video or music files to be stored on akamai servers and accessed from those servers by internet users.the process of designating components to be stored on akamai servers is known as tagging.by aggregat ing the data demands of multiple content providers with differing peak usage patterns and serv ing that content from multiple servers in multiple locations,supp,as well as by delivering content from servers located in the same geographic area as the users who are attempting to access it,akamai is able to increase the speed with which internet users access the content of its customers web sites.
petitioner limelight networks,also operates a cdn and carries out several of the steps claimed in the patent.but instead of tagging those components of its customers web sites that it intends to store on its servers a step included in the patent,limelight requires its customers to do their own tagging respondents claim that limelight provides instructions and offers technical assistance to its customers regarding how to tag,ca fed,but the record is undisputed that limelight does not tag the components to be stored on its servers.
in,respondents sued limelight in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,claiming patent infringement.the case was tried to a jury,which found that limelight had committed infringement and awarded more than million in damages.
respondents victory was,however.after the jury returned its verdict,the federal circuit decided muniauction,thomson.in that case the court of appeals rejected a claim that the defendant method,involving bidding on financial instruments using a computer system,directly infringed the plaintiff patent.the defendant performed some of the steps of the patented method,and its customers,to whom the defendant gave access to its system along with instructions on the use of the system,performed the remaining steps.the court started from the proposition that direct infringement requires a single party to perform every step of a claimed method.at.this requirement is satisfied even though the steps are actually undertaken by multiple parties,the court explained,if a single defendant exercises control or direction over the entire process such that every step is attributable to the controlling party.ibid.the court held that the defendant in muniauction was not liable for direct infringement because it did not exercise control or direction over its customers performance of those steps of the patent that the defendant itself did not perform,at.
in light of muniauction,limelight moved for reconsideration of its earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court had denied.the district court granted the motion,concluding that muniauction precluded a finding of direct infringement under a because infringement of the patent required tagging and limelight does not control or direct its customers tagging.a panel of the federal circuit affirmed,explaining that a defendant that does not itself undertake all of a patent steps can be liable for direct infringement only when there is an agency relationship between the parties who perform the method steps or when one party is contractually obligated to the other to perform the steps.at.since neither of these conditions was met in the present case,the federal circuit panel held that limelight could not be held liable for direct infringement ibid.
the federal circuit granted en banc review and reversed.the en banc court found it unnecessary to revisit its a direct infringemen
