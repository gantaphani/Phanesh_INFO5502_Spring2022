martha dean appeals from an april,judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut thompson,dismissing her complaint.dean,a former and possibly future candidate for attorney general in connecticut,argues that a contractual prohibition on contributions to candidates for the office of the attorney general from,inter alia,certain employees of private law firms that performed legal work for the state violated dean rights under the first amendment.because the challenged contractual language has not been enforced in over six years and could not reasonably be expected to be reimplemented,we hold that dean requested relief of a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and a order are moot.we also hold that appellee richard blumenthal is entitled to qualified immunity from dean claim for damages because there was no clearly established right under the first amendment to receive campaign contributions during the relevant period.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
under connecticut general statute,the attorney general for the state of connecticut attorney general may procure such assistance as he or she may require in carrying out his or her official responsibilities.pursuant to this statute,the state of connecticut,acting through its attorney general,has contracted a portion of the state legal business to the private bar.
from to october,attorney general richard blumenthal included and enforced the following provision in contracts with outside counsel 
no partner,owner,director employee,with managerial discretionary authority,of the counsel may directly or indirectly make financial donations to any candidate for the office of the attorney general of the state of connecticut during the course of this agreement.
the attorney general interpreted this language to apply to all lawyers in a contracting law firm as well as to spouses of covered lawyers.according to the attorney general,this provision was included in order to avoid the appearance that the contracting law firm was being awarded a contract in exchange for future campaign contributions.
in,this policy was challenged by appellant martha dean,who was the republican party candidate in connecticut for the office of the attorney general.her opponent was appellee blumenthal,who at that time had held the office for twelve years.prior to election day,dean filed a complaint in which she alleged that blumenthal policy on campaign donations deprived her of needed financing for her campaign as a result of willing contributors withholding contributions for fear of suffering the loss of the state business.compl.pursuant to,dean asserted that blumenthal policy both violated her right under the first amendment to receive campaign contributions and deprived her of her right to receive funding for her campaign from otherwise willing supporters without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment.compl.dean also alleged violations of the connecticut constitution.she sought relief including damages,a judgment declaring the contractual bar on campaign contributions to be null and void,a order,and a preliminary injunction enjoining the promulgation of the policy.
approximately one week prior to the election,blumenthal temporarily suspended the contractual prohibition on campaign contributions pending a final decision by the district court.a letter was faxed to all firms with contracts with the office of the attorney general notifying them of the suspension.blumenthal,however,continued to refuse to accept any campaign contributions from partners and associates as well as their spouses of any law firm holding an outside counsel contract with the attorney general office.after winning,blumenthal moved to dismiss dean complaint.
approximately four years passed between blumenthal motion to dismiss and the district court eventual ruling.because the lawsuit had not been resolved by the next election cycle in,blumenthal continued his suspension of the campaign contribution prohibition once again,a letter was faxed to all firms with open contracts with the office of the attorney general notifying them of the policy continued suspension.in addition,the connecticut general assembly passed campaign finance legislation in december that prohibited contributions from,inter alia,state contractors and prospective state contractors to certain committees affiliated with a candidate for the office of attorney general.see,spec.sess.as a result of this legislation,blumenthal publicized to all firms with contracts with the office of the attorney general that the contractual bar on campaign contributions would be wholly and permanently superseded by the statutory ban as of december,the effective date of the campaign finance legislation.
in september,the district court granted blumenthal motion to dismiss.the court held that dean claim under the fourteenth amendment failed because she could not demonstrate a liberty or property interest in the receipt of campaign contributions.it also dismissed dean state law claims as barred by the eleventh amendment during the following week,the district court dismissed dean remaining claim,which was based on the first amendment.the district court concluded that dean lacked standing because there existed no constitutional right to receive campaign contributions.
discussion 
as a preliminary matter,we address our jurisdiction over this appeal,which we have an independent obligation to evaluate even in the absence of a challenge from any party.sharkey quarantillo,cir.we lack jurisdiction if we conclude that a case is moot.fox bd.of trs.of the state of,cir see also steffel thompson,d the rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.a case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d internal quotation marks omitted see church of scientology of cal.united states,d it has long been settled that a federal court has no authority to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that much of dean appeal is moot and therefore beyond our jurisdiction to review.dean complaint principally seeks a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and a order regarding an office policy that it is undisputed no longer exists.compl.at.dean attempts to avoid this complication by contending that blumenthal could the policy at any moment,which might affect her if she runs in the next election and which,in any event,may amount to unconstitutional conduct that is capable of repetition yet evades review.see altman bedford cent.sch,cir a narrow exception to the principle that a moot claim is to be dismissed,available only in exceptional situations,is that the court may adjudicate a claim that,though technically moot,is capable of repetition,yet evading review.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is clear,however,that the attorney general will not the contractual bar on campaign contributions.the attorney general has represented to the court that he has no intent to reintroduce the challenged provision into his contracts.standing alone,this representation might not suffice to render moot dean requested relief.see united states grant.holding that,although defendant had disclaimed any intention to revive the challenged conduct,s uch a profession does not suffice to make a case moot although it is one of the factors to be considered in determining the appropriateness of granting an injunction against the acts see also friends of the earth,at.describing the heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct can not reasonably be expected to start up again internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.but the attorney general claim is bolstered by his voluntary practice of not enforcing the contractual prohibition over the past six years and of deleting the contractual prohibition over two years ago.
moreover,although v oluntary cessation of illegal conduct does not necessarily render the controversy moot,state org.for women terry,cir,the attorney general has further represented that connecticut campaign finance legislation.g a,wholly and permanently superseded the contractual bar,thus rendering it superfluous.it is true,as dean asserts,that the statutory and contractual language do not cover identical conduct.for example,the office of the attorney general acknowledged that the contractual provision applied to contracts in all amounts,while g a applies only to contracts in excess of.see.g c.nonetheless,it is undisputed that,in reliance upon his interpretation that the statutory and contractual language cover sufficiently similar situations,the attorney general voluntarily eliminated the contractual bar upon the statute effective date over two years ago.the attorney general also has not reimplemented his practice despite a favorable ruling from the district court in april that dean lacked standing to challenge the contractual prohibition.consequently,there is no reasonably concrete basis to anticipate that the expired rule will be reenacted in a form that will raise the same questions.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.
in light of the undisputed fact that the contractual bar is no longer in effect,the attorney general consistent and voluntary conduct over an extended period of time in not enforcing the contractual ban,his removal of the challenged contractual language based upon his belief that legislation has wholly and permanently rendered the challenged practice unnecessary,his representations that he has no intention to the practice,and his declining to reimplement the challenged practice despite a favorable ruling from the district court dismissing dean complaint,we conclude that dean requested relief for a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and a order are moot.see catanzano wing,cir since both plaintiffs and defendants agree that the state is no longer implementing the fiscal assessment laws,and there is no reason to expect that fiscal assessments are now occurring or that the legislature will reenact the laws,no controversy now exists with respect to this claim and it is therefore moot.
dean complaint,however,also seeks damages,and blumenthal withdrawal of the challenged policy does not render moot dean requested relief for past constitutional violations.see stokes vill.of wurtsboro,cir claims for damages or other monetary relief automatically avoid mootness,so long as the claim remains viable.quoting charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed see also beyah coughlin,cir holding that an allegedly unconstitutional practice,which no longer affects plaintiff,may well moot plaintiff claims for declaratory and injunctive relief but does not moot the request for damages.even if dean actual damages are speculative,i t is clear that nominal damages are available in actions alleging violations of constitutionally protected rights.fox,at.
because dean claims are not moot insofar as she seeks damages,we now consider dean claim that the attorney general policy violated her purported first amendment right to receive campaign contributions.blumenthal disputed the existence of any such right,and the district court agreed.although we affirm the district court judgment,we do not adopt its reasoning see in re certain underwriter,cir w e are free to affirm an appealed decision on any ground which finds support in the record.internal quotation marks omitted.instead,we conclude that,regardless of whether a right to receive campaign contributions exists,it was not clearly established at the time of blumenthal alleged misconduct,and blumenthal is therefore entitled to qualified immunity see pearson callahan,d the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.quoting harlow fitzgerald,d 
before discussing whether the right at issue was clearly established,however,we first explain how we approach our analysis of qualified immunity in light of the supreme court recent of its holding in saucier katz,d,which had mandated a sequence for resolving government officials claims of qualified immunity.in the first step under saucier,courts had asked the following question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right id.at.if a violation of a constitutional right was discerned,then the second question required by saucier was whether the right was clearly established.id.
in pearson callahan,the supreme court recognized that saucier protocol is often beneficial,such as where the analysis of the facts under clearly established law make s it apparent that the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all and where the question presented does not frequently arise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is unavailable.at.but the court rejected saucier obligatory,rule for resolving all qualified immunity claims.id.at.the court noted a variety of situations in which a rule was inappropriate,including where 
i t is plain that a constitutional right is not clearly established but far from obvious whether in fact there is such a right.
a constitutional question is so that the decision provides little guidance for future cases.
i t appears that the question will soon be decided by a higher court.
the constitutional decision rests on an uncertain interpretation of state law.
the answer to whether there was a violation may depend on a kaleidoscope of facts not yet fully developed.
the briefing of constitutional questions is woefully inadequate.
a decision may make it hard for affected parties to obtain appellate review of constitutional decisions.
where the sequence in which judges reach their conclusions in their own internal thought processes is different from the sequence prescribed by saucier,thereby creating a risk that a court may not devote as much care as it would in other circumstances to the decision of the constitutional issue.
id.at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.based on these concerns,the court held that courts should have the discretion to decide whether th e saucier procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.id.at.
we exercise our discretion here and will initially evaluate whether the constitutional right asserted by dean was clearly established during the relevant period.only if the right was clearly established will we then consider whether the facts that dean has alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right.we invert the saucier sequence because,as discussed below,it is clear that a constitutional right to receive campaign contributions was not clearly established,but it is far from obvious whether in fact there is such a right.id.at.we also do not believe that a challenge to a practice that has been defunct for over six years,where injunctive relief is moot and where damages are speculative,presents an appropriate opportunity to explore the complexities of a difficult constitutional question.
in turning to our analysis of whether the constitutional right at issue here was clearly established,we may consider 
whether the right in question was defined with reasonable specificity 
whether the decisional law of the supreme court and the applicable circuit court support the existence of the right in question and whether under preexisting law a reasonable defendant official would have understood that his or her acts were unlawful.
