making their second appearance before this court are eight police officers,a police cadet,and a provisionally hired operator collectively,the officers,who claim that they suffered adverse employment actions by the boston police department department as a result of a racially discriminatory hair drug test.eschewing any claim that the department discriminated against them intentionally,the officers advance a disparate impact claim under title vii of the civil rights act of.see k.adjudicating the question of liability under such a claim begets a,sequential inquiry.see lopez city of lawrence,cir.in our prior opinion,we held that the officers all of whom identify as black had established under the first prong of that inquiry that the hair drug test caused a cognizable disparate impact.see jones city of boston jones i,cir.we remanded the case to the district court to consider the next two prongs by determining,either on summary judgment or after trial,as appropriate whether the department drug testing program was job related and consistent with business necessity and,if so,whether the department refused to adopt an available alternative that would have met the department legitimate needs while having less of a disparate impact.
on remand,the district court again entered summary judgment for the department,concluding that the evidence could not support a jury verdict for the officers on either of the remaining prongs of the disparate impact liability inquiry.we now vacate that judgment,albeit only in part.although the drug test was indisputably job related and its use was consistent with business necessity,a reasonable factfinder could nevertheless conclude that the department refused to adopt an available alternative to the challenged hair testing program that would have met the department legitimate needs while having less of a disparate impact.our reasoning follows.
background 
our prior opinion details much of the relevant factual background.see jones i,at.in a nutshell,from to,the department administered a hair drug test to thousands of officers,cadets,and job applicants.the testing procedure called for the gathering of a hair sample,which was then washed and analyzed for the presence of cocaine,marijuana,opiates,pcp,and amphetamines.upon detecting cocaine in a hair sample,a licensed physician would determine whether legally administered medication could have caused the positive result.the individual who tested positive was also permitted to submit a second sample for a test.
the results were negative for over of the white individuals tested and over of the black individuals tested.the officers now before us,however,were among the fewer than two percent of black individuals who tested positive for cocaine.as a result,nine lost a job or job offer,and one received an unpaid suspension subject to participation in a drug rehabilitation and testing program.
in the first,the district court relied on a rule of thumb promulgated by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc to declare that there was no actionable disparate impact,because the difference in pass rates between white and black officers was so miniscule as to be of no practical significance.we,in turn,found the eeoc rule of thumb not controlling.see id.at.instead,because the difference in exam results by race was indisputably statistically significant,we concluded that the officers prevailed as a matter of law on the first prong of the disparate impact inquiry.id.at.on remand,the case was randomly assigned to a new district court judge in accord with the district customary practice.
in short order,the parties marshalled their evidence,mostly in the form of competing expert opinions concerning the reliability of the test,together with affidavits from the officers denying drug use.in a lengthy and attentive opinion,the district court found that no reasonable jury could rule in favor of the officers on either of the two remaining prongs.specifically,the court found that the department demonstrated the business necessity and job relatedness of the hair drug test,jones city of boston,supp,mass,and that the officers failed to offer any compelling evidence of the department refusal to consider and adopt an alternative equally valid procedure,id.at.the officers appeal both findings.
ii.discussion 
ruling on a motion for summary judgment,the district court was required to assume that any disputes of material conflicting opinions offered by competent experts could be resolved by the jury in the officers favor.see corporaci√≥n insular de seguros,cir.on appeal,we must also so assume,see sensing outback steakhouse of,llc,cir,and we consider the summary judgment ruling de novo,martinez petrenko,cir.
and consistency with business necessity 
we consider first whether a reasonable jury could find that the department use of the hair drug test to terminate or suspend officers was job related and consistent with business necessity.k a i.the parties agree that abstention from drug use is an important element of police officer behavior,and is thus job related.the officers also quite understandably concede that selecting police officers for retention or discharge based on that behavior is consistent with business necessity.the pivotal question,therefore,is whether a reasonable jury could nonetheless find that the hair drug test as used by the department was so unreliable that its use did not meaningfully further the department legitimate need for a police force.see jones i,at suggesting that the hair test would have to be so unreliable that its results have no significant correlation with drug use see also lopez,at a selection practice is valid if it materially enhances the employer ability to pick individuals who are more likely to perform their jobs better than those not picked.emphasis added.
certainly,the evidence would allow a reasonable jury to find that the hair test as employed by the department was not reliable because according to the officers experts it could not always distinguish between ingestion of drugs and contamination of the hair by environmental exposure to drugs.the officers experts further testified that this inability to distinguish unerringly between ingestion and exposure could well have caused the disparate impact because,at the margins,black hair,especially if damaged by some cosmetic treatments more commonly used by black individuals,is more likely to absorb and retain contaminants to which the hair might be exposed.
so far,so good for the officers.the problem,though,is that a finding that all of the test few positive results might not have accurately distinguished between ingestion and exposure logically falls short of establishing that using the test to move towards a police force did not further the department important needs.to evaluate the reliability of the hair drug test in this context,one must consider the test as a whole and the relative numbers of errors among both the positive and negative results.
the department employs thousands of officers.it would like to know which officers abstain from drug use and which do not.as best the record reveals and no party argued otherwise to the district court the negative hair test results were all accurate.this means that the hair test was accurate in the overwhelming majority of cases,reliably confirming that almost all officers,irrespective of race,very likely abstained from using the drugs within as many as ninety days prior to the test.this undisputed high degree of accuracy is far beyond what we have recently and repeatedly indicated satisfies the employer burden of proving that a challenged employment practice furthers an important need of the employer.see jones i,at see also lopez,at.it also eliminates any reason to look at the technical guidance for assessing job relatedness promulgated by the eeoc.see lopez,at.
of course,unless the test was accurate at distinguishing exposure from ingestion,obtaining a police force in this manner could well have been unfair to some of the few officers who received positive results as we will discuss,this potential unfairness was the focus of a state administrative just cause adjudication.the second prong of the disparate impact inquiry,though,focuses only on the reliability of the test in meeting the employer needs.see albemarle paper moody.and as we have previously stated,see lopez,at,there is no reason why a test need be anything near reliable few tests are to be consistent with business necessity keeping in mind that the presence of an alternative method that would have had less of a disparate impact will still be relevant under the third prong of the inquiry.
notwithstanding the foregoing reasoning,the officers argue that a ruling in by the massachusetts civil service commission mcsc collaterally precludes the department from claiming that the hair test was job related and consistent with business necessity.in that ruling,the mcsc overturned most but not all of the officers dismissals,determining that a positive hair test was insufficiently reliable by itself to establish just cause for termination by a preponderance of the evidence.both the massachusetts superior court,see bos.police dep t civil serv.comm n,slip op.at.super,and the massachusetts court of appeals,see thompson civil serv.comm n.app,have since affirmed the mcsc conclusions regarding the reliability of the positive results generated by the hair drug test.
we review the applicability vel non of issue preclusion de novo.monarch life ins.ropes gray,cir.a party advocating for issue preclusion must show among other things that the issues raised in the two actions are the same and the determination of the issue was necessary to that judgment.manganella evanston ins,cir.the identity of the issues need not be absolute rather,it is enough that the issues are in substance identical.id.citing montana united states.
the issue before the mcsc was whether a positive test result by itself was just cause for terminating a tenured public employee.that is simply not an issue in this case.the officers nevertheless point out that the mcsc made a subsidiary finding that the positive results failed to show that drug ingestion was more likely than not.there is nothing in this finding,though,that conflicts with the district court central conclusion that use of the hair drug test furthered the department legitimate need to have a police force comprised of officers who abstain from using the drugs.indeed,the mcsc expressly stated that the test has a legitimate place in narrowing down which of its few officers may reasonably be suspected of abusing illicit drugs.this statement supports,rather than precludes,the district court conclusion that the use of the drug test furthered a significant employer need.the mcsc parted company with the district court only to the extent that the mcsc was required to ask a further question not germane to the district court inquiry,whether a reasonable suspicion of illicit drug use was just cause for terminating a tenured public employee.
we therefore agree with the district court that the record in this case even including the mcsc findings renders unreasonable any claim that the department has not proved that its use of the hair test was job related and consistent with business necessity.
refusal to adopt available alternative that would have met employer legitimate needs with less disparate impact 
our conclusion that a reasonable jury would have to find that the hair drug test was job related and consistent with business necessity does not mean that it was necessarily lawful to use the disparately impactful test.rather,it brings us to the third and final prong of the disparate impact liability inquiry whether the evidence could support a jury finding that the department nevertheless refuses to adopt an available alternative employment practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employer legitimate needs.ricci destefano,citing k a ii,c.application of this prong in this case turns on the answers to three questions first,does the record contain evidence that would allow a jury to find that there was an alternative method of meeting the department legitimate needs second,does the record also allow a jury to find that adopting that alternative method would have had less of a disparate impact and finally,could a jury find that the department refuses to adopt that alternative method we consider each question in turn.
could a reasonable jury find that an alternative method would have met the department legitimate needs 
with relatively little explanation or elaboration,the officers opening brief offers four proposed alternatives to the hair drug test,only one of which it subsequently contends the department refused to adopt even though it would have been equally effective in meeting the department needs and less disparately impactful.the parties refer to that alternative as hair testing plus urinalysis.by this,the officers mean the following first,administer the hair test to all officers which will clear over of the individuals tested then,administer a series of random urinalysis tests only to those officers who receive positive results on the hair test and discharge or suspend,pending rehabilitation and further drug testing only those who flunk one of the random urinalysis tests 
this approach would have fully replicated the results of the hair test alone except,a jury might find,it would have cleared those who received a positive hair test yet were likely not using cocaine.and if the urinalysis tests continued randomly over the course of more than ninety days,they would have confirmed a period of drug abstention equal to that confirmed by a negative hair test.
would this alternative have equally met the department needs a reasonable jury might so find.keep in mind that the department already used a series of negative urinalysis tests as a basis to reinstate suspended officers who tested positive on the hair test officers who tested positive on the hair test under the challenged practice could choose to admit to drug use receive a day unpaid suspension undergo drug rehabilitation and submit to frequent,random urinalysis for three years.the only difference between the challenged practice and the proposed hair testing plus urinalysis alternative is that firing or suspension and drug rehabilitation preceded the urinalysis testing in the actual regime,whereas no change in employment status would have occurred until after urinalysis confirmation in the alternative scheme.additionally,department policy has long permitted supervisors with a reasonable suspicion that an officer is using drugs to order urinalysis screening of that officer.that the department used urinalysis in these scenarios where officers had already tested positive for drugs or were reasonably suspected of using drugs naturally suggests that the department viewed random urinalysis as an acceptably reliable method for detecting drug use on a targeted rather than mass basis to the extent that a concern with urinalysis is its manipulability,a jury could find that the more frequent and randomized nature of the officers proposed urinalysis program would have sufficiently minimized such a concern 
crucially,the alternative would have retained the main benefit of the challenged drug testing program using a relatively unintrusive,hair test to generate the negative results that confirm that almost all officers,regardless of race,do not use illegal drugs.all in all,we think that this is a close enough call that a jury could conclude that the officers proffered alternative equally would have met the department needs.indeed,if a jury believed the thrust of the officers evidence,it might conclude that the alternative test method would have saved the department from losing several veteran officers who were not using cocaine.
could a reasonable jury find that the alternative would have generated less of a disparate impact 
in jones i,we observed that a plaintiff who subjects a defendant practice to the sensitivity of a large sample analysis can fairly be required to show through statistical evidence,and with equal confidence,that the proffered alternative practice will have a smaller impact,except where the alternative is incapable of causing a differential.at.the department reads this statement as always requiring a new,statistical analysis that specifies the precise impact of an alternative practice.we reject this overly narrow reading of the manner by which statistical evidence can be marshalled.rather,the plaintiff in some situations can use the statistically determined impact of the challenged process as a baseline,and demonstrate that the alternative practice must necessarily be less.suppose,for example,that an employer selected job applicants by height,creating a disparate gender impact revealed through a statistical analysis.if the proposed alternative were to use a random selection tool such as a coin flip,it would be that the impact would be less hence,there would be no need for actually running the numbers through a new analysis.
here,if the jury were to believe the officers and their experts rather than the department and its experts,it would be that the hair testing plus urinalysis alternative would have generated less of a disparate impact than that revealed by the statistical analysis of the hair drug test results.the jury could find that the hair test alone can generate false positives for some black individuals,that black individuals have no greater likelihood of receiving a false positive result from urinalysis than do white individuals and that the officers who swear that they did not use cocaine more likely than not received false positive results that urinalysis would have identified as such.given such findings,the alternative would necessarily have resulted in the termination of a lower ratio of black officers to white officers.that is,because the statistical analysis of the challenged practice shows an overall disparate impact of x,where the number of black officers with positive results was y,a reduction in y alone would necessarily have resulted in an overall disparate impact of less than 
none of this is to say that the jurors must so find.the jury could conclude,for example,that the hair test as administered by the department did not generate false positives based on race,and hence,that the alternative would not have had a lesser disparate impact.the point is that,though the evidence is conflicting,the mathematical import of either conflicting view is.a jury could therefore find that the officers proposed alternative would have had less of a disparate impact than that resulting from the challenged practice.
could a reasonable jury find that the department refuses to adopt the alternative 
title vii requires as an element of a successful disparate impact claim a finding that the employer refuses to adopt such alternative employment practice.k a ii.this language is susceptible to a number of different readings.does an employer only refuse to adopt an alternative practice if the employer knows it will meet its needs and have less of a disparate impact if this were a correct reading,then a finding for plaintiffs on the third prong of the disparate impact inquiry would effectively constitute a finding of intentional discrimination.wards cove packing atonio,observing that a refusal to adopt an alternative would belie a claim by petitioners that their incumbent practices are being employed for nondiscriminatory reasons,superseded by statute,civil rights act of,pub,stat.albemarle paper,at such a showing would be evidence that the employer was using its tests merely as a pretext for discrimination.as we have previously observed,however,proof of a disparate impact claim requires no proof of intentional discrimination.jones i,at see also ricci,at.
other possible readings of the statute remain.is it enough that the alternative was available and not used,or must its availability have been known must it be specifically proposed,like a dinner special at a restaurant,or is it enough that it was on the known menu of options and not selected what are we to make of the statute use of the present tense refuses the parties provide no express discussion of these nuances.indeed,their briefs contain no acknowledgement that there are meaningfully different possible readings of the statutory text.the only cases upon which the officers rely are the seventh circuit decisions in adams city of chicago,cir,and allen city of chicago,cir.the department,too,urges us to follow the seventh circuit,pointing specifically to allen.the formulation employed in allen and repeated in adams is that the statutory scheme requires plaintiffs to demonstrate a viable alternative and give the employer an opportunity to adopt it.adams,at quoting allen,at.adams elsewhere seems to suggest that the employer is given an opportunity to adopt the alternative if the employer had an opportunity to adopt it,see id.at,and that such an opportunity existed if the alternative was available,see id.at,and the employer was free to adopt it,see id.at.
confronted with the limited briefing on point,and the parties consensus in pointing to seventh circuit precedent,we will follow the path of allen and adams by default rather than by decision.we asked at oral argument whether there was evidence in the record that the hair testing plus urinalysis alternative was available to the department at a time relevant to this lawsuit.the officers counsel directed us only to the fact that in,they gave the department an affidavit signed by their expert,kidwell,proposing the alternative.this affidavit by kidwell is the same evidence on which plaintiffs relied in the district court.the affidavit appears to be an expert disclosure detailing kidwell opinions on hair testing as well as more enlightened approach es to drug testing,which include hair testing followed by random,frequent urinalysis.it is dated june.plaintiffs additional statement of material facts states that a s early as,kidwell suggested alternative methods of testing for drug use to the department,pointing to this affidavit as evidence of the fact.the officers make no claim that the alternative was otherwise available before kidwell proposed it.exactly when in the suggestion was made is not revealed.we infer that it was when the affidavit was served on the department counsel sometime that year.in any event,the affidavit does indeed propose that the department could use what we refer to as the hair testing plus urinalysis alternative.
accordingly,we agree with the officers that the summary judgment record reveals a material dispute of fact concerning whether,sometime in,the department,by continuing to administer the challenged hair test,necessarily refused to adopt the alternative made available to it by the suggestion of kidwell.see ricci,at.the parties appear to agree that some but not all of the officers were selected for termination or suspension after kidwell submitted his affidavit to the department in.those officers,but not the others,could succeed at trial under the third prong of the disparate impact inquiry.precisely which officers claims survive based on this timeline can be determined in the district court on remand.
iii.conclusion 
in sum,we affirm the district court ruling on summary judgment that the department use of the hair test was job related and consistent with business necessity,but we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment to the department on the third prong of the disparate impact inquiry.the record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that hair testing plus a series of random urinalysis tests for those few officers who tested positive on the hair test would have been as accurate as the hair test alone at detecting the nonpresence of cocaine metabolites while simultaneously yielding a smaller share of false positives in a manner that would have reduced the disparate impact of the hair test.we also think that,on the present record,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the department in refused to adopt this alternative.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.the district court will decide at the time of final judgment whether costs of this appeal are to be shifted in favor of a finally prevailing party under any applicable statute.
the officers do not claim that all of the positive results were inaccurate.
