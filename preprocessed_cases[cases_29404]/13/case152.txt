congress enacted the class action fairness act of cafa to lower diversity jurisdiction requirements in class actions and,as relevant here,in mass actions,civil actions in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,d b i.petitioner mississippi sued respondent liquid crystal display lcd manufacturers in state court,alleging violations of state law and seeking,inter alia,restitution for lcd purchases made by itself and its citizens.respondents sought to remove the case to federal court.the district court held that the suit qualified as a mass action under d b i,but remanded the suit to state court on the ground that it fell within cafa general public exception,d b ii iii.the fifth circuit reversed,agreeing with the district court that the suit was a mass action but finding the general public exception inapplicable.
held because mississippi is the only named plaintiff,this suit does not constitute a mass action under cafa.
a contrary to respondents argument,cafa or more persons phrase does not encompass unnamed persons who are real parties in interest to claims brought by named plaintiffs.congress knew how to draft language to that effect when it intended such a meaning,see,d b,d d.that it did not do so in the mass action provision indicates that congress did not want the provision numerosity requirement to be satisfied by counting unnamed individuals who possess an interest in the suit.
respondents understanding also can not be reconciled with the fact that the or more persons are not unspecified individuals with no participation in the suit but are the plaintiffs subsequently referred to in the provision,the very parties proposing to join their claims in a single trial.this is evident in two key ways.first,cafa uses persons and plaintiffs the same way they are used in federal rule of civil procedure,which refers to persons as individuals who are proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.second,it is difficult to imagine how the claims of or more unnamed individuals could be proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the claims of some completely different group of named plaintiffs involve common questions of law or fact.
construing plaintiffs to include both named and unnamed real parties in interest would stretch the meaning of plaintiff beyond recognition.a plaintiff is commonly understood to be a party who brings a civil suit in a court of law,not anyone,named or unnamed,whom a suit may benefit.moreover,respondents definition would also have to apply to the mass action provision subsequent reference to plaintiffs in the phrase jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims exceed,d b i.see brown gardner.this would result in an administrative nightmare that congress could not possibly have intended,see griffin oceanic contractors,where district courts would have to identify hundreds or in this case,hundreds of thousands of unnamed parties whose claims are for less than and then decide how to dispose of their claims.
b statutory context reinforces this court reading of the mass action provision.cafa provides that once removal occurs,a case shall not be transferred to another court unless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request transfer.d c i.if plaintiffs included unnamed parties,it would be surpassingly difficult for a court to poll the enormous number of real parties in interest to decide whether an action may be transferred.moreover,respondents position that the action here should be removed because it is similar to a class action fails to recognize that the mass action provision functions largely as a backstop to ensure that cafa relaxed class action jurisdictional rules can not be evaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather than using the class device.had congress wanted cafa to authorize removal of representative actions brought by states as sole plaintiffs on respondents theory,it would have done so through the class action provision,not the mass action provision.
c this court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity jurisdiction,see,wecker national enameling stamping,but congress did not intend this background inquiry to apply to the mass action provision.first,it could make sense to incorporate the background inquiry into the mass action provision if the inquiry had previously been applied in a similar manner.that is not the case here,however,and so any presumption that congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry,if it exists at all,would be comparatively weak.second,even if the background principle had previously been applied in this manner,congress expressly indicated that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass action provision both through the textual indicators described above and by prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action,d b ii ii.requiring district courts to identify unnamed persons interested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.

mississippi ex rel.jim hood,attorney general,petitioner au optronics corporation et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
under the class action fairness act of cafa or act,defendants in civil suits may remove mass actions from state to federal court.cafa defines a mass action as any civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.d b i.the question presented is whether a suit filed by a state as the sole plaintiff constitutes a mass action under cafa where it includes a claim for restitution based on injuries suffered by the state citizens.we hold that it does not.according to cafa plain text,a mass action must involve monetary claims brought by or more persons who propose to try those claims jointly as named plaintiffs.because the state of mississippi is the only named plaintiff in the instant action,the case must be remanded to state court.
congress enacted cafa in order to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions.stat.in doing so,congress recognized that c lass action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system.cafa.it was concerned,however,that certain requirements of federal diversity jurisdiction,had functioned to kee p cases of national importance in state courts rather than federal courts.cafa.
cafa accordingly loosened the requirements for diversity jurisdiction for two types of cases class actions and mass actions.the act defines class action to mean any civil action filed under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or similar state statute or rule of judicial procedure.d b.and it defines mass action to mean any civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.d b i.
for class and mass actions,cafa expanded diversity jurisdiction in two key ways.first,it replaced the ordinary requirement of complete diversity of citizenship among all plaintiffs and defendants,see state farm fire casualty tashire,with a requirement of minimal diversity.under that requirement,a federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a class action if any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d a.the same rule applies to mass actions.see d a a mass action shall be deemed removable under d through d second,whereas a ordinarily requires each plaintiff claim to exceed the sum or value of,see exxon mobil allapattah services,cafa grants federal jurisdiction over class and mass actions in which the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds million.d,d,d a.class and mass actions filed in state court that satisfy cafa requirements may be removed to federal court,but federal jurisdiction in a mass action,unlike a class action,shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims individually satisfy the amount in controversy requirement,d b i 
respondents manufacture liquid crystal displays,or lcds.in march,the state of mississippi sued them in state court,alleging that they had formed an international cartel to restrict competition and raise prices in the lcd market.the state claimed that these actions violated two mississippi statutes the mississippi antitrust act.code ann.et,and the mississippi consumer protection act,et and cum.supp.the state sought injunctive relief and civil penalties under both statutes,along with punitive damages,costs,and attorney fees.it also sought restitution for its own purchases of lcd products and the purchases of its citizens.app.to brief in opposition.
respondents filed a notice to remove the case from state to federal court,arguing that the case was removable under cafa as either a class action or a mass action.the district court ruled that the suit did not qualify as a class action because it was not brought pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure or a similar state statute or rule of judicial procedure.supp,sd.but it held that the suit did qualify as a mass action,because i t is a civil action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.at.the district court reached that conclusion on the basis of fifth circuit precedent in louisiana ex rel.caldwell allstate ins,which it understood to stan d for the proposition that the words persons and plaintiffs in the mass action definition are to be defined as real parties in interest.supp,at.applying that rule,the court found that or more unidentified mississippi consumers had purchased lcd screens and were therefore real parties in interest to the state restitution claim.ibid.the court noted the possibility that a mass action should be thought of as a mass joinder,that is,as a suit involving or more named plaintiffs.but it deemed that interpretation to be foreclosed by caldwell.
the district court nonetheless remanded the case to state court on the basis of cafa general public exception,which excludes from the mass action definition any civil action in which all of the claims in the action are asserted on behalf of the general public and not on behalf of individual claimants or members of a purported class pursuant to a state statute specifically authorizing such action.d b ii iii.
the court of appeals reversed.it agreed with the district court determination that mississippi suit is not a class action under cafa,at.it also agreed that,under caldwell,the suit qualifies as a mass action because t he real parties in interest in mississippi suit are those more than individual citizens who purchased the lcd products within mississippi.at.it disagreed,however,with the district court ruling that the suit falls within the general public exception,at judge elrod concurred in the judgment,noting that after the fifth circuit decision in caldwell,three courts of appeals had deemed similar lawsuits not to be mass actions removable under cafa we granted certiorari to resolve this split of authority,and now reverse.
our analysis begins with the statutory text.sebelius cloer,slip,at.the statute provides 
t he term mass action means any civil action except a class action in which monetary relief claims of or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under subsection a.d b i.
the parties do not dispute that this provision encompasses suits that are brought jointly by or more named plaintiffs who propose to try their claims together.the question is whether the provision also includes suits brought by fewer than named plaintiffs on the theory that there may be or more unnamed persons who are real parties in interest as beneficiaries to any of the plaintiffs claims.respondents argue that the provision covers such suits because claims of or more persons refers to the persons to whom the claim belongs,the real parties in interest to the claims,regardless of whether those persons are named or unnamed.brief for respondents emphasis in original.we disagree.
to start,the statute says or more persons,not or more named or unnamed real parties in interest.had congress intended the latter,it easily could have drafted language to that effect.indeed,when congress wanted a numerosity requirement in cafa to be satisfied by counting unnamed parties in interest in addition to named plaintiffs,it explicitly said so cafa provides that in order for a class action to be removable,the number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes must be or greater,d b,and it defines class members to mean the persons named or unnamed who fall within the definition of the proposed or certified class,d d.congress chose not to use the phrase named or unnamed in cafa mass action provision,a decision we understand to be intentional.see dean united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion 
more fundamentally,respondents interpretation can not be reconciled with the fact that the or more persons referred to in the statute are not unspecified individuals who have no actual participation in the suit,but instead the very plaintiffs referred to later in the sentence the parties who are proposing to join their claims in a single trial.congress made this understanding evident in two key ways.
first,we presume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.hall united states,slip,at.here,congress used the terms persons and plaintiffs just as they are used in federal rule of civil procedure,governing party joinder.where d b i requires that the claims of or more persons must be proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact,rule provides that p ersons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly and any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.thus,just as it is used in rule,the term persons in d b i refers to the individuals who are proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.
second,respondents interpretation of persons can not square with the statute requirement that the claims of the or more persons must be proposed for joint trial on the ground that the plaintiffs claims involve common questions of law or fact.d b i.it is difficult to imagine how the claims of one set of unnamed individuals could be proposed for joint trial on the ground that the claims of some completely different group of named plaintiffs share common questions.the better understanding is that congress meant for the or more persons and the proposed plaintiffs to be one and the same.
recognizing that the statute use of the term persons could be a reference to proposed plaintiffs,respondents assert that plaintiffs,like persons,should be construed to includ e both named and unnamed real parties in interest.brief for respondents.but that stretches the meaning of plaintiff beyond recognition.the term plaintiff is among the most commonly understood of legal terms of art it means a party who brings a civil suit in a court of law.black law dictionary ed.see also webster third new inte
