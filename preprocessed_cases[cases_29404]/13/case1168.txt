two people who use wheelchairs and the organizations that represent persons with disabilities bring this class action against the new york city taxi and limousine commission tlc and the tlc commissioner david yassky for violation of parts a and b of title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada,the rehabilitation act of,and the new york city human rights law.the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,granted plaintiffs partial summary judgment as to liability on the claim that defendants are violating part a of title ii of the ada title ii a by failing to provide meaningful access to taxi services for persons with disabilities.the district court also entered a temporary injunction that requires that all new taxi medallions and livery licenses be limited to vehicles that are wheelchair accessible accessible taxis,until the tlc proposes and the district court approves a comprehensive plan to provide meaningful access to taxi service for passengers.
defendants appeal the injunction and the grant of partial summary judgment upon which the injunction is premised.appellate jurisdiction exists to review the injunction and the underlying merits that relate to it.we conclude that,though the tlc exercises pervasive control over the taxi industry in new york city,defendants were not required by title ii a to deploy their licensing and regulatory authority to mandate that persons who need wheelchairs be afforded meaningful access to taxis.the district court therefore erred in entering the temporary injunction.
accordingly,we vacate the temporary injunction and remand for the district court to enter summary judgment for defendants on the title ii a claim and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
background 
the facts are not in dispute.plaintiffs are persons with disabilities who seek fuller access to new york city taxis and organizations who represent them.they contend that the taxi services in new york city fail to give meaningful access to persons with disabilities and that the tlc thus discriminates in violation of the ada,the rehabilitation act,and the new york city human rights law.
there are two types of licensed taxis in new york city the traditional yellow cabs and the livery cabs.the yellow cabs are medallion taxis because the license is accompanied by a metal medallion that is affixed to the outside of the taxi.admin.code h.a yellow taxi is a passenger vehicle for hire licensed to accept hails from passengers in the street.id.l.a livery cab is a passenger vehicle for hire that is dispatched from a livery base station on a basis.see rules regs.j,k see generally admin.code g defining vehicle.livery cabs have not been authorized to accept street hails 
under the city charter,all taxis are licensed and regulated by the tlc,an administrative agency of the city of new york under the deputy mayor for operations.see charter.as a condition of licensure,taxi owners and drivers must comply with the tlc applicable laws and regulations.id,admin.code.under the city charter,the tlc adopt s and establish es an overall public transportation policy governing taxi,coach,limousine,wheelchair accessible van services and commuter van services as it relates to the overall public transportation network of the city.charter.this includes set ting standards and criteria for the licensing of vehicles,drivers and chauffeurs establishing standards of service,insurance and minimum coverage,driver safety,equipment safety and design,noise and air pollution control and adjudicating charges of violations of the provisions of the administrative code and rules promulgated thereunder.id.
the number of medallions is limited by law to.at least are designated for vehicles,though any medallion owner may operate such a taxi regardless of whether the medallion has that designation.currently,taxis are so accessible of medallion taxis are therefore inaccessible to persons in wheelchairs not surprisingly,the wait time for accessible taxis is prolonged.the record shows that the chances of hailing any taxi in manhattan within ten minutes is,whereas the chances of hailing an accessible taxi within ten minutes is.
after some discovery,plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment only on the ada claims and only as to liability.defendants on all claims.each side motion for summary judgment was granted in part and in part denied.
as to part b of title ii of the ada title ii b,which governs public transportation,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.the district court reasoned that although the tlc has extensive regulatory powers,the agency itself has no authority to provide public transportation services,and does not function as a transportation services provider,to the public.noel new york city taxi limousine comm n,d.because the tlc does not operate a public transportation service,the district court held that the tlc is not obligated under title ii b to ensure meaningful access to taxis for persons with disabilities.id.at.
however,as to title ii a,which governs public services generally,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.the district court reasoned that the tlc is a public entity carrying out a public regulatory function that affects and confers a benefit on new york city taxicab riders,and therefore may not discriminate in any of its functions including its regulatory activities and must ensure persons with disabilities have meaningful access to taxis in new york city.id.at.the district court determined that plaintiffs enjoyed no meaningful access to taxis,and were therefore entitled to summary judgment,id.at.
the district court then entered a temporary injunction that had immediate impact in view of recent changes in new york state law,which had authorized the issuance of additional medallions and authorized,for the first time,livery cabs to pick up street hails in areas of the city.see supra note.the injunction is as follows 
t he tlc must propose a comprehensive plan to provide meaningful access to taxicab service for disabled wheelchair bound passengers.such a plan must include targeted goals and standards,as well as anticipated measurable results.until such a plan is proposed and approved by th e district court,all new taxi medallions sold or new livery licenses or permits issued by the tlc must be for wheelchair accessible vehicles.
on appeal,defendants challenge the temporary injunction and the grant of summary judgment,to the extent it bears on the injunction.while the appeal was pending,we granted defendants motion to stay enforcement of the injunction.we now consider the merits of defendants appeal and vacate the temporary injunction 
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal because the district court entered an order granting an injunction.see a.by the same token,we have jurisdiction to consider the underlying merits of the case,to the extent they relate to the propriety of granting injunctive relief.united states allen,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted holding that this court had jurisdiction to consider not only the injunction but also the merits of the district court determination that the appellee was entitled to summary judgment.accordingly,we review the entry of the temporary injunction as well as the grant of partial summary judgment on which it is based.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.kapps wing,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on an error of law or clearly erroneous finding of fact.abrahams mta long island bus,cir.
we review the grant of summary judgment,which was the basis for the temporary injunction,de novo.miller wolpoff abramson,cir.
one goal of the ada is to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.henrietta bloomberg,cir quoting b.to do so,the ada first three titles proscribe discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment and hiring title i,access to public services title ii,and public accommodations title iii.id.title ii is,in turn,divided into parts a and b part a governs public services generally,and part b governs the provision of public transportation services.abrahams,at.this appeal involves only title ii a.
title ii a provides subject to the provisions of this subchapter,no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.to prevail under title ii a,plaintiffs must demonstrate that they are qualified individuals with a disability that the defendants are subject to the ada and that plaintiffs were denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from defendants services,programs,or activities,or were otherwise discriminated against by defendants,by reason of plaintiffs disabilities.henrietta,at.defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs are qualified individuals or that the tlc is a public entity that is generally subject to title ii a.the only question on appeal then is whether the tlc denied plaintiffs an opportunity to participate in its services,programs,or activities,or otherwise discriminated against them on account of a disability.
as a remedial statute,the ada must be broadly construed to effectuate its purpose of providing a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.innovative health,city of white plains,internal quotation marks omitted,aff in part,cir,recognized as superseded on other grounds,zervos verizon,cir.accordingly,the phrase services,programs,or activities has been interpreted to be a phrase that prohibits all discrimination by a public entity.innovative health,at.
although the ada is to be interpreted broadly,the scope of title ii is not limitless.see reeves queen city,d.in enacting title ii,congress directed the attorney general to promulgate regulations to implement title ii a,see a,and the attorney general regulations add scope and shape to the general prohibitions in the ada,which are not.as the house judiciary committee report conceded,it is the purpose of this section to direct the attorney general to issue regulations setting forth the forms of discrimination prohibited.iii at,reprinted in.
the most relevant regulation here is b,which governs the conduct of a public entity administering a licensing program.the tlc,of course,administers a licensing program the licensing of taxis.section b prohibits a public entity from administer ing a license or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability or establish ing requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability.
notwithstanding the broad construction of the ada,section b does not support plaintiffs claim against the tlc.section b prohibits the tlc from refusing to grant licenses to persons with disabilities who are otherwise qualified to own or operate a taxi,qualified medallion purchasers and drivers it does not assist persons who are consumers of the licensees product.this reading of section b is consistent with the technical assistance manual of the department of justice tam,which is persuasive authority as to the ada meaning,unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the ada regulations.see innovative health,at.the section involving licensing makes clear that the persons who are protected are those who are seeking licenses 
a public entity may not discriminate on the basis of disability in its licensing,certification,and regulatory activities.a person is a qualified individual with a disability with respect to licensing or certification,if he or she can meet the essential eligibility requirements for receiving the license or certification public entities may not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities who apply for licenses,but may consider factors related to the disability in determining whether the individual is qualified.
ada tam ii,available at last visited june.the example given in the tam reinforces that limitation 
illustration a state prohibits the licensing of transportation companies that employ individuals with missing limbs as drivers.xyz company refuses to hire an individual with a missing limb who is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job,because he is able to drive safely with hand controls.
id.the tam concludes that such a licensing requirement would violate title ii a,but critically that t he state is not accountable for discrimination in the employment or other practices of xyz company,if those practices are not the result of requirements or policies established by the state.id.
that guidance goes far to deciding this appeal.the gravamen of plaintiffs claim is that there are too few accessible taxis in new york city and that the tlc should use its regulatory authority to require that more taxis be accessible.but no such claim is cognizable under title ii a against the tlc because nothing in the tlc administration of the licensing program discriminates against persons with disabilities.although only medallions are conditioned on wheelchair accessibility,none of the medallions issued by the tlc prohibits any medallion owner from operating an accessible taxi.
plaintiffs contend that the tlc violates title ii a because the industry it licenses fails to provide meaningful access to taxis for persons with disabilities.
as an initial matter,title ii a makes clear that t he programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by a public entity are not,themselves,covered by title ii a.b as the tam advises a lthough licensing standards are covered by title ii,the licensee activities themselves are not covered.an activity does not become a program or activity of a public entity merely because it is licensed by the public entity.ada tam ii emphasis added.at the risk of being obvious,t he new york city taxicab industry is a private industry.freidman motors,d.accordingly,even if private industry such as the new york city taxi industry fails to provide meaningful access for persons with disabilities,a licensing entity such as the tlc is not therefore in violation of title ii a,unless the private industry practice results from the licensing requirements.see ada tam ii.
this conclusion was adopted by the two district courts that have considered the issue.it was claimed in tyler city of manhattan,that manhattan kansas violated title ii a by granting liquor licenses to businesses that were inaccessible to persons with disabilities.the district court concluded that the regulations implementing title ii of the ada do not cover the programs and activities of private entities that are licensed or certified by a public entity.id.at citing b accord id.explaining that a lthough city programs operated under contractual or licensing arrangements may not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities,the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities are not themselves programs or activities of the public entity merely by virtue of the license or certificate.internal citation,quotation marks,and alteration omitted.tyler ruled that the licensing of private establishments did not deny access to services,aids,and programs provided by the city under licensing or contractual arrangements.id.at.
the plaintiff in tyler also argued that the city physical inspection of licensed facilities provided a benefit to people only,because only people could enter those establishments.id.the district court explained that it was not the government inspections that denied access to the facilities or the benefits of being there it was the facilities themselves,which were operated privately.id.such a claim is not actionable under title ii a,tyler reasoned,because title ii and its implementing regulations prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals only by public entities and do not go so far as to require public ent
