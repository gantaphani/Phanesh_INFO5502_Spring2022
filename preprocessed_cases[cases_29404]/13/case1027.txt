with respect to the damages award,stanczyk fails to establish that the challenged conduct caused prejudice.as to the june,order,the district court properly applied rule and did not abuse its discretion by reducing the reasonable hourly rate of stanczyk lead counsel.we accordingly affirm the judgment and order.
background 
stanczyk originally filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on january.the operative complaint alleged multiple violations of her civil rights under and several pendent state law violations arising from a november incident involving stanczyk and the officers.stanczyk section claims alleging false arrest and excessive force were the only claims submitted to the jury.stanczyk city of,cv fb rer,wl,at june.
on december,defense counsel served stanczyk with defendants rule offer of judgment the offer,which stated in pertinent part 
pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,defendant city of new york hereby offers to allow plaintiff anna stancyzk sic to take a judgment against it in this action for the total sum of one hundred fifty thousand and one dollars,plus reasonable attorneys fees,expenses and costs to the date of this offer for plaintiff federal claims.
this judgment shall be in full satisfaction of all federal and state law claims or rights that plaintiff may have to damages,or any other form of relief,arising out of the alleged acts or omissions of defendants city of new york,richard demartino,shaun grossweil er,or any official,employee,or agent,either past or present,of the city of new york,or any agency thereof,in connection with the facts and circumstances that are the subject of this action 
this offer of judgment is made for the purposes specified in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and is not to be construed as an admission of liability by any defendants,or any official,employee or agent of the city of new york,or any agency thereof nor is it an admission that plaintiff has suffered any damages.
acceptance of this offer of judgment will act to release and discharge defendants the city of new york,richard demartino and shaun grossweil er their successors or assigns and all past and present officials,employees,representatives and agents of the city of new york,or any agency thereof,from any and all claims that were or could have been alleged by plaintiff in the action.
stanczyk rejected the offer and proceeded to trial.
the facts of the underlying altercation were vigorously disputed at trial.what emerged from the testimony were conflicting accounts of a typical urban dispute.stanczyk claimed that she took her dog out to do its business,and her dog complied by urinating.the officers then approached stanczyk and accused her of not cleaning up a pile of feces that they claimed had just been deposited by her dog.stanczyk protested her innocence,but the officers ordered her to clean up the deposit.she did so and then was arrested either for screaming at the officers and banging on their patrol car or solely because she did not have identification or a license for her dog on her person.a struggle ensued,and stanczyk suffered bruising and other injuries either because the officers struck her in the head and breasts and slammed the patrol car rear door on one of her legs or because she fell to the ground while screaming and resisting the officers efforts to handcuff her 
in addition to hearing testimony from stanczyk and the officers,the jury also heard from,among others,medical experts and physicians who had treated stanczyk following the incident.collectively,they testified that stanczyk had required treatment,which had included an mri,surgery,physical therapy,and psychological therapy,and that she would require additional medical treatment moving forward.one physician testified that she had met with stanczyk times over a period for injuries relating to post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and depression,and planned to continue similar treatment.another testified that she continued to provide stanczyk biweekly therapy sessions in order to treat ptsd and depression that resulted from the incident.
in contrast to the significant evidence concerning physical and emotional harm and past and future medical needs,stanczyk submitted no evidence regarding the actual cost of her treatment past or future beyond her own recollection that she had paid for one visit to a doctor she had seen one time.she did not place a single medical bill into evidence nor did she elicit testimony from any of her witnesses regarding the cost of treatment.the district court,aware of the problem that this lack of evidence could cause,alerted stanczyk counsel that there was not any evidence regarding cost of treatment there not a shred of evidence in here,other than she will have some continuing cost.but it speculative as to what that cost will be.trial tr,at.counsel took no heed of that warning.
the jury returned a verdict for stanczyk on the excessive force claim but found for the officers on the false arrest claim.in conjunction with this finding,the jury awarded stanczyk in compensatory damages and in punitive damages against demartino and grossweiler.the district court entered judgment on april.
following entry of judgment,stanczyk filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,and defendants submitted a bill of costs.in a june,order,the district court a granted stanczyk motion with respect to costs and attorney fees incurred prior to defendants rule offer although with a downward adjustment as to her lead counsel reasonable rate and b awarded to defendants costs,excluding attorney fees,incurred following the rule offer.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the damages award 
on appeal,stanczyk primarily challenges the jury damages award as inadequate and as the product of errors by the district court and improprieties by defense counsel.
stanczyk faults the district court for failing to give a separate charge on future damages.stanczyk additionally argues that defense counsel prejudiced the damages award by,inter alia,presenting a highly improper and prejudicial summation and repeatedly and brazenly inject ing race into the case by attempting to portray stanczyk as a racist who had problems with dark people.stanczyk br,
in resolving stanczyk request for a new trial on damages,counsel for both stanczyk and defendants have forsaken opportunities both here and at the district court to deal with the matter more efficiently.stanczyk failed to move pursuant to rule for a new trial on damages before the district court.when a party has not attacked the adequacy of a verdict in a motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial,we have usually refused to review this issue on appeal.zinman black decker,cir accord calcagni hudson waterways,cir per curiam vaught childs,cir.we may depart from this prudential rule where a verdict offends fundamental conceptions of allowable damages,or presents so plain an error that it should be entertained in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice.zinman,at internal brackets,quotation marks,and citations omitted.no such grounds exist here.
immediately after the jury rendered its verdict,stanczyk counsel noted his intent to move to set aside the damages award on the basis that the damages were insufficient as a result of much of the conduct stanczyk challenges on appeal.the district court set a briefing schedule and granted stanczyk request of four weeks to submit a brief.five days later,however,stanczyk counsel changed his position and asked the district court to enter judgment so he could proceed directly to this court.this decision inevitably precluded the district court from considering the damages challenge in the light of all of the facts then recently before it.vaught,at.not to be outdone by stanczyk attorney apparent haste and perhaps folly,defense counsel has not raised the waiver issue here on appeal.we are thus left to address issues that might have been resolved below yet were not,and could have been precluded here but instead remain.
turning to the merits,the district court did not err in refusing to give a separate charge as to future damages the district court charge,although it did not separate out future damages,properly instructed the jury that it could consider future suffering in its damages calculation.specifically,the pertinent portion of the jury instruction provided 
a plaintiff is entitled to compensatory damages for her actual physical injuries,including pain and suffering caused by the injuries,emotional distress that she has suffered because of the defendant conduct the damages that you award must be fair and reasonable,neither inadequate nor excessive.you should not award compensatory damages for speculative injuries,but only for those injuries that plaintiff has actually suffered or which she is reasonably likely to suffer in the future 
in determining the amount,if any,of plaintiff damages,you may take into consideration the effect that her injuries have had on her ability to enjoy life.emphasis added.
to the extent stanczyk sought a charge on future medical costs,as distinct from future pain and suffering,the district court correctly concluded that an award for medical costs would have been speculative and unsupported by the record.beyond a passing reference to one fee,stanczyk counsel failed to submit any evidence concerning past or future medical costs.contrary to stanczyk contention,her trial testimony that she recalled paying her first psychiatrist for one session apparently the only session she had because she could not afford the fee does not render the district court jury instruction improper 
stanczyk also argues that she is entitled to a new trial on damages because of defense counsel allegedly improper summation and general misconduct throughout trial.we agree that many of defense counsel comments,particularly those invoking race,seem random and unconnected to the case.nonetheless,because of the district court constant admonitions and curative instructions,stanczyk counsel failure to provide the jury with any evidence or guidance concerning a proper compensatory damages award,and the absence of a connection between any potentially improper conduct and the jury award of punitive damages,we conclude that this conduct,even to the extent improper,was harmless.
defense counsel racially inflected comments warrant a moment of our attention.these comments appear to have first arisen during the of marcia knight.in the form of a hypothetical,defense counsel asked knight whether,before making a diagnosis,she would like to know that the individual had assaulted a coworker,was told to go to anger management,refused to go to anger management,was terminated,and then blamed,quote,to use their words,dark people,for being terminated.trial tr,at emphasis added.moments later,after knight stated that the hypothetical would not necessarily have changed her report but that she would have inquired further,defense counsel asked,you would have tried to determine what the individual meant when they said dark people were behind their termination id.at emphasis added.somewhat later,defense counsel posed a nearly identical question.immediately following each of the foregoing questions,the district court explicitly instructed the jury that the statements comprised a hypothetical and were not evidence in the record.the district court also asked knight questions that clarified that the hypotheticals did not alter her report and diagnosis.id.at.
on several more occasions,which followed the district court clear admonishment,defense counsel pressed witnesses with questions about stanczyk difficulty with dark people.as before,the district court immediately sustained stanczyk counsel objections and instructed the jury that,for instance,this case has nothing to do with race.it has nothing to do with race.i do want any of you folks to enter into any thought whatsoever that this case has anything to do with race.do go there.do go there when i looked,the police officers were white.stanczyk is white.do go there.trial tr,at.the district court constant admonitions and curative instructions correctly reminded the jury that race was not an issue in the case and that defense counsel was out of line.those continuous and unequivocal admonitions and curative instructions,along with the irrelevance of race to the underlying altercation or claims,distinguish this case from others that warranted a new trial.see,mcfarland smith,cir moore morton,cir.
moreover,although stanczyk counsel elicited substantial testimony and submitted numerous exhibits concerning stanczyk physical and emotional pain and suffering,he failed to submit a single medical bill or elicit any testimony from stanczyk experts and treating physicians regarding the cost of her medical treatment.further compounding this error,stanczyk counsel never provided the jury with a reference point from which to gauge stanczyk damages.for instance,he elected not to suggest,nor even move for the opportunity to suggest,a specific damages figure to the jury.see lightfoot union carbide,cir.rather,as a review of his summation makes clear,stanczyk counsel relegated to the jury full discretion to award what it deemed proper.
as this court has stated,albeit in a somewhat different context,a plaintiff is not permitted to throw herself on the generosity of the jury.if s he wants damages,s he must prove them.bracey bd.of educ.of city of bridgeport,cir internal quotation marks omitted.stanczyk counsel effectively abdicated this duty in light of the unique facts of this case,his failure to provide evidence as to cost or to provide the jury with a monetary reference point precludes a finding that the challenged conduct,even if improper,erroneous,or an abuse of discretion,caused prejudice to the jury award of compensatory damages.
stanczyk has also failed to demonstrate that any potentially improper conduct by defense counsel prejudiced the jury award of punitive damages.the jury was carefully instructed that it was to consider the officers conduct in determining punitive damages.since the challenged conduct relates to characterizations and representations of stanczyk and not to whether the officers acted maliciously or wantonly,stanczyk fails to prove that any of the challenged conduct prejudiced the award of punitive damages.
for all of the foregoing reasons,stanczyk is not entitled to a new trial on damages.

federal rule of civil procedure provides in relevant part 
a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms,with the costs then accrued if the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.
