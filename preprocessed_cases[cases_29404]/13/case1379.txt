cross sound ferry services,cross sound appeals from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york feuerstein,in favor of defendant town of east hampton east hampton or the town.cross sound and plaintiffs town of southold and town of shelter island collectively,town plaintiffs brought this action seeking a declaration that local law of of the town of east hampton the ferry law,which requires ferry operators to obtain a special permit before using a ferry terminal within the town and restricts the types of ferries that may use local terminals,is unconstitutional.plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the ferry law violates the dormant commerce clause and equal protection clause of the united states constitution,as well as the equal protection clause of the new york state constitution.plaintiffs also claimed that the law constitutes an improper and abusive exercise of the town police power under the laws and constitution of new york and sought to enjoin its enforcement.
following joinder of issue,the town moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.plaintiffs for summary judgment on each cause of action in the complaint except for their police power claim.plaintiffs further moved to strike the town rule statement,contending that it was based on inadmissible evidence.the district court granted the town motion and denied plaintiffs cross motion and their motion to strike the rule statement.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it determined that the ferry law did not violate the dormant commerce clause and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the judgment in all other respects.
background 
cross sound is a corporation that provides interstate ferry service transporting passengers,vehicles,and freight between terminals and docking facilities located in new london,connecticut and orient point in suffolk county,long island.cross sound operates seven vehicular ferries that can accommodate vehicles such as buses,trucks,and motor homes together with passengers,as well as one ferry that carries only passengers and is capable of traveling at greater speeds than vehicular ferries.cross sound desires to expand the geographical scope of its operations by instituting ferry service from its existing facilities in new london to those located in the town of east hampton.however,the town of east hampton currently limits access to its local terminals pursuant to the ferry law,a local zoning ordinance prohibiting ferry operators from landing any vehicular or ferry within the town,except in cases of emergency.inasmuch as the ferry law would preclude cross sound from providing any ferry service in the town except for,service,cross sound challenge to the law is before us in this appeal.
geographical backdrop 
long island is an island in the atlantic ocean that comprises the southeastern most part of new york state.the island juts out eastward from the harbor of new york city for miles and lies parallel to the southern shore of connecticut,from which it is separated to the north by long island sound.suffolk county occupies the easternmost portion of long island and is bordered to the west by nassau county.at its eastern end in the town of riverhead,suffolk county splits latitudinally into two peninsulas known as the north and south forks,which are separated by shelter island sound.the town of shelter island is an island located in between the forks.the north fork contains,inter alia,the town of southold,which encompasses orient point and the village of greenport.the south fork contains,inter alia,the town of east hampton.east hampton,in turn,consists of the village of east hampton,a part of the village of sag harbor,and a number of unincorporated hamlets,including montauk in the easternmost region.the main artery,route or montauk highway,provides one traffic lane in each direction throughout most of the town of east hampton.
ii.ferry service on long island 
cross sound provides vehicular and passenger ferry service between new london and orient point on the north fork.passengers on cross sound service who wish to proceed further south from orient point to east hampton may take a car,bus,or train miles west to greenport,board a vehicular ferry to shelter island minutes,drive to the southern end of shelter island miles,and take another vehicular ferry to sag harbor minutes,which straddles the border between the western end of east hampton and the eastern end of the town of southampton.travel between connecticut and east hampton also can be effected by taking a vehicular ferry from bridgeport,connecticut to port jefferson on the northern shore of long island minutes and then driving to east hampton miles.in addition,passengers can use the seasonal ferry service between new london and montauk during may through september.
iii.the transportation element and the ferry law 
the town of east hampton has been a premier summer resort for many years.the town summertime population has experienced substantial growth since and increases each year to four or five times the population due to tourism and the presence of seasonal homes.because travel through east hampton occurs mainly by way of the montauk highway,traffic volumes on the highway during summers are currently at or near capacity.moreover,traffic on other town roads during the summer months is rising rapidly at an average rate of per year.
in light of these burgeoning traffic problems,the town board of east hampton town board or the board became increasingly concerned with the resulting serious threat to public health and safety and to the economic vitality and general livability of the town.in particular,the board recognized that increased road congestion would be exacerbated by proposed changes to ferry service on the eastern end of long island occasioned by the presence of large casinos near new london,connecticut and the technological developments in the speed and carrying capacities of ferries.
in,the board imposed a moratorium on the establishment of new ferry service until a comprehensive transportation plan could be completed and thereafter commissioned the first transportation study since.following two public hearings,the board adopted the study as the transportation element of its comprehensive plan.the board found that the study confirmed what town residents already knew summertime road traffic in east hampton has become so heavy as to undermine the town rural atmosphere,create very inconvenient and even dangerous driving conditions on the town roads,and generally diminish the quality of life heretofore enjoyed by residents and visitors alike.specifically,the transportation element revealed that c ongestion occurs along route as through traffic competes for available highway capacity with traffic destined for business areas.particularly in the village of east hampton,traffic is slowed when vehicles enter and exit parking spaces,sometimes blocking through traffic for a significant period of time.recognizing that there is minimal potential for the existing highway system to accommodate existing traffic,let alone future traffic generated by natural growth and new private developments,the transportation element concluded that a new ferry has the potential to cause a significant degradation in levels of service at roadway intersections providing access to a new terminal site.in many cases,these levels are already poor.as a result,it is recommended that this ferry service not be instituted.
in addition,the transportation element evaluated the potential environmental impact of increased traffic in the town and recommended against the institution of the ferry service on that basis 
a ny potential traffic increases on the roadway network providing access to a new ferry terminal will directly impact the environment.this impact will include generation of additional vehicle pollutants and noise.this generation of additional air pollutants is of particular concern,due to the classification of the region as a severe area for ozone,and a moderate area for carbon monoxide,as a result of the federal clean air act amendments of 
the extent of pollutants generated is directly related to average speeds of vehicles on any particular roadway.any traffic increases on a roadway will lower the average speeds,usually resulting in an increase in vehicle emissions.
more vehicular noise is generated by acceleration and deceleration than by travel at constant speeds.
the board also considered studies showing that ferries create larger waves that pose safety concerns for boaters and swimmers and have high fuel consumption and air emissions.finally,the board recognized that the need for a special use permit even for conventional passenger ferries had become acute in light of findings that the site must have adequate parking and public restrooms available.
in,following a series of public hearings during which cross sound submitted comments opposing the moratorium and the board proposed action to limit ferry access to its terminals,east hampton adopted local law,termed the ferry law,to address the potential traffic problems posed by vehicle ferries operating between the town and the connecticut shore or,passenger ferries transporting passengers to the large connecticut casinos.the ferry law,which became effective december,provides,in relevant part 
special permit required.no person shall construct,commence to use,or substantially expand a passenger ferry terminal,nor commence any passenger ferry service,without having first obtained a special permit pursuant to article v hereof which specifically authorizes the proposed use and approves the onshore terminal facility to be employed.
vessel limitations.no ferry which has more than two thousand installed horsepower and the capability of travel ing at a speed in excess of twenty knots,nor any vehicle ferry of any description,shall dock at or otherwise make use of any passenger ferry terminal,or be allowed to dock at or make use of such facility,except in case of emergency.
these restrictions apply regardless of the origin,destination,or ownership of the ferries utilizing the town terminals.
the ferry law distinguishes between ferries and excursion boats.the law defines ferry to mean a vessel used in the business of carrying passengers between any port or place in the town of east hampton and any other port or place without the town.compare excursion boat.in contrast to a ferry,which picks up passengers at one point and drops them off at another,an excursion boat is defined as a vessel used on a commercial basis to take passengers to sea from any port or place within the town of east hampton,and which returns those passengers to the point of origin without an intervening stop at any port or other land not located in the town.excursion boats include boats used on a commercial basis for trips trips or tours,a dinner cruise vessel,or a vessel employed on gambling trips outside the territorial waters of the state of new york.compare ferry.
iv.proceedings in the district court 
on september,cross sound and the town plaintiffs commenced the instant action,alleging that the ferry law violates the dormant commerce clause and the equal protection clause of the federal constitution,as well as the equal protection clause of the new york state constitution,and that it constitutes an improper and abusive exercise of the town police power under the laws and constitution of new york.
east hampton answered and moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations,that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring suit,and that the substantive claims lacked merit.plaintiffs responded and for summary judgment on each cause of action set forth in the complaint except for their police power claim.plaintiffs at no time sought discovery under federal rule of civil procedure f,but they moved to strike the town rule statement of undisputed material facts and challenged the admissibility of several documents submitted in support of the town motion.
by order dated december,the district court granted the town motion and denied plaintiffs cross motion and motion to strike the rule statement.town of southold town of hampton,d.the district court first declined to strike east hampton rule statement and ruled that plaintiffs motion was moot in light of the court discretion to review the record independently.id.at.the court then held that the town plaintiffs lacked standing to assert their claims but determined that cross sound had standing to raise the claims on behalf of its passengers.id.at.in addition,the court held that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.
turning to the merits of the complaint,the district court first addressed cross sound dormant commerce clause claims.the court rejected cross sound contentions that the ferry law clearly discriminated against interstate commerce and that it was therefore invalid per se,finding instead that the law applied equally to all and ferry operators and that cross sound failed to identify any local interest favored by it.id.at.the court then examined the ferry law under the balancing test set forth in pike bruce church,d,and concluded that any burden imposed on interstate commerce was not clearly excessive in relation to the local benefits secured,which included better health and safety for town residents.town of hampton,d at.the court held that cross sound failed to even allege a different burden on interstate commerce than on intrastate commerce and that,in any event,cross sound offered no evidence in support of such allegation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in its analysis,the district court noted that cross sound commerce clause claims were devoted largely to the application of the per se invalidity test and that the pike analysis was raised in a conclusory fashion only.id.
the court next evaluated the ferry law under the equal protection clauses of the federal and new york constitutions and rejected cross sound claims that the law infringed upon the fundamental right to travel and was therefore subject to strict scrutiny review.id.at.concluding that the law did not implicate the right to travel,the district court applied rational basis review and determined that the law imposed only minor restrictions upon travel that were rationally related to the town interest in protecting its residents.id.at.moreover,the court determined that the ferry law was not an improper and abusive exercise of east hampton police power because it was designed to accomplish legitimate public purposes and was authorized under state laws that empowered towns to enact laws restricting the operation of vessels in their territories.id.at.
the town plaintiffs did not appeal from the ensuing judgment.cross sound timely appeal is now properly before us see.

ii.of the dormant commerce clause claims 
the commerce clause provides that congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.this express grant of power to congress contains a further,negative command,known as the dormant commerce clause.tax comm jefferson lines,d,which limits the power of local governments to enact laws affecting interstate commerce.hughes oklahoma,d.the fundamental objective of the dormant commerce clause is to preserv e a national market for competition undisturbed by preferential advantages conferred by a state upon its residents or resident competitors.brown williamson tobacco pataki,cir quoting motors tracy,d.in analyzing a challenged local law under the dormant commerce clause,we first determine whether it clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce,or whether it regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce.see freedom holdings,spitzer,cir.the term discrimination in this context means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality,d.
we then apply the appropriate level of scrutiny.a law that clearly discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce is virtually invalid per se and will survive only if it is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.wyoming oklahoma,d.a law that only incidentally burdens interstate commerce is subject to the more permissive balancing test under pike bruce church,d,and will be struck down if the burden imposed on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the putative local gains.the party challenging a law as either clearly discriminatory or violative of pike bears the threshold burden of demonstrating that it has a disparate impact on interstate commerce t he fact that it may otherwise affect commerce is not sufficient.automated salvage,wheelabrator envtl,cir.
if discrimination is established,the burden shifts to the government to show that the local benefits of the law outweigh its discriminatory effects and that the government lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative by which it could protect the local interests.usa recycling,town of babylon,cert.denied,d.if the challenging party can not show discrimination,however,it must demonstrate that the law places a burden on interstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.id.at quoting minnesota clover leaf creamery,d.
clear discrimination against interstate commerce 
a clearly discriminatory law may operate in three ways by discriminating against interstate commerce on its face,see,granholm heald,d striking down state laws restricting wineries,but not ones,from selling wine directly to consumers in the state camps,town of harrison,d striking down statute that denied beneficial tax treatment to entities that were conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of maine city of philadelphia new jersey,d striking down statute prohibiting the importation of most waste which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the state by harboring a discriminatory purpose,see,hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d striking down facially neutral statute prohibiting state grading from appearing on apple boxes and noting evidence that it was intended to discriminate against washington apples carrying state grades bacchus imports,dias,d striking down facially neutral statute exempting certain alcoholic beverages from the excise tax because legislative history showed it was intended to foster local industry or by discriminating in its effect,see,lynn creamery,healy,d striking down facially neutral law imposing assessment on all milk sold to massachusetts retailers because its effect on producers was entirely offset by the subsidy provided exclusively to dairy farmers.in our view,the ferry law does not offend any of these categories.
initially,the ferry law does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce because it is indifferent to the point of origin,destination,and ownership of the restricted types of ferries and applies equally to both and ferry operators.nor is there evidence showing that the ferry law was enacted for the purpose of discriminating against interests.the record more than supports the district court conclusion that the law was not motivated by a discriminatory animus but by the need to address a growing traffic problem in the town.town of hampton,d at.as set forth in the law findings and objectives section,t he revisions contained in this local law are intended to improve and strengthen the town zoning regulations as they pertain to ferries,and to thereby reduce the potential traffic and other impacts of such uses.the minutes of the town board meetings and correspondence among town officials confirm this conclusion since they do not evince an improper purpose and relate primarily to the stated salutary purposes of the law.
cross sound places great emphasis on the references in the law findings and objectives section and internal town memoranda to connecticut casinos and the need to curb additional traffic flowing from them.these references,however,do not establish a discriminatory purpose behind the law when they are viewed in light of myriad studies,reports,and conferences indicating that the traffic problem has been increasing since at least,before these casinos even existed,and attributing the problem to numerous other sources,including tourism and the presence of seasonal homes.aside from simply reflecting the reality of the town traffic situation,the observation that congestion would result from new casino ferry service furnishes additional support for the town regulatory measure.moreover,the transportation element raises substantially similar concerns about the potential traffic problem stemming from proposed ferry service from new york city to the town,suggesting that operators would be restricted by the ferry law for the same reasons as operators from connecticut or anywhere else.
in addition,although the ferry law distinguishes between ferries and excursion boats,laws that draw distinctions between entities that are not competitors do not discriminate for purposes of the dormant commerce clause,because in the absence of actual or prospective competition between the supposedly favored and disfavored entities in a single market there can be no local preference.motors,at.since ferries and excursion boats service different industries,eliminating the distinction in their treatment would not necessarily serve the objective of preserving a national market undisturbed by preferential advantages.
finally,the ferry law is not discriminatory in its effect.the law generally prohibits the operation of vehicular and ferries in the town and requires any new ferry entering the town to obtain a docking permit from the board.because these restrictions apply equally to all ferry operators,the ferry law lacks an important feature common to those regulations that previously have been found to violate the dormant commerce does not confer a competitive advantage upon local business competitors.see,c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d finding unconstitutional local ordinance requiring that solid waste processed or handled within town be processed or handled at town transfer station timber,wunnicke,d finding unconstitutional state law requiring all timber to be processed within the state before export dean milk city of madison.finding unconstitutional city law requiring milk to be pasteurized within five miles of the city packing haydel.finding unconstitutional state law requiring that local processors remove shrimp heads and hulls before export minnesota barber.finding unconstitutional state law requiring meat sold within state to be examined by state inspector.unlike these and similar regulations,the ferry law does not give any advantage to local businesses at the expense of competitors.that the ferry law does not discriminate on the basis of geography is amply demonstrated by the fact that even local businesses operating within the town itself challenge the validity of this law.see francarl realty town of hampton,civ.accordingly,we discern no clear discrimination in this case.
b.the pike balancing test 
having determined that the ferry law does not patent ly discriminat e against interstate commerce,we next assess its validity under the pike balancing test city of philadelphia,at.under pike,a regulation will be upheld if the burden it places on interstate commerce is outweighed by its local public benefits 
where the statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
at.citation omitted.we have explained that the incidental burdens to which pike refers are the burdens on interstate commerce that exceed the burdens on intrastate commerce.usa recycling,at.thus,at a minimum,the challenged regulation must impose a burden on interstate commerce that is qualitatively or quantitatively different from that imposed on intrastate commerce.mfrs.ass sorrell,cir.
we have recognized three circumstances in which an evenhanded regulation imposes an incidental burden on interstate commerce when the regulation has a disparate impact on any commercial entity when the statute regulates commercial activity that takes place wholly beyond the state borders and when the challenged statute imposes a regulatory requirement inconsistent with those of other states.united haulers ass n,solid waste mgmt,cir,cert.granted,d,see sal tinnerello sons,town of stonington,cir.cross sound does not contend that the ferry law operates extraterritorially by regulating commerce wholly beyond new york borders.nor does it argue that the law conflicts in any respect with the regulatory requirements imposed by other jurisdictions.cross sound only argument is that the ferry law imposes a disparate impact on interstate travelers.as cross sound alleges in its complaint 
the ferry law is protectionist legislation that,facially,in practical effect,and in its purpose,restricts the flow of commerce between new england and the south fork of long island,and forces significant quantities of such commerce to take a more circuitous,more timely and more costly and burdensome route through southold and shelter island.the ferry law creates burdens on interstate commerce that are clearly excessive in relation to any putative local benefits 
the ferry law inflicts harm on cross sound ferry passengers and customers,including by increasing the time and cost of interstate commerce,causing direct competitive harm to businesses engaged in interstate commerce,and decreasing the general health,welfare,and safety of cross sound ferry passengers and customers 
the ferry law limits the vessel horsepower and capable speed of vessels carrying passengers in interstate commerce that can use any passenger ferry terminal in east hampton,thereby rendering commercial passenger water carrier service on the waters between new london,connecticut and east hampton unfeasible and impractical.
although the ferry law does not clearly discriminate in favor of local interests,cross sound claims that it raises the cost of interstate transit because interstate travelers must take an alternate route that is longer and more expensive.the district court therefore erred when it determined that cross sound has failed to even allege any difference between the burdens on interstate and intrastate commerce.town of hampton,d at internal quotation marks omitted.the disparity alleged is that the ferry law shifts the burden or cost of traffic from town drivers onto interstate travelers because drivers benefit from reduced traffic volume on the local roads while interstate travelers are denied the most direct route to the town.
moreover,in support of its motion for summary judgment,cross sound submitted the affidavit of ronald hill,a traffic engineer,who analyzed the impact of the ferry law on interstate travel.hill opined that the ferry law increases trip length for passengers traveling from points in new england to east hampton and forces travelers and commerce to take a longer,circuitous,and thus more timely and costly route.the district court therefore also erred in concluding that cross sound offered no evidence in support of an allegation of disparate impact.id.on the burden side of the pike balancing equation,genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to the degree of the burden on interstate commerce.
genuine issues of material fact also exist on the benefits side of the pike equation.cross sound contends that any burden on interstate commerce is clearly excessive when compared to the local benefits and relies on hill affidavit to challenge the alleged benefits of the ferry law.using data from cross sound reservation database,hill estimated that vehicular ferry service to the town would result in an annual reduction of vehicle miles traveled vmt.hill then detailed the resulting positive impacts of the ferry service,including better air quality from reduced vmt,a decrease in traffic at intersections in the western portions of the town,and improved traffic conditions caused by a reduction of vehicles traveling in the peak direction of traffic flow.hill opined that the reduction in vmt from the ferry service translates directly to a reduction in the amount of pollutants emitted by the vehicles on the roadways and that a ll of the other benefits resulting from that vmt reduction,reduction of noise and air pollution,lessening of congestion,shorter queuing lines on the shelter island ferries,would also accrue.hill also observed that ferry service between east hampton and new england would have further beneficial impacts on traffic patterns,including the diversion of travelers off the already heavy queues,which create additional noise and air pollution when they are idling and waiting for the next ferry.
in addition,hill affidavit characterized the transportation element findings as a flawed and inaccurate assessment of the impact of ferry service upon traffic in east hampton.hill disputed each of the scenarios used in the transportation element to support the enactment of the ferry law and criticized the study for failing to consider other measures to mitigate any traffic burden that might be imposed by the ferry service,such as turning lanes or other roadway improvements.to rebut hill affidavit,the town presented the affidavit of raymond di biase,also a traffic engineer,who disagreed with hill vmt analysis and supported the conclusions in the transportation element.
in applying the pike balancing test,the district court did not refer to the conflicts in these expert affidavits or engage in any meaningful examination of the claimed local benefits conferred by the ferry law.the court simply rejected cross sound claim on the basis that the law was clearly enacted to further a legitimate local purpose the promotion of the health and safety of east hampton residents.id.while it is true that the judiciary may not sit as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom of legislative policy determinations,state trawlers ass jorling,cir quoting city of new orleans dukes,d,courts also must be wary of granting summary judgment when conflicting expert reports are presented,harris provident life accident ins,cir.we have remanded for further discovery or trial where a party has offered a credible expert affidavit alleging a burden on interstate commerce and challenging the proposed benefits of the law.see ass of int l auto,abrams,cir holding that affidavit of plaintiff expert challenging the validity of the legislative assumptions that a stronger bumper will mean less damage and lower insurance premiums precluded summary judgment since alleged local benefits of the new york bumper law were disputed.even the town appears to recognize that cross sound critique of the transportation element does raise a dispute of fact about the precise extent and manner in which the ferry law affects traffic congestion.br.at.
in light of the foregoing,a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the ferry law does not actually produce any of its intended benefits so as to justify the potential burden on inters
