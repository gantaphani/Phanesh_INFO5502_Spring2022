plaintiff cheryl krist appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a bench trial before george daniels,judge,dismissing her complaint alleging that defendant kolombos rest.kolombos,a new york city restaurant doing business as coopertown diner coopertown or the restaurant,discriminated against her on the basis of her disabilities in violation of title iii of the americans with disabilities act ada or the act,new york state executive law state human rights law and new york city administrative code to city human rights code or city code.krist,who has been disabled since at least,complained that beginning in late,when she acquired a service dog,kolombos discriminated against her by,inter alia,attempting to restrict her access and that of the dog to the restaurant and by verbally harassing her on account of her disability and use of the service dog.the district court entered judgment in favor of kolombos after finding that kolombos had not denied krist full and equal access to and use of the restaurant,either with or without her service dog,and ruling that restaurant employees comments,which krist considered to be rude or insensitive,did not constitute a violation of the ada.on appeal,krist contends principally that the district court erred by basing its decision on the premise that a plaintiff complaining of a violation of title iii of the ada is required to establish that discrimination was intended,by failing to find that krist was actually excluded from the restaurant,and by failing to construe the ada as imposing a code of civility and to rule that kolombos violated the ada by constructively excluding krist from the restaurant.concluding that there is no error of law or clear error of fact in the district court decision,we affirm the judgment.
background 
the following description of the facts is drawn from the district court findings as to the course of events,made on the record at the end of the bench trial see trial transcript tr.at,most of which have not been challenged by krist,and from testimony of krist and kolombos owners,most of which is consistent with the court findings.
krist,who suffers from several afflictions,including hereditary essential tremor,arthritis,and asthma,has been manifestly disabled since at least,causing her to require the assistance of walking aids or a wheelchair.she was a customer of coopertown for some years,beginning in approximately,frequenting the restaurant several times a week.between and december,krist went to coopertown nearly every day for breakfast and lunch.she usually arrived around and remained there until around coopertown became her primary social community,in which her friends were other customers,coopertown employees,and the restaurant current owners,michael kolombos and his cousin fotios batas.during this period,krist would arrive at the restaurant using a cane,crutches,or a wheelchair,and she experienced no discrimination.
in or about december,krist obtained a service dog that accompanied her to the restaurant.batas testified that when krist told him in late november that she was about to acquire a service dog and would be bringing it to the restaurant,he told her that that was permissible as long as the dog was licensed and was truly a service dog otherwise,he indicated,the dog would be excluded in order to avoid the restaurant being penalized by the health department.however,krist testified that on december,on her first trip to coopertown with the dog,her treatment by the kolombos employees,and by the friends with whom she normally congregated at the restaurant,changed radically.
coopertown,for krist,had been like cheers,you went in and you knew people and people knew you and you were friendly and everything was fine.tr.but after she began bringing the dog,it all went right out the window.id.at.the employees dealings with her all became very cool.it was just take my order,give me my food,give me my receipt and hope i leave.id.at.the first time she took the dog to the restaurant,joe mugno,a waiter with whom she frequently had had lunch,asked her if her dog was a service dog,using a tone of skepticism.krist responded that it was a service dog,and she and mugno had no further conversations about the dog but mugno never had lunch with her again.krist testified that on this occasion,none of the other employees of the restaurant spoke to her,even to exchange pleasantries.in addition,one of the customers,who had sat with krist every day she was at coopertown for years,refused to sit with her,never sat with her again,and stopped speaking to her.see id.at.
krist also testified that there were incidents in which batas or michael kolombos yelled at her.thus,on her second visit to coopertown with the dog,a few days after the first,batas,from behind the counter on the opposite side of the restaurant,stared at the dog and made growling sounds.krist testified that when the dog then made a sound that krist said was not a bark but sounded like boof,batas yelled at her that the dog was barking and he ordered her to leave the restaurant.tr.she testified that on another occasion in december,after she took the dog out from under her table to show it to another customer,batas yelled at her,complaining that she was playing with the dog.see id.at.
after batas yelled at her on her second visit to coopertown with the dog,krist had complained to michael kolombos.krist testified that michael kolombos said t hat i was welcome to have the dog in the restaurant but that i should sit in the front of the store and should e at my breakfast and go.tr.thereafter,krist began going to the restaurant less frequently she went approximately every other day.she sat at a front table perhaps three times but then resumed sitting in the back in her favorite booth.she would arrive at about and stay until around noon see id.at but,she testified,i did stay to eat lunch because no one meaning joe mugno or any of his sons or any of the other waiters or anybody would eat lunch with me so there was no sense in staying id.at.krist also testified that there was an incident in february and another in the summer of in which batas and michael kolombos,respectively,yelled at her for having the dog lie beside her chair or her booth,rather than under the table,and potentially imperil customers and waiters.see tr.batas and michael kolombos similarly testified that on those occasions,when they asked krist to move the dog,krist had put the dog in the aisle.see id.at.
in september,krist stopped going to coopertown.in december she filed the present action seeking injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages,alleging that on various occasions in and,the restaurant owners yelled at her and discriminated against her on the basis of her disability and use of the service dog,in violation of federal,new york state,and new york city laws.krist attorney argued that punitive damages were warranted because the kolombos owners knew the law and,having read the law at an early stage,they went on to do things that drove a person to tears and drove them sic ultimately to,after seven or eight months or nine months,to exclude herself from her only real significant social community.id.at.
following the trial,at which the court had heard testimony principally from krist,michael kolombos,and batas,the court made findings of fact generally consistent with the above except that it rejected krist testimony that either kolombos owner had ever ordered her to leave the restaurant it found that krist was never forced to leave the restaurant id.at see also id.at.
the court ruled that krist had failed to prove that kolombos did not attempt to reasonably accommodate her use of a service dog id.at that there was no evidence that these owners either attempted to deny krist access to the restaurant,provide d less or different services,or exclude d her or the dog from the restaurant id.at and that there was 
no evidence that any of these owners of this restaurant or employees of this restaurant treated plaintiff any differently because she was disabled.there is no evidence of that from the years before she had the dog,and there is no evidence of that when she got the dog 
id.at see also id.i can not say that they did reasonably accommodate the use of the service dog,even though it created additional issues that,obviously,are relevant in the context of a restaurant and places where people come to have their meals.
the court found that krist had continued to patronize the restaurant with the service dog for some months in virtually the same manner as she had before acquiring the dog.see tr.it found that she went to the restaurant with the dog dozens and dozens of times id.at that although there were some discussions between krist and michael kolombos as to whether krist could sit at various tables,she continued to sit exactly where she wanted to sit id.at that she stayed for hours and hours id.at and that whatever conversations there were about her leaving the restaurant on a particular day,it was clear that she was never forced to leave the restaurant id.at.krist decided when to arrive and when to leave,and despite her difficulties and disagreements with the owners,she quickly and continuously came back to the restaurant id.the court found that krist had not proven that coopertown owners or employees made her feel that she was not welcome at the restaurant because she had a disability.id.at.
the court accepted krist testimony that after she began bringing the dog to coopertown m any of her friends were no longer as friendly and that her circle of friends changed and it found that on approximately two or three occasions one of the owners yelled at her about the dog and the dog handling or the dog conduct.tr.however,the court found that although 
she was not treated as friendly as she had been treated before,the ada does prohibit the conduct at issue here,complaining about the dog handling and the dog behavior,even if done in a rude and insensitive manner if i could even characterize it as that.that is not what the ada is intended to reach.this may have been thought of like cheers,but the ada does not guarantee that kind of atmosphere.the ada prohibits discrimination and denial of use and enjoyment of public facilities.
without making a finding as to whether the owners comments or shouts of which krist complained actually were rude or insensitive,the court found that on this record i can not conclude that she was in any way,regardless of what the statements were,excluded from this restaurant,or that she in any way did not have full access to all of the facilities that she had access to before and utilized id.at.
the district court also noted that there was absolutely no evidence of any discriminatory intent on the part of the restaurant owners and employees.tr.see,id.at i can not reasonably determine on these facts as they are presented,even accepting them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,that these individuals intended to discriminate against her and in fact discriminated against her id.at there is no evidence that these individuals had any animosity toward the plaintiff personally and clearly not because she was disabled.
the court found that the occasions on which one of the kolombos owners yelled or shouted across the restaurant about the dog behavior were isolated and that their conduct was neither outrageous nor demeaning so as to constitute a constructive denial of access to the restaurant or its services.tr.it ruled that the ada does not require that owners of a public restaurant not complain,not ask the dog owner to control the dog behavior in a way that is not inconsistent with everyone else use of the restaurant.id.at.
although the court noted that krist ceased frequenting coopertown in the fall of,it was not persuaded that the decision to do so was forced upon her by kolombos.rather,the court stated that krist decision may have been motivated by her frustration at the breakdown of her social network id.as well as by the fact that she was about to bring suit against kolombos and desired to protect the viability of the lawsuit id.at.
judgment was entered in favor of kolombos on all of krist claims.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,krist argues principally that the judgment should be reversed on the grounds that the district court erroneously interpreted title iii of the ada or title iii as requiring a plaintiff to prove discriminatory intent,and that the court erred in failing to find that she was actually excluded from coopertown or that the coopertown owners yelling at her constructively excluded her from the restaurant.she contends that title iii imposes on public restaurants a requirement of civility.we reject krist contention that title iii imposes a civility code,and we see no error in the findings or conclusion of the district court.
title iii of the ada prohibits,as a g eneral rule,discrimination against an individual on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns,leases or operates a place of public accommodation,a,a restaurant serving food or drink,id.b.the act defines discrimination to include,to the extent pertinent in this action,
a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures,when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods and services to individuals with disabilities,unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods and services.
b a ii.regulations issued under title iii by the department of justice shortly after the ada was enacted,which were effective until march,provided that g enerally,a public accommodation shall modify policies,practices,or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability.c see also c effective,elaborating on accommodation requirements for individuals with disabilities aided by service animals.
in order to state a claim for violation of title iii,which authorizes private actions only for injunctive relief,not monetary damages,see,powell national board of medical examiners,cir,a plaintiff must establish that he or she is disabled within the meaning of the ada that the defendants own,lease,or operate a place of public accommodation and that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiff within the meaning of the ada,roberts royal atlantic,cir,cert.denied,d see camarillo carrols,cir camarillo.only the third element is at issue here.
in reviewing a judgment entered after a bench trial,we must not set aside the district court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.a see,anderson bessemer city,d banker nighswander,martin mitchell,cir.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson,at.
further,in determining whether factual findings are clearly erroneous,we are required to give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.a.it is within the province of the district court as the trier of fact to decide whose testimony should be credited.see,e,anderson,at.and as trier of fact,the judge is entitled,just as a jury would be,see,robinson cattaraugus county,cir fiacco city of rensselaer,cir,cert.denied,d,to believe some parts and disbelieve other parts of the testimony of any given witness.diesel props greystone business credit ii llc,cir.we are not allowed to the court credibility assessments.see,anderson,at.
we review the district court conclusions of law,and its application of the law to the facts,de novo.see,henry champlain enterprises,cir fdic providence college,cir.m ixed questions of law and fact are reviewed either de novo or under the clearly erroneous standard,depending on whether the question is predominantly legal or predominantly factual.united states skys,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
given these principles,we see no basis for disturbing the decision of the district court.preliminarily,we note that we are inclined to agree with krist that a title iii plaintiff who proves that she is disabled within the meaning of the ada and that the defendant operates a place of public accommodation that failed to make rea
