background 
on september,the individual students and a number of other students walked out of gorton high school in yonkers,new york,during school hours and headed for yonkers city hall.at city hall,the students protested recent cuts to the budget of the yonkers school district,the budget having been reduced by million for the school year.apparently,a similar demonstration had proved effective at staunching the previous year cuts to the yonkers school district budget.according to the plaintiffs,none of the students who walked out of gorton high school at the previous year demonstration were penalized for their act of protest,although they had violated the rules against leaving school grounds during school hours.the students,however,were classified as level iv offenders for their departure from the school grounds.level iv is the most serious disciplinary status and is reserved for those who engage in violent or dangerous conduct.based on this classification,the school district imposed upon the students a period of suspension.
on september,after having served two of the five days suspension,the students filed a complaint and an order to show cause in the district court citing violations of their first amendment rights and requesting,inter alia,that the court temporarily,preliminarily and permanently enjoin the school district from imposing the suspensions on them.a hearing was scheduled to be held on the noon of that same day to address the order to show cause or temporary restraining order brought on by garcia,et the school district was notified of the hearing by telephone that morning.as the school district counsel was entering the court to attend the hearing,he was provided with the students memorandum of law in support of the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,excerpts from the yonkers public school code of conduct the code of conduct,one of the disciplinary review forms utilized by the school district in connection with the suspensions,and ten affidavits.the hearing commenced at noon,and the school district counsel noted at the beginning of his statement i have had a chance to review the papers yet,but i do have some comments here.the district court acknowledged the lack of preparation time afforded to the school district counsel in its colloquy with counsel and i know you have had a chance to read the affidavits fully.both defendants superintendent angelo petrone and principal rocco grassi were present at the hearing.
the district court focused mainly on the punishment imposed on the students for their actions in derogation of the code of conduct.the district court noted that the students were punished for a level iv disciplinary action despite the code of conduct providing for a level,at most,a level action for a student leaving school grounds during school hours.the district court summarized its concern in a rhetorical question 
level iv punishes u se of a weapon.possession of a weapon assault.menacing.selling,giving or delivering alcoholic beverage defacing,vandalizing or destroying property.possession or use of fireworks,poppers,smoke or stink bombs,et cetera.engaging in the offense of retaliation against any school employee.any felony as defined by the criminal justice system.bomb threats or terrorist threats.sexual offenses.theft,burglary.false alarm that is,falsely activating a fire alarm.how is this walk out by the students a level iv 
in response,the school district counsel seemed to concede that the students conduct did not amount to a level iv violation.later during the hearing,however,principal rocco grassi explained that the students rose to the level of violent and dangerous conduct because of the confluence of several factors the students walked out despite repeated warnings not to do so the students push ed past security and plac ed themselves in danger out on the street and several of the students who walked out returned and assembled alongside of the school and were chanting to their fellow students break out.
unpersuaded by the testimony of principal rocco grassi,the district court found that the students had shown a likelihood of success on their first amendment claim that they were improperly punished for exercising protected speech the district court suggested,however,that the school district could prevail if it could present evidence that the imposition of a level iv disciplinary action applied to all and not only to the students in their exercise of protected speech.in an apparent conclusion,the district court stated so i going to grant the temporary restraining order.here is what i will do.and preliminary injunction.i will sign it in a few moments.but the district court then immediately stated that it would provide an opportunity to the school district to put forth evidence at another hearing,if requested,early next week so that we can get a definitive ruling on this quickly.at no time did the district court make written findings or sign a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order.
on september,the school district informed the district court that it does not request a hearing but would request the opportunity to submit responsive papers on the students application for an injunction.thereafter,the school district filed a memorandum in opposition to the students request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,and the students filed a reply memorandum in response to the school district opposing memorandum.subsequent to the hearing,the students were not subject to continued or further suspensions relating to the september,protest beyond the two days served however,the level iv notation remained on the students disciplinary records.
by of,the district court still had not made a ruling on the arguments made in the parties memoranda.in june and july of,after the students graduated from gorton high school,counsel for the students wrote the school district,asking it to resolve this case.counsel did not receive a response from the school district.on december,counsel filed with the district court a notice of a motion for attorney fees and costs,claiming that he was entitled to fees and costs because the students were prevailing parties under.counsel based his argument on the theory that the district court grant of the temporary restraining order ripen ed into a preliminary injunction.after submission of a written opposition by the school district and a reply by counsel,the district court granted counsel application for attorney fees and costs in a published decision and order.see garcia yonkers sch,d.
in its published decision and order,the district court stated that it had granted the students request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction at the september,hearing.id.at.in so concluding,the district court referred to its own statement at the hearing i going to grant the temporary restraining order.here is what i will do.and preliminary injunction.i will sign it in a few moments.id.at.the district court then explained that it was not precluded by.a from entering a preliminary injunction against the school district because the school district had adequate notice and a fair opportunity to oppose the request for a preliminary injunction at the september,hearing.id.the district court referred to the school district counsel appearance at the hearing accompanied by named defendants petrone and grassi and noted that the school district presented an argument in support of its position.id.
having concluded that a preliminary injunction had been entered,the district court stated that the entry of that injunction was a sufficient basis for granting the attorney fees.id.at.the district court explained that its grant of a preliminary injunction was based on the merits of the students first amendment claims and,thus,created a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties to this case.id.the district court observed that,consistent with the entry of a preliminary injunction,the school district did not attempt to continue the suspension of the students after the september,hearing.see id.at.the district court thus concluded that the students were prevailing parties under b,and,therefore,that their counsel was entitled to attorney fees and costs.see id.
to the extent the amount of attorney fees was concerned,the district court found that the fees sought were appropriate and reasonable in light of counsel highly qualified background and experience in civil rights litigation.id.at.the district court also found no error in counsel computation of the time expended on the case.id.accordingly,the district court ordered the school district to pay attorney fees and costs in the amount of.id.judgment was entered in due course,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.see auto.club of,dykstra,cir.inasmuch as the resolution of the district court grant of attorney fees implicates questions of law,our review is de novo.see williams beemiller,cir stating that questions of statutory construction,including the district court interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure,are reviewed de novo citations omitted.
attorney fees under section b 
section b permits reasonable attorney fees and costs to be awarded to a prevailing party in any action or proceeding in connection with enforcing the provisions of.see b.the supreme court has held that a prevailing party is one who has favorably effected a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties by court order.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d quoting texas state teachers ass garland indep.school,d see also vacchio ashcroft,cir see also black law dictionary ed defining prevailing party as a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered,regardless of the amount of damages awarded.thus,for example,the entry of an enforceable judgment,such as a stay or preliminary injunction,may permit the district court to confer status on the plaintiff notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment on the underlying claim see vacchio,at s tatus as a prevailing party is conferred whenever there is a court ordered change in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant or a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.citing coalition of erie county federal transit,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted haley pataki,cir awarding attorney fees pursuant to b to party prevailing on preliminary injunction.
although prevailing party is thus construed broadly,a plaintiff is not a prevailing party if he or she achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.buckhannon,at.the supreme court has explained that such a voluntary change in defendant conduct lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change to accord status to the plaintiff.id.at.moreover,a plaintiff who secures interim relief that is later reversed,dissolved,or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case is not a prevailing party.sole wyner,d see id.at a plaintiff who achieves a transient victory at the threshold of an action can gain no award under that provision if,at the end of the litigation,her initial success is undone and she leaves the courthouse emptyhanded.
with these legal principles in mind,we conclude that attorney fees were erroneously granted because the students were not,in fact,prevailing parties.the district court did not issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order at the september,hearing,and,therefore,there was nothing that could serve as a basis for conferring status on the students.further,even if the district court had granted the students request for a temporary restraining order,the students were not prevailing parties because the court never finally addressed the merits of the students underlying first amendment claim.
the preliminary injunction 
a district court interpretation of its own order is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.see united states spallone,cir when an issuing judge interprets his own orders,we accord substantial deference to the draftsman,and we will not reverse the judge construction of an ambiguity in his own words except for abuse of discretion.nonetheless,
we do not give equal deference to every aspect of a court decision.the abuse of discretion standard is used to evaluate the court application of the facts to the appropriate legal standard,and the factual findings and legal conclusions underlying such decisions are evaluated under the clearly erroneous and de novo standards,respect ively.
matter of vms sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we review de novo the legal question of whether the district court issued a preliminary injunction or restraining order in satisfaction of.see united states camacho,cir reviewing de novo whether a criminal judgment is final for purposes of.
here,notwithstanding the district court conclusion in retrospect that it had granted the preliminary injunction at the september,hearing,it is unclear upon our review of the transcript whether the district court intended to grant the injunction at the hastily convened hearing.to be sure,the district court stated at one time that it was going to grant the temporary restraining order.here is what i will do.and preliminary injunction.i will sign it in a few moments.in the context of the entire proceedings,however,the meaning of this plain statement is complicated by various findings and comments by the district court made before and after the granting of the injunction restraining order.see spallone,at stating that this court examines the entire record for the purpose of determining what was decided internal quotation marks omitted.
the transcript of the hearing reveals that,on the one hand,the district court thought that the students first amendment claims were meritorious in light of the disproportionate level iv punishment imposed on the students for an infraction that should have placed them at level ii or,at most,level iii.on the other hand,the district court also noted that it was appropriate for the school district to punish the students for violating the code of conduct and,in fact,that the school district may prevail in opposing the injunction if it could show that a level iv punishment is the ordinary disciplinary action taken against all students who leave school grounds during school hours.
adding to the ambivalence of the district court opinion on the merits of the case,the district court informed the school district immediately after stating that it was going to grant the temporary restraining order a nd preliminary injunction emphasis added that the school district would be given an opportunity to present evidence early next week so that we can get a definitive ruling on this quickly.despite its earlier indication that it would do so,it is noteworthy that the district court did not sign either a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction order.thus,it is apparent that the district court ultimately decided against entering a preliminary injunction at the september,hearing.we also note that even the students counsel believed that the district court had not entered a preliminary injunction at the hearing,as made clear in his motion for attorney fees.in
