a defendant seeking to remove a case from state to federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.a.
respondent owens filed a putative class action in kansas state court,seeking compensation for damages class members allegedly sustained when petitioners collectively,dart underpaid royalties due under certain oil and gas leases.dart removed the case to the federal district court,invoking the class action fairness act of cafa,which gives federal courts jurisdiction over class actions if the amount in controversy exceeds million,d.dart notice of removal alleged that the purported underpayments totaled over million.owens moved to remand the case to state court,asserting that the removal notice was deficient as a matter of law because it included no evidence proving that the amount in controversy exceeded million.in response,dart submitted an executive detailed declaration supporting an amount in controversy in excess of million.the district court granted owens remand motion,reading tenth circuit precedent to require proof of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself.dart petitioned the tenth circuit for permission to appeal,see c,but that court denied review and rehearing en banc.
as specified in a,a defendant notice of removal need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold the notice need not contain evidentiary submissions.
section a tracks the general pleading requirement stated in rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.by borrowing rule a short and plain statement standard,corroborative history indicates,congress intended to clarify that courts should apply the same liberal rules to removal allegations as to other matters of pleading.the allegation of a plaintiff invoking jurisdiction is accepted if made in good faith.see,healthy city bd.of ed.doyle.similarly,the allegation of a defendant seeking adjudication should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.in the event that the plaintiff does contest the defendant allegations,both sides submit proof and the court decides,by a preponderance of the evidence,whether the requirement has been satisfied,see c b.
in remanding the case to state court,the district court relied,in part,on a purported presumption against removal,but no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking cafa,a statute congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.see standard fire ins.knowles.
the district court erred in remanding this case for want of an evidentiary submission in the notice of removal,and the tenth circuit abused its discretion in denying review of that decision.
a this court concludes that no jurisdictional barrier impedes settlement of the question presented whether evidence supporting the amount in controversy must be included in a notice of removal.the case was in the tenth circuit because of dart application for leave to appeal,and the court has jurisdiction to review what the court of appeals did with that application.see hohn united states.

the district court,driven by its conscientious endeavor to follow circuit precedent,erred in ruling that dart allegation failed for want of proof.it was an abuse of discretion for the tenth circuit to deny dart request for review,for that disposition fastened on district courts within the circuit an erroneous view of the law.contrary to the law the district court derived from tenth circuit precedent,a removal notice need only plausibly allege,not detail proof of,the amount in.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
to remove a case from a state court to a federal court,a defendant must file in the federal forum a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.a.when is based on diversity of citizenship,an requirement must be met.ordinarily,the matter in controversy must excee d the sum or value of.a.in class actions for which the requirement of diversity of citizenship is relaxed,d a c,the matter in controversy must excee d the sum or value of,d.if the plaintiff complaint,filed in state court,demands relief of a stated sum,that sum,if asserted in good faith,is deemed to be the amount in controversy.c.when the plaintiff complaint does not state the amount in controversy,the defendant notice of removal may do so.c a.
to assert the amount in controversy adequately in the removal notice,does it suffice to allege the requisite amount plausibly,or must the defendant incorporate into the notice of removal evidence supporting the allegation that is the single question argued here and below by the parties and the issue on which we granted review.the answer,we hold,is supplied by the removal statute itself.a statement short and plain need not contain evidentiary submissions.
brandon owens,plaintiff below and respondent here,filed a putative class action in kansas state court alleging that defendants dart cherokee basin operating company,llc,and cherokee basin pipeline,llc collectively,dart,underpaid royalties owed to putative class members under certain oil and gas leases.the complaint sought a fair and reasonable amount to compensate putative class members for damages they sustained due to the alleged underpayments.app.to pet.for cert.
invoking federal jurisdiction under the class action fairness act of cafa,dart removed the case to the district court for the district of kansas.cafa gives federal courts jurisdiction over certain class actions,defined in d,if the class has more than members,the parties are minimally diverse,and the amount in controversy exceeds million.d,b see standard fire ins.knowles,slip,at.dart notice of removal alleged that all three requirements were satisfied.with respect to the amount in controversy,dart stated that the purported underpayments to putative class members totaled more than million.
owens moved to remand the case to state court.the notice of removal was deficient as a matter of law,owens asserted,because it included no evidence proving that the amount in controversy exceeded million.app.to pet.for cert.in response,dart submitted a declaration by one of its executive officers.the declaration included a detailed damages calculation indicating that the amount in controversy,sans interest,exceeded million.without challenging dart calculation,owens urged that dart submission came too late.the legally deficient notice of removal,owens maintained,could not be cured by evidence about the amount in controversy.at.
reading tenth circuit precedent to require proof of the amount in controversy in the notice of removal itself,the district court granted owens remand motion.dart declaration,the district court held,could not serve to keep the case in federal court.the tenth circuit,as the district court read circuit precedent,has consistently held that reference to factual allegations or evidence of the petition and notice of removal is not permitted to determine the amount in controversy.app.to pet.for cert,and citing laughlin kmart,martin franklin capital,oklahoma farm bureau mut.ins.jssj,fed.appx.
ordinarily,remand orders are not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.d.there is an exception,however,for cases invoking cafa.c.in such cases,a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand.ibid.citing this exception,dart petitioned the tenth circuit for permission to appeal.upon careful consideration of the parties submissions,as well as the applicable law,the tenth circuit panel,dividing,denied review.app.to pet.for cert.
an evenly divided court denied dart petition for en banc review.dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc,judge hartz observed that the tenth circuit had let stand a decision that will in effect impose in this circuit requirements for notices of removal that are even more onerous than the code pleading requirements that federal courts abandoned long ago.the tenth circuit was to grant dart petition for rehearing en banc,judge hartz urged,because the opportunity to correct the law in our circuit likely would not arise again,at.henceforth,judge hartz explained,any diligent attorney would submit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a chance on remand to state court.ibid.
dart filed a petition for certiorari in this court requesting resolution of the following question whether a defendant seeking removal to federal court is required to include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the notice of removal,or is alleging the required short and plain statement of the grounds for removal enough pet.for cert.owens brief in opposition raised no impediment to this court review.nor,later,did owens merits brief suggest any barrier to our consideration of dart petition.we granted certiorari to resolve a division among the circuits on the question presented.compare ellenburg spartan motors chassis,a removing party notice of removal need not meet a higher pleading standard than the one imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an initial complaint and spivey vertrue,similar,with laughlin,at the requisite amount in controversy must be affirmatively established on the face of either the petition or the removal notice 
as noted above,a defendant seeking to remove a case to a federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.a.by design,a tracks the general pleading requirement stated in rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.see wright,miller,cooper,steinman,federal practice and procedure,ed.section a requires only that the grounds for removal be stated in a short and plain statement terms borrowed from the pleading requirement set forth in federal rule of civil procedure a.the legislative history of a is corroborative.congress,by borrowing the familiar short and plain statement standard from rule a,intended to simplify the pleading requirements for removal and to clarify that courts should apply the same liberal rules to removal allegations that are applied to other matters of pleading.see also ibid.disapproving decisions requiring detailed pleading 
when a plaintiff invokes jurisdiction,the plaintiff allegation is accepted if made in good faith.see,healthy city bd.of ed.doyle,t he sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith.quoting paul mercury indemnity red cab,alteration in original.similarly,when a defendant seeks adjudication,the defendant allegation should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court.indeed,the tenth circuit,although not disturbing prior decisions demanding proof together with the removal notice,recognized that it was anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and removing defendants differently with regard to the amount in controversy.see mcphail deere,requiring proof by defendant but not by plaintiff bears no evident logical relationship either to the purpose of diversity jurisdiction,or to the principle that those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must establish its prerequisites 
if the plaintiff contests the defendant allegation,c b instructs r emoval is proper on the basis of an amount in controversy asserted by the defendant if the district court finds,by the preponderance of the evidence,that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold this provision,added to as part of the federal courts jurisdiction and venue clarification act of jvca,clarifies the procedure in order when a defendant assertion of the amount in controversy is challenged.in such a case,both sides submit proof and the court decides,by a preponderance of the evidence,whether the requirement has been satisfied.as the house judiciary committee report on the jvca observed 
d efendants do not need to prove to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy requirement has been met.rather,defendants may simply allege or assert that the jurisdictional threshold has been met.discovery may be taken with regard to that question.in case of a dispute,the district court must make findings of jurisdictional fact to which the preponderance standard applies.
of course,a dispute about a defendant jurisdictional allegations can not arise until after the defendant files a notice of removal containing those allegations.brief for dart.
in remanding the case to state court,the district court relied,in part,on a purported presumption against removal.app.to pet.for cert.see,laughlin,at t here is a presumption against removal jurisdiction.we need not here decide whether such a presumption is proper in diversity cases.it suffices to point out that no antiremoval presumption attends cases invoking cafa,which congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.see standard fire ins,at slip,at cafa primary objective is to ensur e federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance.quoting b,stat,cafa provisions should be read broadly,with a strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.
in sum,as specified in a,a defendant notice of removal need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.evidence establishing the amount is required by c b only when the plaintiff contests,or the court questions,the defendant allegation.
as in standard fire ins,at slip,at,we granted review in this case after the court of appeals declined to hear an appeal from a remand order.neither party in that case or in this one questioned our review authority under cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed b y writ of certiorari upon the petition of any party before or after rendition of judgment.an amicus brief filed in support of owens by public citizen,however,raised a jurisdictional impediment.
section c,public citizen noted,provides that a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed.emphasis added.because court of appeals review of a remand order is discretionary,see supra,at,and the tenth circuit exercised its discretion to deny review,public citizen urged,b oth parties ask this court to decide an issue that is not properly before it.brief for public citizen.absent grounds for reversing the court of appeals decision to deny permission to appeal,public citizen asserted,the merits of the district court decision are not before any appellate court,including this one.ibid.
satisfied that there are indeed grounds for reversing the tenth circuit decision to deny permission to appeal,we find no jurisdictional barrier to our settlement of the question presented.the case was in the court of appeals because of dart application,and we have jurisdiction to review what the court of appeals did with that application.see hohn united states.owens,we reiterate,did not contest the scope of our review.
discretion to review a remand order is not rudderless.see highmark allcare health management system,slip,at matters of discretion are reviewable for abuse of discretion internal quotation marks omitted.a court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law.cooter gell hartmarx.this case fits that bill 
there are many signals that the tenth circuit relied on the legally erroneous premise that the district court decision was correct.in an earlier case,the tenth circuit,following the first circuit lead,stated considerations that it regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of discretion under c.bp america,ex rel.edmondson,adopting factors set out in college of dental surgeons of puerto rico connecticut life ins,when the question presented in an appeal from a remand order is important,unsettled,and recurrent,the first circuit instructed,a court of appeals should inquire absent an interlocutory appeal,will the question in all probability escape meaningful appellate review.at.or,as phrased by the tenth circuit,if a district court remand order remains undisturbed,will the case leave the ambit of the federal courts for good,precluding any other opportunity for the defendant to vindicate its claimed legal entitlement under cafa to have a federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.bp america,at.see also coffey freeport mcmoran copper gold,noting that the purpose of c is to develop a body of appellate law interpreting cafa brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the tenth circuit own guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting dart appeal.that the court of appeals,instead,rejected dart appeal strongly suggests that the panel thought the district court got it right in requiring proof of the amount in controversy in the removal notice.
in practical effect,the court of appeals denial of review established the law not simply for this case,but for future cafa removals sought by defendants in the tenth circuit.the likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in which the tenth circuit will face a plea to retract the rule that both owens and the district court ascribed to decisions of the court of appeals defendants seeking to remove under cafa must be sent back to state court unless they submit with the notice of removal evidence proving the alleged amount in controversy.see supra,at.on this point,judge hartz observation,dissenting from the tenth circuit denial of rehearing en banc,see supra,at,bears recounting in full 
after today decision any diligent attorney and one can assume that an attorney representing a defendant in a case involving at least million the threshold for removal under cafa would have substantial incentive to be diligent would submit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a chance on remand to state court.at.
with no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray,judge hartz anticipated,the issue will not arise again.ibid.consequently,the law applied by the district court demanding that the notice of removal contain evidence documenting the amount in controversy will be frozen in place for all venues within the tenth circuit 
recall that the court of appeals denied dart petition for review u pon careful consideration of the parties submissions,as well as the applicable law.app.to pet.for cert.what did the parties submit to the tenth circuit their presentations urged conflicting views on whether a removing defendant must tender prima facie proof of the amount in controversy as part of the removal notice.and what was the applicable law other than the rule recited by the tenth circuit in laughlin and decisions,to remove successfully,a defendant must present with the notice of removal evidence proving the amount in controversy 
from all signals one can discern then,the tenth circuit denial of dart request for review of the remand order was infected by legal error.the district court erred in ruling that dart allegation failed for want of proof,but that error was driven by the district court conscientious endeavor to follow circuit precedent.the parties trained their arguments in the tenth circuit,as they did here,on the question whether dart could successfully remove without detailing in the removal notice evidence of the amount in controversy.see tr.of oral arg.acknowledgment by owens counsel that the issues provided to the tenth circuit were very similar to what you see in this court,with the exception of the question raised by public citizen whether this court has jurisdiction dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc,judge hartz explained at length why the tenth circuit owe d a duty to the bench and bar to correct the district court misperception and to state as the circuit law a defendant seeking removal under cafa need only allege the jurisdictional amount in its notice of removal and must prove that amount only if the plaintiff challenges the allegation.at.in this regard,we note,the tenth circuit has cautioned against casual rulings on applications like dart.the decision whether to grant leave to appeal under c,the tenth circuit stressed,calls for the exercise of the reviewing court correctly informed discretion.bp america,at emphasis added see supra,at.
recall,moreover,that owens never suggested in his written submissions to this court that anything other than the question presented accounts for the court of appeals disposition.if owens believed that the tenth circuit denial of leave to appeal rested on some other ground,he might have said so in his brief in opposition or,at least,in his merits brief.see this court rule granite rock teamsters.he said nothing of that order,for he,like dart,that the question presented was ripe for this court resolution.
in the circumstances,we find it an abuse of discretion for the tenth circuit to deny dart request for review.doing so froze the governing rule in the circuit for this case and future cafa removal notices,with no opportunity for defendants in dart position responsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission.that situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who did not think that the amount in controversy in diversity cases is a matter a removal notice must demonstrate by evidence,not merely credibly allege and if the circuit precedent on which the district court relied misstated the law,as we hold it did,then the district court order remanding this case to the state court is fatally infected by legal error.
careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues public citizen invites us to separate whether the tenth circuit abused its discretion in denying review,and whether the district court remand order was erroneous do not pose genuinely discrete questions.instead,resolution of both issues depends on the answer to the very same question what must the removal notice contain if the notice need not contain evidence,the tenth circuit abused its discretion in effectively making the opposing view the law of the circuit.by the same token,the district court erred in remanding the case for want of an evidentiary submission in the removal notice.we no doubt have authority to review for abuse of discretion the tenth circuit denial of dart appeal from the district court remand order,see supra,at,and in doing so,to correct the erroneous view of the law the tenth circuit decision fastened on district courts within the circuit domain 
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the tenth circuit is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

when dart removed this class action to federal court,it was required to file a notice of removal containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.a.in accordance with what it thought to be tenth circuit jurisprudence,the district court interpreted this to require evidence as opposed to mere allegations supporting federal jurisdiction.after finding that dart notice of removal did not include evidence of the jurisdictionally required amount in controversy,the district court remanded the case to state court.app.to pet.for cert.dart sought permission to appeal this order under c,which provides that a court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed emphasis added.without stating its reasons,the tenth circuit issued an order denying dart request.app.to pet.for cert.
eager to correct what we suspected was the district court and the tenth circuit erroneous interpretation of a,we granted certiorari to decide whether notices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal jurisdiction.after briefing we discovered a little snag this case does not present that question.because we are reviewing the tenth circuit judgment,the only question before us is whether the tenth circuit abused its discretion in denying dart permission to appeal the district court remand order.once we found out that the issue presented differed from the issue we granted certiorari to review,the responsible course would have been to confess error and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.
the court,however,insists on deciding whether the district court erred in remanding this case to state court.how can it do that,one might ask,when the only issue in this case concerns the propriety of the tenth circuit rejection of dart appeal the court hits upon a solution it concludes that the tenth circuit decided not to hear the appeal because it agreed with the district court analysis.attributing the district court reasoning to the tenth circuit allows the court to pretend to review the appellate court exercise of discretion while actually reviewing the trial court legal analysis.
there are problems with this approach that are,in a rational world,insuperable.to begin with,the tenth circuit short order does not tell us why it decided not to hear dart appeal.it might have done so for an impermissible reason for example,agreement with the district court legal reasoning.but it might instead have done so for countless other,permissible,reasons for example,a concern that this would be a poor vehicle for deciding the issue presented by dart appeal,or a concern regarding the court ability to quickly resolve the issue,see c providing that appeals accepted under c must be decided within days,absent consent of the parties,with a extension for good cause shown and in the interests of justice 
not long ago we held,unanimously,that a n appellate court should not presume that a district court intended an incorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible of a correct reading,particularly when the applicable standard of review is deferential.management mendelsohn.there,we corrected the tenth circuit for doing precisely what the court itself does today in reviewing deferentially the tenth circuit denial of permission to appeal presuming that the lower court adopted a legally erroneous argument advanced by one party,at.we explained to the tenth circuit that it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court to assume,absent indication in the district court opinion,that the lower court adopted a party incorrect argument.at,emphasis added.today,however,this court blatantly violates that rule.
the only indication in the opinion that the court relies on is the following language from the order denying permission to appeal upon careful consideration of the parties submissions,as well as the applicable law,the petition for permission to appeal the remand order is denied.app.to pet.for cert.this,the court tells us,means the tenth circuit must have denied dart petition because it agreed with the district court legal conclusion.of course it means no such thing.
as for point,considering a submission is not the same thing as agreeing with that submission.worse still,correctness of the district court opinion was not the only ground that owens brief in the tenth circuit urged to support denial of the petition for review.it noted,for example,that the case addressed the general removal statute,a,and so did not involve a question unique to the class action fairness act of cafa.response to petition for permission to appeal in.the tenth circuit considers the presence of an important question a reason to accept an appeal.bp america,oklahoma ex rel.edmonson,internal quotation marks omitted.
as for point,there is no reason whatever to believe that the only applicable law the tenth circuit considered and relied on was the law relating to the correctness of the district court decision,the law interpreting a.after all,the applicable law surely includes the law applicable to the disposition of petitions to appeal,c,and that body of law includes countless reasons to deny permission to appeal that are unrelated to the merits of the underlying district court judgment.applicable law would allow the tenth circuit,for example,to deny permission to appeal for reasons not mentioned in the parties briefing.it would allow it to deny permission because it would be unable to resolve the issue within days,as required by cafa absent an extension.c and c see also,hartz,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc it will always be tempting for very busy judges to deny review of a knotty matter that requires a decision in short order and applicable law would permit numerous other grounds for denial,including those applied by this court in denying petitions for certiorari.there is,to tell the truth,absolutely nothing in the tenth circuit order to suggest that it relied on the unlawful ground that the court eagerly attributes to it,rather than one of many possible lawful grounds.thus,as we said in mendelsohn,it would be inappropriate for the reviewing court us to assume that the lower court adopted a party incorrect argument.at.
besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of the order,the court makes one other attempt to demonstrate that the tenth circuit order was based upon its agreement with the holding of the district court.it asserts that denying dart permission to appeal froz e in place the district court rule.ante,at.in light of that denial,the court says,any responsible attorney will include evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of removal,thereby eliminating the risk of having that notice held improper for the reason given by the district court in this case.as a result,the tenth circuit will likely never again be presented with the question whether evidence of jurisdiction must be included with a notice of removal.ibid.the court then notes that,among the many factors the tenth circuit considers in deciding whether to accept an appeal under c,is whether the case presents an issue which,if not resolved in that appeal,will leave the ambit of the federal courts for good.bp america,supra,at.one would have thought that this factor,if it controlled the tenth circuit denial,means that the tenth circuit did not agree with the court perception that this issue will not likely reappear.the court,however,says quite illogically that it means the tenth circuit must have agreed with the district court incorrect legal analysis.it is hard to imagine a more obvious non
