make the road by walking mrbw appeals from judge schwartz grant of summary judgment to the human resources administration hra.the district court held that exclusion of mrbw from welfare office waiting rooms sometimes job center waiting rooms when mrbw was not there to transact official business did not violate appellant first amendment,due process,or equal protection rights.judge schwartz also granted summary judgment to mrbw on its claim that a portion of the hra policy on admission to job center waiting rooms was unconstitutionally vague.mrbw appeals from only the district court first amendment ruling hra does not.
the dispositive issue is whether the job center waiting rooms are nonpublic fora or limited public fora for first amendment purposes.we hold that the waiting rooms are nonpublic fora and that the exclusion of mrbw was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.we therefore affirm,albeit on grounds different from those expressed by the district court.
background 
mrbw is an advocacy organization incorporated in and located in bushwick,brooklyn.it seeks to provide information,assistance,and representation with respect to public assistance benefits to welfare claimants in job centers.specifically,mrbw advocates inform claimants of their rights,help them complete application and recertification forms,translate for claimants,and represent individual claimants during meetings with caseworkers.in addition,advocates may quickly encourage welfare center personnel to follow proper procedures so that erroneous decisions are not made and can remain on site to address any remaining ambiguities or resistance by the welfare center employees.in the long run,according to mrbw,advocates can observe and identify chronic or systemic problems and request that hra employees rectify those problems.
mrbw is staffed by lawyers and,and its members are community residents who volunteer for four hours or pay dues of two dollars each month.mrbw employs four full time attorneys,one law school graduate,and four staff organizers.one lawyer is assigned to the project responsible for the mrbw programs at issue in this case,the equal justice project ejp.the parties dispute whether the two ejp staff of the three ejp advocates in trained for their jobs.hra claims that one of the two has received no training,while the other has attended only a seminar about benefits.mrbw responds that advocates perform only those tasks for which they have been trained,and that this training consists of discussions at meetings,conversations,and practicing.mrbw has successfully advocated for numerous welfare claimants,mainly by filing complaints with hra.
the job center waiting rooms are operated by hra,the social services district charged with administering and dispensing benefits to residents of new york city.the family independence administration fia is the largest division of hra and administers many welfare benefits programs,including public assistance cash subsidies to recipients,medicaid,and food stamps.claimants apply for these benefits or are recertified to receive them at job centers,which are operated by fia,except that claimants who are eligible only for medicaid are referred to another division of hra.fia is solely responsible for operating job center waiting rooms.
each job center has a waiting room,and each also has separate areas containing cubicles of eligibility specialists and financial planners who interview and process forms for claimants.the business serving claimants at job centers takes place mainly in these separate areas the parties agree that the purpose of providing waiting room access to claimants is to facilitate the claimants business with fia.
in debating whether the job centers are limited public or nonpublic fora,the parties have looked to hra policies from the to the present date.during this period,federal and state law have required hra to allow claimants to select and bring an advocate into job centers.a iii reg.tit,d.while accompanying a claimant to a job center,an advocate can inform,assist,and represent that claimant,and can help other claimants who ask for the advocate assistance.however,retained advocates may not solicit new clients in job center waiting rooms.advocates brought by claimants need not have prior permission or training,or meet any other criteria to gain entry.id.
in,we held that the albany welfare office could not totally prohibit peaceful leafletting about,and discussion of,the legal rights of welfare recipients and the welfare rights movement in welfare office waiting rooms by advocacy groups.albany welfare rights org.wyman,cir,cert.denied,d.we indicated that the waiting rooms were not traditional public fora but that some expression was permissible.id.at.in light of this decision,from through approximately,hra allowed unretained advocates to enter job centers and provide information,representation,and assistance to claimants.new york city unemployed welfare council brezenoff,cir describing access policy.in,hra promulgated regulations allowing o rganizations desiring to converse with clients and distribute literature to sit at tables in job centers,such community tables were referred to in the hra procedure manual as late as.after the district court decision in brezenoff struck down regulations requiring advocates to stay behind tables,hra also began allowing one advocate from any group present in a job center to walk around the waiting room.id.at.
several advocacy organizations took advantage of this access to job centers.during the,hra admitted the food law project in the,it admitted the new york city unemployed and welfare council and in the late and early,hra admitted other advocates.id.at id.at murphy,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
in,the supreme court decided cornelius naacp legal defense and educational fund,d,and in it decided international society for krishna consciousness,lee lee i,d.these cases built upon the tripartite forum analysis developed in perry education association perry local educators association,d,and clarified that a designated public forum,including a limited public forum,arises only where the government intends to create one.lee i,at.cornelius,at.this reliance upon governmental intent substantially differed from the analysis used in albany welfare and brezenoff,and,beginning in the early,hra began enforcing a policy first enacted in its code of conduct in,and included in each subsequent code of conduct,that was at odds with albany welfare and brezenoff.that policy provided that 
the use of hra premises shall be limited to the transaction of official business and such other activities as may be specifically authorized by the hra department of social services distribution of written material on agency premises is limited to releases issued or sponsored by hra,releases of recognized staff organizations or clubs approved for distribution by hra and releases of certified labor organizations pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.
hra code of conduct according to hra,its official business is delineated by federal and state law,as well as local law,and,under this policy,hra limits third party access to centers and their waiting rooms to those individuals who are part of the transaction of hra official business.in recent years,retained advocates,contractors providing managed health care and homelessness intervention services,the census bureau,and the new york state department of health have been admitted under this policy.these entities,except for the homelessness intervention contractors,may deal with claimants in the job center waiting rooms.academics and government officials also occasionally tour the job centers by permission.the managed care and homelessness intervention contractors operate in job centers pursuant to contracts with hra requiring compliance with laws and indemnification of the city for any liability arising from their services,as well as insurance coverage of per occurrence.hra contracts with these providers pursuant to federal and state law.soc.servs.law,managed care pub.health law et,managed care for pregnant women and children soc.servs.law homelessness intervention.see also note,infra.
members of the general public can enter welfare centers freely,in the sense that anyone can walk in from the street to a welfare office waiting room.however,three to four times a day job center supervisors patrol the center waiting rooms to ensure that everyone is being properly served and that people are not waiting too long.these supervisors also ask those in the waiting rooms for the purpose of their visit,and those who are not there to conduct official business are asked to leave.claimants may bring friends,relatives,and retained advocates to job centers.unless already retained by a claimant,mrbw representatives are no longer allowed to enter job centers because they lack authorization under the official business policy.on august,mrbw,along with the brennan center for justice,the legal aid society,the new york legal assistance group and the welfare law center,requested access to the job center waiting rooms to assist,inform,and represent claimants.the city counsel responded in a letter,stating that hra declines to grant the access you seek in your letter,other than for the purpose of providing representation to a specific applicant or recipient,in accordance with d.
this suit seeking access to job center waiting rooms followed.mrbw complaint claimed that hra access policy violated the first and fourteenth amendments of the constitution because it was vague,constituted viewpoint discrimination,and abridged mrbw speech,press,petition,and associational rights.mrbw also argued that the policy violated the plaintiff welfare claimants due process and equal protection rights.both parties moved for summary judgment.
after entertaining for summary judgment,the district court granted each party motion in part.it held that the portion of hra access policy allowing entry for other such activities as may be specifically authorized by the hra administrator,as well as the portion allowing distribution of literature issued or sponsored by hra,to be unconstitutionally vague.sanchez turner,civ.ags,dist.lexis,at,wl,at june.the court severed those clauses and left the remainder of the policy standing.id.hra has not appealed from this part of the district court decision.
the court also granted hra motion for summary judgment in part,on two first amendment grounds.first,the court determined that limiting the use of hra premises to official business was not unconstitutionally vague because hra official business is clearly defined by state and local law,specifically the new york social services law,the new york city charter,and state regulations.id.at,wl,at.furthermore,according to the court,hra inclusion of providers and homelessness intervention well as advocates previously retained by claimants,the new york state department of health,the census bureau,and academic tours,did not demonstrate that hra had unfettered discretion in determining what constituted official business.id.at,wl,at.rather,each of these entities conducted official business pursuant to the new york city charter or the city regulations 
the district court pointed out that new york social services law establishes new york city as a social services district and requires that each social services district shall be responsible for the assistance and care of any person who resides or is found in its territory and who is in need of public assistance and care which he is unable to provide for himself.ny soc.serv.see also soc.serv.under the new york city charter,hra referred to in the charter as the department of social services is the mayoral agency charged with upholding the city responsibilities under the social services law.see nyc charter.sanchez turner dist.lexis,at,wl at.
second,the court held that the job center waiting rooms were public fora for the purposes of speech pertaining to welfare issues and that in limited public fora restrictions on speech need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.id.at,wl,at.according to the court,hra policies satisfied this requirement and were therefore constitutional.the court reasoned that hra interest is legitimate and its method for achieving that interest is reasonable and that it is not the court role to second guess the city and determine whether hra policy represents the least restrictive means for achieving hra interest.id.at,wl,at.specifically,the court held that the policy was a reasonable way to accomplish hra interest in limiting congestion and disruption in job centers and in preventing confusion on the part of claimants who might believe that hra endorsed statements made by groups.id.at,wl,at.according to the court,hra policy was viewpoint neutral because it was not an effort to suppress the speaker activity due to disagreement with the speaker point of view.id.at,wl,at internal citation and quotation omitted mrbw appeal followed.

a forum analysis 
the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny depends on the nature of the forum subject to the regulation.the supreme court has recognized three types of fora across a spectrum of constitutional protection for expressive activity.traditional public fora are places such as streets and parks which have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public questions.perry,at.quoting hague cio.speech finds its greatest protection in traditional public fora,and government may not alter their public status without completely changing the fora use,converting a public park to an office building.in public fora,time,place,and manner regulations of speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.see also travis sch,cir.restrictions will be upheld only if they are necessary to serve a compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that end.perry,at.citing carey brown,d.
next on the spectrum is the designated public forum,a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate,cornelius,at,which the state has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity,perry,at.the government does not create a designated public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional public forum for public discourse.educ.television comm forbes,d quoting cornelius,at.modification in.educ.television comm n.furthermore,the government may decide to close a designated public forum.perry,at.stating that government is not required to indefinitely retain the open character of a designated public forum.however,so long as a forum remains public,government regulation of speech within it is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public forum,lee i,at.
the limited public forum is a subset of the designated public forum.it arises where the government opens a forum but limits the expressive activity to certain kinds of speakers or to the discussion of certain subjects.here,at quoting magazine metro.transp,cir,cert.denied,d.restrictions on speech not within the type of expression allowed in a limited public forum must only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.see,fighting finest bratton,cir corrected opinion 
finally,nonpublic forum is public property not traditionally open to public expression or intentionally designated by the government as a place for such expression.general media communs.cohen,cir corrected opinion all remaining public property that is not traditional or designated public forum is nonpublic forum.restrictions on speech in a nonpublic forum need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.lee i,at.t he state may reserve a nonpublic forum for its intended purposes,communicative or otherwise,as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.perry,at.
b the distinction between limited public and nonpublic fora 
governmental intent is the touchstone of forum analysis,general media,internal quotations omitted,for determining whether property is a limited public or nonpublic forum.courts have looked to the policy and practice of the government to ascertain whether it intended to designate a place not traditionally open to assembly and debate as a public forum,cornelius,at,as well as to the nature of the property,and its compatibility with expressive activity,general media,at.see also perry mcdonald,cir stating forum analysis factors.if these indicia show that intent to create a public forum is absent,the forum is generally nonpublic of course,the fact that members of the public are permitted freely to visit a as the airport terminals held nonpublic in lee not abrogate its nonpublic status if the visitors are not permitted to express themselves freely in that forum.lee i,at.quoting greer spock,d.
also,a policy allowing some speakers to use a forum does not necessarily convert a nonpublic forum into a limited public forum.a public forum is not created when the government allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers.educ.television comm n,at.see also fighting finest,at some access to forum does not render it public.there is a 
distinction between general access,which indicates the property is a designated public forum,and selective access,which indicates the property is a nonpublic forum.on one hand,the government creates a designated public forum when it makes its property generally available to a certain class of speakers on the other hand,the government does not create a designated public forum when it does no more than reserve eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers,whose members must then,as individuals,obtain permission,to use it.for instance,the federal government did not create a designated public forum in cornelius when it reserved eligibility for participation in a fundraising drive aimed at federal employees to charitable agencies,and then made individual,judgments as to which of the eligible agencies would participate.
the cornelius distinction between general and selective access furthers first amendment interests.by recognizing the distinction,we encourage the government to open its property to some expressive activity in cases where,if faced with an choice,it might not open the property at all.that this distinction turns on governmental intent does not render it unprotective of speech.rather,it reflects the reality that,with the exception of traditional public fora,the government retains the choice of whether to designate its property as a forum for specified classes of speakers.
educ.television comm n,at.internal citations omitted.whether the access policy is selective or general is determined by reference to written policies and actual practice.see lebron passenger amtrak,cir noting that a court must examine the actual gleaned from the consistent practice with regard to various determine whether a state intended to create a designated public forum internal quotation omitted.
the distinction between selective and general access policies applies with equal force when the limited public forum is open only to the discussion of certain topics rather than to certain speakers.on the one hand,when a forum is generally available for the discussion of certain topics,it is a limited public forum.on the other hand,when the government reserves eligibility for access to particular topical discussions,but those who wish to gain entrance must individually seek permission to use the forum,it is nonpublic.for example,in determining that a military base was a nonpublic forum,the supreme court noted that 
t he fact that other civilian speakers and entertainers had sometimes been invited to appear at fort dix did not of itself serve to convert fort dix into a public forum the decision of the military authorities that a civilian lecture on drug abuse,a religious service by a visiting preacher at the base chapel,or a rock musical concert would be supportive of the military mission of fort dix surely did not leave the authorities powerless thereafter to prevent any civilian from entering fort dix to speak on any subject whatever.
greer,at.eligibility for entrance to express oneself in fort dix was therefore validly limited to those discussing topics that furthered the military mission of the base,and then to only those potential speakers who were allowed access on an individual basis.
as indicia of governmental intent,the purposes of access limits can also be important in determining a forum status.where the government goal in granting selective access to a forum is to further its own internal objectives,a forum is more likely to be nonpublic 
finally,the physical characteristics of a forum can help determine whether it is public or nonpublic.courts will not infer that the government intended to create a public forum when the nature of the property is inconsistent with expressive activity.cornelius,at.the location of a forum may be evidence of its status separation from acknowledged public areas may serve to indicate that the separated property is a special enclave,subject to greater restriction.lee i,at.citing united states grace,d.
c application 
applying the forum analysis outlined above,the job center waiting rooms must be categorized as nonpublic forums.hra unequivocally evidenced its intent to render them nonpublic by enforcing a written policy reserving them for official business or for activities specifically authorized by the administrator.neither the official business nor the specifically authorized language evidences an intent to open the job centers to the public.nor is there evidence that the specifically authorized clause has ever been used to allow anyone without official business to enter the job centers or their waiting rooms for expressive purposes and that clause has now been excised by the district court order,an act from which hra has not appealed 
like waiting rooms in airport terminals,medical clinics or doctor offices,or motor vehicle departments,welfare office waiting rooms generate casual conversations.such conversations may involve family matters,the weather,sports,politics,or many other subjects,including welfare policies or particular welfare applications.while this expressive activity may take place,it is entirely incidental to the purpose of the welfare office waiting rooms,namely to ensure an orderly flow of claimants to the interviewers.
welfare advocacy organizations had access to welfare office waiting rooms between and approximately.however,this prior access does not undermine our conclusion because it was compelled by our decisions in albany welfare and brezenoff and was not a policy freely chosen by hra.those cases essentially held that the waiting rooms were limited public fora open to discussion of welfare issues by virtue of the fact that welfare recipients waited in them.no consideration was given to government intent.as discussed above,the supreme court has since then held in cornelius and lee i that governmental intent and access policy,as well as the purpose of a forum,are the touchstones for differentiating between designated public fora and nonpublic fora.in the aftermath of those decisions,hra began to enforce its code of conduct disallowing all but official business and thereby demonstrated a clear intent to convert the waiting rooms from limited public fora into nonpublic fora.moreover,even if the to policy had been freely chosen by hra,government may,without offending the first amendment,reverse policies regarding access to government property.see perry,at.government is not required to indefinitely retain the open character of a limited public forum 
it is true of course that if anyone able to perform services relevant to hra official business were free to enter hra job center waiting rooms,the centers might lose their nonpublic status.as noted above,where a forum is generally available to certain speakers or for the discussion of certain issues,it is a designated public forum.educ.television comm n,at.therefore,if the job center waiting rooms were generally open to all those capable of transacting official all managed care providers,whether or not under contract with centers would likely be limited public fora.however,the language of the executive order,as modified by the district court,states that u se of hra premises shall be limited to the transaction of official business,hra executive order,and hra makes admission determinations on an individualized basis.for example,managed care providers can not walk in off the street to offer medical services in job center waiting rooms,although providing such services is technically a part of hra business.rather,hra investigates the providers,determines whether they are suitable and have insurance,and,if so,enters into service contracts with them before admitting them to job centers.a similar process is followed with regard to homelessness intervention service providers,the census bureau,and the health department.
claimants and their statutorily permitted retained advocates are freely admitted because they too are there on official business.neither claimants nor their retained advocates engage in expressive activity in the job center waiting rooms except for random,incidental discussions that are part of the kind of casual conversations that occur in waiting rooms generally.rather,the purpose of admitting claimants and their retained advocates to the waiting rooms is to ensure an orderly flow of claimants to interviewers.indeed,retained advocates may not solicit other clients in the waiting rooms,and supervisors periodically survey those in the waiting rooms to ensure that everyone is a claimant,someone legitimately accompanying a claimant,or otherwise on official business.
d reasonableness and viewpoint neutrality 
having determined that the job center waiting rooms are nonpublic fora,we must now address whether exclusion of advocacy groups in general and mrbw in particular is reasonable and viewpoint neutral,as required for upholding restrictions on expression in nonpublic fora.cornelius,at.we conclude that it is.
reasonableness 
restrictions on speech in nonpublic fora must be reasonable in light of the purpose of the forum and reflect a legitimate government concern.perry mcdonald,at internal citation omitted alteration in original.see also cornelius,at.reasonableness of restriction must be assessed in light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.a restriction will be reasonable if it is wholly consistent with the government legitimate interest in preserving the property for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.perry,at.internal citations and quotations omitted.however,such a restriction need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.lee i,at.internal quotations omitted.
with regard to property used to carry out specific governmental functions,government may reasonably reserve expression on that property exclusively for those conducting official business.w hen government property is not dedicated to open communication the government further use to those who participate in the forum official business.perry,at.what expression takes place in job center waiting rooms is in the nature of casual conversation or in the course of official business.to reiterate,claimants and their advocates,who are present on official business,do not engage in expressive activity other than incidental casual conversations in waiting rooms.authorized managed care organizations and the health department provide information to claimants,the census bureau takes surveys,and homelessness intervention contractors speak with claimants.
of course,the definition of official business used must also be reasonable.see id.at.in that regard,hra reasonably determined that unlimited access for mrbw representatives would not be for the purpose of transacting official business.hra is required to provide,and provides,the services mrbw purports to and help filling out forms,for hra has not contracted with mrbw to provide those services.
it was also reasonable for hra to exclude mrbw and other advocacy organizations,independent of the official business policy.the government can reasonably exclude expression that undermines the purpose served by a nonpublic forum.the most common reason for such an exclusion is that the excluded expression is distracting or disruptive.lee i,at.exclusion based on disruptive effect reasonable.see also united states kokinda,d plurality opinion same.disruption can detract from a nonpublic forum use for its intended purpose.for example,solicitation of money is disruptive in an airport terminal because it detracts from the purpose of allowing passengers to move as efficiently as possible.such solicitation requires action by those who would respond the individual solicited must decide whether or not to contribute which itself might involve reading the solicitor literature or hearing his pitch,and then,having decided to do so,reach for a wallet,search it for money,write a check,or produce a credit card.lee i,at.quoting kokinda,at.
avoiding other negative effects of expression can also justify limits on speech in nonpublic fora.for example,in cornelius,the court noted that it was harder to convince people to donate to a fundraising drive when advocacy groups were included because there was less universal agreement that such groups were worthwhile charities because raising funds was a primary purpose of the drive,excluding controversial advocacy groups was reasonable.at.in lee i,where a purpose of the airport terminals was to transport passengers safely and efficiently to their flights or ground transportation,it was reasonable to exclude solicitors because unsavory solicitors may take advantage of the most vulnerable.at.
also,where allowing private expression in a nonpublic forum may imply government endorsement of that expression,limiting or excluding speakers may be reasonable.cornelius,at.avoiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum kokinda,at.
the reasonableness of prohibiting expression by a certain speaker can not be determined by reference only to the effect caused by that speaker alone.lee i,at.whether a restriction is reasonable must be determined with reference to the disruption or distraction that would result if all groups like the group at issue sought access.where restrictions on expression are aimed at crowd control,for example,o bviously,there would be a much larger threat to the state interest in crowd control if all other religious,nonreligious,and noncommercial organizations could likewise move freely.lee i,at.quoting heffron int l soc.for krishna consciousness,d.
finally,although the government may restrict expression in a nonpublic forum without ensuring the presence of adequate alternative outlets,the existence of such outlets may be considered in determining whether particular restrictions are reasonable.perry,at.the reasonableness
