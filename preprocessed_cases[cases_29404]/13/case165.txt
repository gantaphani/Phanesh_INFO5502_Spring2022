respondent gary woods and his employer,billy joe mccombs,participated in an tax shelter designed to generate large paper losses that they could use to reduce their taxable income.to that end,they purchased from deutsche bank a series of spreads.each spread was a package consisting of a long option,which woods and mccombs purchased from deutsche bank and for which they paid a premium,and a short option,which woods and mccombs sold to deutsche bank and for which they received a premium.because the premium paid for the long option was largely offset by the premium received for the short option,the net cost of the package to woods and mccombs was substantially less than the cost of the long option alone.woods and mccombs contributed the spreads,along with cash,to two partnerships,which used the cash to purchase stock and currency.when calculating their basis in the partnership interests,woods and mccombs considered only the long component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly offsetting short component.as a result,when the partnerships assets were disposed of for modest gains,woods and mccombs claimed huge losses.they had contributed roughly million in cash and spreads to the partnerships,they claimed losses of more than million.
the internal revenue service sent each partnership a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment,disregarding the partnerships for tax purposes and disallowing the related losses.it concluded that the partnerships were formed for the purpose of tax avoidance and thus lacked economic substance,they were shams.as there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes,the irs determined that the partners could not claim a basis for their partnership interests greater than zero and that any resulting tax underpayments would be subject to a penalty for gross valuation misstatements.woods sought judicial review.the district court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams but that the penalty did not apply.the fifth circuit affirmed.
the district court had jurisdiction to determine whether the partnerships lack of economic substance could justify imposing a penalty on the partners.
a because a partnership does not pay federal income taxes,its taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.under the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra,the irs initiates tax proceedings at the partnership level to adjust partnership items,items relevant to the partnership as a whole,a.once the adjustments become final,the irs may undertake further proceedings at the partner level to make any resulting computational adjustments in the tax liability of the individual partners.a,c,a.
b under tefra framework,a court in a proceeding has jurisdiction to determine the applicability of any penalty which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.f.a determination that a partnership lacks economic substance is such an adjustment.tefra authorizes courts in proceedings to provisionally determine the applicability of any penalty that could result from an adjustment to a partnership item,even though imposing the penalty requires a subsequent,proceeding.in that later proceeding,each partner may raise any reasons why the penalty may not be imposed on him specifically.applying those principles here,the district court had jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the penalty.
the penalty applies in this case.
a a penalty applies to the portion of any underpayment that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement,which exists where the value of any property or the adjusted basis of any property claimed on any return of tax exceeds by a specified percentage the amount determined to be the correct amount of such valuation or adjusted basis as the case may be.a,b,e a,h.the penalty plain language makes it applicable here.once the partnerships were deemed not to exist for tax purposes,no partner could legitimately claim a basis in his partnership interest greater than zero.any underpayment resulting from use of a basis would therefore be attributable to the partner having claimed an adjusted basis in the partnerships that exceeded the correct amount of such adjusted basis.e a.and under the relevant treasury regulation,when an asset adjusted basis is zero,a valuation misstatement is automatically deemed gross.
b woods contrary arguments are unpersuasive.the penalty encompasses misstatements that rest on legal as well as factual errors,so it is applicable to misstatements that rest on the use of a sham partnership.and the partnerships lack of economic substance is not an independent ground separate from the misstatement of basis in this case.

i.the facts 
this case involves an tax shelter,variants of which were marketed to taxpayers in the late.tax shelters of this type sought to generate large paper losses that a taxpayer could use to reduce taxable income.they did so by attempting to give the an artificially high basis in a partnership interest,which enabled the taxpayer to claim a significant tax loss upon disposition of the interest.see irs notice,cum.bull.describing tax shelters.
the particular tax shelter at issue in this case was developed by the law firm jenkens gilchrist and marketed by the accounting firm ernst young under the name current options bring reward alternatives,or cobra.respondent gary woods and his employer,billy joe mccombs,agreed to participate in cobra to reduce their tax liability for.to that end,in november they created two general partnerships one,tesoro drive partners,to produce ordinary losses,and the other,sa tesoro investment partners,to produce capital losses.
over the next two months,acting through their respective wholly owned,limited liability companies,woods and mccombs executed a series of transactions.first,they purchased from deutsche bank five spreads.each of these option spreads was a package consisting of a long option,which entitled woods and mccombs to receive a sum of money from deutsche bank if a certain currency exchange rate exceeded a certain figure on a certain date,and a short option,which entitled deutsche bank to receive a sum of money from woods and mccombs if the exchange rate for the same currency on the same date exceeded a certain figure so close to the figure triggering the long option that both were likely to be triggered or not to be triggered on the fated date.because the premium paid to deutsche bank for purchase of the long option was largely offset by the premium received from deutsche bank for sale of the short option,the net cost of the package to woods and mccombs was substantially less than the cost of the long option alone.specifically,the premiums paid for all five of the spreads long options totaled million,and the premiums received for the five spreads short options totaled million,so the net cost of the spreads was just million.woods and mccombs contributed the spreads to the partnerships along with about in cash.the partnerships used the cash to purchase assets canadian dollars for the partnership that sought to produce ordinary losses,and sun microsystems stock for the partnership that sought to produce capital losses.the partnerships then terminated the five option spreads in exchange for a payment from deutsche bank.
as the tax year drew to a close,woods and mccombs transferred their interests in the partnerships to two s corporations.one corporation,tesoro drive investors,received both partners interests in tesoro drive partners the other corporation,sa tesoro drive investors,received both partners interests in sa tesoro investment partners.since this left each partnership with only a single partner the relevant s corporation,the partnerships were liquidated by operation of law,and their assets the canadian dollars and sun microsystems stock,plus the remaining cash were deemed distributed to the corporations.the corporations then sold those assets for modest gains of about on the canadian dollars and about on the stock.but instead of gains,the corporations reported huge losses an ordinary loss of more than million on the sale of the canadian dollars and a capital loss of more than million on the sale of the stock.the losses were allocated between woods and mccombs as the corporations.
the reason the corporations were able to claim such vast losses the alchemy at the heart of an tax shelter lay in how woods and mccombs calculated the tax basis of their interests in the partnerships.tax basis is the amount used as the cost of an asset when computing how much its owner gained or lost for tax purposes when disposing of it.see downes goodman,dictionary of finance and investment terms.a partner tax basis in a partnership interest called outside basis to distinguish it from inside basis,the partnership basis in its own assets is tied to the value of any assets the partner contributed to acquire the interest.see.collectively,woods and mccombs contributed roughly million in option spreads and cash to acquire their interests in the two partnerships.but for purposes of computing outside basis,woods and mccombs considered only the long component of the spreads and disregarded the nearly short component on the theory that it was too contingent to count.brief for respondent.as a result,they claimed a total adjusted outside basis of more than million.since the basis of property distributed to a partner by a liquidating partnership is equal to the adjusted basis of the partner interest in the partnership reduced by any cash distributed with the property,see b,the inflated outside basis figure was carried over to the s corporations basis in the canadian dollars and the stock,enabling the corporations to report enormous losses when those assets were sold.at the end of the day,woods and mccombs million investment generated tax losses that,if treated as valid,could have shielded more than million of income from taxation.
the internal revenue service,however,did not treat the losses as valid.instead,after auditing the partnerships tax returns,it issued to each partnership a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment,or fpaa.in the fpaas,the irs determined that the partnerships had been formed and availed of solely for purposes of tax avoidance by artificially overstating basis in the partnership interests of the purported partners.app.because the partnerships had no business purpose other than tax avoidance,the irs said,they lacked economic substance or,put more starkly,they were sham s so the irs would disregard them for tax purposes and disallow the related losses.ibid.and because there were no valid partnerships for tax purposes,the irs determined that the partners had not established adjusted bases in their respective partnership interests in an amount greater than zero,at,so that any resulting tax underpayments would be subject to a penalty for gross valuation misstatements,see b.
woods,as the partner for both partnerships,sought judicial review of the fpaas pursuant to a.the district court held that the partnerships were properly disregarded as shams but that the penalty did not apply.the appealed the decision on the penalty to the court of appeals for the fifth circuit.while the appeal was pending,the fifth circuit held in a similar case that,under circuit precedent,the penalty does not apply when the relevant transaction is disregarded for lacking economic substance.bemont,llc united states.in a concurrence joined by the other members of the panel,judge prado acknowledged that this rule was binding circuit law but suggested that it was mistaken.see,at.a different panel subsequently affirmed the district court decision in this case in a opinion,declaring the issue well settled.fed.appx.per curiam,reh g denied 
we granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split over whether the penalty is applicable in these circumstances.see bemont,supra,at prado,concurring recognizing opposition to the fifth circuit rule.because two courts of appeals have held that district courts lacked jurisdiction to consider the penalty in similar circumstances,see jade trading,llc united states,ca fed.petaluma fx partners,llc commissioner,cadc,we ordered briefing on that question as well.
ii.jurisdiction 
we begin with a brief explanation of the statutory scheme for dealing with tax matters.a partnership does not pay federal income taxes instead,its taxable income and losses pass through to the partners.a partnership must report its tax items on an information return,a,and the partners must report their distributive shares of the partnership tax items on their own individual returns.
before,the irs had no way of correcting errors on a partnership return in a single,unified proceeding.instead,tax matters pertaining to all the members of a partnership were dealt with just like tax matters pertaining only to a single taxpayer through deficiency proceedings at the level.see generally ed.and supp.v.deficiency proceedings require the irs to issue a separate notice of deficiency to each taxpayer,a ed,who can file a petition in the tax court disputing the alleged deficiency before paying it,a.having to use deficiency proceedings for tax matters led to proceedings and the potential for inconsistent treatment of partners in the same partnership.congress addressed those difficulties by enacting the tax treatment of partnership items act of,as title iv of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra.stat.codified as amended at ed.and supp.v.
under tefra,tax matters are addressed in two stages.first,the irs must initiate proceedings at the partnership level to adjust partnership items,those relevant to the partnership as a whole,a.it must issue an fpaa notifying the partners of any adjustments to partnership items,a,and the partners may seek judicial review of those adjustments,a b.once the adjustments to partnership items have become final,the irs may undertake further proceedings at the partner level to make any resulting computational adjustments in the tax liability of the individual partners.a.most computational adjustments may be directly assessed against the partners,bypassing deficiency proceedings and permitting the partners to challenge the assessments only in refund actions.a,c.deficiency proceedings are still required,however,for certain adjustments that are attributable to affected items,that is,items that are affected by but are not themselves partnership items.a a i,a.
under the tefra framework,a court in a proceeding like this one has jurisdiction to determine not just partnership items,but also the applicability of any penalty which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.f.as both sides agree,a determination that a partnership lacks economic substance is an adjustment to a partnership item.thus,the jurisdictional question here boils down to whether the penalty relates to the determination that the partnerships woods and mccombs created were shams.
the government theory of why the penalty was triggered is based on a straightforward relationship between the determination and the penalty.in the government view,there can be no outside basis in a sham partnership which,for tax purposes,does not exist,so any partner who underpaid his individual taxes by declaring an outside basis greater than zero committed a valuation misstatement.in other words,the penalty flows logically and inevitably from the determination.
woods,however,argues that because outside basis is not a partnership item,but an affected item,a penalty that would rest on a misstat
