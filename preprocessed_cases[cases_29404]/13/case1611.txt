the appellants,members of local of the exposition worker union,filed their complaint in december,and this action was consolidated with a similar one brought by the present and former members of the truck drivers local union of the international brotherhood of teamsters the appellees are the new york convention center operating corporation nyccoc and robert boyle,president and chief executive officer of the nyccoc the complaint challenges various changes in hiring practices,which resulted in plaintiffs not being hired for work at the javits center,and various statements made by the appellees in the context of publicized allegations of corruption and mob infiltration at the center.
the appellants appeal from the district court dismissal of their claim that the nyccoc deprived them of a property interest in their employment at the javits center without due process.they also appeal the grant of summary judgment on their claim that statements made by the appellees to the media deprived them of a liberty interest in other employment without due process.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
because we are reviewing defendants motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment,we recount and review the facts as alleged in the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs in a manner appropriate to the nature of the motion.mcpherson coombe,cir walker city of new york,cir,cert.denied,d.
the nyccoc is a public benefit corporation created by statute for the purpose of operating and maintaining the javits large convention hall in new york city established in.pub.auth.law mckinney.the nyccoc enters into license agreements with various exhibitors entitling them to use the space at the javits center for trade shows and other events.prior to the reorganization giving rise to the present litigation,the show managers of the tenant exhibitors usually hired general contractors to help move freight,erect and dismantle exhibit booths and lay rugs.most of these contractors were members of the new york trade show contractors association tsa,which has had collective bargaining agreements with three different unions.the contractors typically selected employees from one of these unions for the various jobs maintained by the exhibitors.the appellants are members of one of these unions,local of the exposition worker union.
in november,the nyccoc entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with a number of unions,including local.the mou provided,inter alia,that the work on exhibitions at the javits center would be performed by workers represented by certain specified local.the appellants argue that this memorandum created a protectable property interest by requiring a comprehensive system for employment of the plaintiffs pursuant to collective bargaining agreement sic and by providing that the memorandum would not be modified or terminated without consent of the parties appellants br.at.
local had collective bargaining agreements with various trade show contractors.these agreements provided that local would be the exclusive representative of employees who installed exhibits and booths for javits center trade shows and exhibitions.
the tsa arranged to provide much of the labor for the trade shows at the javits center.but in early,concerns arose with accompanying publicity about corruption at the javits center and its workers ties to organized crime.at that time,governor pataki and boyle made public statements indicating their intention to clean up the reported corruption.in june,the nyccoc decided to hire workers directly instead of through the contractors,and to enter into its own collective bargaining agreements with unions certified to represent the new workers.the new labor force would be divided into two bargaining units and would consist of members of two unions,one representing employees handling freight and the other for booth erectors.boyle also distributed a letter indicating his intent to formally disavow and terminate the mou.
local agreed to the reduction in the number of unions involved from three to two,after seeking and receiving assurances that its own members would be rehired.in this recognition agreement,the nyccoc pledged to recognize two unions as the collective bargaining representatives for the new workforce upon a showing that the majority of hired or rehired employees were members of those unions.on june,the appellants filled out applications for employment at the javits center.but the nyccoc instead hired hundreds of new workers,not members of any of the unions that had previously been utilized for the javits center workforce.only to of the approximately members of local who applied were rehired.in july,local requested arbitration pursuant to the recognition agreement with the nyccoc that it had signed agreeing to the reduction in the number of bargaining units.the union alleged that the nyccoc had discriminated against it in the hiring and certification processes,in violation of the recognition agreement.after the requested arbitration was concluded without a requirement that the nyccoc recognize or hire any of its members,appellants brought the instant suit.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim,taking all factual allegations as true and construing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.conley gibson,d lee bankers trust,cir.dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.lee,at internal citations omitted.the appellants first argue that the district court incorrectly applied this procedure,and erroneously found that the plaintiffs had no protectable property interest in their employment they had not,therefore,been deprived of property without due process of law.
to survive a motion to dismiss,a due process claim under section must allege the deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest.see christ gatzonis contractor,new york city sch.constr,cir affirming dismissal of a section claim because plaintiff had no constitutionally protected property interest.in order to have an interest protectable under the constitution,a person must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.bd.of regents of state coll.roth,d.an abstract need,desire or unilateral expectation is not enough.see id.employees at will have no protectable property interest in their continued employment.see goetz windsor cent.sch,cir see also roth,at.stating that plaintiff had no claim of entitlement to reemployment where he was appointed to faculty position for term only.but a protectable property interest may arise in a situation where an employee may be removed only for cause.see arnett kennedy,d plurality.indeed,in this circuit,a person may possess a protected interest in public employment if contractual or statutory provisions guarantee continued employment absent sufficient cause for discharge or he can prove a de facto system of tenure.see goetz,at.
the appellants argue that their property interest was rooted in the mou,employment procedures and collective bargaining agreements,as well as in statements by the appellees promising future employment.under the mou,the appellants argue that the nyccoc agreed to use the labor of the specified unions,including local,by obligating contractors to employ them.but,as the district court noted,the mou does not guarantee employment it simply outlines certain understandings between the unions and the nyccoc.the appellants find their entitlement in the nyccoc agreement that the memorandum of understanding shall apply so long as the undersigned unions represent employees working at the center and
