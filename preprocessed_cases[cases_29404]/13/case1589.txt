harold wit and donald ebel appeal from the dismissal of their complaint by judge hellerstein for failure to state a claim.see.b.the complaint alleged a violation of appellants rights to equal protection of the laws under the federal and state constitutions.we affirm,holding that the new york state election law election law does not impermissibly deny citizens who have homes in multiple communities the right to vote in multiple local elections.
background 
each appellant has maintained a home in new york city for over forty years.each pays income and property taxes in the city,owns real property there,is listed in the new york city telephone directory,uses his new york city residence for personal financial statements,and spends a considerable portion of every year living there.in addition,each appellant meets other and register to vote in new york city.
appellants were once registered to vote in new york city and voted there.however,for some years,both have also lived,and have been registered voters in,the towns of east hampton and southampton,respectively.appellants are currently barred from voting in new york city because they are also registered to vote in the hamptons.each alleges that,if they were not registered to vote in the hamptons,they would be allowed to register in new york city.
under new york law,one must be a resident of an electoral district to register as a voter in that district.residence is defined in the election law as that place where a person maintains a fixed,permanent and principal home and to which he,wherever temporarily located,always intends to return.law emphasis added.section of the election law provides that any person who r egisters or attempts to register as an elector in more than one election district for the same election is guilty of a felony.law.other sections of the election law also impose felony penalties on those who knowingly attempt to register when not qualified and on those who attempt to vote in an election more than once.law.
in june,appellants filed the present complaint challenging the constitutionality of the pertinent provisions of the election law and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief permitting them to register to vote in local elections in new york city while maintaining the right to vote in the hamptons.the complaint claims that the election law,as written and enforced,violates the equal protection clause because it denies appellants the right to register to vote in elections in new york city even though,save for new york defining residency for voting purposes as the location of one single permanent home that place they possess the same indicia of residency as those residents of new york city who are deemed qualified to register to vote.the complaint also asserts that the election law infringes on appellants federal constitutional rights to due process of law and intrastate travel as well as their rights under various provisions of the new york constitution.
in july,appellees moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.after oral argument,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.on appeal,appellants renew their federal equal protection claim 
discussion 
we review a dismissal under rule b de novo,with all inferences drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.moore painewebber,cir.
where a statute invidiously discriminates in granting the right to vote,we apply strict scrutiny in our review.see kramer union free school dist,d.however,although voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure i t does not follow that the right to vote in any manner and the right to associate for political purposes through the ballot are absolute.burdick takushi,d citation omitted.as the court elaborated in burdick 
election laws will invariably impose some burden upon individual voters.each provision of a code,whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters,the selection and eligibility of candidates,or the voting process itself,inevitably least to some individual right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.consequently,to subject every voting regulation to strict scrutiny and to require that the regulation be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest would tie the hands of states seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently.
id.citation omitted quoting anderson celebrezze,d.the burdick court went on to state that where voting rights are subjected to severe restrictions,regulations must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance,id.at.quoting norman reed,d,but that where a state election law provision imposes only reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the rights of voters,the state important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.id.quoting anderson,at.for reasons discussed infra,we uphold the provisions of the election law challenged by appellants because those provisions impose only reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions and advance important state regulatory interests.
an equal protection claim must be based on impermissible differential treatment.harlen assocs.vill.of mineola,cir.the differential treatment alleged here is that,because appellants are otherwise qualified under new york law to register in both new york city and the hamptons,the provision of the election law prohibiting them from registering in two places treats them differently than the qualified voters in the election district in which they are not registered.to put it another way,appellants are not allowed to vote in new york city solely because they are registered in the hamptons.were they to give up their registration in the hamptons,they could register in new york city.therefore,they argue,they are being treated differently than others qualified to vote in the city.because there is in their view no permissible governmental interest justifying this differential treatment,they conclude that they have been denied their rights under the equal protection clause.we disagree.
the election law states that no person may vote unless a resident of the particular election district.law.residence and the legal concept of domicile are synonymous under the election law.see hosley curry,stating that the terms resident and inhabitant are properly understood to be synonymous with domicile citing palla suffolk county bd.of elections,auerbach rettaliata,cir stating that under new york law the definition of residence for voting purposes is intended to approximate the test for domicile see also mcgrath kristensen.residence sometimes equals domicile,as in voting restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.d under the local law of many states,the county or other political subdivision where a person is domiciled is the place where he may vote.
new york rule against voting in two election districts reflects a critical aspect of the concept of domicile.the principal usefulness of the concept is that it resolves jurisdictional issues in circumstances in which exclusivity is desirable or necessary,such as probating an estate.although one may be legally domiciled in different places for different legal purposes,a person is deemed to have only a single domicile for the particular legal purpose for which the concept is then being used.see,restatement second of conflict of laws every person has a domicil at all times and,at least for the same purpose,no person has more than one domicil at a time.california texas,d noting,in estate tax context,the general state law principle that it is possible to have only one domicile rosario ins,cir noting in immigration law context that a person may have only one domicile in re estate of newcomb,stating that a person may have only one domicile.
for purposes of voting in new york,domicile is defined as that place where one has the fixed,permanent,and principal home to which,even with extended periods of living elsewhere,one intends to return.law the term residence shall be deemed to mean that place where a person maintains a fixed,permanent and principal home and to which he,wherever temporarily loc
