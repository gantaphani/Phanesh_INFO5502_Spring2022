joseph smith,superintendent of the shawangunk correctional facility in wallkill,new york,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york stein,conditionally granting the application for a writ of habeas corpus of jose martin taveras taveras or petitioner and ordering that taveras be released from custody unless the new york appellate division reinstated his direct appeal within days,taveras met the relevant indigency counsel to represent him.see taveras smith,d.the question we consider on appeal is whether it was contrary to or an unreasonable application of settled supreme court precedent for the new york state court to dismiss the appeal of a returned fugitive without first appointing that under new york law and practice such dismissals are discretionary.
background 
criminal proceedings 
on november,taveras was charged in new york state court with murder and other crimes.after approximately sixteen months in custody pending trial,taveras was released on his own recognizance.
on may,taveras failed to appear at his scheduled trial.a bench warrant failed to return him to state custody,and,after conducting a parker hearing the trial court ordered taveras to be tried in absentia.on june,tried and convicted of two counts of murder new york penal law,both intentional and felony murder,and one count each of attempted murder new york penal law,criminal possession of a weapon new york penal law,and bribery new york penal law.on june,taveras was sentenced,still in absentia,to two concurrent prison terms of years to life imprisonment for the murder convictions,a concurrent term of to years imprisonment for the attempted murder conviction,a concurrent term of one year of imprisonment for the weapons possession conviction,and a consecutive term of to years imprisonment for the bribery conviction 
immediately following trial,unbeknownst to taveras,his trial attorney filed a notice of appeal on his behalf.no action was taken on this appeal until,eight years later,taveras was returned to state court on the bench warrant.his sentence was executed on december.
ii.procedural appellate history 
on february,still unaware of the notice of appeal filed for his murder convictions,taveras moved the new york appellate division,first department,for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal.the state opposed this motion,and on june,the appellate division summarily denied taveras request.two years later,on june,taveras again moved the first department seeking to reargue the issue of an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal.he contended that counsel had improperly failed to file one on his behalf and that he had not been informed of the proceedings against him.the state opposed this motion as well,and on july,the first department denied it summarily.
on september,taveras,pro se,filed a petition with the district court for the southern district of new york for habeas corpus.in it he alleged that he had been denied his fifth and fourteenth amendment rights to appeal his conviction in state court.in the course of preparing its response,the state discovered a copy of the notice of appeal filed on taveras behalf immediately after his trial.see taveras portuondo,wl at june.the district attorney informed the first department of this filing,and the first department recalendared taveras motions and treated them as applications for leave to prosecute the direct appeal as a poor person and for assignment of counsel.the district attorney opposed these reconfigured motions and for dismissal of the appeal.the state argued that taveras had abandoned his right to appeal by absconding,and that even if the notice of appeal were valid,the first department could have sua sponte dismissed his appeal ten years earlier by its own rules.in addition,the state argued that as a motion for poor person relief,the filing did not comply with new york state rules requiring a detailed,notarized affidavit.petitioner did not respond to this.
on march,the federal district court had acted on taveras pro se appellate division issued an order reconsidering all its prior decisions concerning taveras.the court stated,in full 
an order of this court having been entered on june,denying defendant motion for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal from the judgment of the supreme court,new york county,rendered on or about june,and for leave to prosecute the appeal as a poor person,assignment of counsel,and related relief,
and a further order of this court having been entered on july,denying defendant motion for of this court order entered on june,
now,upon the court own motion,reconsideration of the aforesaid orders of this court is granted and,upon reconsideration,defendant motion,insofar as it seeks leave to file a late notice of appeal,is denied as unnecessary,a timely notice of appeal from the aforesaid judgment having been duly filed by trial counsel on defendant behalf and,insofar as it seeks leave to prosecute the appeal as a poor person and for assignment of counsel,the motion is denied.
and respondent having moved for an order dismissing the appeal,
now,upon reading and filing the papers with respect to the motion,and due deliberation having been had thereon,
it is ordered that the motion is granted and the appeal is dismissed.
both parties assume that the appellate division dismissal of taveras appeal was based on new york fugitive disentitlement doctrine,because the district attorney only other,still available,argument for dismissal concerning untimeliness was expressly rejected by the court.we accept the parties assumption,but this,of will be apparent not mean that in deciding to apply the doctrine the new york court did not consider,at least to some extent,the possible merits of taveras appeal 
following the appellate division dismissal,the district court ruled on taveras september habeas petition.see taveras,wl.adopting the report and recommendation of magistrate judge ronald ellis,judge stein rejected taveras claim that he had been denied the right to appeal.see id.at.the court found,however,that taveras claim that he had been denied appellate counsel was unexhausted.accordingly,the district court dismissed that claim without prejudice to its renewal in order to permit taveras to present the issue to the new york court of appeals.see id.at.
taveras sought leave from the new york court of appeals to file an untimely appeal from the appellate division order denying him counsel.on september,the court of appeals granted taveras permission to file an untimely application.that,now timely,application was denied on december,thereby putatively exhausting taveras claim.
taveras renewed his habeas claim in federal court on december.magistrate judge gorenstein appointed counsel.on march,with leave of the court,taveras renewed his claim that the denial of his application for counsel and for a free trial transcript by the appellate division had violated his due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment.
after further briefing,magistrate judge gorenstein issued a thorough and thoughtful report in which he recommended granting taveras habeas petition.see taveras,d at.he considered and rejected respondent renewed exhaustion challenge to taveras petition id.at.he also rejected the state contention that the appellate division properly denied taveras request for counsel because taveras had failed to file an affidavit attesting to indigence.on the merits,magistrate judge gorenstein found that taveras had been denied his right to right that was deemed unaffected by the fact that the threshold issue in taveras appeal was whether the fugitive disentitlement doctrine should apply.see id.at.
adopting magistrate judge gorenstein reasoning and recommendation,the district court conditionally granted taveras application for a writ of habeas corpus and ordered that petitioner be released from custody unless his direct appeal to the appellate division was reinstated within days of the entry of judgment.district judge stein supplemented the magistrate judge report in order to especially take account of a newly discovered document that further supports the conclusion reached by judge gorenstein.he described that contrary to the state assertions,on june,taveras had in fact filed the requisite evidence of indigence,an affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis and for assignment of counsel,which had been inadvertently mishandled by the courts 
before our court,respondent challenges only the district court holding on the merits of taveras right to counsel.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to grant habeas corpus relief de novo and review findings of fact for clear error.jackson edwards,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,
a n application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.both parties agree that taveras claim that he was denied his right to appellate counsel was adjudicated on the merits in state court,though the district court expressed some hesitation as to whether this was in fact the case.as the district court ultimately did,we will apply the aedpa deferential standard.we do so without further consideration of the issue,because the outcome in the present case would be the same under either the aedpa or the standard of review.messiah duncan,cir declining to decide whether the petitioner claims were adjudicated on the merits in state court,because his claims would fail even under the standard more favorable to his claims.
ii.taveras right to counsel 
the question before us is whether clearly established supreme court law prohibited the new york appellate division from dismissing taveras appeal on fugitive disentitlement grounds without appointing counsel and without providing a copy of any transcripts available and necessary for pursuing that appeal.
a.the right to counsel 
our criminal justice system stands on the bedrock principle that there can be no equal justice where the kind of an appeal a man enjoys depends on the amount of money he has.douglas california,d quoting griffin illinois.for that reason,the supreme court held in douglas,and reaffirmed and expanded in evitts lucey,that the fourteenth amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel on his first appeal if the state has provided such an appeal as of right.see douglas,at.evitts lucey,d holding that the fourteenth amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the effective assistance of counsel on such an appeal.
the right to a criminal appeal itself is not included in the sixth amendment,and is rather a creature of statute.see martinez court of appeal of,fourth appellate,d.but,once state law grants a first appeal as of right,the fourteenth amendment provides twofold protection to the right to counsel.first,the due process clause forbids states from establishing a system of appeals as of right but then refusing to provide each defendant with a fair opportunity for adjudication,and second,the equal protection clause prohibits states from distinguish ing between poor and rich in the provision of a meaningful appeal.see evitts,at.see also halbert michigan,d.both protections emphasize the central aim of our entire judicial people charged with crime must,so far as the law is concerned,stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every american court.griffin,at.quoting chambers florida.
as the court has consistently recognized,the import of the broad principles expressed in douglas is not confined to the precise facts of that case a appeal as of right the rationale of douglas also extends to any case in which an indigent defendant seeks appellate review that involves some consideration of the merits,and involves claims that have not yet been presented by appellate counsel and passed upon by an appellate court,douglas,at,thereby leaving indigent defendants generally ill equipped to represent themselves,halbert.at.see ross moffitt,d declining to extend the rationale of douglas to indigent defendants seeking to pursue a discretionary appeal because neither of douglas considerations were met in such a case halbert.at,analyzing the two considerations that were key to our decision in douglas,and concluding that states must appoint counsel for indigent defendants convicted on pleas of guilty or nolo contendere who pursue a appeal in state court,even though the allowance of such an appeal is discretionary under state law.thus,even if a case does not align perfectly with the facts of douglas,it is clear that the fourteenth amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel on an appeal when both of douglas conditions are met and of course,the court willingness to reaffirm and expand on the longstanding principles expressed in douglas means that the central holding of the fourteenth amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel on his first appeal if the state has provided such an appeal as of a fortiori fully established.
the right to appellate counsel for the indigent also includes the right to free copies of transcripts or another means of enabling effective representation.see griffin,at.accord halbert.at ross,at.draper washington,d.trial transcripts or other equivalent reports are among those instruments needed to vindicate legal rights,of which the supreme court has stated differences in access to the instruments needed to vindicate legal rights,when based upon the financial situation of the defendant,are repugnant to the constitution.fullan comm r of corr.of,cir quoting roberts lavallee,d per curiam.
all this is crystal clear.
fugitive disentitlement doctrine 
the validity of state rules that permit or mandate the dismissal of appeals filed by fugitives is equally clear.in estelle dorrough,d per curiam,for example,after discussing the history of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine,the supreme court rejected a returned fugitive equal protection challenge to a texas statute that provided for automatic dismissal of pending appeals brought by fugitive felons who did not voluntarily surrender within ten days of escape see id.at.see also molinaro new jersey,d per curiam finding n o persuasive reason to adjudicate the merits of a criminal case after a convicted defendant escape.in upholding the validity of the texas statute,the estelle court,moreover,spoke approvingly of texas purposes in enacting the rule,namely to discourage escape,to encourage voluntary surrenders,and to promote efficiency in the state appeals process.see estelle,at.
similarly,and more recently,the court rejected a due process challenge to missouri fugitive disentitlement doctrine.see goeke branch,d per curiam.in doing so,the goeke court rejected any characterization of evitts that read due process to require state courts to provide for appellate review where the appellant has not satisfied reasonable preconditions on her right to appeal as a result of her own conduct.id.at.the court then expressly framed obedience to state custody as a procedural precondition of appellate rights,noting that evitts turned on the right to effective assistance of counsel,but left intact the states ability to conduct appeals in accordance with reasonable procedural rules.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also estelle,at.stating that t he right of appeal from a judgment of conviction in both the federal and state systems is almost uniformly conditioned,for example,upon the filing of a notice of appeal within a prescribed time limit,and other procedural requirements that promote orderly judicial procedure 
c.the new york court decision 
we take for granted,therefore,that new york has a full right to establish fugitive disentitlement doctrines.for,as stated by the fifth circuit,clearly established federal law does not provide a constitutional right to reinstatement of an appeal aba
