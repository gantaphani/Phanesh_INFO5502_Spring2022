damach,damach appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut peter dorsey,judge dismissing a claim brought under seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from enforcement of a amendment to the hartford municipal zoning code prohibiting adult cabaret in the zoning district.the district court never addressed damach allegation that the zoning amendment violates its first amendment rights by banning adult cabaret because the district court concluded that adult cabaret had never been a permitted use under the hartford municipal zoning code.because we find the record insufficiently developed to support conclusive findings regarding whether adult cabaret was permitted in hartford prior to the zoning amendment,we remand for development of the record to enable the district court to provide a more detailed analysis of the matter.
background 
on july,the city of hartford hartford enacted a zoning ordinance which eventually was codified as section of the hartford municipal code hmc.the amendment allowed adult establishments in three zoning districts,and.at the same time,another ordinance was enacted,eventually codified under section,which defined an adult establishment as an adult bookstore,adult or adult motion picture theater,or any combination thereof.in,hartford enacted another zoning amendment which refined the definition of adult establishments by specifying that it also included adult cabaret.adult cabaret,in turn,consisted of a nightclub,bar,restaurant,or similar establishment that regularly features live performances that are characterized by the exposure of specific anatomical areas or by specified sexual activities.
meanwhile,in,damach leased a property in the zoning district,and in november of that year applied for a caf√© liquor permit.although initially denied,litigation in the connecticut state courts secured damach its liquor license.damach began presenting adult entertainment at its establishment,and in,hartford issued a notice of violation of its zoning ordinances.damach appealed the notice first to the hartford zoning board of appeals and then to the connecticut superior court.damach lost its appeal in state court and subsequently sought relief in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alleging infringement of its first amendment rights.
while adult theaters and speech in general may be regulated,such regulation may only occur where the speech to be regulated has secondary effects and it is the secondary effects that the regulation is actually targeting.see city of renton playtime theatres,d.damach argued that the amendment prohibiting adult cabaret violated first amendment jurisprudence because it failed to establish,in its factual findings,that the zoning amendment purpose was not primarily to restrict free speech.the district court,however,found that adult entertainment had always been prohibited in the area where damach hoped to open its adult cabaret because zoning ordinance states no building or structure shall be used,designed or arranged for any purpose other than the uses permitted in the district in which the building or structure or land is located thus,reasoned the district court in dismissing damach complaint,the alleged failure to create a record to sustain,factually,adverse secondary effects of the permitted use can not be a basis for finding the prohibition violative of the first amendment when the violation,if there be one,is not the result of the amendments but another enactment.
damach filed a motion for reconsideration and for a new trial.the district court granted the motion for reconsideration but denied damach a new trial.damach argued that the district court prior decision had ignored a stipulation of fact entered into by both parties to the suit which stated that in,adult cabaret was a permitted use in the zoning district.the district court noted that the stipulation pertained to a matter of law which was properly within the court province,and thus held that its prior decision would stand.
on october,damach appealed to this court.
discussion 
on appeal,damach argues a number of points that the district court was bound by the stipulation,that the district court was bound by the law of the case,and that the district court was bound by issue preclusion.we do not reach the merits of any of these arguments because we conclude that a remand is necessary to allow a more detailed analysis by the district court of whether adult cabaret was a permitted use in the zone prior to the amendment.
hmc states that no building or structure shall be used,designed or arranged for any purpose other than the uses permitted in the district in which the building or structure or land is located the district court relied on this provision in deciding both that damach and hartford were mistaken in believing that adult cabaret was a permitted use in the zone prior to the amendment and that any adult entertainment was permissible prior to the amendment defining adult establishments.as judge dorsey explained,until,there was no provision for adult entertainment in any zone and thus plaintiff proposed adult cabaret use,which was not listed as a permitted use,was not permitted.because damach and hartford had stipulated that prior to,adult cabaret was a permitted use in the district,they were unprepared for this turn in the district court reasoning.judge dorsey noted that although plaintiff alleges an adult cabaret was a permitted use in the district no authority is cited,nor argument made,for that being the case prior to.
judge dorsey may well be correct that adult cabaret was never permitted in the district.however,the parties to this case should have an opportunity to present any relevant authorities and offer argument about whether and when adult cabaret was permitted in the zone,and why they stipulated to their particular conclusion on this point.if,prior to,there was no provision for adult entertainment anywhere,that may have been because such a category simply did not exist.what became an adult bookstore with the amendment could well have been,prior to,simply a bookstore.what became an adult motion picture theater in was,before,simply a motion picture theater.in other words,the district court may be assuming that the category of adult establishment had always existed and that adult movie theaters,for example,were always distinguishable from other least in the eyes of the zoning code.but one would never assert that although the hmc allows motion picture theaters,it therefore does not allow motion picture theaters that specialize in showing foreign or animated films.a motion picture theater is a motion picture theater,and the fact that one theater shows films with a content easily distinguishable from the content of films shown in other theaters would not be grounds for seriously contending that,based on the difference in content,one theater was not actually a motion picture theater within the terms of the hmc.
the amendment,viewed in this light,may not have for the first time permitted adult establishments in certain districts by lifting a universal ban.rather,the amendment could have provided a way,based on content,to distinguish some bookstores and theaters from others.thus,while motion picture theaters continued to be a viable use in the district,after the amendments,motion picture theaters with adult content were now prohibited.similarly on this view,the amendment,far from being redundant,addressed a real loophole in the definition of adult establishments by extending the definition reach to include adult cabaret.the category provided a way to distinguish some kinds of nightclubs,bars and restaurants from others based on the activities occurring there.adult cabaret is defined as a nightclub,bar,restaurant,or similar establishment that regularly features live performances of an adult nature.thus,prior to the amendment,the use of an establishment for the activities henceforth understood as adult cabaret could have been permitted under the guise of the use of a place as a nightclub,bar,restaurant,or similar establishment.
in short,it is not clear that hmc on it
