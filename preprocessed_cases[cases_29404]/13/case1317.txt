glenn marcus appeals from a september,judgment of conviction and sentence of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york allyne ross,judge,sentencing defendant principally to a term of months imprisonment following conviction after a jury trial of violations of the trafficking victims protection act tvpa,and.marcus argues,inter alia,that his conviction amounted to a violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution.for the reasons set forth below,we agree.the judgment of the district court is vacated,and the case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the facts of this case are exhaustively set forth in the district court opinion.see united states marcus,d.we recite only those facts relevant to the ex post facto challenge.
at trial,the government presented evidence that in,glenn marcus,who was living in new york at the time,met jodi the complaining witness,in an online chat room devoted to an alternative sexual lifestyle,known as bondage,and masochism bdsm.marcus,with the help of two of his slaves,joanna and celia,convinced jodi to travel from her home in the midwest to joanna apartment in maryland,in order to meet marcus in person,which she did in october.during this visit,marcus whipped jodi and carved the word slave on her stomach with a knife.jodi returned to joanna apartment in maryland for a second visit in november.
after her second visit,marcus convinced jodi to move from the midwest to maryland,where she would live with joanna.jodi submitted to marcus a petition,in which she referred to herself as pooch,a name given to her by marcus,and stated,among other things,i am begging to serve you sir,completely,with no limitations if i beg you for my release,sir,please ignore these words.despite this petition,jodi testified that she believed she would be able to leave marcus if she wanted to.
jodi moved into joanna apartment in january,and marcus visited them in maryland every one to two weeks.during these visits,marcus engaged in bdsm activities with jodi and joanna,and sometimes other women.these activities included branding jodi,requiring her to seek his permission before contacting her family,whipping and choking her during intercourse,photographing her for his website,subspace,and requiring her to post diary entries describing the activities on the website.the bdsm activity,along with the punishments for disobedience,increased in severity during this time,and jodi testified that she became increasingly depressed.
at some point,marcus instructed jodi to convince her younger sister to travel to maryland,and when she refused,marcus told her that she would be severely punished.in october,marcus arrived in maryland to inflict jodi punishment.he handcuffed her to a wall and left to take a nap,informing her that he would return to inflict the punishment.jodi testified that at this point,she had a moment of clarity and decided to leave marcus.she convinced celia to help her off the wall,but joanna awakened marcus.jodi told marcus that she wanted to leave,and in response,marcus inflicted upon jodi the most severe punishment she had ever received up to this point.the incident was photographed for marcus website.jodi testified that at this point,the relationship became,as she felt completely beaten down,trapped,and full of terror.
in november,joanna informed marcus,by phone,that she wished to leave him.with jodi listening on the line,marcus threatened that he would show joanna pictures to her family and that he would harm members of her family if she were to leave him.jodi testified that,as a result of having heard this conversation,she thought that marcus would do the same to her were she to leave.
in january,marcus instructed jodi to move to new york,where she lived with rona,another one of marcus slaves.marcus instructed jodi to create a new website,called slavespace.after creating the site,jodi worked on it for approximately eight to nine hours per day,updating pictures and diary entries.marcus received all revenues,which consisted primarily of membership fees and advertising.during the time that jodi lived with rona,marcus continued to engage in violent sexual behavior with her,punishing her severely when he was unhappy with her work on the website.jodi testified that each of these incidents was,but that she was afraid to leave him.at one point,when she told marcus that she wanted to leave,he threatened to send pictures to her family and the media.
finally,in march,marcus told jodi that she would be allowed to leave him,but that she had to endure one final punishment.he drove her to the home of a woman named sherry and there inflicted severe punishment upon jodi,including banging her head against a beam in the ceiling of sherry basement,tying her hands and ankles to the beam,beating her and whipping her while she was hanging from the beam,drugging her,and having sexual intercourse with her.he photographed the incident and forced jodi to write a diary entry about the incident for his website.jodi continued to live with rona until august,when rona told marcus that she no longer wanted jodi to live with her.jodi moved into her own apartment,and her interactions with marcus became less frequent,although she remained in contact with him until.
on february,the government filed a superceding indictment,charging marcus with violating the sex trafficking statute,a and the forced labor statute,of the trafficking victims protection act tvpa i n or about and between january and october.marcus was convicted,after a jury trial,of both counts 
although the tvpa was not enacted until october,the government presented evidence at trial with respect to the entire period charged in the indictment,and the district court did not instruct the jury with respect to the date of the enactment of the statute.at the time,marcus did not object to the jury instructions on this ground,and he did not raise any argument to this effect in his motion for a judgment of acquittal under.
discussion 
marcus argues for the first time on appeal that the tvpa has been applied retroactively in his case in violation of the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution.because marcus failed to raise this argument before the district court,it is reviewed for plain error.see united states torres,cir.to establish plain error,the defendant must establish error that is plain and affects substantial rights.united states villafuerte,cir.if the error meets these initial requirements,we then must consider whether to exercise our discretion to correct it,which is appropriate only if the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the constitution provides that n o ex post facto law shall be passed.const.art.i,cl.
the supreme court has interpreted this clause as prohibiting congress from passing a law that makes an act a crime that was legal when committed makes a crime greater than it was when it was committed increases the punishment for a crime after it has been committed or deprives the accused of a legal defense that was available at the time the crime was committed.
united states harris,cir.while the ex post facto clause itself is a restraint on the legislative branch,its protections have been extended to the application of judicial precedent by the courts under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.id.at.
it is undisputed that the indictment charges marcus with violating the statute between january and october,that the government presented evidence at trial with respect to this entire time period,that the tvpa was enacted in october,and that the district court failed to instruct the jury with respect to this issue.this case,therefore,clearly implicates the ex post facto clause.however,the government argues that the sex trafficking and forced labor offenses constitute continuing offenses,and that even though the criminal conduct at issue began prior to enactment of the tvpa,it continued after enactment accordingly,no violation occurred here.it is that when a statute is concerned with a continuing offense,the ex post facto clause is not violated by application of a statute to an enterprise that began prior to,but continued after,the effective date of the statute.id.at internal quotations marks and alterations omitted.marcus argues that the sex trafficking and forced labor offenses do not constitute continuing offenses.
we need not decide whether the offenses constitute continuing offenses for ex post facto purposes because,even if they do,the convictions violate the ex post facto clause.in torres,we stated that,even in the case of a continuing offense,if it was possible for the had not been given instructions regarding the date of convict exclusively on conduct,then the conviction constitutes a violation of the ex post facto clause.at.see also united states monaco,cir a conviction for a continuing offense straddling enactment of a statute will not run afoul of the ex post facto clause unless it was possible for the jury to convict exclusively on conduct.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original harris,at because the statute is a continuing crime statute,we must determine whether it was possible for the jury to convict harris exclusively on pre enactment conduct.emphasis in original.this is true even under plain error review.see torres,at holding under plain error review that,although it was unlikely that the jury had based its findings entirely on conduct,because such a scenario was a possibility,the defendant conviction had to be vacated here,the government concedes that the jury could have found that marcus violated sections and solely by his conduct prior to their effective dates,because there was evidence before it that established all of the elements of these offenses as of that time.specifically,the government concedes that before enactment of the statute jodi moved from the midwest to maryland jodi relationship with marcus became marcus threatened joanna in jodi hearing marcus forced jodi to work on his existing website as well as create a new website and jodi moved from maryland to new york.accordingly,the application of the tvpa in such a manner constituted an ex post facto clause violation,and the conviction must be vacated under our holding in torres 
the government argues that we should not vacate the convictions because it was a remote possibility that the jury relied exclusively on conduct however,that argument is foreclosed by our decision in torres,where we held that a retrial is necessary whenever there is any possibility,no matter how unlikely,that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on conduct 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the judgment of the district court.the case is remanded to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
judge wesley and i concur with the per curiam opinion because its conclusions are compelled by the current law of this circuit.we write separately because we believe this court precedent with regard to review of ex post facto violations does not fully align with the principles inhering in the supreme court recent applications of review.
under review,an appellate court can not correct an error not raised at trial unless there is error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in its recent applications of review,the supreme court has stated that where a trial court commits an error that is plain,that error does not seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings if the error concerns an essentially uncontroverted issue.united states cotton,d johnson,at.our case law appears to conflict with this precedent because it requires a retrial whenever there is any possibility that an improperly instructed jury could have convicted a defendant based exclusively on conduct committed prior to the enactment of the relevant statute,see united states torres,cir,even where it is essentially uncontroverted that the defendant relevant conduct before and after the statute enactment was materially indistinguishable.we write to bring this issue to our court attention and to explain how this difference affects the outcome of this appeal 
in johnson,the defendant was convicted of perjury under.one element of that materiality of the defendant false unconstitutionally decided by the trial judge,rather than by the jury.see johnson,at.see also united states gaudin,d.the supreme court nevertheless affirmed the conviction,explaining that the error did not affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings because the evidence of materiality was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted.at.because johnson had no plausible argument that the false statement under oath for which she was convicted was somehow not material,the supreme court concluded there was no miscarriage of justice in not taking notice of the error.id.at.
likewise,in cotton,the defendants were convicted of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute a detectable amount of cocaine and crack cocaine.the indictment,however,failed to allege drug quantity,a fact that increased the statutory maximum penalty,rendering the defendants enhanced sentences unconstitutional.see cotton,at.see also apprendi new jersey,d a ny fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment,submitted to a jury,and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.internal quotation marks omitted.again,the supreme court held this error did not affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the proceedings because the evidence that the drug conspiracy involved at least grams of cocaine base was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted.cotton,at.see also id.surely the grand jury,having found that the conspiracy existed,would have also found that the conspiracy involved at least grams of cocaine base.the real threat to the fairness,integrity,and public reputation of judicial proceedings,the supreme court explained,would be if the defendants,despite the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that they were involved in a vast drug conspiracy,were to receive a sentence prescribed for those committing less substantial drug offenses because of an error that was never objected to at trial.id.at.
these cases embody the supreme court view that there is no miscarriage of justice in refusing to notice forfeited errors that did not affect the judgment.see johnson,at.this is true even if the errors fall within the limited class of structural errors that affect the framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.id.at.we see no reason why this principle should not apply to the context of ex post facto violations.while the ex post facto clause is certainly fundamental to our notions of justice,see marks united states,d,it is no more so than the fifth and sixth amendment rights at issue in johnson and cotton.see,duncan louisiana,d describing the right to trial by jury in serious criminal cases to be fundamental to the american scheme of justice.
thus,where there is no reasonable possibility that an error not objected to at trial had an effect on the judgment,the supreme court counsels us against exercising our discretion to notice that error.within the context of the ex post facto clause,we believe this means that where the evidence is overwhelming or essentially uncontroverted that the defendant relevant pre and conduct is materially indistinguishable,such that a reasonable jury would not have convicted the defendant based solely on conduct,a retrial is unwarranted.in other words,the defendant must meet the low threshold of offering a plausible explanation as to how relevant pre and conduct differed,thereby demonstrating a reasonable possibility that the jury might have convicted him or her based exclusively on conduct.when this
