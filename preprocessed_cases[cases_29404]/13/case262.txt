the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works berne,which took effect in,is the principal accord governing international copyright relations.berne member states agree to provide a minimum level of copyright protection and to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.of central importance in this case,article of berne requires countries to protect the works of other member states unless the works copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is claimed or the country of origin.a different system of transnational copyright protection long prevailed in this country.throughout most of the century,the only foreign authors eligible for copyright act protection were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to american authors and whose works were printed in the united states.despite article,when the united states joined berne in,it did not protect any foreign works lodged in the public domain,many of them works never protected here.in,however,the agreement on aspects of intellectual property rights mandated implementation of berne first articles,on pain of enforcement by the world trade organization.
in response,congress applied the term of protection available to works to preexisting works from berne member countries.section of the uruguay round agreements act uraa grants copyright protection to works protected in their country of origin,but lacking protection in the united states for any of three reasons the united states did not protect works from the country of origin at the time of publication the united states did not protect sound recordings fixed before or the author had not complied with certain statutory formalities.works encompassed by are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had the united states maintained copyright relations with the author country or removed formalities incompatible with berne.as a consequence of the barriers to copyright protection prior to enactment,foreign works restored to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country.to cushion the impact of their placement in protected status,provides ameliorating accommodations for parties who had exploited affected works before the uraa was enacted.
petitioners are orchestra conductors,musicians,publishers,and others who formerly enjoyed free access to works removed from the public domain.they maintain that congress,in passing,exceeded its authority under the copyright clause and transgressed first amendment limitations.the district court granted the attorney general motion for summary judgment.affirming in part,the tenth circuit agreed that congress had not offended the copyright clause,but concluded that required further first amendment inspection in light of eldred ashcroft.on remand,the district court granted summary judgment to petitioners on the first amendment claim,holding that constriction of the public domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests.the tenth circuit reversed,ruling that was narrowly tailored to fit the important government aim of protecting copyright holders interests abroad.
section does not exceed congress authority under the copyright clause.
a the text of the copyright clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain.eldred is largely dispositive of petitioners claim that the clause confinement of a copyright lifespan to a limited tim e prevents the removal of works from the public domain.in eldred,the court upheld the copyright term extension act ctea,which extended,by years,the terms of existing copyrights.the text of the copyright clause,the court observed,contains no command that a time prescription,once set,becomes forever fixed or inalterable,and the court declined to infer any such command,at.the construction petitioners tender here is similarly infirm.the terms afforded works restored by are no less limited than those the ctea lengthened.nor had the limited tim e already passed for the works at issue here many of them works formerly denied any copyright protection for a period of exclusivity must begin before it may end.petitioners also urge that the government position would allow congress to legislate perpetual copyright terms by instituting successive limited terms as prior terms expire.but as in eldred,such hypothetical misbehavior is far afield from this case.in aligning the united states with other nations bound by berne,congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a perpetual copyright regime.
b historical practice corroborates the court reading of the copyright clause to permit the protection of previously unprotected works.in the copyright act of,the first congress protected works that had been freely reproducible under state copyright laws.subsequent actions confirm that congress has not understood the copyright clause to preclude protection for existing works.several private bills restored the copyrights and patents of works and inventions previously in the public domain.congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting copyrights and patents to works and inventions that had lost protection.
c petitioners also argue that fails to promote the progress of science as contemplated by the initial words of the copyright clause.specifically,they claim that because affects only works already created,it can not meet the clause objective.the creation of new works,however,is not the sole way congress may promote science,knowledge and learning.in eldred,this court rejected a nearly identical argument,concluding that the clause does not demand that each copyright provision,examined discretely,operate to induce new works.rather the clause empowers congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that,overall,in that body judgment,will serve the ends of the clause.at.nothing in the text or history of the copyright clause,moreover,confines the progress of science exclusively to incentives for creation.historical evidence,congressional practice,and this court decisions,in fact,suggest that inducing the dissemination of existing works is an appropriate means to promote science.
d considered against this backdrop,falls comfortably within congress copyright clause authority.congress had reason to believe that a international copyright system would encourage the dissemination of existing and future works.and testimony informed congress that full compliance with berne would expand the foreign markets available to authors and invigorate protection against piracy of works abroad,thus benefitting industries stateside and inducing greater investment in the creative process.this court has no warrant to reject congress rational judgment that exemplary adherence to berne would serve the objectives of the copyright clause.
the first amendment does not inhibit the restoration authorized by.
a the pathmarking eldred decision is again instructive.there,the court held that the ctea enlargement of a copyright duration did not offend the first amendment freedom of expression guarantee.recognizing that some restriction on expression is the inherent and intended effect of every grant of copyright,the court observed that the framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit on the manner in which expressive works may be used,but also as an engine of free expression.at.the traditional contours of copyright protection,the dichotomy and the fair use defense,moreover,serve as first amendment accommodations.ibid.given the purposes and safeguards embraced by copyright law,there was no call for the heightened review sought in eldred.the court reaches the same conclusion here.section leaves undisturbed the distinction and the fair use defense.moreover,congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime.
b petitioners claim that first amendment interests of a higher order are at stake because they unlike their eldred counterparts enjoyed vested rights in works that had already entered the public domain.their contentions depend on an argument already considered and rejected,namely,that the constitution renders the public domain largely untouchable by congress.nothing in the historical record,subsequent congressional practice,or this court jurisprudence warrants exceptional first amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain.congress has several times adjusted copyright law to protect new categories of works as well as works previously in the public domain.section,moreover,does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.the question is whether users of certain foreign works must pay for their desired use of the author expression,or else limit their exploitation to fair use of those works.by fully implementing berne,congress ensured that these works,like domestic and most other foreign works,would be governed by the same legal regime.section simply placed foreign works in the position they would have occupied if the current copyright regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works berne convention or berne,which took effect in,is the principal accord governing international copyright relations.latecomer to the international copyright regime launched by berne,the united states joined the convention in.to perfect implementation of berne,and as part of our response to the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations,congress,in,gave works enjoying copyright protection abroad the same full term of protection available to works.congress did so in of the uruguay round agreements act uraa,which grants copyright protection to preexisting works of berne member countries,protected in their country of origin,but lacking protection in the united states for any of three reasons the united states did not protect works from the country of origin at the time of publication the united states did not protect sound recordings fixed before or the author had failed to comply with statutory formalities formalities congress no longer requires as prerequisites to copyright protection.
the uraa accords no protection to a foreign work after its full copyright term has expired,causing it to fall into the public domain,whether under the laws of the country of origin or of this country.works encompassed by are granted the protection they would have enjoyed had the united states maintained copyright relations with the author country or removed formalities incompatible with berne.foreign authors,however,gain no credit for the protection they lacked in years prior to enactment.they therefore enjoy fewer total years of exclusivity than do their counterparts.as a consequence of the barriers to copyright protection prior to the enactment of,foreign works restored to protection by the measure had entered the public domain in this country.to cushion the impact of their placement in protected status,congress included in ameliorating accommodations for parties who had exploited affected works before the uraa was enacted.
petitioners include orchestra conductors,musicians,and others who formerly enjoyed free access to works removed from the public domain.they maintain that the constitution copyright and patent clause,art.i,cl,and first amendment both decree the invalidity of.under those prescriptions of our highest law,petitioners assert,a work that has entered the public domain,for whatever reason,must forever remain there.
in accord with the judgment of the tenth circuit,we conclude that does not transgress constitutional limitations on congress authority.neither the copyright and patent clause nor the first amendment,we hold,makes the public domain,in any and all cases,a territory that works may never exit.
members of the berne union agree to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.berne convention,as revised at stockholm on july.nationals of a member country,as well as any author who publishes in one of berne member states,thus enjoy copyright protection in nations across the globe.each country,moreover,must afford at least the minimum level of protection specified by berne.the copyright term must span the author lifetime,plus at least additional years,whether or not the author has complied with a member state legal formalities.and,as relevant here,a work must be protected abroad unless its copyright term has expired in either the country where protection is claimed or the country of origin.
a different system of transnational copyright protection long prevailed in this country.until,foreign works were categorically excluded from copyright act protection.throughout most of the century,the only eligible foreign authors were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to authors and whose works were print ed in the united states.see act of,stat,patry,the united states and copyright law,houston,for domestic and foreign authors alike,protection hinged on compliance with notice,registration,and renewal formalities.
the united states became party to berne multilateral,copyright regime in.initially,congress adopted a minimalist approach to compliance with the convention,hereinafter bcia house report.the berne convention implementation act of bcia,stat,made only those changes to american copyright law that were clearly required under the treaty provisions,bcia house report,at.despite berne instruction that member countries including new accessions to the union protect foreign works under copyright in the country of origin,and,at,the bcia accorded no protection for any work that is in the public domain in the united states,stat.protection of future foreign works,the bcia indicated,satisfied article.see,stat.the amendments made by this act,together with the law as it exists on the date of the enactment of this act,satisfy the obligations of the united states in adhering to the berne convention congress indicated,however,that it had not definitively rejected retroactive protection for preexisting foreign works instead it had punted on this issue of berne implementation,deferring consideration until a more thorough examination of constitutional,commercial,and consumer considerations is possible.bcia house report,at,
the minimalist approach essayed by the united states did not sit well with other berne members while negotiations were ongoing over the north american free trade agreement nafta,mexican authorities complained about the united states refusal to grant protection,in accord with article,to mexican works that remained under copyright domestically.see intellectual property and international issues,hearings before the subcommittee on intellectual property and judicial administration,house committee on the judiciary,statement of ralph oman,register of copyrights the register of copyrights also reported questions from turkey,egypt,and austria.ibid.thailand and russia balked at protecting works,copyrighted here but in those countries public domains,until the united states reciprocated with respect to their authors works.uraa joint hearing statement of ira shapiro,general counsel,office of the trade representative ustr,at statement of professor shira perlmutter,at statement of jason berman,recording industry association of america riaa 
berne,however,did not provide a potent enforcement mechanism.the convention contemplates dispute resolution before the international court of justice.but it specifies no sanctions for noncompliance and allows parties,at any time,to declare themselves not bound by the convention dispute resolution provision,at.unsurprisingly,no enforcement actions were launched before.gervais,the trips agreement,and ed.although several berne union members disagreed with our interpretation of article,the ustr told congress,the berne convention did not provide a meaningful dispute resolution process.uraa joint hearing statement of shapiro.this shortcoming left congress free to adopt a minimalist approach and evade article.karp,final report,berne article study on retroactive united states copyright protection for berne and other works,arts.

congress response to the uruguay agreements put to rest any questions concerning compliance with article.section of the uraa,stat.codified at,a extended copyright to works that garnered protection in their countries of origin but had no right to exclusivity in the united states for any of three reasons lack of copyright relations between the country of origin and the united states at the time of publication lack of protection for sound recordings fixed before and failure to comply with statutory formalities,failure to provide notice of copyright status,or to register and renew a copyright.see h b c 
works that have fallen into the public domain after the expiration of a full copyright term either in the united states or the country of origin receive no further protection under.ibid copyrights restored under uraa subsist for the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted if the work never entered the public domain.a b.prospectively,restoration places foreign works on an equal footing with their counterparts assuming a foreign and domestic author died the same day,their works will enter the public domain simultaneously.see a copyrights generally expire years after the author death.restored works,however,receive no compensatory time for the period of exclusivity they would have enjoyed before enactment,had they been protected at the outset in the united states.their total term,therefore,falls short of that available to similarly situated works.
the uraa disturbance of the public domain hardly escaped congress attention.section imposed no liability for any use of foreign works occurring before restoration.in addition,anyone remained free to copy and use restored works for one year following enactment.see h a.concerns about compatibility with the fifth amendment takings clause led congress to include additional protections for reliance parties those who had,before the uraa enactment,used or acquired a foreign work then in the public domain.see h reliance parties may continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of the restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce either by filing with the copyright office within two years of restoration,or by actually notifying the reliance party.c,d a i,and b i.after that,reliance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a grace period of one year.d a ii,and b ii.finally,anyone who,before the uraa enactment,created a derivative work based on a restored work may indefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the copyright holder of reasonable compensation,to be set by a district judge if the parties can not agree.d.
in,petitioners filed this lawsuit challenging.they maintain that congress,when it passed the uraa,exceeded its authority under the copyright clause and transgressed first amendment limitations the district court granted the attorney general motion for summary judgment.golan gonzales,no.civ,wl.in rejecting petitioners copyright clause argument,the court stated that congress has historically demonstrated little compunction about removing copyrightable materials from the public domain.at.the court next declined to part from the settled rule that private censorship via copyright enforcement does not implicate first amendment concerns.at.
the court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed in part.golan gonzales.the public domain,it agreed,was not a threshold that congress was powerless to traverse in both directions.at internal quotations marks omitted.but,as the court of appeals read our decision in eldred ashcroft,required further first amendment inspection,at.the measure altered the traditional contours of copyright protection,the court said specifically,the bedrock principle that once works enter the public domain,they do not leave.ibid.quoting eldred,at.the case was remanded with an instruction to the district court to address the first amendment claim in light of the tenth circuit opinion.
on remand,the district court starting premise was uncontested section does not regulate speech on the basis of its content therefore the law would be upheld if narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.supp,quoting ward rock against racism.summary judgment was due petitioners,the court concluded,because constriction of the public domain was not justified by any of the asserted federal interests compliance with berne,securing greater protection for authors abroad,or remediation of the inequitable treatment suffered by foreign authors whose works lacked protection in the united states.supp,at.
the tenth circuit reversed.deferring to congress predictive judgments in matters relating to foreign affairs,the appellate court held that survived first amendment scrutiny.specifically,the court determined that the law was narrowly tailored to fit the important government aim of protecting copyright holders interests abroad.
we granted certiorari to consider petitioners challenge to under both the copyright clause and the first amendment,and now affirm.
we first address petitioners argument that congress lacked authority,under the copyright clause,to enact.the constitution states that congress shall have power t o promote the progress of science by securing for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings.art.i,cl.petitioners find in this grant of authority an impenetrable barrier to the extension of copyright protection to authors whose writings,for whatever reason,are in the public domain.we see no such barrier in the text of the copyright clause,historical practice,or our precedents.
the text of the copyright clause does not exclude application of copyright protection to works in the public domain.symposium,congressional power and limitations inherent in the copyright clause,colum.arts.petitioners contrary argument relies primarily on the constitution confinement of a copyright lifespan to a limited tim e.removing works from the public domain,they contend,violates the limited t imes restriction by turning a fixed and predictable period into one that can be reset or resurrected at any time,even after it expires.brief for petitioners.
our decision in eldred is largely dispositive of petitioners argument.there we addressed the question whether congress violated the copyright clause when it extended,by years,the terms of existing copyrights,at upholding copyright term extension act ctea.ruling that congress acted within constitutional bounds,we declined to infer from the text of the copyright clause the command that a time prescription,once set,becomes forever fixed or inalterable.at.the word limited,we observed,does not convey a meaning so constricted.ibid.rather,the term is best understood to mean confine d within certain bounds,restrain ed,or circumscribed.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.the construction petitioners tender closely resembles the definition rejected in eldred and is similarly infirm.
the terms afforded works restored by are no less limited than those the ctea lengthened.in light of eldred,petitioners do not here contend that the term congress has granted authors their lifetimes,plus years is unlimited.see a.nor do petitioners explain why terms of the same duration,as applied to foreign works,are not equally circumscribed and confined.see eldred,at.indeed,as earlier noted,see supra,at,the copyrights of restored foreign works typically last for fewer years than those of their domestic counterparts.
the difference,petitioners say,is that the limited time had already passed for works in the public domain.what was that limited term for foreign works once excluded from copyright protection exactly zero,petitioners respond.brief for petitioners works in question received a specific term of protection sometimes expressly set to zero at the end of that period,they entered the public domain tr.of oral arg.by refusing to provide any protection for a work,congress set s the term at zero,and thereby tell s us when the end has come we find scant sense in this argument,for surely a limited time of exclusivity must begin before it may end 
carried to its logical conclusion,petitioners persist,the government position would allow congress to institute a second limited term after the first expires,a third after that,and so on.thus,as long as congress legislated in installments,perpetual copyright terms would be achievable.as in eldred,the hypothetical legislative misbehavior petitioners posit is far afield from the case before us.see,at.in aligning the united states with other nations bound by the berne convention,and thereby according equitable treatment to once foreign authors,congress can hardly be charged with a design to move stealthily toward a regime of perpetual copyrights.
historical practice corroborates our reading of the copyright clause to permit full compliance with berne.undoubtedly,federal copyright legislation generally has not affected works in the public domain.section disturbance of that domain,petitioners argue,distin guishes their suit from eldred.in adopting the ctea,petitioners note,congress acted in accord with an unbroken congressional practice of granting term extensions,at.no comparable practice,they maintain,supports.
on occasion,however,congress has seen fit to protect works once freely available.notably,the copyright act of granted protection to many works previously in the public domain.act of may,act,stat.covering any map,chart,book,or books already printed within these united states before the act launched a uniform national system,three states provided no statutory copyright protection at all of those that did afford some protection,seven failed to protect maps eight did not cover previously published books and all ten denied protection to works that failed to comply with formalities the first congress,it thus appears,did not view the public domain as inviolate.as we have recognized,the construction placed upon the constitution by the drafters of the first copyright act of and the act of men who were contemporary with the constitution formation,many of whom were members of the convention which framed it,is of itself entitled to very great weight.lithographic sarony,
subsequent actions confirm that congress has not understood the copyright clause to preclude protection for existing works.several private bills restored the copyrights of works that previously had been in the public domain.see act of,corson act,ch,stat.act of june,helmuth act,ch,stat.act of,jones act,ch,stat.these bills were unchallenged in court.
analogous patent statutes,however,were upheld in litigation in,congress passed a private bill restoring patent protection to oliver evans flour mill.when evans sued for infringement,first chief justice marshall in the circuit court,evans jordan,cas,and then justice bushrod washington for this court,evans jordan,cranch,upheld the restored patent validity.after the patent expiration,the court said,a general right to use evans discovery was not so vested in the public as to allow the defendant to continue using the machinery,which he had constructed between the patent expiration and the bill passage,at.see also blanchard sprague,cas,cc story,i never have entertained any doubt of the constitutional authority of congress to give a patent for an invention,which was in public use and enjoyed by the community at the time of the passage of the act.
this court again upheld congress restoration of an invention to protected status in mcclurg kingsland,how.there we enforced an amendment that recognized a patent on an invention despite its prior use by the inventor employer.absent such dispensation,the employer use would have rendered the invention unpatentable,and therefore open to exploitation without the inventor leave,at.
congress has also passed generally applicable legislation granting patents and copyrights to inventions and works that had lost protection.an statute authorized a new patent for any inventor whose failure,by inadvertence,accident,or mistake,to comply with statutory formalities rendered the original patent invalid or inoperative.act of july,stat.an measure similarly allowed authors who had not timely deposited their work to receive all the rights and privileges the copyright act affords,if they made the required deposit by march.act of,ch,stat.and in and,congress authorized the president to issue proclamations granting protection to foreign works that had fallen into the public domain during world wars i and ii.see act of,ch,stat.act of,ch,stat.
pointing to dictum in graham john deere of kansas city,petitioners would have us look past this history.in graham,we stated that congress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain,or to restrict free access to materials already available.at post,at.but as we explained in eldred,this passage did not speak to the constitutional limits on congress copyright and patent authority.rather,it addressed an invention very eligibility for patent protection.at.
installing a federal copyright system and ameliorating the interruptions of global war,it is true,presented congress with extraordinary situations.yet the trips accord,leading the united states to comply in full measure with berne,was also a signal event.see supra,at eldred,at,breyer,dissenting acknowledging importance of international uniformity advanced by efforts to conform to the berne convention.given the authority we hold congress has,we will not the political choice congress made between leaving the public domain untouched and embracing berne unstintingly,at.
petitioners ultimate argument as to the copyright and patent clause concerns its initial words.congress is empowered to promote the progress of science and useful arts by enacting systems of copyright and patent protection,art.i,cl.perhaps counterintuitively for the contemporary reader,congress copyright authority is tied to the progress of science its patent authority,to the progress of the useful arts.see graham,at,and evans,at marshall.
the progress of science,petitioners acknowledge,refers broadly to the creation and spread of knowledge and learning.brief for petitioners accord post,at.they nevertheless argue that federal legislation can not serve the clause aim unless the legislation spur s the creation of new works.brief for petitioners accord post,at.because deals solely with works already created,petitioners urge,it provides no plausible incentive to create new works and is therefore invalid.reply brief 
the creation of at least one new work,however,is not the sole way congress may promote knowledge and learning.in eldred,we rejected an argument nearly identical to the one petitioners rehearse.the eldred petitioners urged that the ctea extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to promote the progress of science,because it does not stimulate the creation of new works.at.in response to this argument,we held that the copyright clause does not demand that each copyright provision,examined discretely,operate to induce new works.rather,we explained,the clause empowers congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that,overall,in that body judgment,will serve the ends of the clause.at.and those permissible ends,we held,extended beyond the creation of new works.see,at rejecting the notion that the only way to promote the progress of science is to provide incentives to create new works quoting perlmutter,participation in the international copyright system as a means to promote the progress of science and useful arts,loyola la,
even were we writing on a clean slate,petitioners argument would be unavailing.nothing in the text of the copyright clause confines the progress of science exclusively to incentives for creation.at,internal quotation marks omitted.evidence from the founding,moreover,suggests that inducing dissemination as opposed to creation was viewed as an appropriate means to promote science.see nachbar,constructing copyright mythology,green bag,the scope of copyright protection existing at the time of the framing,trained as it was on publication,not creation,is inconsistent with claims that copyright must promote creative activity in order to be valid.internal quotation marks omitted.until,in fact,congress made federal copyright contingent on publication,thereby providing incentives not primarily for creation,but for dissemination.perlmutter,supra,at.our decisions correspondingly recognize that copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.harper row,publishers,nation enterprises,emphasis added.see also eldred,at 
considered against this backdrop,falls comfortably within congress authority under the copyright clause.congress rationally could have concluded that adherence to berne promotes the diffusion of knowledge,brief for petitioners.a international copyright system would likely encourage the dissemination of existing and future works.see uraa joint hearing statement of professor perlmutter.full compliance with berne,congress had reason to believe,would expand the foreign markets available to authors and invigorate protection against piracy of works abroad,uraa joint hearing statement of berman,riaa,at,statement of smith,iipa,thereby benefitting industries stateside and inducing greater investment in the creative process.
the provision of incentives for the creation of new works is surely an essential means to advance the spread of knowledge and learning.we hold,however,that it is not the sole means congress may use t o promote the progress of science.see perlmutter,supra,at united states would lose all flexibility were the provision of incentives to create the exclusive way to promote the progress of science congress determined that adherence to berne would serve the objectives of the copyright clause.we have no warrant to reject the rational judgment congress made.
we next explain why the first amendment does not inhibit the restoration authorized by.to do so,we first recapitulate the relevant part of our pathmarking decision in eldred.the petitioners in eldred,like those here,argued that congress had violated not only the limited times prescription of the copyright clause.in addition,and independently,the eldred petitioners charged,congress had offended the first amendment freedom of expression guarantee.the ctea enlargement of a copyright duration,we held in eldred,offended neither provision.
concerning the first amendment,we recognized that some restriction on expression is the inherent and effect of every grant of copyright.noting that the copyright clause and the first amendment were adopted close in time,at,we observed that the framers regarded copyright protection not simply as a limit on the manner in which expressive works may be used.they also saw copyright as an engine of free expression by establishing a marketable right to the use of one expression,copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.ibid.quoting harper row,at internal quotation marks omitted see,at rights conferred by copyright are designed to assure contributors to the store of knowledge a fair return for their labors 
we then described the traditional contours of copyright protection,the dichotomy and the fair use defense both are recognized in our jurisprudence as first amendment accommodations.eldred,at see harper row,at first amendment protections are embodied in the copyright act distinction between copyrightable expression and uncopyrightable facts and ideas,and in the latitude for scholarship and comment safeguarded by the fair use defense.
the dichotomy is codified at b in no case does copyright protec t any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery described,explained,illustrated,or embodied in the copyrighted work.due to this distinction,every idea,theory,and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication the author expression alone gains copyright protection.eldred,at see harper row,at dichotomy strike s a definitional balance between the first amendment and the copyright act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author expression internal quotation marks omitted.
the second traditional contour,the fair use defense,is codified at t he fair use of a copyrighted work,including such use by reproduction in copies,for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.this limitation on exclusivity allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work,but also the author expression itself in certain circumstances.eldred,at see,at fair use defense affords considerable latitude for scholarship and comment,even for parody internal quotation marks omitted.
given the purposes and safeguards embraced by copyright law,see,at,we concluded in eldred that there was no call for the heightened review petitioners sought in that case we reach the same conclusion here section leaves undisturbed the distinction and the fair use defense.moreover,congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime it deferred the date from which enforcement runs,and it cushioned the impact of restoration on reliance parties who exploited foreign works denied protection before took effect.see supra,at describing c,d,and h.see also eldred,at describing supplemental allowances and exemp tions available to certain users to mitigate the ctea impact.
petitioners attempt to distinguish their challenge from the one turned away in eldred.first amendment interests of a higher order are at stake here,petitioners say,because they unlike their counterparts in eldred enjoyed vested rights in works that had already entered the public domain.the limited rights they retain under copyright law safeguards are,in their view,no substitute for the unlimited use they enjoyed before enactment.nor,petitioners urge,does unprecedented foray into the public domain possess the historical pedigree that supported the term extension at issue in eldred.brief for petitioners.
however spun,these contentions depend on an argument we considered and rejected above,namely,that the constitution renders the public domain largely by congress.petitioners here attempt to achieve under the banner of the first amendment what they could not win under the copyright clause on their view of the copyright clause,the public domain is inviolable as they read the first amendment,the public domain is policed through heightened judicial scrutiny of congress means and ends.as we have already shown,see supra,at,the text of the copyright clause and the historical record scarcely establish that once a work enters the public domain,congress can not permit anyone not even the creator to copyright it,at.and nothing in the historical record,congressional practice,or our own jurisprudence warrants exceptional first amendment solicitude for copyrighted works that were once in the public domain neither this challenge nor that raised in eldred,we stress,allege congress transgressed a applicable first amendment prohibition we are not faced,for example,with copyright protection that hinges on the author viewpoint.
the tenth circuit initial opinion determined that petitioners marshaled a stronger first amendment challenge than did their predecessors in eldred,who never possessed unfettered access to any of the works at issue.at.see also,at o nce the works at issue became free for anyone to copy,petitioners had vested first amendment interests in the expressions,thus interference with petitioners rights is subject to first amendment scrutiny.as petitioners put it in this court,congress impermissibly revoked their right to exploit foreign works that belonged to them once the works were in the public domain.brief for petitioners.
to copyright lawyers,the vested rights formulation might sound exactly backwards rights typically vest at the outset of copyright protection,in an author or rightholder.see,a copyright in a work protected vests initially in the author once the term of protection ends,the works do not revest in any rightholder.instead,the works simply lapse into the public domain.see,berne,at this convention shall apply to all works which have not yet fallen into the public domain anyone has free access to the public domain,but no one,after the copyright term has expired,acquires ownership rights in the works.
congress recurrently adjusts copyright law to protect categories of works once outside the law compass.for example,congress broke new ground when it extended copyright protection to foreign works in,act of,stat.to dramatic works in,act of,stat.to photographs and photographic negatives in,act of,stat.to motion pictures in,act of,stat.to fixed sound recordings in,act of,stat.and to architectural works in,architectural works copyright protection act,stat.and on several occasions,as recounted above,congress protected works previously in the public domain,hence freely usable by the public.see supra,at.if congress could grant protection to these works without hazarding heightened first amendment scrutiny,then what free speech principle disarms it from protecting works prematurely cast into the public domain for reasons antithetical to the berne convention 
section,we add,does not impose a blanket prohibition on public access.petitioners protest that fair use and the dichotomy are plainly inadequate to protect the speech and expression rights that section took from petitioners,or the public that is,the unrestricted right to perform,copy,teach and distribute the entire work,for any reason.brief for petitioners.playing a few bars of a shostakovich symphony,petitioners observe,is no substitute for performing the entire work.at 
but congress has not put petitioners in this bind.the question here,as in eldred,is whether users must pay for their desired use of the author expression,or else limit their exploitation to fair use of that work.prokofiev peter and the wolf could once be performed free of charge after the right to perform it must be obtained in the marketplace.this is the same marketplace,of course,that exists for the music of prokofiev contemporaries works of copland and bernstein,for example,that enjoy copyright protection,but nevertheless appear regularly in the programs of concertgoers.
before we joined berne,domestic works and some foreign works were protected under statutes and bilateral international agreements,while other foreign works were available at an artificially low because cost.by fully implementing berne,congress ensured that most works,whether foreign or domestic,would be governed by the same legal regime.the phenomenon to which congress responded is not new distortions of the same order occurred with greater frequency and to the detriment of both foreign and domestic authors when,before,foreign works were excluded entirely from copyright protection.see kampelman,the united states and international copyright,am.int l,american readers were less inclined to read the novels of cooper or hawthorne for a dollar when they could buy a novel of scott or dickens for a quarter.section continued the trend toward a harmonized copyright regime by placing foreign works in the position they would have occupied if the current regime had been in effect when those works were created and first published.authors once deprived of protection are spared the continuing effects of that initial deprivation gives them nothing more than the benefit of their labors during whatever time remains before the normal copyright term expires 
unlike petitioners,the dissent makes much of the orphan works problem.see post,at.we readily acknowledge the difficulties users of copyrightable materials may face in identifying or locating copyright owners.see generally copyright office,report on orphan works.but as the dissent concedes,see post,at,this difficulty is hardly peculiar to works restored under.it similarly afflicts,for instance,libraries that attempt to catalogue books.see post,at.see also brief for american library association et as amici curiae section exacerbated,but did not create,the problem of orphan works copyright office,supra,at tracing problem to congress elimination of formalities,commencing with the copyright act 
nor is this a matter appropriate for judicial,as opposed to legislative,resolution.authors guild google,supp,sdny rejecting proposed google books class settlement because,inter alia,the establishment of a mechanism for exploiting unclaimed books is a matter more suited for congress than this court citing eldred,at.indeed,the host of policy and logistical questions identified by the dissent speak for themselves.post,at.despite longstanding efforts,see authors guild,supp,at quoting statement of marybeth peters,congress has not yet passed ameliorative legislation of the sort enacted by other berne members,see,canada copyright act,authorizing copyright board to license use of orphan works by persons unable,after making reasonable efforts,to locate the copyright owner.heretofore,no one has suggested that the issue should be addressed through our implementation of berne,rather than through overarching legislation of the sort proposed in congress and cited by the dissent.see post,at copyright office,legal issues in mass digitization discussing recent legislative efforts.our unstinting adherence to berne may add impetus to calls for the enactment of such legislation.but resistance to berne prescriptions surely is not a necessary or proper response to the pervasive question,what should congress do about orphan works.
congress determined that interests were best served by our full participation in the dominant system of international copyright protection.those interests include ensuring exemplary compliance with our international obligations,securing greater protection for authors abroad,and remedying unequal treatment of foreign authors.the judgment expresses lies well within the ken of the political branches.it is our obligation,of course,to determine whether the action congress took,wise or not,encounters any constitutional shoal.for the reasons stated,we are satisfied it does not.the judgment of the court of appeals for the tenth circuit is therefore 
justice kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

in order t o promote the progress of science by which term the founders meant learning or knowledge the constitution copyright clause grants congress the power to secur e for limited times to authors the exclusive right to their writings.art.i,cl.this exclusive right allows its holder to charge a fee to those who wish to use a copyrighted work,and the ability to charge that fee encourages the production of new material.in this sense,a copyright is,in macaulay words,a tax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers a bounty designed to encourage new production.as the court said in eldred,t he economic philosophy behind the copyright c lause is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.eldred ashcroft,quoting mazer stein.see macaulay,speeches on copyright miller ed.walterscheid,the nature of the intellectual property clause a study in historical perspective hereinafter walterscheid.
the statute before us,however,does not encourage anyone to produce a single new work.by definition,it bestows monetary rewards only on owners of old works works that have already been created and already are in the american public domain.at the same time,the statute inhibits the dissemination of those works,foreign works published abroad after,of which there are many millions,including films,works of art,innumerable photographs,and,of course,books books that in the absence of the statute would assume their rightful places in databases,spreading knowledge throughout the world.see infra,at.in my view,the copyright clause does not authorize congress to enact this statute.and i consequently dissent.
the possibility of eliciting new production is,and always has been,an essential precondition for american copyright protection.the constitution words,exclusive right,limited times,progress of science,viewed through the lens of history underscore the legal significance of what the court in eldred referred to as the economic philosophy behind the copyright clause.at,brackets omitted.that philosophy understands copyright grants of limited monopoly privileges to authors as private benefits that are conferred for a public reason to elicit new creation.
yet,as the founders recognized,monopoly is a sword.on the one hand,it can encourage production of new works.in the absence of copyright protection,anyone might freely copy the products of an author creative labor,appropriating the benefits without incurring the nonrepeatable costs of creation,thereby deterring authors from exerting themselves in the first place.on the other hand,copyright tends to restrict the dissemination and use of works once produced either because the absence of competition translates directly into higher consumer prices or because the need to secure copying permission sometimes imposes administrative costs that make it difficult for potential users of a copyrighted work to find its owner and strike a bargain.see landes posner,the economic structure of intellectual property law.consequently,the original british copyright statute,the constitution framers,and our case law all have recognized copyright resulting and necessary call for balance.
at the time the framers wrote the constitution,they were well aware of britain copyright statute,the statute of anne,anne,ch,and they were aware of the legal struggles that produced it.that statute sought in part to control,and to limit,preexisting monopolies that had emerged in the book trade as a result of the crown having previously granted special privileges to royal favorites.the crown,for example,had chartered the stationers company,permitting it to regulate and to censor works on the government behalf.the stationers had thereby acquired control over the disposition of copies of published works,from which emerged the stationers copyright a right conferred on company members,not authors,that was deemed to exist in perpetuity.see patterson,copyright in historical perspective,hereinafter patterson walterscheid,the untold story of the first copyright suit under the statute of anne in,berkeley tech.
to prevent the continuation of the booksellers monopoly and to encourage authors to write new books,parliament enacted the statute of anne.it bore the title an act for the encouragement of learning,by vesting the copies of printed books in the authors or purchasers of such copies,during the times therein mentioned.and it granted authors not publishers and their assignees the sole right and liberty of printing their works for limited periods of time in order to encourage them to compose and write useful books.anne,ch,emphasis added.as one historian has put it,t he central plank of the act was a cultural quid pro quo.to encourage learned men to compose and write useful books the state would provide a guaranteed,if temporally limited,right to print and reprint those works.deazley,the myth of copyright at common law,camb.at first,in their attempts to minimize their losses,the booksellers argued that authors had a perpetual copyright in their works deriving from their natural rights as creators.but the house of lords ultimately held in donaldson beckett,eng,that the statute of anne had transformed any such perpetual copyright into a copyright of a limited term designed to serve the public interest.patterson,deazley,supra,at.
many early colonial copyright statutes,patterned after the statute of anne,also stated that copyright objective was to encourage authors to produce new works and thereby improve learning.see copyright office,copyright enactments,bulletin,statutes of connecticut,new jersey,pennsylvania,south carolina,georgia,and new york walterscheid bracha,the adventures of the statute of anne in the land of unlimited possibilities the life of a legal transplant,berkeley tech.
at least,that was the predominant view expressed to,or by,the founders.patterson.thomas jefferson,for example,initially expressed great uncertainty as to whether the constitution should authorize the grant of copyrights and patents at all,writing that the benefit even of limited monopolies is too doubtful to warrant anything other than their suppression.letter from thomas jefferson to james madison july,in papers of thomas jefferson,boyd ed.james madison also thought that monopolies are justly classed among the greatest nu i sances in government.letter from james madison to thomas jefferson,in,at,boyd ed.but he argued that in certain cases such as copyright,monopolies should be granted with caution,and guarded with strictness agst abuse to serve as compensation for a benefit actually gained to the community which the owner might otherwise withhold from public use.perpetuities.corporations.ecclesiastical endowments.in madison,writings rakove ed.emphasis added.jefferson eventually came to agree with madison,supporting a limited conferral of monopoly rights but only as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility.letter from thomas jefferson to isaac mcpherson,in papers of thomas jefferson,at,looney ed.emphasis added.
this utilitarian view of copyrights and patents,embraced by jefferson and madison,stands in contrast to the natural rights view underlying much of continental european copyright law a view that the english booksellers promoted in an effort to limit their losses following the enactment of the statute of anne and that in part motivated the enactment of some of the colonial statutes.patterson.premised on the idea that an author or inventor has an inherent right to the fruits of his labor,it mythically stems from a legendary statement of king diarmed to every cow her calf,and accordingly to every book its copy.birrell,seven lectures on the law and history of copyright in books.that view,though perhaps reflected in the court opinion,ante,at,runs contrary to the more utilitarian views that influenced the writing of our own constitution copyright clause.see ricketson,the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works,the first french copyright laws placed authors rights on a more elevated basis than the act of anne had done,on the understanding that they were simply according formal recognition to what was already inherent in the very nature of things stewart,international copyright and neighbouring rights ed.describing the european system of droit.
this utilitarian understanding of the copyright clause has long been reflected in the court case law.in mazer,for example,the court refers to copyright as embodying the view that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.at emphasis added.in twentieth century music aiken,the court says that underlying copyright is the understanding that c reative work is to be encouraged and rewarded,but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature,music,and the other arts.at emphasis added.and in sony of universal city studios,the court,speaking of both copyrights and patents,points out that the monopoly privileges that congress may authorize are not primarily designed to provide a special private benefit.rather,the limited grant is a means by which an important public purpose may be achieved.it is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors by the provision of a special reward.at emphasis added see also,graham john deere of kansas city,the constitutional command to promote the progress of science is the standard expressed in the constitution and it may not be ignored fox film doyal,the sole interest of the united states lie s in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors 
congress has expressed similar views in congressional reports on copyright legislation.thus,for example,an house report states 
the object to be attained and the reason for the constitutional grant of power are imbedded in the grant itself.they are to promote the progress of science and the useful arts.the clause says nothing about any desire or purpose to secure to the author or inventor his natural right to his property.
similarly,the congressional authors of the landmark copyright act wrote 
the constitution provides that congress shall have the power to grant copyrights n ot primarily for the benefit of the author,but because the policy is believed to be for the benefit of the great body of people,in that it will stimulate writing and invention,to give some bonus to authors and inventors.
and they went on to say 
congress must consider two questions first,how much will the legislation stimulate the producer and so benefit the public and,second,how much will the monopoly granted be detrimental to the public the granting of such exclusive rights,under the proper terms and conditions,confers a benefit upon the public that outweighs the evils of the temporary.ibid.
the upshot is that text,history,and precedent demonstrate that the copyright clause places great value on the power of copyright to elicit new production.congress in particular cases may determine that copyright ability to do so outweighs any concomitant high prices,administrative costs,and restrictions on dissemination.and when it does so,we must respect its judgment.see eldred,at.but does the clause empower congress to enact a statute that withdraws works from the public domain,brings about higher prices and costs,and in doing so seriously restricts dissemination,particularly to those who need it for scholarly,educational,or cultural purposes all without providing any additional incentive for the production of new material that is the question before us.and,as i have said,i believe the answer is no.congress in this statute has exceeded what are,under any plausible reading of the copyright clause,its permissible limits.
the act before us says that it restores american copyright to a set of works,which,for the most part,did not previously enjoy american copyright protection.these works had fallen into america public domain,but as of the restoration date,they had not yet fallen into the public domain of the foreign country where they originated.
the statute covers works originating almost anywhere outside the united states.see h setting out eligibility criteria copyright office,circular international copyright relations of the united states.the relevant set of works consists primarily of works originating abroad that did not obtain,or at some point lost,american copyright protection because the author failed to comply with applicable american copyright formalities such as notice or renewal,or the nation in which they were first published then lacked copyright relations with the united states,or they are sound recordings fixed before february.h c.a work must also satisfy other technical requirements it must have had a rightholder who was a national or resident of an eligible country on the day it was created and it can not have been published in the united states within days of its first publication.h d.the act grants these works a copyright that expires at the time it would have expired had the author obtained a full american copyright term starting from the date on which the work was first published in the foreign country.a b.
the act mainly applies to works first published abroad between and.it does not apply significantly to earlier works because any work published before would have fallen into the public domain before had it received a full american copyright term,while works published between and obtained a restored copyright that expired before the sonny bono copyright term extension act,and so could have lasted two years at most.see tit.i,stat.extending the copyright term of works still under copyright in to years b extending the copyright term of works still under copyright in to years.it has less impact on more recent works because in the united states became a berne member,abolished the copyright notice requirement,and thenceforth provided prospective copyright protection throughout the berne union.see schechter thomas,intellectual property the law of copyrights,patents and trademarks,stat.codified as amended at.
despite these temporal limitations,the act covers vast numbers of works.the first category includes works published in countries that had copyright relations with the united states during this time period,such as most of western europe and latin america,australia,and japan,see circular,supra,at,whose authors did not satisfy american copyright formalities,perhaps because the author,who may not have sought an american copyright,published the book abroad without proper american notice,or perhaps because the author obtained a valid american copyright but failed to renew it.
the second category works that entered the public domain due to a lack of copyright relations includes,among others,all works published in russia and other countries of the former soviet union before may when the joined the universal copyright convention ucc,all works published in the people republic of china before march when bilateral copyright relations between the people republic and the united states were first established,all south korean works published before october when south korea joined the ucc,and all egyptian and turkish works published before march when the united states joined berne.see,at,and,nn.
the third category covers all sound recordings from eligible foreign countries published after february.the practical significance of federal copyright restoration to this category of works is less clear,since these works received,and continued to receive,copyright protection under state law.see c.
apparently there are no precise figures about the number of works the act affects,but in the of copyrights,marybeth peters,thought that they probably number in the millions.the year in review accomplishments and objectives of the copyright office,ford.intellectual property media entertainment.
the provision before us takes works from the public domain,at least as of january.see h a setting restoration dates.it then restricts the dissemination of those works in two ways.
first,restored copyright holders can now charge fees for works that consumers previously used for free.the price of a score of shostakovich preludes and fugues,for example,has risen by a multiple of seven.brief for conductors guild et as amici curiae.and,as the court recognizes,an orchestra that once could perform peter and the wolf free of charge will now have to buy the right to perform it in the marketplace.ante,at.but for the case of certain derivative works,d,the restored copyright holder,like other copyright holders,can charge what the market will bear.if a school orchestra or other nonprofit organization can not afford the new charges,so be it.they will have to do without aggravating the already serious problem of cultural education in the united states.see brief for conductors guild et as amici curiae,describing the inability of many orchestras to pay for the rental of sheet music covered by restored copyright s 
second,and at least as important,the statute creates administrative costs,such as the costs of determining whether a work is the subject of a restored copyright,searching for a restored copyright holder,and negotiating a fee.congress has tried to ease the administrative burden of contacting copyright holders and negotiating prices for those whom the statute calls reliance part ies,namely those who previously had used such works when they were freely available in the public domain.h.but congress has done nothing to ease the administrative burden of securing permission from copyright owners that is placed upon those who want to use a work that they did not previously use,and this is a particular problem when it comes to orphan works older and more obscure works with minimal commercial value that have copyright owners who are difficult or impossible to track down.unusually high administrative costs threaten to limit severely the distribution and use of those works works which,despite their characteristic lack of economic value,can prove culturally invaluable.
there are millions of such works.for example,according to european union figures,there are million orphan books in the european union of the total number of books there,orphan films in european film archives,and million orphan photographs in united kingdom museums.vuopala,assessment of the orphan works issue and costs for rights clearance,online at all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file.how is a university,a film collector,a musician,a database compiler,or a scholar now to obtain permission to use any such lesser known foreign work previously in the american public domain consider the questions that any such individual,group,or institution usually must answer is the work eligible for restoration under the statute if so,who now holds the copyright the author an heir a publisher an association a cousin whom must we contact what is the address suppose no one answers how do we conduct a negotiation 
to find answers to these,and similar questions,costs money.the cost to the university of michigan and the institute of museum and library services,for example,to determine the copyright status of books contained in the hathitrust digital library that were published in the united states from to will exceed million.brief for american library et as amici curiae.
it is consequently not surprising to learn that the los angeles public library has been unable to make its collection of mexican folk music publicly available because of problems locating copyright owners,that a jewish cultural organization has abandoned similar efforts to make available jewish cultural music and other materials,or that film preservers,museums,universities,scholars,database compilers,and others report that the administrative costs associated with trying to locate foreign copyright owners have forced them to curtail their cultural,scholarly,or other efforts.see,comments of the library copyright alliance in response to the copyright office inquiry on orphan works,online at comments of creative commons and save the music in response to the copyright office inquiry on orphan works,online at http general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt intellectual property provisions,joint hearing before the subcommittee on intellectual property and judicial administration of the house committee on the judiciary and the subcommittee on patents,copyrights and trademarks of the senate committee on the judiciary,hereinafter joint hearing statement of larry urbanski,chairman of the fairness in copyright coalition and president of moviecraft,brief for american library et as amici curiae brief for creative commons as amicus curiae brief for project petrucci,llc,as amicus curiae.
these high administrative costs can prove counterproductive in another way.they will tempt some potential users to steal or pirate works rather than do without.and piracy often begets piracy,breeding the destructive habit of taking copyrighted works without paying for them,even where payment is possible.such habits ignore the critical role copyright plays in the creation of new works,while reflecting a false belief that new creation appears by magic without thought or hope of compensation.
i recognize that ordinary copyright protection also comes accompanied with royalty charges and administrative costs.but here the restrictions work special harm.for one thing,the foreign location of restored works means higher than ordinary administrative costs.for another,the statute technical requirements make it very difficult to establish whether a work has had its copyright restored by the statute.gard,in the trenches with an evaluation of the parties arguments in golan holder as it heads to the supreme court,vand.en banc,describing difficulties encountered in compiling the information necessary to create an online tool to determine whether the statute applies in any given case.
worst of all,restored copyright protection removes material from the public domain.in doing so,it reverses the payment expectations of those who used,or intended to use,works that they thought belonged to them.were congress to act similarly with respect to property rights,the problem would be obvious.this statute analogously restricts,and thereby diminishes,americans preexisting freedom to use formerly public domain material in their expressive activities.
thus,while the majority correctly observes that the harms of copyright normally present problems appropriate for legislation to resolve,ante,at,the question is whether the copyright clause permits congress seriously to exacerbate such a problem by taking works out of the public domain without a countervailing benefit.this question is appropriate for judicial resolution.indeed,unlike eldred where the court had to decide a complicated question when is a copyright term too long here an easily administrable standard is available a standard that would require works that have already fallen into the public domain to stay there.
the several,just mentioned features of the present statute are important,for they distinguish it from other copyright laws.by removing material from the public domain,the statute,in literal terms,abridges a preexisting freedom to speak.in practical terms,members of the public might well have decided what to say,as well as when and how to say it,in part by reviewing with a view to repeating,expression that they reasonably believed was,or would be,freely available.given these speech implications,it is not surprising that congress has long sought to protect public domain material when revising the copyright laws.see infra,at listing instances.and this court has assumed the particular importance of public domain material in roughly analogous circumstances.see graham,at congress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain kewanee oil bicron,trade secret protection is not incompatible with policy that matter once in the public domain must remain in the public domain cox broadcasting cohn,first amendment prohibits sanctioning press for publishing material disclosed in public court documents see also dastar twentieth century fox film,the right to copy once a copyright has expired passes to the public internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,whereas copyright laws tend to benefit those whose identities are not yet known the writer who has not yet written a book,the musician who has not yet composed a song,when a copyright law is primarily backward looking the risk is greater that congress is trying to help known beneficiaries at the expense of badly organized unknown users who find it difficult to argue and present their case to congress.in eldred,i thought this problem was severe.see generally,at dissenting opinion.and in light of the fact that congress,with one minor exception,heard testimony only from the representatives of existing copyright holders,who hoped that passage of the statute would enable them to benefit from reciprocal treatment of american authors abroad,infra,at,i can not say that even here the problem,while much diminished,was nonexistent.
i agree with the majority that,in doing so,this statute does not discriminate among speakers based on their viewpoints or subject matter.ante,at.but such considerations do not exhaust potential first amendment problems.sorrell ims health,slip,at finding first amendment problem in statute that prohibits drug manufacturers from using publicly available information in their marketing efforts in part because it disfavor ed specific speakers turner broadcasting system,fcc,regulations that discriminate among media,or among different speakers within a single medium,often present serious first amendment concerns 
taken together,these harms,restricting use of previously available material reversing payment expectations rewarding at the public expense at least show the presence of a first amendment interest.and that is enough.for present purposes,i need not decide whether the harms to that interest show a violation of the first amendment.i need only point to the importance of interpreting the constitution as a single document a document that we should not read as setting the copyright clause and the first amendment at.nor need i advocate the application here of strict or specially heightened review.i need only find that the first amendment interest is important enough to require courts to scrutinize with some care the reasons claimed to justify the act in order to determine whether they constitute reasonable justifications for the serious harms,including harms,which the act seems likely to impose.
this statute does not serve copyright traditional public ends,namely the creation of monetary awards that motivate the creative activity of authors,sony,at,encourag e individual effort,mazer,at,and thereby serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature,music,and the other arts,twentieth century music,at.the statute grants its restored copyright s only to works already produced.it provides no monetary incentive to produce anything new.unlike other american copyright statutes from the time of the founders onwards,including the statute at issue in eldred,it lacks any significant quid pro quo.
the majority seeks to avoid this awkward fact by referring to past congressional practice that mostly suggests that congress may provide new or increased protection both to newly created and to previously created,works.ante,at,act of may,stat.conferring its new federal copyright on new works as well as old act of july,stat.authorizing new patents for past and future inventors who inadvertently failed to comply with applicable statutory formalities mcclurg kingsland,how.applying an act deeming a past or future inventor patent valid despite it being briefly used by,for example,the inventor employer.i do not dispute that copyright power.insofar as such a statute does the former,extends protection to newly created material,it embodies copyright traditional justification eliciting new production.and i do not doubt that congress may then also include existing works within the scope of,say,increased protection for equitable and administrative reasons.see eldred,at,describing equitable reasons for applying newly extended copyright terms to future and existing copyrights alike.the statute before us,however,does not directly elicit any new production.compare,at majority opinion noting that statute extended term would apply to newly created material,and finding that the determination of the likelihood of its eliciting new production in practice was a matter for congress to determine,with,at breyer,dissenting expressing the view that there is little likelihood,in practice,that the statute would elicit new material.see also walterscheid the congress likely thought it was substituting federal protection for preexisting state protections maher,copyright term,retrospective extension,and the copyright law of in historical context,copyright soc.usa,and numerical estimate suggesting that act removed only a small number of books from public domain.
the other statutes to which the majority refers are private bills,statutes retroactively granting protection in wartime,or the like.ante,at act of,ch,stat.levi corson act of june,ch,pt,tod helmuth act of,ch,stat.judson jones act of,ch,stat.act of,ch,stat.see also evans jordan,cranch upholding a private bill restoring patent protection to a flour mill.but special circumstances,like wars,hurricanes,earthquakes,and other disasters,prevent the realization in practice of a reasonable expectation of securing or maintaining a preexisting right.private bills are designed to provide special exceptions for comparable equitable reasons.see also act of,ch,stat.similar,as far as i can tell.to find in these laws an important analogy to the present law,which for the most part covers works that the author did not expect to protect in america and often did not particularly want to protect,seems somewhat farfetched.
in fact,congressional practice shows the contrary.it consists of a virtually unbroken string of legislation preventing the withdrawal of works from the public domain.see,berne convention implementation act of,stat.the act does not provide copyright protection for any work that is in the public domain in the united states copyright act of,tit.i,stat.declining to extend copyright protection to any work that is in the public domain prior to the act taking effect copyright act of,stat.n o copyright shall subsist in the original text of any work which is in the public domain,or in any work which was published in this country or any foreign country prior to the going into effect of this act and has not been already copyrighted in the united states act to amend the several acts respecting copy rights,stat.the act shall not extend to any copyright heretofore secured,the term of which has already expired see also,expressing concern that because it is not possible to revive expired terms of copyright,it seems to the committee to be desirable to suspend further expiration of copyright for a period long enough to enable the working out of remaining obstacles to the overall revision of the copyright law 
the majority makes several other arguments.first,it argues that the clause does not require the creation of at least one new work,ante,at,but may instead promote the progress of science in other ways.and it specifically mentions the dissemination of existing and future works as determinative here.ante,at,and.the industry experts to whom the majority refers argue that copyright protection of already existing works can help,say,music publishers or film distributers raise prices,produce extra profits and consequently lead them to publish or distribute works they might otherwise have ignored.but ordinarily a copyright since it is a monopoly on copying restricts dissemination of a work once produced compared to a competitive market.and simply making the industry richer does not mean that the industry,when it makes an ordinary economic calculus,will distribute works not previously distributed.the industry experts might mean that temporary extra profits will lead them to invest in the development of a market,say,by advertising.but this kind of argument,which can be made by distributers of all sorts of goods,ranging from kiwi fruit to swedish furniture,has little if anything to do with the nonrepeatable costs of initial creation,which is the special concern of copyright protection.see supra,at.
moreover,the argument proves too much.it is the kind of argument that the stationers company might well have made and which the british parliament rejected.patterson describing failed booksellers bill seeking protection from foreign competition through an extension of the copyright term.it is the kind of argument that could justify a legislature withdrawing from the public domain the works,say,of hawthorne or of swift or for that matter the king james bible in order to encourage further publication of those works and,it could even more easily justify similar action in the case of lesser known early works,perhaps those of the venerable bede.the court has not,to my knowledge,previously accepted such a rationale a rationale well removed from the special economic circumstances that surround the nonrepeatable costs of the initial creation of a writing.supra,at.and i fear that doing so would read the copyright clause as if it were a blank check made out in favor of those who are not themselves creators.
it is not surprising that the copyright holders representatives who appeared before congress did not emphasize this argument.with one minor exception only those representatives appeared,see generally joint hearing the copyright office did not testify,at.rather,they focused on the berne convention itself.by that time,congress had already protected all new works of berne members.but it had not provided additional protection to preexisting foreign works that were then in the american public domain.industry witnesses testified that withdrawing such works from the american public domain would permit foreign copyright owners to charge american consumers more for their products and that,as a result,the united states would be able to persuade foreign countries to allow american holders of preexisting copyrights to charge foreign customers more money for their products.see,at statement of eric smith,executive director and general counsel,international intellectual property alliance f ailure to comply with article will undermine the ability of the united states to press other countries to implement the same sort of protection in their implementing legislation currently pending in many legislatures around the globe at statement of matt gerson,vice president for congressional affairs,motion picture of america similar.see also,at statement of xavier becerra,house judiciary committee member r etroactivity is probably the best way to ensure that some of our older american works,anything from motown,to star trek,to the hardy boys get the protection in some of these emerging foreign markets.it is important to ensure that countries no longer use our law as an excuse for not extending retroactive copyright protections to some of our own works but see,at statement of larry urbanski,chairman of the fairness in copyright coalition and president of moviecraft testifying against restoration on grounds similar to those set out,supra,at.
this argument,whatever its intrinsic merits,is an that directly concerns a private benefit how to obtain more money from the sales of existing products.it is not an argument about a public benefit,such as how to promote or to protect the creative process.
third,the majority points out that the statute gives authors nothing more than the benefit of their labors during whatever time remains before the normal copyright term expires.ante,at.but insofar as it suggests that copyright should in general help authors obtain greater monetary rewards than needed to elicit new works,it rests upon primarily european,but not american,copyright concepts.see supra,at.
fourth,the majority argues that this statutory provision is necessary to fulfill our berne convention obligations.ante,at.the treaty,in article,says that the convention shall apply to all works which,at the moment of its coming into force,in the case of the united states have not yet fallen into the public domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of protection.berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works,as revised at stockholm on july.the majority and government say that this means we must protect the foreign works at issue here.and since the berne convention,taken as a whole,provides incentives for the creation of new works,i am willing to speculate,for argument sake,that the statute might indirectly encourage production of new works by making the united states place in the international copyright regime more secure.
still,i can not find this argument sufficient to save the statute.for one thing,this is a dilemma of the government own making.the united states obtained the benefits of berne for many years despite its failure to enact a statute implementing article.but in,the united states and other nations signed the agreement on aspects of intellectual property rights,which enabled signatories to use world trade organization dispute resolution mechanisms to complain about other members berne convention violations.but at that time the government,although it successfully secured reservations protecting other special features of american copyright law,made no effort to secure a reservation permitting the united states to keep some or all restored works in the american public domain.and it made no effort to do so despite the fact that article explicitly authorizes countries to negotiate exceptions to the article retroactivity principle.see,ibid.the application of the retroactivity principle shall be subject to any provisions contained in special conventions to that effect existing or to be concluded between countries of the union emphasis added gervais,golan holder a look at the constraints imposed by the berne convention,vand.en banc,gard,vand.en banc,at.
for another thing,the convention does not require congress to enact a statute that causes so much damage to public domain material.article also states that the respective countries shall determine,each in so far as it is concerned,the conditions of application of this principle.at emphasis added.congress could have alleviated many of the costs that the statute imposes by,for example,creating forms of compulsory licensing,requiring restored copyright holders to provide necessary administrative information as a condition of protection,or insisting upon reasonable royalties.sess.legislation that would have limited judicial remedies against users of orphan works,sess.house version of same american society of composers,authors and publishers.aspx society of music copyright owners offering blanket licenses that give users the unlimited right to perform any of its members songs for a fixed fee,thus reducing negotiation and enforcement costs.
to say this is not to criticize the convention or our joining it.rather,it is to argue that the other branches of government should have tried to follow the convention and in particular its provisions offering compliance flexibility.the fact that the statute has significant first amendment costs is relevant in this respect,for that amendment ordinarily requires courts to evaluate less restrictive,alternative possibilities.doing so here,reveals that neither congress nor the executive took advantage of methods of compliance that the convention itself provides.and that fact means that the convention can not provide the statute with a constitutionally sufficient justification that is otherwise lacking.
the fact that,by withdrawing material from the public domain,the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow of information is sufficient,when combined with the other features of the statute that i have discussed,to convince me that the copyright clause,interpreted in the light of the first amendment,does not authorize congress to enact this statute.
i respectfully dissent from the court contrary conclusion.
article of the berne convention provides 
this convention shall apply to all works which,at the moment of its coming into force,have not yet fallen into the public domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of protection.
if,however,through the expiry of the term of protection which was previously granted,a work has fallen into the public domain of the country where protection is claimed,that work shall not be protected anew.
the application of this principle shall be subject to any provisions contained in special conventions to that effect existing or to be concluded between countries of the union.in the absence of such provisions,the respective countries shall determine,each in so far as it is concerned,the conditions of application of this principle.
the preceding provisions shall also apply in the case of new accessions to the union and to cases in which protection is extended by the application of article or by the abandonment of reservations.
as noted by the government amici,the united states excluded foreign works from copyright not to swell the number of unprotected works available to the consuming public,but to favor domestic publishing interests that escaped paying royalties to foreign authors.see brief for international publishers association et as amici curiae.this,according to senator jonathan chace,champion of the act,made the united states the barbary coast of literature and its people the buccaneers of books.
