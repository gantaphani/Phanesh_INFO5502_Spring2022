respondent titlow and billie rogers were arrested for the murder of billie husband.after explaining to respondent that the state evidence could support a conviction for murder,respondent attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agreement to testify against billie.three days before billie trial,respondent retained a new attorney,frederick toca,who demanded an even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.the prosecutor rejected the proposal,and respondent withdrew the original plea.without that testimony,billie was acquitted.respondent was subsequently convicted of murder.on direct appeal,respondent argued that toca provided ineffective assistance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn the strength of the state evidence.the michigan court of appeals rejected the claim,concluding that toca actions were reasonable in light of his client protestations of innocence.on federal habeas review,the district court applied the deferential standard of review set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,concluded that the michigan court of appeals ruling was reasonable on the law and facts,and denied relief.the sixth circuit reversed.it found the factual predicate for the state court decision that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent assertion of innocence an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record,given toca explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision to withdraw was made because the state original plea offer was higher than the sentencing range provided by the michigan guidelines.it also found no evidence in the record that toca adequately advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.
held the sixth circuit failed to apply the doubly deferential standard of review recognized by the court case law when it refused to credit the state court reasonable factual finding and assumed that counsel was ineffective where the record was silent.
a aedpa recognizes the federalism principle that state courts are adequate forums for the vindication of federal statutory and constitutional rights.it erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court,requiring them to show that the state court ruling was so lacking in justification that there was an error beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter.
b here,the record readily supports the michigan court of appeals factual finding that toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea only after respondent proclamation of innocence.the facts that respondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when billie husband was killed,discussed the case with a jailer who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent,and hired toca just three days before billie trial at which respondent had agreed to,strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to toca.the only evidence cited by the sixth circuit for its contrary conclusion was that toca sole explanation at the withdrawal hearing focused on the fact that the state plea offer was substantially higher than that provided by the michigan guidelines.the michigan court of appeals was well aware of toca representations to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about a defendant asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by punishment on the other.accepting as true the michigan court of appeals factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence to toca,the sixth circuit strickland analysis can not be sustained.more troubling is that court conclusion that toca was ineffective because the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea.the sixth circuit turned on its head the principle that counsel should be strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,strickland washington,with the burden to show otherwise resting squarely on the defendant,at.the single fact that toca failed to retrieve respondent file from former counsel before withdrawing the guilty plea can not overcome strickland strong presumption of effectiveness.in any event,respondent admitted in open court that former counsel had explained the state evidence and that it would support a murder conviction.toca was justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent understood the strength of the prosecution case.toca conduct in this litigation was far from exemplary,but a lawyer ethical violations do not make the lawyer per se ineffective,and toca questionable conduct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the sixth circuit.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
when a state prisoner asks a federal court to set aside a sentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining,our cases require that the federal court use a doubly deferential standard of review that gives both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.cullen pinholster,slip,at.in this case,the sixth circuit failed to apply that doubly deferential standard by refusing to credit a state court reasonable factual finding and by assuming that counsel was ineffective where the record was silent.because the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and strickland washington,do not permit federal judges to so casually the decisions of their colleagues or defense attorneys,the sixth circuit decision must be reversed.
respondent titlow and billie rogers,respondent aunt,murdered billie husband don by pouring vodka down his throat and smothering him with a pillow.with help from attorney richard lustig,respondent reached an agreement with state prosecutors to testify against billie,plead guilty to manslaughter,and receive a to sentence.as confirmed at a plea hearing,lustig reviewed the state evidence with respondent over a long period of time,and respondent understood that that evidence could support a conviction for murder.app.the michigan trial court approved the plea bargain.
three days before billie rogers trial was to commence,however,respondent retained a new lawyer,frederick toca.with toca help,respondent demanded a substantially lower minimum sentence three years,instead of seven in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and testify.when the prosecutor refused to accede to the new demands,respondent withdrew the plea,acknowledging in open court the consequences of withdrawal including reinstatement of the murder charge.without respondent critical testimony,billie rogers was acquitted,and later died.
respondent subsequently stood trial.during the course of the trial,respondent denied any intent to harm don rogers or any knowledge,at the time respondent covered his mouth or poured vodka down his throat,that billie intended to harm him.indeed,respondent testified to attempting to prevent billie from harming her husband.the jury,however,elected to believe respondent previous statements,which squarely demonstrated participation in the killing,and convicted respondent of murder.the trial court imposed a to term of imprisonment.
on direct appeal,respondent argued that toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea without taking time to learn more about the case,thereby failing to realize the strength of the state evidence and providing ineffective assistance of counsel.rejecting that claim,the michigan court of appeals found that toca acted reasonably in light of his client protestations of innocence.that court found that respondent decision to hire toca was set in motion by respondent statement to a sheriff deputy that respondent did not commit the offense.app.to pet.for cert.applying the standard set forth by our decision in strickland,which requires that defense counsel satisfy an objective standard of reasonableness,at,the michigan court of appeals concluded that w hen a defendant proclaims innocence,it is not objectively unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain from pleading guilty no matter how good the deal may appear.app.to pet.for cert.
respondent then filed a federal habeas petition under.applying aedpa deferential standard of review,the district court concluded that the michigan court of appeals ruling was completely reasonable on the law and the facts and denied relief,wl,ed.in particular,the district court concluded that c ounsel could not be ineffective by trying to negotiate a better plea agreement for titlow with billie rogers trial imminent and titlow stating at the time that billie rogers had committed the murder without assistance.ibid.
the sixth circuit reversed.it found that the factual predicate for the state court decision that the withdrawal of the plea was based on respondent assertion of innocence was an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record,given toca explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision to withdraw titlow plea was based on the fact that the state plea offer was substantially higher than the michigan guidelines for murder.further observing that t he record in this case contains no evidence that toca fully informed respondent of the possible consequences of withdrawing the guilty plea,the sixth circuit held that toca rendered ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted in respondent loss of the benefit of the plea bargain,at.citing our decision in lafler cooper,the sixth circuit remanded this case with instructions that the prosecution must reoffer the original plea agreement to respondent,and that the state court should consul t the plea agreement and fashion a remedy for the violation of respondent sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining,at.chief judge batchelder dissented on the grounds that the michigan court of appeals decision was reasonable,at.
on remand,the prosecution followed the sixth circuit instructions and reoffered the plea agreement it had offered some years before even though,in light of billie rogers acquittal and subsequent death,respondent was no longer able to deliver on the promises originally made to the prosecution.at the plea hearing,however,respondent balked,refusing to provide a factual basis for the plea which the court could accept.respondent admitted to pouring vodka down don rogers throat,but denied assisting in killing him or knowing that pouring vodka down his throat could lead to his death.as at trial,respondent testified to attempting to prevent billie rogers from harming her husband.eventually,after conferring with current counsel not toca,respondent admitted to placing don rogers in danger by pouring vodka down his throat with the knowledge that his death could result.the trial court took the plea under advisement,where the matter stands at present.we granted certiorari.
aedpa instructs that,when a federal habeas petitioner challenges the factual basis for a prior decision rejecting a claim,the federal court may overturn the state court decision only if it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the prisoner bears the burden of rebutting the state court factual findings by clear and convincing evidence.e.we have not defined the precise relationship between d and e,and we need not do so here.see wood allen.for present purposes,it is enough to reiterate that a factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.at.aedpa likewise imposes a highly deferential standard for reviewing claims of legal error by the state courts a writ of habeas corpus may issue only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by this court.d.
aedpa recognizes a foundational principle of our federal system state courts are adequate forums for the vindication of federal rights.t he states possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the federal government,subject only to limitations imposed by the supremacy clause.under this system of dual sovereignty,we have consistently held that state courts have inherent authority,and are thus presumptively competent,to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the united states.tafflin levitt.this principle applies to claimed violations of constitutional,as well as statutory,rights.see trainor hernandez.indeed,state courts have the solemn responsibility equally with the federal courts to safeguard constitutional rights,and this court has refused to sanction any decision that would reflec t negatively upon a state court ability to do so.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.especially where a case involves such a common claim as ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland a claim state courts have now adjudicated in countless criminal cases for nearly years there is no intrinsic reason why the fact that a man is a federal judge should make him more competent,or conscientious,or learned than his neighbor in the state courthouse.stone powell,internal quotation marks omitted.
recognizing the duty and ability of our colleagues to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong,aedpa erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court.aedpa requires a state prisoner to show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter,slip,at.if this standard is difficult to meet and it is that is because it was meant to be.at slip,at.we will not lightly conclude that a state criminal justice system has experienced the extreme malfunctio n for which federal habeas relief is the remedy,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the record readily supports the michigan court of appeals factual finding that toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea only after respondent proclamation of innocence.respondent passed a polygraph denying planning to kill don rogers or being in the room when he died.thereafter,according to an affidavit in the record,respondent discussed the case with a jailer,who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact guilty.app.affidavit of william pierson that conversation set into motion respondent decision to retain toca.those facts,together with the timing of toca hiring on the eve of the trial at which respondent was to strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to toca.that conclusion is further bolstered by respondent maintenance of innocence of don rogers death at trial.
indeed,reading the record in any other way is difficult.respondent first lawyer,lustig,had negotiated a deal that was quite favorable in light of the fact,admitted by respondent in open court,that the state evidence could support a conviction for murder.this deal involved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a to sentence far less than the mandatory sentence of life in prison that results from a conviction for murder under michigan law.see.comp.laws ann.west supp.yet after a jailer advised against pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty,something caused respondent both to fire lustig and hire toca who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea,and then to maintain innocence at trial.if that somethi
