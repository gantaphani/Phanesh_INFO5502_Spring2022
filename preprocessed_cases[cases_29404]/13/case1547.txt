discussion 
holston raises facial and challenges to the constitutionality of a.citing united states lopez,d,and united states morrison,d,his main contention is that congress attempt,through a jurisdictional prong,to reach child pornography created for personal use and which does not cross state lines is an unconstitutional exercise of the commerce clause power because the jurisdictional prong is too attenuated from the conduct sought to be regulated.holston further contends that,even if facially valid,the statute is unconstitutional as applied to him because his conduct was not commercial and did not implicate interstate commerce because the depictions never crossed state lines.we review a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.united states griffith,cir united states bianco,cir.
i.the federal child pornography statutes 
section provides 
a any person who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in,or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in,or who transports any minor in interstate or foreign commerce,with the intent that such minor engage in,any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,shall be punished as provided under subsection d,if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed,if that visual depiction was produced using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,or if such visual depiction has actually been transported in interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.
a emphasis added.appellant was prosecuted on the basis of the second jurisdictional prong and the government has not alleged that either of the other jurisdictional bases applies.
section was enacted as part of the protection of children against sexual exploitation act of the act,a,stat,codified at et.the act is a broad regulatory scheme that prohibits,in addition to the production of child pornography,the receipt,transmission,and possession of child pornography.see.as originally enacted,a did not contain the jurisdictional language at issue here.instead,it criminalized the production of pornographic depictions involving minors only if the producer knew,or had reason to know,that the depiction would be transported in interstate commerce,or if it was,in fact,transported in interstate commerce.
when passed in,the act was supported by congressional findings that child pornography ha s become a highly organized,multimillion dollar industr y that operate s on a nationwide scale,and that the sale and distribution of such pornographic materials are carried on to a substantial extent through the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce,at,reprinted in,available at wl.congress also found that because of the vast potential profits in child pornography its low production and reproduction costs and high retail industry was growing at a very rapid rate.id.at,at.
the act was amended in to eliminate the requirement that the production,receipt,transportation,and distribution of child pornography be for a commercial purpose.see child protection act of,stat.see also,at,reprinted in,available at wl.this change followed congress conclusion that,within the unique realities of the child pornography market,much of the production and trafficking was.see,id.at,at many of the individuals who distribute materials covered by section do so by gift or exchange without any commercial motive id.at,at the bulk of the child pornography traffic is.generally,the domestic material is of the homemade variety,while the imported material is produced by commercial dealers.see also id.at,at most often,our investigations have resulted in the identification of collectors,some of whom sell their material while others do not.those who do not sell their material often loan or trade collections with others who share their interest.the house report on the amendment indicated that because much of the pornographic material that concerned congress was homemade and the subject of barter and informal exchanges through underground distribution networks,a statutory regime that required a commercial purpose left a significant enforcement hole that the amendment was intended to fill.
in,congress amended by adding a new jurisdictional basis which required that the materials used to produce the depictions have been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,a,stat,codified at a.the legislative history indicates two reasons for the amendment.the first was to correct an anomaly between the analogous possession statutes,a b,a b,a b,which contained equivalent jurisdictional language and the production statute,which,as originally enacted,did not.the second was to extend the statute to cases where proof of the interstate transportation of the depictions,or proof of the pornographer knowledge as to the interstate transportation,was absent.see,at,reprinted in,available at wl.
ii.the commerce clause under lopez and morrison 
holston contends that the prong of a exceeds congress authority under the commerce clause in light of lopez and morrison.in these two decisions,the supreme court reaffirmed the proposition that the grant of authority to congress under the commerce clause,though broad,is not unlimited.solid waste agency of cook county united states army corps of eng rs,d.both lopez and morrison involved statutes that regulated local noneconomic activity under the theory that the activity,when viewed in the aggregate,substantially affected interstate commerce.
