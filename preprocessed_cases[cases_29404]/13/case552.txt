we are called upon to determine the constitutionality of a provision of the adam walsh child protection and safety act walsh act,stat,a recently enacted federal law that provides in pertinent part for the civil commitment of a sexually dangerous person already in federal criminal custody in lieu of that person release upon service of his full sentence.id,stat.at,codified at,which we shall call,as a shorthand,section.the district court concluded that congress lacked constitutional authority to enact this civil commitment provision and,therefore,dismissed the government petition to enforce it against the respondent,john charles volungus.united states volungus,d.the government appeals from that ruling.
after careful consideration,we hold that the civil commitment provision comes within the legitimate scope of congressional power conferred by the necessary and proper clause of the federal constitution.consequently,we reverse the decision below and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the challenged provision of the walsh act authorizes the government to seek civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons who are in the custody of the federal bureau of prisons bop.a.a sexually dangerous person within the meaning of the walsh act is one who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others.id.a.a person is sexually dangerous to others if he suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder as a result of which he would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.id.a.
mechanically,the walsh act civil commitment provision operates in the following manner.a responsible federal official the attorney general,the director of the bop,or the designee of either may initiate commitment proceedings by petitioning the federal district court in the judicial district in which a targeted person is confined.id.a.the petition must certify to the court that the target,whom we shall call the respondent,is a sexually dangerous person.id.the filing of the petition stays the respondent release from federal custody,notwithstanding the expiration of his sentence,pending completion of procedures described in the walsh act.id.
those procedures include an opportunity for the district court to order a mental health examination and to hold a hearing to determine whether the respondent named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person.id.a c see id.b c.at the hearing,the respondent is entitled to counsel and to the opportunity to testify,to present evidence,to subpoena witnesses on his behalf,and to confront and the government witnesses.id.d.
in prosecuting such a petition,the government has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a sexually dangerous person.id.d.if the court finds that the government has carried this heavy burden,it must commit the respondent to the custody of the attorney general.id.the attorney general is directed to defer to available state custody that is,to release the respondent to the appropriate official of the state in which he is domiciled or was tried if such state will assume responsibility for his custody,care,and treatment.id.in addition,the attorney general is required to make all reasonable efforts to cause such a state to assume responsibility.id.if such efforts prove unsuccessful,the attorney general must retain federal custody and place the respondent in a suitable facility for treatment until either an eligible state will assume responsibility or the respondent condition is ameliorated to the extent that he can safely be released,either conditionally or unconditionally.id.
the walsh act provides an array of safeguards to ensure periodic reevaluation of a committed person overall mental condition,potential dangerousness,and suitability for release.these include a requirement for an annual report setting forth a recommendation for or against continued commitment.id.e b.if the director of the facility in which the person is confined determines that he is no longer sexually dangerous,the director must notify the court,which must either order the person release or schedule a hearing to determine whether release is appropriate.id.e.the person himself,through counsel,may petition the court for such a hearing,but not within days after a judicial determination that commitment is appropriate.id.h.
we turn now from the general to the specific.the respondent here,volungus,was convicted of receipt of child pornography by means of a computer,possession of child pornography,and use of a facility of interstate commerce to attempt to persuade a minor to engage in a sexual act.see a,a a,b.in june of,the united states district court for the western district of kentucky sentenced him to serve a incarcerative term,to be followed by a period of supervised release.the respondent served his initial prison sentence and embarked on his term of supervised release.he violated the conditions of his supervised release and,as a result,was haled into the united states district court for the northern district of new york.that court revoked the supervised release term and remanded him to federal prison for an additional period of incarceration.
over time,the bop housed the respondent in a number of different correctional facilities.the last of these was the federal medical center devens,in ayer,massachusetts a prison hospital.the respondent was in custody there when the government,before the expiration of his extended term of immurement,commenced a civil commitment proceeding under section in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the respondent release from prison,scheduled to take place when the sentence imposed following the revocation of supervised release expired on february,was stayed pending the outcome of the commitment proceeding.see a.
the respondent moved to dismiss the proceeding,making a facial challenge to the constitutionality of section.the district court obliged,declaring the walsh act civil commitment regime unconstitutional because congress lacked the authority to enact it.see volungus,d at.the court,however,stayed the respondent release pending the consummation of this appeal.the respondent remains at devens.
in this venue,the government argues that congress had constitutional authority to enact section under both the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause.the two courts of appeals that thus far have examined the constitutionality of section have reached divergent conclusions.compare united states tom,cir upholding the provision,with united states comstock,cir contra.the supreme court has granted certiorari in comstock to resolve this conflict,d.we decide this appeal now,however,because the timing of the supreme court decision is uncertain,the respondent remains confined despite the expiration of his criminal sentence,and other petitions are currently being litigated in the courts of this circuit.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo challenges to the constitutionality of federal statutes.united states hussein,cir united states bongiorno,cir.before undertaking this review,we acknowledge some first principles.
as long as congress acts within the sphere of its constitutional authority,it has the power to make criminal laws and to fashion penalties for noncompliance therewith.see gonzales raich,d champion ames.united states fox.in the criminal law arena,the commerce clause,const.art.i,cl,typically furnishes the source of this congressional power.see,united states lewis,cir discussing source of congress power to outlaw transmission of child pornography united states meade,cir discussing source of congress power to criminalize possession of a firearm by one subject to an order.
a certain degree of ancillary authority accompanies the power to enact and enforce criminal laws.one example of this ancillary authority is congress power to construct and operate a prison system.see,ex parte karstendick.estabrook king,cir.a related and subsidiary example is congress authority to commit mentally ill prison inmates while they are in federal custody.see,greenwood united states.see also jackson indiana,d acknowledging that greenwood settled any question of the federal government substantive power to commit.these ancillary strands of power descend from the necessary and proper clause,const.art.i,cl.see greenwood,at.
the necessary and proper clause imbues congress with a measure of legislative discretion to enact laws that are incidental to the furtherance of legislation authorized under more specific powers conferred by the constitution.see mcculloch maryland,wheat.the clause is a bit of an anomaly.although the constitution enshrines the principle of a limited federal government,see gregory ashcroft,d,the necessary and proper clause injects some legislative flexibility into the equation.it is a broad grant of incidental power that enables congress to further constitutionally legitimate ends.see sabri united states,d jinks richland county,d see also the federalist alexander hamilton.as chief justice marshall aptly observed let the end be legitimate,let it be within the scope of the constitution,and all means which are appropriate,which are plainly adapted to that end,which are not prohibited,but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,are constitutional.mcculloch,wheat.at.
in this instance,the respondent served time in federal prison following his conviction for violating a panoply of federal criminal laws.congress power to enact those laws flowed from the commerce clause,and the respondent does not challenge their provenance.the inquiry here involves the constitutionality of a statutory scheme of federal civil commitment that operates after a defendant has been convicted,sentenced,and reached the brink of release.
that the operation of the walsh act is federal in nature is an important datum.the supreme court has made it transparently clear that a state may civilly commit a prisoner beyond the expiration of his sentence if the prisoner is determined under appropriate procedures to be sexually dangerous.see kansas hendricks,d.but the source of the federal government authority to commit is less clearly defined,and the statutory provision here in issue is limited in its application to federal action persons in federal custody.see a.the question before us,then,is whether section civil commitment scheme is an appropriate exercise of congressional power.
the government argues that it is,pointing to both the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause.the respondent argues that it is not.in our view,federal authority to commit civilly,if constitutional at all,would seem to fit most comfortably among the auxiliary,implied powers conferred by the necessary and proper clause.consequently,we focus our inquiry there.
the civil commitment scheme spelled out in section is new,but it is not sui generis.since the nineteenth century,congress has provided for the commitment of convicts who,while in federal custody,are determined through appropriate procedures to be mentally ill.see,act of,ch,stat,act of june,ch,stat.more than six decades ago,congress passed legislation dealing with this that legislation,in modified form,remains in force.see act.of,ch,stat,codified as amended at see also act of june,ch,stat,codified as amended at.this legislation provides that persons in federal criminal custody,including those whose incarcerative terms are about to expire,may be civilly committed upon a determination that they suffer from a mental disease or defect and are dangerous.see.
enacted many years prior to the passage of the walsh act,this earlier regime that we shall call,as a shorthand,section a wide array of mentally ill persons in federal custody,including pretrial detainees,persons who had been convicted and sentenced,and persons tried but found not guilty by reason of insanity.see id.
when a federal pretrial detainee challenged section,the supreme court upheld it and,thus,effectively upheld the potentially indefinite pretrial commitment of a mentally incompetent defendant.greenwood,at.in so doing,the court endorsed the proposition that congress may provide for the civil commitment of a person in federal custody who would be dangerous to society if released.see id.at.see also jackson,at.jones united states,d stating that indefinite commitment of a dangerous person acquitted by reason of insanity does not violate due process united states debellis,cir similar.the court reasoned that the law providing for civil commitment was constitutional,under the necessary and proper clause,as an assertion of authority,duly guarded,auxiliary to incontestible national power to prosecute for federal crimes.greenwood,at.
we read greenwood to hold,as a general matter,that civil commitment under a federal scheme targeted to those in federal criminal custody is within the scope of congress constitutional authority under the necessary and proper clause.the respondent strives to limit this generalization by pointing out that greenwood involved a pretrial detainee,whereas he has at this juncture served his entire sentence.as we explain below,this distinction does not make a dispositive difference.
both section and section are geared toward preventing the release of persons in federal custody who would,if set free,be dangerous to society because of mental illness.compare a defining dangerousness as resulting from a mental disease or defect,with id.a defining sexual dangerousness to others as rooted in a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder.the primary difference between these two provisions is the condition that triggers possible commitment.on the one hand,section is triggered by the prospect of generalized danger arising from mental illness,traditionally conceived.on the other hand,section is triggered by discrete dangers arising from a particular manifestation of mental illness sexually dangerous proclivities.in a sense,then,section is simply a specific application of section,designed to forestall dangers presented by those who do not necessarily meet the criteria for commitment under the more general section scheme.hendricks,at.explaining that state legislation specific to sexual dangerousness was enacted to bridge an analogous gap.seen in that light,greenwood is a formidable precedent.
in all events,the similarities between the two provisions are more salient than the differences.most importantly,under both provisions the authority to commit civilly is auxiliary to the longstanding federal power to prosecute and punish federal crimes.greenwood places that authority within the compass of the necessary and proper clause.
in point of fact,the case for constitutionality here may be even stronger than in greenwood.there,the defendant was merely charged with having committed a federal crime.at.here,however,the respondent has already been found guilty of a crime.that data point is telling t he fact that a person has been found,beyond a reasonable doubt,to have committed a criminal act certainly indicates dangerousness.jones,at.see hendricks,at.thus,civil commitment of one in the respondent position entails proof of both future dangerousness and past dangerousness.
the respondent counters that,in working the constitutional calculus,the greenwood court noted that federal authority over the defendant persist ed because he was being detained pretrial when committed.at.in contrast,the respondent has now served his sentence.seizing on this sequencing,the district court distinguished greenwood on the ground that federal power over the defendant there was unexhausted.volungus,d at.
this attempted distinction is more illusory than real.the government filed its petition for civil commitment in this case before the respondent sentence had run its course.from that time forward,the respondent remained,lawfully,in the uninterrupted legal custody of the bop.see rumsfeld padilla,d wales whitney.no exhaustion has occurred because the government authority over the respondent is tied to its lawful custody of him,up to the present time and continuing.
to be sure,it can be argued that continued confinement,beyond the expiration of the respondent sentence,is unconstitutional.but the respondent initial confinement
