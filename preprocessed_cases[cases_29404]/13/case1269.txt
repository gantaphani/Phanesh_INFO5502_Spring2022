background 
david seidemann is a tenured professor of geology at brooklyn college,which is part of the city university of new york cuny system of colleges and universities.professional staff congress of the city university of new york,of which barbara bowen is president jointly,psc or the union,is a union and the exclusive collective bargaining representative for certain cuny employees,including plaintiff.plaintiff has chosen not to join psc.however,because cuny is an agency shop,new york law requires that he pay an agency fee to the union as compensation for its collective bargaining efforts on his behalf.a portion of plaintiff dues support activities of psc,while other portions are paid to psc national affiliate,the american federation of teachers aft,and its state affiliate,the new york state united teachers nysut.because,as we explain below,dissenters may not be compelled to support ideological activity not related to collective bargaining,they may file objections to psc charges and may be entitled to receive refunds of portions of psc charges for such unrelated ideological activities.plaintiff,as we detail below,has filed objections to several of psc expenditures made from the year to.
in june,plaintiff,proceeding pro se,filed a complaint against psc in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york lois bloom,magistrate judge alleging that several of the charges comprising psc agency fee violated his rights under the first amendment.plaintiff alleged that psc impermissibly charged him a pro rata share of expenses unrelated to the union collective bargaining duties,in violation of his rights under the first amendment set forth by the supreme court in lehnert.specifically,plaintiff argued that psc could not constitutionally charge him a pro rata share for,among other things,psc contract campaign,which consisted of political activity designed to persuade management to enter into a new contract with the union,of the lobbying costs incurred by nysut,psc costs to send delegates to annual nysut conventions,of the salaries of psc employees,and aft media communication expenses.plaintiff also alleged that psc procedures for contesting charges violated his first amendment rights in falling short of the basic procedural requirements set forth by the supreme court in chicago teachers union,local hudson,d.
after discovery was completed,the parties for summary judgment.on november,the district court issued an opinion and order granting psc and dismissing the action in its entirety.see seidemann bowen,seidemann i.
through pro bono counsel plaintiff timely appealed from the judgment of the district court dismissing his action.a panel of this court reversed the judgment of the district court.see seidemann bowen,cir seidemann ii.the seidemann ii panel held that psc objection procedures violated plaintiff rights under hudson,and it remanded the cause for further consideration of plaintiff claims.id.at.
on remand,in an opinion and order dated april,the district court enforced the mandate of this court by granting in part plaintiff motion for summary judgment and awarding plaintiff injunctive and declaratory relief as well as nominal damages.see seidemann bowen,dist.lexis,seidemann iii.however,the april,opinion and order did not specifically address all of plaintiff claims.plaintiff thus moved to amend the opinion and order,and in an order dated august,the district court granted plaintiff motion in part and denied it in part.see seidemann bowen,dist.lexis,seidemann iv.the district court held that psc charges to plaintiff for certain public relations expenditures were not rightly charged to plaintiff.id.at.however,the district court upheld psc charges for its contract campaign,nysut lobbying,the cost of its members attendance at nysut annual representative assembly conventions,and the salaries of psc employees.the district court also upheld psc charges to plaintiff for aft media communications.id.at.finally,the district court held,sua sponte,that plaintiff would be required to arbitrate his future challenges to psc agency fee before filing suit in federal court.
plaintiff timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiff argues that,under the supreme court decision in lehnert,psc contract campaign was not chargeable to him because it entailed political activity in a public forum and was designed to convince cuny management to enter into a new contract with psc.similarly,plaintiff contends that he may not be compelled to subsidize nysut lobbying,as the record purportedly demonstrates that nysut efforts on psc behalf were minimal and designed only to secure a new agreement from cuny management.plaintiff also maintains that,even if the charges for the contract campaign and nysut lobbying were not unconstitutional per se,the record does not support the district court decision to uphold them in this action.additionally,plaintiff contends that,on this record,the district court erred in upholding psc charges for the cost of sending a psc delegation to nysut annual convention and psc charges for its employees salaries.further,plaintiff contends that the district court improperly found that plaintiff claim regarding aft media communications was not before the court and,accordingly,that the district court erred in dismissing that claim.finally,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in holding,sua sponte,that plaintiff will be required to arbitrate future claims against psc for violations of his first amendment rights.
we consider plaintiff challenges to each of the charges in turn.we then address the district court dismissal of plaintiff claim regarding aft media communications and,finally,we consider the district court holding that plaintiff must arbitrate future chargeability claims.
generally,we review a district court ruling on a motion to amend a judgment for abuse of discretion.see,schwartz liberty mut.ins,cir sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.internal citation,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.however,in this case,it is undisputed that each of the issues raised in plaintiff motion to amend was before the district court when it granted summary judgment to plaintiff,although the district court did not specifically address them at that time.accordingly,we review the district court decision de novo,as we would any other decision of a district court granting or denying a motion for summary judgment.see,graves finch pruyn,cir.summary judgment is warranted only upon a showing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.
psc contract campaign 
the supreme court has recognized that t o compel employees financially to support their representative has an impact upon their first amendment interests.abood,at.yet,the desirability of labor peace and eliminating free riders can justify the assessment of agency fees to nonmembers for the purposes of collective bargaining,contract administration,and grievance adjustment.lehnert,at.quoting abood,at.in order to accommodate both interests,the supreme court has established that,although unions are entitled to charge dissenters an agency fee in order to avoid free riding,they may not use the fees of objecting nonmembers for ideological purposes that are not germane to the union duties.davenport,at.
the supreme court has prescribe d a analysis in determining which activities a union constitutionally may charge to dissenting employees,and it has set forth guidelines for courts making such determinations.lehnert,at.generally,chargeable activities must be germane to activity be justified by the government vital policy interest in labor peace and avoiding free riders and not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.id.in all cases,the union bears the burden of establishing that the disputed assessments do not violate the dissenter first amendment rights.see id.at.if the union can establish that disputed expenses are,in fact,chargeable,it also bears the burden of proving the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.id.thus,if a union deems a category of expenses chargeable to dissenters,it must be able to prove the specific proportion of expenses in that category that were,in fact,chargeable.for example,the union might establish that category a contained chargeable expenses it would then have to prove that of its category a expenses were,in fact,chargeable.
here,psc charged payers a pro rata share of expenses for various activities undertaken in an effort to win a collective bargaining agreement from cuny in.defs.mem.in opp to pl.mot.for partial summ.this contract campaign,as psc described it,consisted of,among other things,a series of rallies,a woody guthrie concert,a contract protest,and an event called teach cuny.third am.compl.ex.applying lehnert inquiry,the district court held that the contract campaign was chargeable to plaintiff and,accordingly,did not grant summary judgment to plaintiff with respect to those charges.see seidemann iv,dist.lexis,at.
on appeal,plaintiff contends that the district court erred in upholding the contract campaign charge.according to plaintiff,under lehnert,activities of a political nature in a public forum are not chargeable to dissenters unless they concern legislative ratification of,or fiscal appropriations for,their agreement.appellant br.quoting lehnert,at.plurality opinion.plaintiff argues that the contract campaign was not chargeable to dissenters like him because it amounted to political activity in a public forum that was designed to secure a new agreement,not to ratify or implement an existing agreement,and to persuade management,not the legislature.
although we do not dispute plaintiff characterization of the contract campaign as consisting principally of political activity in a public forum,we do not read lehnert as holding that a union may charge dissenters for political activity only in the context of legislative ratification or implementation of a collective bargaining agreement.plaintiff correctly observes that justice blackmun discussion of political lobbying in lehnert included the statement that the state constitutionally may not compel its employees to subsidize legislative lobbying or other political union activities outside the limited context of contract ratification or implementation.at.plurality opinion.however,justice blackmun discussion of chargeable political spoke for only a as follows 
the court of appeals determined that unions constitutionally may subsidize lobbying and other political activities with dissenters fees so long as those activities are pertinent to the duties of the union as a bargaining representative.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied upon the inherently political nature of salary and other workplace decisions in public employment.to represent their members effectively,the court concluded,public sector unions must necessarily concern themselves not only with negotiations at the bargaining table but also with advancing their members interests in legislative and other political arenas.
this observation is clearly correct.
id.at.citations and some internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also id.at.distinguishing chargeable activities from nonchargeable activities by noting that unlike discussion by negotiators regarding the terms and conditions of employment,lobbying and electoral speech are likely to concern topics about which individuals hold strong personal views emphasis added.in light of this analysis,we think the relevant inquiry is whether a union political activities were pertinent to the duties of the union as a bargaining representative,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted a requirement that is indistinguishable from the question whether an activity is germane to collective bargaining,id.majority opinion.were we to adopt plaintiff logic,we would enable precisely the sort of free rider problem that the supreme court explicitly sought to avoid in lehnert,inasmuch as plaintiff would stand to benefit from psc negotiation of a new agreement without having to contribute financially to the union efforts.
while justice blackmun plurality opinion referred to legislative lobbying and the ratification or implementation of a contract,id.at.plurality opinion,his opinion distinguished negotiations from lobbying,electoral,and other political activities that do not relate to dissenters agreement s,id.at.whatever the reason for the plurality reference to ratification or implementation most likely the procedural posture of think that,had the court wished to adopt a rule as narrow as that suggested by plaintiff,it would have said so unambiguously.
for these reasons,we hold that a union political activities aimed at securing a new contract may be chargeable to dissenters if those activities are pertinent to the union duties as a collective bargaining representative and do not otherwise significantly add to the burden on dissenters rights to free speech.we emphasize,however,that the risk of a union political activity substantially adding to the burden already placed on dissenters first amendment rights is particularly great where the union has engaged in speech of a political nature in a public forum.id.at.courts must examine union activities carefully to ensure that dissenters are not charged for ideological undertakings not related to collective bargaining.see id.at.noting that the burden upon freedom of expression is particularly great where a union compels speech in a public context see also id.where the subject of compelled speech is the discussion of governmental affairs the burden upon dissenters rights extends far beyond the acceptance of the agency shop and is constitutionally impermissible.citations omitted.
looking to the instant case,we agree with plaintiff that the record before us does not support the district court decision to uphold psc charges for the contract campaign.although the district court rejected plaintiff argument that psc efforts to obtain a new contract from management were categorically not chargeable,it made no particularized findings with respect to whether psc met its burden of establishing that all aspects of the contract campaign were sufficiently related to psc collective bargaining function so as to justify any burden imposed on plaintiff first amendment rights.see id.at.majority opinion holding that the union bears the burden of proving the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.nor is the record sufficiently developed for us to make such a determination.particularly in light of the public nature of the activities at issue,we hold that the district court erred in upholding psc charge for the contract campaign.
nysut lobbying 
plaintiff also objects to psc charge for lobbying and legislative activities with respect to issues conducted by its state affiliate,nysut.psc apportioned nysut lobbying as chargeable to dissenters and nonchargeable.in its august,order,the district court observed that defendant did not do a good job of establishing what nysut did behind the scenes to support psc,dist.lexis,at,but nevertheless upheld the charge on the theory that lehnert did not preclude charges for lobbying as a matter of law and required only some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately inure to benefit of the members of local union,id.at citing lehnert,at.
plaintiff maintains that psc may charge him for nysut lobbying only if nysut lobbied the state legislature to ratify or implement psc collective bargaining agreement.appellant br.for the reasons stated in section a,ante,we again reject plaintiff contention that,under lehnert,unions may charge dissenters only for political activity directed at the legislature and related to the implementation or ratification of an existing agreement.however,our analysis does not end here because plaintiff challenge to psc charge for nysut lobbying requires us to consider the circumstances under which a local union may charge dissenters for the political activity of a parent union.
the supreme court in lehnert did not directly address whether a dissenter local agency fee could be used to subsidize lobbying activities by a parent union.however,the court held that local unions may constitutionally charge dissenters a pro rata share of dues paid by a local union to a parent union.lehnert,at.the court explained that such charges were constitutionally permissible because t he essence of the affiliation relationship is the notion that the parent will bring to bear its often considerable economic,political,and informational resources when the local is in need of them.id.at.in order to sustain a charge for dues to an affiliate,the union need not demonstrate that the affiliate expenditure of dues resulted in a direct and tangible impact on the dissenter unit.id.at.nor must the dues actually be expended on the local unit in any particular membership year.id.at.however,t here must be some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization.id.at.
in light of the supreme court holdings in lehnert that a union political activity may be charged to dissenters if it is germane to activity,id.at,and a local union may charge dissenters for dues paid to a parent union,see id.at,we now hold that a dissenter agency fee may be used to subsidize the lobbying expenses of a parent union where those lobbying expenses are related to collective bargaining and may ultimately inure to the benefit of the local union,see id.at.while we consistently have looked to whether nonideological expenses are germane to collective bargaining,we have never interpreted that test to require a direct relationship between the expense at issue and some tangible benefit to the dissenters bargaining unit.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in our view,permitting such charges does not significantly add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of an agency or union shop.id.at.see also id.at.a n employee free speech rights are not unconstitutionally burdened because the employee opposes positions taken by a union in its capacity as representative.of course,dissenters may not be charged for ideological or other lobbying not related to collective bargaining and,as with all other expenses,the union bears the burden of demonstrating the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.id.at.
we agree with plaintiff that the record does not support the district court decision to uphold psc charge for nysut lobbying.the undisputed evidence before the district court demonstrated that nysut lobbying activities that concerned the ratification of or fiscal appropriations for a collective bargaining agreement consisted principally of a few phone calls.third am.compl.ex.psc offered no other evidence that nysut engaged in other lobbying that was related to collective bargaining and might inure to the benefit of psc members.further,even if we assume for the sake of argument that psc demonstrated that nysut lobbying was germane to collective bargaining and would ultimately inure to the benefit of psc members,we can not affirm the district court holding because psc produced no evidence to meet its burden of demonstrating the proportion of chargeable expenses to total expenses.lehnert,at.accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in upholding psc charges for nysut lobbying expenditures.on remand,the district court should develop the record to consider whether psc properly apportioned charges for those expenses.
nysut convention costs 
dissenters were required to pay a pro rata share of percent of the cost of sending psc delegates to the annual convention of nysut,and the district court upheld the charge,notwithstanding plaintiff contentions that psc own documents show or concede that at least some of the convention content is affirmatively unrelated to bargaining or representational strategies and psc did not produce or cite any evidence showing their chargeability in any amount.seidemann iv,dist.lexis,at.plaintiff argues that the convention at representative,in part,political,and therefore the costs of sending psc delegates to the convention should be apportioned so that plaintiff is not forced to subsidize ideological activity.
in evaluating whether a local union may charge dissenters for costs incurred by the local union to defray the costs of a national affiliate convention,the supreme court in ellis brotherhood of railway clerks considered whether the expenses involve d additional interference with the first amendment interests of objecting employees,and,if so,whether the expenses were nonetheless adequately supported by a governmental interest,d.under this analysis,a union may charge dissenters a pro rata share for the costs of a convention that were relat ed to the work of the union in the realm of collective bargaining because such a convention would have imposed little additional infringement of first amendment rights beyond that already accepted as a result of the agency shop arrangement,and none that is not justified by the governmental interests behind the union shop itself.id.similarly,the supreme court in lehnert held that dissenters may be require d to subsidize the participation in affiliate conventions of delegates from the local.at.the court explained that the first amendment did not require a local union to demonstrate that the conventions were solely devoted to the activities of the local union,in part because participation by members of the local in the formal activities of the parent is likely to be an important benefit of affiliation.id.
in this action,the district court reasoned that the supreme court holding in lehnert squarely foreclosed plaintiff argument.see seidemann iv,dist.lexis,at.however,the record before us suggests that,unlike the conventions at issue in ellis and lehnert,the representative assembly was not entirely relat ed to the work of the union in the realm of collective bargaining,ellis,at.internal quotation marks omitted,and had at least a small political component that may have imposed an additional burden on plaintiff first amendment rights.in particular,plaintiff submitted to the district court the minutes of a psc executive committee meeting at which members of the committee referred to psc delegates to the representative assembly as a political caucus.third am.compl.ex.the psc executive committee also characterized the convention as a
