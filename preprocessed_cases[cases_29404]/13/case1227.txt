todd broxmeyer,convicted in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mcavoy,challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions for i production of child pornography and ii transportation of a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.he also raises an challenge to the statute criminalizing the production of child pornography.
broxmeyer,a year old field hockey coach,entered into a sexual relationship legal under state law with a year old player.the two counts alleging production of child pornography are premised on two photos one per count that the girl took of herself.he was found to have induced her to produce them but while there is evidence that he encouraged her to take photographs of that kind,and that she took several with his encouragement,there is no evidence that he encouraged her to take the two photos specified in the two counts of conviction.
the transportation count is premised on the travel of a year old field hockey player from her home in pennsylvania to a field hockey practice in new york where broxmeyer was coach.he drove her back home,stopping en route for a sexual encounter with her before crossing the state line.
we agree with broxmeyer on the sufficiency challenges reverse the convictions on counts one,two,and four and remand for on the counts of conviction as to which no appeal was taken attempted production of child pornography and possession of child pornography.
broxmeyer was for some years a field hockey coach to girls to years old.during this career,broxmeyer engaged in sexual relationships with several of his players,some of whom were younger than.these relationships involved both physical acts and sexting defined here to mean the exchange of sexually explicit text messages,including photographs,via cell phone.
in september,broxmeyer was convicted by a jury on all counts of a indictment,of which counts one,two,and four are at issue on this appeal 
counts one and two production of child pornography,in violation of a 
count three attempted production of child pornography,in violation of a,e 
count four transportation of a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity,in violation of a and 
count five possession of child pornography,in violation of a b 
at the close of the government,broxmeyer moved pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a for a judgment of acquittal on counts one,two,and four.the district court denied the motion as to count four and reserved judgment as to counts one and two.a week after his conviction,broxmeyer moved pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c for a judgment of acquittal on all five counts or,in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a.by written order dated november,the district court denied the motion in full.
on april,the district court sentenced broxmeyer to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on each of counts one,two,and three months on count four and months on count five.the advisory guidelines sentence was life imprisonment.
in point ii,we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions for production of child pornography.in point iii,we review sufficiency as to the transportation count.
counts one and two allege that broxmeyer produced two sexually explicit pictures one per count that a year old field hockey player took of herself.
broxmeyer met in,while he was coaching at a field hockey camp in new england over the next few years,and through her senior year in high school,attended broxmeyer practices at field hockey camps across pennsylvania,new jersey,and new york.
beginning in the spring of and continuing until his arrest in december,broxmeyer and who was then began a consensual sexual relationship,legal under new york statutory rape law the two engaged in sexting as well as physical sex.
they exchanged images as follows.they used their cell phones to take pictures of themselves engaged in sexual acts with each other.broxmeyer texted a picture of his arousal.broxmeyer texted sexually explicit pictures of other field hockey players,including one of several girls in their underwear,who were arranged in a pyramid.broxmeyer showed several sexually explicit pictures of field hockey players that he had saved to an internet photo album.he challenged to acquire naked pictures of other field hockey players,and obliged.also texted broxmeyer explicit photos of herself.broxmeyer never expressly asked to send him pictures of herself,but he did tell her that he liked them and that she was doing something nice by sending them to him.
counts one and two relate to two photos one per count that took of herself and texted to broxmeyer.the first photo shows from the neck down,naked,touching her private parts.the second photo shows using a handheld showerhead to spray water between her legs.but there is no evidence as to when the two photos at issue were taken,produced or how or whether their production fits into the series of other communications and exchanges.
the federal statute criminalizing the production of child pornography,a,provides 
any person who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct shall be punished if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce if that visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed,shipped,or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means 
section a applies only to the actual production of child pornography other statutes not charged in this case proscribe distribution.united states dauray,cir explaining that a prohibits the sale or possession with intent to sell child pornography and a prohibits the receipt or distribution of child pornography.to secure a conviction under a,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was less than years old the defendant used,employed,persuaded,induced,enticed,or coerced the minor to take part in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct and the visual depiction was produced using materials that had been transported in interstate or foreign commerce.united states malloy,cir.
broxmeyer does not contest the sufficiency of proof as to the first and third elements was when she took photos and and the cell phone she used to take them was made in south korea.his challenge is to the sufficiency of the evidence on the second element.
a defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction bears a heavy burden.united states jackson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all permissible inferences in its favor.id.t he relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d see also jackson,at explaining that a judgment of acquittal is proper only if the evidence that the defendant committed the crime alleged was nonexistent or meager internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.at the same time,a conviction can not stand if it is based on mere speculation or guesswork.see united states thai,cir.
the decisive question here is whether the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that broxmeyer persuaded,induced,or enticed to take photos and.the terms persuade,induce,and entice are not defined in a,but they are words of common usage that have plain and ordinary meanings,united states gagliardi,cir,and we look to the dictionary for their common definitions,see vip of berlin,llc town of berlin,cir.persuade,induce,and entice are in effect synonyms.see the random house dictionary of the english language unabridged ed.the idea conveyed is of one person lead ing or mov ing another by persuasion or influence,as to some action,state of mind,or to bring about,produce,or cause.id.at defining induce see also id.at defining entice as to draw on by exciting hope or desire allure id.at defining persuade to mean to prevail on a person to do something,as by advising,urging,or to induce to believe convince.
these are words of causation the statute punishes the cause when it brings about the effect.sequence is therefore critical.the facts of this case require us to belabor the obvious broxmeyer could only persuade,induce,or entice to take photos and if his persuasion,inducement,or enticement came before she took them.broxmeyer counsel failed to present this argument to the district court and conceded at oral argument that he raised it for the first time in his reply brief on appeal.generally speaking,such arguments are deemed forfeited.see local,rwdsu,ufcw tenants ass n,cir mccarthy,cir.however,because manifest injustice would result if we were to invoke that rule here,see mccarthy,at,we go to the merits of this contention.
all that the record shows on this sequencing point is that turned in january she took photos and when she was and she began a sexual relationship with broxmeyer in the spring of.there is nothing to tie broxmeyer to photos and except that he received them when she transmitted them.his receipt may or may not have violated but that statute was not charged in the indictment.as to the production of photos and which is charged there is no evidence that broxmeyer inspired it.for all the record evidence shows,photos and could have been taken in the early part of,for an audience other than broxmeyer,or for alone or during the preliminary stage of their encounter when she was flirting with him on a basis not yet reciprocated or later in,while in the course of her sexual relationship with broxmeyer.photos and were taken in one of these three periods,but as to when and whether they were taken before or after he solicited photos of her one can only guess.
the government adduced no evidence on this point.at trial,the government questioned at length she was a government witness,at least nominally but she was not asked when in the sequence of events she took photos and.the jury was left to speculate or guess.see thai,at.
as to sequence,the government fudged.it adduced evidence that during the sexual relationship broxmeyer took explicit photographs of the couple having sex he challenged to take naked pictures of other field hockey players and broxmeyer took sexually explicit pictures of themselves and sent them to one another while sexting broxmeyer told that he thought the naked pictures sent of herself were nice and hot and broxmeyer made feel as though she did something right by sending him naked pictures either of her or other girls that is unclear.the government also relies heavily on testimony that there were approximately pictures taken during the entire time that she and todd broxmeyer engaged in any kind of sexual act.gov t app.at.but none of this evidence is specific to photos and.some of the evidence reflects encouragement or incitement by broxmeyer that was presumably proscribed by a but there is no evidence that photos and were among those taken at his behest.
our analysis in united states sirois,cir,is not to the contrary.there,the defendant himself took the pornographic pictures,and he was convicted of using the minors in violation of a.in rejecting the sufficiency challenge in that case,we held that a defendant can be found to have used a minor to produce child pornography if the minor serves as the subject of the illicit photographs taken by the defendant.id.at emphasis added.here,the photographs were taken by,not broxmeyer,and to repeat there is no evidence he induced her to take them.
to the extent the district court concluded that the jury could infer that took photos and at broxmeyer prodding,no such inference was available the government presented no evidence bearing on when photos and were taken.in a footnote to its decision and order denying broxmeyer motion,the district court observed that t here was testimony at trial that broxmeyer took photographs while engaging in sexual acts with def.app.at.this is true,but irrelevant.neither photo nor photo showed broxmeyer at all.presumably there is a reason the government did not premise the a counts on the photographs that broxmeyer took of him and having sex but for present purposes,all that matters is that it did not do so.whether broxmeyer took photographs of having sex or,indeed,took sexually explicit photographs of other under girls has no bearing on the sole decisive issue of whether he persuaded,induced,or enticed to produce photos and.
the district court also cited evidence that broxmeyer persuaded,induced,or enticed to send sexually explicit pictures of herself to him.def.app.at emphasis added.as we have explained,however,a applies only to the production of child pornography.distribution is proscribed by,which was not charged.accordingly,a a conviction can not be premised on the fact that broxmeyer persuaded,induced,or enticed to send him her pornographic.
for these reasons,we hold that the government adduced insufficient evidence on which to sustain a conviction under a accordingly,we reverse the convictions on counts one and two.in light of this holding,broxmeyer commerce clause challenge to a has no further bearing on the outcome of this case.however,because the point was closely briefed by the parties and studied by the court,we impart our view,now dicta,that the argument fails in light of the supreme court decision in gonzales raich,d.
count four involves broxmeyer conviction for transporting then year old across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual conduct with her.
was another of broxmeyer field hockey players.she lived in pennsylvania,but on saturdays and a friend would often attend broxmeyer practices in binghamton,new york.usually,they would be driven to and from practice by father,or by the mother of her friend.
consistent with this pattern,early in december,told her father that she wanted to attend practice on saturday,december,in new york.originally,the plan was for to drive her to practice she would spend the night at the home of another friend,who also planned on attending that practice and would return to pick up on the afternoon of sunday,december he could not pick her up sunday in the morning because of a prior family commitment.the plan seems to have changed when parents offered to drive home,to a point where would meet them and take the rest of the way home.
later that week,broxmeyer learned that was coming to practice and that she would spend the night at house.broxmeyer offered to drive home from new york to pennsylvania on sunday morning on his way to a practice scheduled for later that afternoon in new jersey.father and daughter consented,although maintained that he could return to pick up in new york sunday in the afternoon.
events proceeded in accordance with the last of these three arrangements drove to practice in new york on saturday,december stayed the night at home and early sunday morning,broxmeyer picked up to drive her home to pennsylvania.shortly after picking her up and before crossing the line from new york to pennsylvania,broxmeyer stopped at a local sports facility to get some equipment that he needed for his new jersey practice.at his request,went inside to help him carry the equipment.once inside,broxmeyer caused to perform oral sex on him.
broxmeyer then drove from the facility in new york to her home in pennsylvania and told her not to tell anyone about the oral sex 
title,section a of the united states code provides 
a person who knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the age of years in interstate commerce with intent that the individual engage in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than years or for life.
to obtain a conviction under a,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly transported a minor across state lines,with the intent to engage in sexual activity with the minor,and that the minor was under eighteen at the time of the offense.united states chambers,cir.
relevant to this appeal,a is also violated by aiding and abetting the transportation of a minor across state lines.united states holland,cir see also b whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the united states,is punishable as a principal.thus a defendant who causes a minor to be transported across state lines can be convicted under a.holland,at.
took two interstate rides from pennsylvania to new york on saturday,december and from new york to pennsylvania on sunday,december.in denying broxmeyer motion for a judgment of acquittal on count four,the district court focused only on the first ride,under the aiding and abetting theory of b.def.app.at t here was ample evidence upon which the jury could have reasonably concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that broxmeyer purpose in having transported,or causing her to be transported,to new york was to engage in sexual acts with her.emphases added.
we consider both legs of the trip.
pennsylvania to new york.attendance at the december practice was not brought about by broxmeyer.she was going to attend practice that saturday,as she had done on prior occasions her attendance was not contingent on broxmeyer offer to drive her home on december.her father testified that although it would have been difficult for him to pick up on the sunday morning,that would be a big issue as long as friend would mind keeping to the afternoon did seem like there was a big issue with that.def.app.at.he had no reservations about picking her up on sunday afternoon i always had upon it myself sic i was coming up there in the afternoon sunday.emphasis added.id.at.so,he testified,i was either going to come all the way to pick up or broxmeyer had offered to drive her back down.id.at.
the record thereby contradicts the government contention advanced without corresponding citations to the record that broxmeyer caused to travel from pennsylvania to new york because,absent his offer to do so,she would not have come to his practice that saturday 
the government also contends that was unavailable to retrieve from new york on the morning of december.gov t br.at.this is true as far as it goes.but testified that he could have picked her up on sunday afternoon.an afternoon pickup would not have prevented from attending the practice she was planning on an afternoon return before broxmeyer offered to save her father the trip 
accordingly,the pennsylvania to new york trip can not be the basis for broxmeyer a conviction 
new york to pennsylvania.on their way from new york to pennsylvania,but while still in new york,broxmeyer had perform oral sex on him,in violation of new york law.the decisive question disputed by the parties only in the footnotes in their appellate briefs is whether a a conviction can lie where the unlawful sexual act occurs before the crossing of state lines,and where there is no evidence of an intent to commit a sexual act when state lines were crossed.we hold that it can not.
the plain wording of the statute requires that the mens rea of intent coincide with the actus reus of crossing state lines accord david langum,crossing over the line legislating morality and the mann act of chicago press describing a precursor to a and noting that the violation was complete upon the woman crossing of the state line if the man at that time merely intended that the purpose of her travel be for any immoral purpose first emphasis added morissette united states.crime,as a compound concept,generally constituted only from concurrence of an mind with an hand united states desena,cir rejecting on the facts defendant argument that the coincidence of the mens rea and actus reus elements of the offense was not proven because the defendant did not know of the conspiracy to assault until after he took the overt act leading to conspiracy liability.
the eleventh circuit decision in united states hersh,cir,is consonant with our reading of the statute.there,the defendant was convicted of violating b,which then punished a person who travels in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in any sexual act with a person under hersh,at quoting the statute.the court explained,in a passage relevant here,that t he government was required to prove,and did establish,that the defendant had formed the intent to engage in sexual activity with a minor when he crossed state lines.id.at emphasis added.thus,for b,intent was ascertained as of the moment the state line was crossed.section a operates in the same way.
the district court charged the jury consistent with our reading of the statute.see tr.at,explaining that to convict on count four,the jury must find that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt f irst,that the defendant transported an individual across a state line or border s econd,that the defendant did so with the intent that the individual engage in sexual activity.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the convictions on counts one,two,and four,and remand for.
i dissent from the majority holding as to count,in which todd broxmeyer was convicted by a jury of aiding and abetting the transportation of a year old girl over state lines with the intent to engage in unlawful sexual activity with her.
this case illustrates the importance of the institutional role that we play in a direct appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal defendant conviction.that role requires a delicate balance.on the one hand,we must respect the jury essential place in our criminal justice system that respect requires us to defer to a jury conclusions regarding the evidence at a trial.in other words,we may not usurp the role of the jury by substituting our own determination of the weight of the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn for that of the jury.united states heras,cir internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,fundamental principles of justice require that a jury decision to convict must rest on competent evidence adduced by the government at trial,and we must be satisfied that the evidence is capable of establishing the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.see id.in short,we must accept a jury assessment of actual evidence,but not its speculation,when reviewing the imposition of criminal sanctions.
based on these principles,i agree with the majority that there was insufficient evidence to support broxmeyer conviction as to counts and.vacatur is appropriate because these counts relate to two sexually explicit photographs that took of herself,and there is no evidence in the record regarding when during the year those specific images were produced.
but the same can not be said with respect to count.to obtain a conviction on this count,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that broxmeyer transported,or caused her to be transported,over the pennsylvania new york border,while intending to engage in illegal sexual activity with her,and that was less than eighteen years old at the time.see op.at.with respect to the first element,which is the only one in dispute,the government was permitted to seek a conviction based on an aiding and abetting theory.see id.
our role here is clear we must assess the evidence regarding why it is that drove his daughter from pennsylvania to new york on the morning of december,the question for the jury was whether the government proved,beyond a reasonable doubt,that broxmeyer caused to transport across state lines by promising to bring her home to pennsylvania the next day.the jury answered yes to that question.the only issue for us,then,is whether there was sufficient evidence to support its conclusion.i would answer that question in the affirmative.
one of the most important portions of testimony regarding this issue came during his direct examination.i quote it here in full
