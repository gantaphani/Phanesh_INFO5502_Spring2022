background 
we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.glasser united states.
from about january to about march,vitale,hoblin,and trantino participated in a scheme to defraud fleet bank.they took advantage of fleet bank easy business banking provided to small businesses loans of up to through an expedited process with limited documentary submitting fraudulent loan applications.hoblin was a accountant who prepared individual income tax returns for his clients.he and vitale concocted the fraudulent loan documents by creating phony corporations with fictitious financial information and using names,addresses,tax identification numbers,and income tax returns of hoblin unknowing clients to fill in the gaps.trantino,who was a business officer at fleet bank,would sign each application as a witness and forward the application to the underwriting unit,knowing that the information being submitted was false obtained without hoblin clients permission.working together,vitale,hoblin,and trantino secured five easy business banking loans,each for the maximum.
as each loan was nearing approval,a bank account was opened for each entity.two persons were designated to issue checks on each account on four of the accounts vitale or a relative of vitale and the person in whose name the loan application had been submitted were authorized to draw on the funds on the fifth account,a relative of hoblin was named along with the unwitting applicant.once the monies were deposited in the accounts,vitale,hoblin,and trantino made withdrawals totaling.
on may,a jury found vitale guilty of all five counts of bank fraud,and on august,vitale was sentenced by the district court.
a trantino substance abuse treatment records 
trantino,who pled guilty to charges of bank fraud was a government witness.prior to trial,the government informed defense counsel that trantino had abused narcotic pain killers during the relevant period of time and that he currently was enrolled in a drug abuse treatment program.
defense counsel subpoenaed trantino records from the orchard drug rehabilitation clinic.the apt foundation,which owned and operated the orchard drug rehabilitation clinic,moved to quash the subpoena,arguing that the information was protected from disclosure.
vitale argued that because trantino had admitted to the heavy use of painkillers during the bank fraud scheme and drug addiction when he was discussing the case with the fbi,the substance abuse treatment records were relevant to trantino ability to recall and relate pertinent events as well as to his general credibility.he argued that access to the records was necessary to trantino.vitale counsel also speculated that trantino referral to a substance abuse treatment program after his arrest was facilitated by the government,raising a concern of possible bias.the government assured the court that it had not intervened in trantino state drug charges.the district court then conducted an in camera review of the records and reserved its rulings.
during his direct examination,trantino testified that he had sustained a neck injury in.he was prescribed and took vicodin for this injury until early,when he had surgery to repair his neck.after the surgery,trantino was prescribed another narcotic painkiller,tylox,which he used for another weeks.trantino claimed that neither painkiller affected his performance at the bank.
after this portion of the direct examination,the district court,over the objection of trantino counsel and after its own in camera review,summarized for the parties the information contained in trantino substance abuse treatment records.the court stated that it wanted vitale counsel to have all arguably germane information in order for the defense to fully and thoroughly trantino consistent with the right to confrontation.
outside the presence of the jury,the district court related that starting at age at some point in,long after the transactions at issue here,trantino began to use heroin.the court then summarized trantino lengthy substance abuse treatment i in mid to,outpatient detoxification treatment for four days,which occurred around the time of his initial contact with the fbi ii inpatient treatment for three days in early and iii further inpatient treatment in.the records indicated that trantino last used heroin in march of.since that time,trantino had received methadone treatments,although it was unclear whether those continued at the time of trial.the district court further revealed that trantino had abused cocaine occasionally from the time he was years old until his treatment for heroin but that the records were not clear as to the quantity or frequency of cocaine usage.summing up,the district court stated 
i think that a reasonably accurate summary of a rather voluminous record.and i will leave it to you to proceed from there.
if trantino testifies consistently with that information,then i would see no reason why i should order that the documents be disclosed to you.if that does happen,then maybe there would be good cause or adequate cause for some further disclosure.
defense counsel then moved that the physical records be disclosed pursuant to vitale rights under the confrontation clause and that the records be sealed and marked for appellate review.the district court did not issue a final ruling on the matter,preferring to see how it unfolds.
trantino admitted to the information summarized by the judge,and the district court made no additional disclosures.during,defense counsel again questioned trantino about his drug use and rehabilitation.
b juror contact 
on april,jury selection for another,unrelated case was being conducted while the pool of jurors for vitale case,including juror barbara setlow,was probably present in the courtroom.during voir dire for the first case a potential juror remarked that she thought assistant united states attorney lisa perkins was related to someone she knew who had a different last name.perkins stated that her husband name was sparkowski.the juror indicated that she knew perkins.another potential juror raised his hand and asked perkins if her husband name was jason sparkowski,indicating that he had attended high school with a jason sparkowski.perkins revealed that her husband was indeed jason sparkowski.jason sparkowski was not discussed at any other time during voir dire for the first case.
during the voir dire in vitale case,jason sparkowski name was never mentioned.when setlow introduced herself to the court,she stated that she was a biochemist with the uconn health center and that her husband works at the same place and does the same thing.later events,described below,revealed that jason sparkowski,perkins husband,was also a biologist at the university of connecticut health center uchc.nevertheless,perkins remained silent as setlow was selected as a juror.
on may,following the jury verdict,perkins sent a letter to judge chatigny disclosing the following.jason sparkowski had been a student in the biochemistry graduate program at uchc from.during this time,peter setlow,the juror husband,was a professor in the biochemistry department.while sparkowski was a student at uchc,he had frequent contact with setlow but never socialized with him.he did,however,know barbara setlow to be the spouse of setlow.
according to the letter,sparkowski left connecticut in and lived in washington,until.during these ten years,sparkowski had no contact with the setlows.sparkowski and perkins married in.in june,sparkowski returned to uchc as an assistant research professor but only had brief,passing conversations with setlow.
the letter stated that,on may,sparkowski attended vitale trial for approximately forty minutes.he thought he recognized setlow,the juror,as an acquaintance of setlow.perkins did not know that sparkowski attended the trial until that evening.whether he mentioned his recognition of the juror was not revealed in the letter.after the conclusion of the trial,perkins called sparkowski to inform him of the jury verdict.this prompted sparkowski to go to setlow lab to ask him if his wife had recently served on a jury.when sparkowski arrived at setlow lab,both setlows were there.barbara confirmed that she had recently served on the jury,and sparkowski indicated that he had recognized her when he observed the trial.according to perkins letter,juror setlow made no mention of having seen or recognized him,and no details of the jury deliberation were revealed in this conversation.
based on perkins letter,the defense moved for an evidentiary hearing on potential juror bias.vitale counsel argued that perkins letter was a view of what occurred no affidavits from jason sparkowski or either of the setlows were submitted to the that it was appropriate for the court to further investigate the matter.defense counsel made it clear that he was not accusing anyone of anything at this point and that no motion for a new trial had been made.he simply wanted to call sparkowski and the setlows to obtain their version of the events and the relationships between them.defense counsel also indicated that had he been aware of the professional relationship between sparkowski and the setlows that he would have moved to disqualify setlow for cause.
after also hearing argument from perkins,the court issued the following decision 
as a practical matter,a judge in this situation might think that the better part of valor would be to simply go ahead and call the juror in and see what she has to say.i tempted to do that because i have little doubt that we could resolve this very quickly.
on the other hand,the court of appeals has rightly emphasized that such post trial inquiries of jurors should not be undertaken lightly.i agree that there needs to be a substantial showing to warrant that type of inquiry no matter how convenient it might be to the court.
and applying the standard articulated in the moon case united states sun myung moon,cir,i think the defendant request should be denied.as defense counsel properly acknowledges,he is saying that there was an impropriety,he does know that there was.he asks me to conduct this inquiry to find out if maybe there was some kind of an impropriety.it is entirely speculative.and i do think it is implausible to support that there was an impropriety.
in that context,i think this coincidental post trial contact is just that,and i do think it warrants a postponement of the sentencing hearing.
so the request for an evidentiary hearing to determine the existence of juror bias is denied 
discussion 
vitale advances three arguments on appeal.he contends that the district court denial of access to the substance abuse treatment records violated his sixth amendment rights to confront and trantino,that the district court erred by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on juror bias,and that he is entitled to a resentencing.we address each issue in turn.
a vitale sixth amendment right to confrontation and 
alleged violations of the confrontation clause are reviewed de novo,subject to harmless error analysis.united states saget,cir citing united states tropeano,cir united states mcclain,cir.even if error is found,a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.delaware van arsdall,d.
the sixth amendment to the constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him.davis alaska,d quoting const.amend.vi.confrontation includes the right to the witness.see also pennsylvania ritchie,d plurality opinion with respect to part.is the principal means to show that a witness is biased,or that the testimony is exaggerated or unbelievable.ritchie,at.a party may conduct a general attack on the credibility of the witness,or it may mount a more particular attack on the witness credibility by revealing possible biases,prejudices,or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand.davis,at.however,a judge may impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.van arsdall,at.see also united states sasso,cir.
restricting access to medical or psychological records may deny a defendant the right to confrontation because e vidence of a witness psychological history may be admissible when it goes to her credibility.sasso,at citing.b see also united states lindstrom,cir united states partin,cir.in assessing the probative value of such evidence,the court should consider such factors as the nature of the psychological problem,the temporal recency or remoteness of the history,and whether the witness suffered from the problem at the time of the events to which she is to testify,so that it may have affected her ability to perceive or to recall events or to testify accurately.sasso,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
however,the failure to produce a psychiatric report does not in itself effect a constitutional deprivation where the report does not contain evidence of any deep or sustained mental problems which would directly bear upon the credibility of the witness.white jones.moreover,when the records do not reflect treatment for mental disorders but rather reflect treatment for drug addiction,the introduction of the complete records is not warranted because they are not,as a whole,probative of credibility.united states thompson,cir.
we see no error in the denial of access to trantino substance abuse treatment records.although defense counsel was not allowed to review the physical records,the trial court did not limit the scope or nature of defense counsel in any way.delaware fensterer,d.the district court conducted an in camera review of the records and disclosed to all parties those portions of the records that were arguably germane.the district court summary apprised the defendant of the nature of trantino drug abuse,including incidental cocaine use,and his rehabilitation treatments.the jury acquired the same information during direct and.
the court permitted vitale counsel wide latitude when trantino about his drug use and rehabilitation,including questions about the effects that the drugs had on his ability to perceive events when they occurred as well as on his memory at the time of trial.the leeway granted was generous given that the records reflected trantino treatment several years after the pertinent events and had marginal probative value concerning trantino mental capacity during the events about which he testified.sasso,at probative value of treatment history depends on temporal recency see also thompson,at.
physical access to all the drug rehabilitation treatment records would not have provided defense counsel additional avenues to impeach trantino credibility.vitale was therefore not denied the right to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness,davis,at,and the jury was well aware of all the drug abuse and treatment to make a discriminating appraisal of the particular witness credibility,united states,cir.therefor
