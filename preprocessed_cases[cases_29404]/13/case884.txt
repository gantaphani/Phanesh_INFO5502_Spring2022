marwan youssef albathani,a native and citizen of lebanon,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeal bia summary affirmance of an immigration judge denial of his application for asylum,withholding of deportation,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.his case raises a challenge,new for this court,to the validity of the bia streamlining procedures adopted in.a amended by.
albathani,a maronite christian,sought asylum on the basis that he feared persecution by members of hezbollah active in lebanon.he arrived in the united states in january without any valid documents permitting entry.he was taken into custody by the ins and had an initial interview and a subsequent credible fear interview he was found to have a credible fear of persecution.he was allowed to remain in the united states pending a hearing on his asylum and other claims.at the hearing in september,the immigration judge ij found albathani story not credible and denied his application.her finding was affirmed by the bia in a summary affirmance under a.
albathani challenges this ruling on several grounds both that his hearing before the ij denied him due process of law,for several reasons,and that the summary affirmance procedure itself violates due process.additionally,an amici curiae brief filed by the american immigration law foundation,the new england chapter of the american immigration lawyers association,and the massachusetts law reform institute argues that the summary affirmance procedure also violates rules of administrative law we affirm.
from the to the,political power has been shared in lebanon between members of different religious communities.the president is traditionally a maronite christian,while the prime minister is traditionally a sunni muslim.lebanon parliament is also divided on a system of proportional representation based on religion.this compromise broke down in the,however.between and,lebanon was wracked by conflict,both between lebanese christians and muslims,and among foreign forces.according to the state department,military forces control much of the country.see malek ins,cir.a variety of militias are associated with different groups in lebanon,both foreign and domestic.the conflict between two of those militias is pertinent here the lebanese forces,a rightist,christian militia,and hezbollah,an islamicist militia with foreign support.
the lebanese forces was affiliated with the christian phalangist militia,a maronite group which had fought against muslim nationalists in,touching off lebanon civil war.the lebanese forces was founded in.in,it was licensed as a political party,but in it was banned and a number of members were arrested because of alleged involvement in the bombing of a church.the leader of the lebanese forces,samir geagea,was also arrested and charged with the murder of a political rival.in,geagea was found guilty and sentenced to death,although the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.subsequently,geagea was charged with the assassination of muslim prime minister rashid karami.other members of the lebanese forces were convicted of a bus bombing in syria which killed eleven people.
hezbollah,meanwhile,is a shia muslim political group backed by iran.it became prominent in the in battles against israeli forces in southern lebanon.in lebanon,hezbollah operates in the bekaa valley,the southern suburbs of beirut,and southern lebanon.it is known or suspected to have been involved in terrorist attacks including the truck bombings of the embassy and marine barracks in beirut in october.see dep t of state,background information on foreign terrorist organizations,available at http.on november,hezbollah was added to the list of terrorists and groups linked to terrorism covered by executive order,which blocked access to their assets.see dep t of state,comprehensive list of terrorists and groups identified under executive order,available at http.
marwan albathani,a maronite christian,was born in lebanon on november,and grew up in the midst of this conflict.members of his family were involved in the lebanese forces,including an older brother,who was a captain of the lebanese forces in the dikwane district of beirut.albathani lived in beirut,as did some of his sisters and brothers.his father and other sisters lived in deir,approximately two hours to the east of beirut.other of his relatives lived in the united states.albathani sometimes worked in beirut,sometimes not when he worked it was as either a car mechanic or a car dealer.albathani asserted that after persecution by members of hezbollah he decided to flee lebanon.
albathani traveled to cyprus in november,where he applied for a tourist visa to the united states but did not seek refugee status.on his application,albathani claimed that he was married,that he worked as an electrician,that he had no relatives in the united states,and that he had no intention of working or studying in the united states all untrue.albathani visa application was denied.albathani then returned to cyprus in january,with a visa to panama,purchased a plane ticket to panama by way of london and miami,and got off in miami on january.he was immediately taken into custody by ins officers.
initial ins interview 
that day an ins officer with a translator interviewed albathani.albathani said he was escaping from lebanon because of the hezbollah,which was harassing him because he was not muslim.he said that he was a car salesman,and that both his mother and brother resided legally in the united states.albathani admitted that he had no intention of going to panama and wanted to stay in the united states.based on this initial interview,the ins officer scheduled a further credible fear interview.
credible fear interview 
during his credible fear interview on january,three different interpreters were required before one was found who could understand albathani difficult accent.albathani told the interviewing ins officer that he had served as a regular soldier in the lebanese forces for five years.his problems began in the at that time whenever he visited his family in deir he was stopped and questioned by members of hezbollah.on one occasion,three months before he left lebanon,according to albathani,he was stopped for four hours.he and his brother were tied up,albathani was slapped in the face,they were placed in the trunk of a car,and robbed of and some jewelry.albathani attributed this to hezbollah knowledge that he was a member of the lebanese forces.he said that he was arrested several times,but could not provide a specific number.he had to leave lebanon because he feared being kidnapped by hezbollah members.
based on this interview,albathani was found to have a credible fear of prosecution based on membership in a particular social group,namely the lebanese forces.the officer found that he was credible,that his testimony was detailed,internally consistent,consistent with country conditions and any other extrinsic evidence,and that there was a significant possibility that he could establish eligibility for asylum.albathani was subsequently allowed to move from miami to new hampshire,where his family was located 
asylum hearing 
albathani had submitted an application for asylum on october,in miami.he admitted his illegal entry and conceded deportability.his application for asylum described two assaults by hezbollah.in the first,in april,he claimed he was stopped,interrogated,jailed in the town of vaibalk,beaten and left by a roadside.he said he was then picked up and taken to a hospital,where he remained in a coma for over two weeks.in the second,more than two years later,he asserted he was again stopped and beaten,robbed of his car and money,and his life was threatened.albathani said that this assault took place in december,although in both his credible fear interview and the subsequent hearing before the ij he dated it earlier,in either september or october.no mention is made of a later threat.albathani also described his work in the lebanese forces in greater detail,alleging that he had been a member since,that he worked as a secretary from to,and that from to he served as bodyguard for the group leader.albathani sought asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.
albathani asylum hearing took place in boston,after he was granted a change of venue from miami.in the hearing before the ij on september,albathani had one interpreter the ij expressed concerns that the interpreter had not brought an arabic dictionary and had engaged in numerous colloquies with albathani.albathani was the only witness.
albathani testified about two beatings on the road to his parents house which were sketched out in his asylum application.we summarize what he said.the lebanese forces had ceased to participate as a political party as of,and had fallen apart,prior to both incidents.the area around his parents house was controlled by hezbollah.hezbollah had a list of names of those who had served in the lebanese forces.in,when driving alone,albathani was stopped by individuals he recognized as hezbollah because of distinctive flags on their cars.they asked for his id,took all his belongings,blindfolded him and hit him.albathani lost consciousness during the beating and woke up in a hospital.albathani reported this to the police,who declined to get involved with incidents.when asked if he had a copy of the police report,the interpreter reported his reply as,no,he was worried about the problem,w hen they told me that they ca help me when it comes to hezbollah.
in the next two years,there were no further incidents.that was because albathani was so afraid he did not go out.when questioned on this point he replied he did not mean he was afraid to go out,or to leave the house in beirut,but he did not dare drive to see his parents.he did,however,travel to syria and return to lebanon sometime in the fall of,shortly before the second beating.as to the incident,albathani testified to the following.in september or october,albathani was travelling with his younger brother and a friend to his parents house when they were stopped at a hezbollah roadblock.albathani was again asked for his id,his belongings were taken,and he was beaten on his head and hands.hezbollah asked him how long he had been with the lebanese forces.afraid,he denied he had ever been.as he was being beaten,his captors told him say that you were in the lebanese forces,otherwise you die.albathani was again left unconscious,and woke up in a hospital.his younger brother was blindfolded,but not beaten or robbed.
on both occasions,albathani stolen by hezbollah.he had scars on his back,hands and head as a result of the two beatings.the ij suggested that photographs of them should be submitted so it would be in the record,but declined to make a closer firsthand examination of the scars.the record shows the ij had a clear view of petitioner during the hearing.
in december,members of the hezbollah went to albathani sister house and told her if he stays over here he should consider death for himself.the first time he was able to run away,but now it going to be death for him.shortly thereafter,he looked for help to leave lebanon.the message triggered his flight to the united states in january.
during the period of the incidents,albathani left lebanon twice once to syria for two days,and once to cyprus for two days.he returned to lebanon each time.while in cyprus in november,he filled out a visa application,which contained falsehoods.during the hearing before the ij,he explained the falsehoods by saying that someone else,possibly his brother,filled out the application he just signed it.
the ij rendered an oral decision the same day as the hearing.she rejected albathani claim for relief under the convention against torture because he had not shown injury at the hands of the government.she also rejected albathani application for asylum and withholding of deportation.the ij found albathani testimony not credible,noted that he ran into difficulty with hezbollah only when he drove the road to his parents house,credited that he had been robbed but observed that his brother who was with him during the incident was neither harmed nor robbed,and commented that albathani had returned to lebanon from cyprus after the incidents.
the ij found albathani testimony not credible for a number of reasons.the details of the incidents varied from telling to telling,and there were internal contradictions in his account.for example,he claimed at the asylum hearing to be unconscious after the beating,but said in the earlier interview that he and his brother had been slapped and their money taken,they were forced into the trunk of a car,and driven to a dark place and left.not only did he not mention being unconscious,he even described the place he was confined.moreover,in the later account,albathani said that his brother was unharmed,not placed in the trunk of a car,and did not have anything stolen from him.the ij concluded that this,and other inconsistencies,were material differences that made albathani a less than credible witness.
the ij also noted that albathani had not produced corroborative evidence in the form of testimony by relatives who were in the united states.his mother lived in boston and recently had become an american citizen,but,for whatever reason,had left the country two weeks before the scheduled hearing before the ij.she might have confirmed his testimony that she was at his hospital bedside after the incident.he also had an uncle in boston and his brother and cousin lived in the united states,none of whom testified on his behalf.
the ij cited albathani abuse of immigration procedures,both in filling out the application for a tourist visa fraudulently,and in not filing for admission to the united states as a refugee from persecution at the united states embassy in cyprus.see generally describing normal asylum procedures.
the ij also questioned whether the attacks were motivated by political reasons,noting that albathani was robbed on both occasions,and deprived of not one but two mercedes.he also lost a large amount of money by his own account in one gold jewelry.she concluded,at least one of the motives of the person stopping the car clearly appears to be robbery.
finally,the ij surmised that albathani could have avoided further incidents by relocation,either by leaving lebanon,or by changing his behavior.she cited albathani visits to syria and cyprus as evidence of his ability to avoid persecution without seeking asylum in the united states.she concluded that albathani goal was to come to the united states,not to avoid persecution.the ij also focused on the fact that both incidents took place in a single road between beirut and deir.she suggested that albathani could have avoided the problem in lebanon by seeking alternative routes or means of transportation to his parents home.
in sum,the ij concluded that albathani had not shown a credible fear of persecution on one of the statutory grounds for asylum.because he failed to meet the test for asylum,he could not meet the more stringent test for withholding of removal.he also was not entitled to relief under article of the convention against torture as he had not shown he had been tortured at the hands of the government the ij ordered him deported from the united states.albathani appealed the ij decision to the bia on october.on april,utilizing the summary affirmance procedure,the bia affirmed without opinion the results of the ij decision.
petitioner characterizes his challenge of the decision as being on due process grounds.he does not directly raise a claim that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence,but asserts instead that the decision improperly overlooked evidence,that the judge improperly hurried the hearing along,and that she berated the interpreter.the first ground is,in our view,just a variation on a substantial evidence challenge,and so we apply the usual substantial evidence standard.see,mediouni ins,cir ins,cir.determinations of eligibility for asylum or withholding deportation are conclusive if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d internal quotation omitted.
to reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it.id.at.see also b b t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.ins,cir no reversal unless the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.merely identifying alternative findings that could be supported by substantial evidence is insufficient to supplant the bia findings.see arkansas oklahoma,d.
the ins is not entitled to extreme deference,although our review is deferential.gailius ins,cir.review of the bia decisions is conducted on the basis of the entire record,not merely the evidence that supports the bia conclusions.id.additionally,this court reviews the bia legal conclusions de novo,although it gives deference,where appropriate,to the agency interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.debab ins,cir internal quotation omitted.
because the more likely than not standard for withholding deportation is more stringent than that for asylum,a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails,a fortiori,to satisfy the former.mediouni,at.w ithholding is mandatory if an alien establishes that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.ins,d quoting ins stevic,d.for that reason,we consider first the denial of albathani application for asylum.
denial of the application for asylum 
the burden of proof for establishing eligibility for asylum lies on the petitioner.a.applicants must show either past persecution or fear of future persecution.id.b.such past or future persecution must be based on race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.b.the petitioner bears the burden of providing conclusive evidence that he was targeted on any of the five grounds.velásquez ashcroft,cir see,at finding that petitioner failed to carry his burden in proving past persecution because his account lacked the requisite degree of specificity,and because the vague evidence of alleged persecution that the petitioner adduced failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the events that he described and any ground enumerated.
here,we conduct our substantial evidence review of the ij decision regarding asylum and withholding of deportation rather than the bia opinion.ordinarily,courts of appeals review decisions of the bia,and not those of an ij.when the bia does not render its own opinion,however,and either defers to or adopts the opinion of the ij,a court of appeals must then review the decision of the ij.gao ashcroft,cir.
the burden was on albathani to show that he was persecuted based on his membership in a particular social group,or for his political opinions.see b.we assume arguendo that membership in the lebanese forces satisfies the particular social group or political opinion categories.the difficulty for albathani is that the ij did not find him credible on these claims.accepting that he had been robbed and beaten by hezbollah,the ij did not find this to be persecution based on one of the five categories.the record provides adequate reason for doubt.the two incidents on the road may well have been,as the ij suggested,nothing more than the robbery of someone driving a mercedes with cash in his pocket.the ij thought albathani fear of persecution was undercut by his twice returning to lebanon after trips abroad.
it is true that the ij did not specifically comment on his significant hezbollah later visited his sister house and threatened him,and that this visit led him to seek refuge in the united states.but there was reason to doubt the event occurred only albathani word established it,and there was a conspicuous lack of corroborating evidence from his family members in america.this is not an instance of the ins improperly insisting on evidence that was not likely to be available to a refugee.see,gailius,at.there is nothing in the record to establish that albathani was denied communication with his family in america.he was represented by counsel,and his cousin was present at one hearing with him.indeed,albathani was living with his brother in new hampshire at the time of the hearing,and his aunt was present at an earlier hearing.he was also in contact with his older brother,then in brazil,who had been in the lebanese forces and could have corroborated much of his story.
petitioner argues that the ij ignored evidence of albathani limited capacities in making her decision.we do not find support for this.the ij decision acknowledges albathani limited education he left school at and claim that he had head trouble since his beatings in her decision.his inarticulateness at the hearing was recognized by both the ij and his own counsel.the ij also noted albathani tendency to fluctuate on dates during the hearing,but did not rely on such changes in her decision.for example,during the hearing albathani initially testified that his travel to syria took place in,even though he had already left for the united states by that date.he also demonstrated a tendency to agree with whatever assertion was put to him.during,albathani said that during his trip to syria,he had received passport stamps from both the syrian and lebanese border guards,testimony which was belied by his passport.the ij took these limitations into account,commenting during the hearing that she did not hold his inarticulateness against him.
albathani inconsistency problems go well beyond mere fluctuations.he showed a pattern of embellishing his story.in each context,albathani added a new incident.he originally described a single beating the one in his credible fear interview.he did not mention at that time that he was hospitalized as a result of this beating.then,in his application,albathani added a incident,complete with hospitalization and a coma,as well as expanding the later incident to include almost a week hospitalization.at the hearing itself,albathani mentioned for the first time a second incident in,the december threat delivered to his sister.given this pattern,we find adequate support for the ij reservations regarding albathani credibility.
as petitioner points out,some instances in the record support his credibility.one example is his correct identification of a lebanese forces commander.it is also true that the ij did not explicitly discuss the country conditions report for lebanon,admitted into evidence,other than as useful background.these reports provide some support for albathani claimed fear of kidnapping and murder.hezbollah is reported to detain and mistreat prisoners from groups to which it is opposed.there is no evidence,however,of a pattern of kidnappings by hezbollah in the last decade,although kidnapping was widespread during the civil war.but these reports would not have straightened out the inconsistencies in albathani own stories.
on our review of the entire record,we do not find evidence sufficient to compel reversal of the denial of albathani asylum claim he,a fortiori,fails to satisfy the standard for withholding of deportation.see velásquez,at.
due process 
albathani raises before us a challenge he did not raise in such terms before the bia a procedural due process challenge to the ij conduct of his hearing.he alleges that the ij improperly berated the interpreter,rushed the hearing along,sharply him,and refused to examine evidence of his beatings in the form of scars.respondent says that any due process claim is waived.see mendes ins,cir holding that petitioner waived his due process claim by failing to raise it at his deportation hearing,at his hearing for suspension of deportation,or before the bia.we bypass the waiver question because the claim is easily determined to be meritless,and because he raised similar arguments,under a different label,to the bia.
as an unadmitted alien present in the united states,albathani due process rights are limited.see kaplan tod.presence in the country immaterial because excluded alien was still in theory of law at the boundary line and had gained no foothold in the united states.as a result,many constitutional protections are unavailable to albathani.see zadvydas davis,d see also shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.whatever the procedure authorized by congress is,it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.internal quotation omitted.
moreover,even if albathani were an admitted alien,the problems he describes still would not rise to the level of a due process violation.albathani real complaint is that he may have been misunderstood and that his lack of credibility was simply a function of bad interpreting.but there is nothing to suggest this is so.at the hearing,neither albathani nor his counsel questioned the accuracy of the translation by the interpreter at the ij hearing.even now,albathani does not identify points in the hearing where the translation was inaccurate or misleading.
the ij was,at times,short in her treatment of the interpreter,but may have had cause.o rdinary efforts at courtroom administration do not mean that the hearing was unfair,even where the judge was stern and.morales ins,cir.similarly,the ij attempts to expedite proceedings are not the stuff of which a due process violation can be fashioned,at.indeed,albathani own counsel sought to expedite the hearing so that he could keep a scheduled court appearance that afternoon.the ij of albathani is expressly authorized by regulation.see c the asylum officer shall have authority to question the applicant and any witnesses.moreover,with regard to the scars,albathani counsel chose not to request more time to submit photographs.
albathani had a full and fair hearing.
petitioner,supported by amici,challenges the bia affirmance without opinion awo procedure under which the ij decision was upheld.petitioner claims that awo violates due process amici argue that it violates rules of administrative law both say there must be a more substantive statement of the reasons for the bia decision.
the context of the claim is important.an alien has no constitutional right to any administrative appeal at all.guentchev ins,cir see also abney united states,d no constitutional right to appeal in criminal cases.such administrative appeal rights as exist are created by regulations promulgated by the attorney general.see b.
the attorney general first adopted the awo procedure at issue in.rather than the usual review,the affirmance without opinion procedure allowed for review of a case by a single member,who would affirm the ij decision with the statement the board affirms,without opinion,the result of the decision below.a iii the awo procedure was limited to certain categories of cases,designated by the chairman of the bia,see id.at i.once the case was selected by the chairman,review was permissible where the board member found that the case fit certain criteria 
ii the single board member to whom a case is assigned may affirm the decision of the service or the immigration judge,without opinion,if the board member determines that the result reached in the decision under review was correct that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial and that 
a the issue on appeal is squarely controlled by existing board or federal court precedent and does not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation or 
b the factual and legal questions raised on appeal are so insubstantial that review is not warranted.
iii if the board member determines that the decision should be affirmed without opinion,the board shall issue an order that reads as follows the board affirms,without opinion,the result of the decision below.the decision below is,therefore,the final agency determination.see cfr a.an order affirming without opinion,issued under authority of this provision,shall not include further explanation or reasoning.such an order approves the result reached in the decision below it does not necessarily imply approval of all of the reasoning of that decision,but does signify the board conclusion that any errors in the decision of the immigration judge or the service were harmless or nonmaterial.
id.at a a further provision provided for the single member to return the case for full consideration in the event that he or she determined that it was not suitable for determination.id.at iv.
promulgation of the awo regulations is within the power of the ins a dministrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.
petitioner and amici present two theories in their challenge to the awo procedure.the first is that the bia decision is the final decision and a bia summary affirmance does not provide a reasoned basis for review.the second is that a summary affirmance provides no way for courts to police the bia to see that it is actually doing its job according to the regulations it has promulgated.albathani and amici argue that the awo procedure violates a basic principle of administrative law the requirement that agencies provide reasoned bases for their decision.as classically formulated in sec chenery.
if the administrative action is to be tested by the basis upon which it purports to rest,that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable.it will not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency action nor can a court be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive.
id.at.but both overlook the plain language of chenery,which refers to agencies in their entirety,not individual components of agencies.here,the relevant presented a statement of reasons for its decision,albeit from the ij rather than the bia.chenery does not require that this statement come from the bia rather than the ij.
the bia can adopt,without further explication,the ij opinion.see chen ins,cir w e join eight of our sister circuits in ruling that the board need not write at length merely to repeat the ij findings of fact and his reasons for denying the requested relief,but,rather,having given individualized consideration to a particular case,may simply state that it affirms the ij decision for the reasons set forth in that decision.listing cases.
the contention here is that the awo procedure is distinguishable from chen because it permits affirmance without opinion even when the bia disagrees with the ij reasoning.the awo regulation does indeed allow such an affirmance.because the summary affirmance is only of the result and not the reasoning,this means that courts of appeals are forced to review a decision which may or may not contain the reasoning of the bia.the court thus reviews the bia decision without knowing its basis.the summary affirmance scheme does create these problems,but they do not render the scheme a violation of due process or render judicial review impossible.nor does the scheme violate any statute.
the courts will continue to have the ij decision and the record upon which it is based available for review.see also b a t he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.this permits a court to carry out an intelligent review.
in functional terms,if the bia does not independently state a correct ground for affirmance in a case in which the reasoning proffered by the ij is faulty,the bia risks reversal on appeal.one of the several justifications for chenery requirement for explicit reasons derives from a limitation on the courts ability to substitute different grounds.a reviewing court must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.chenery,at.see also fed.power comm texaco,d a n agency order must be upheld,if at all,on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself.in short,if the bia identifies an alternative satisfactory ground for upholding denial of asylum in a case with an otherwise unsatisfactory decision by the ij,it must state it or
