the patent act provision authorizes district courts to award attorney fees to prevailing parties in exceptional cases.in brooks furniture,dutailier int l,the federal circuit defined an exceptional case as one which either involves material inappropriate conduct or is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.brooks furniture also requires that parties establish the exceptional nature of a case by clear and convincing evidence.at.

held the brooks furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissibly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.
a section imposes one and only one constraint on district courts discretion to award attorney fees the power is reserved for exceptional cases.because the patent act does not define exceptional,the term is construed in accordance with its ordinary meaning.sebelius cloer.in,when congress used the word in and today,for that matter,e xceptional meant uncommon,rare,or not ordinary.webster new international dictionary ed.an exceptional case,then,is simply one that stands out from others with to the substantive strength of a party litigating position considering both the governing law and the facts of the case or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.district courts may determine whether a case is exceptional in the exercise of their discretion,considering the totality of the circumstances.fogerty fantasy.
b the brooks furniture framework superimposes an inflexible framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.
brooks furniture is too restrictive in defining the two categories of cases in which fee awards are allowed.the first category cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct appears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct.but that is not the appropriate benchmark.a district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party unreasonable,though not independently sanctionable,conduct is so exceptional as to justify an award.for litigation to fall within the second category,a district court must determine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.but a case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from cases to be exceptional.the federal circuit imported this second category from professional real estate investors,columbia pictures industries,but that case standard finds no roots in text and makes little sense in the context of the determination.
brooks furniture is so demanding that it would appear to render largely superfluous.because courts already possess the inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad faith,see alyeska pipeline service wilderness society,this court has declined to construe provisions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous.see,christiansburg garment eeoc.
brooks furniture requirement that proof of entitlement to fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by,which imposes no specific evidentiary burden.nor has this court interpreted comparable statutes to require such a burden of proof.see,fogerty,s,at.

justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
section of the patent act authorizes a district court to award attorney fees in patent litigation.it provides,in its entirety,that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.in brooks furniture,dutailier int l,the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit held that a case may be deemed exceptional under only in two limited circumstances when there has been some material inappropriate conduct,or when the litigation is both brought in subjective bad faith and objectively baseless.at.the question before us is whether the brooks furniture framework is consistent with the statutory text.we hold that it is not.
prior to,the patent act did not authorize the awarding of attorney fees to the prevailing party in patent litigation.rather,the american rule governed e ach litigant pa id his own attorney fees,win or lose marx general revenue,slip,at.in,congress amended the patent act to add a discretionary provision,then codified in,which stated that a court may in its discretion award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.ed.
courts did not award fees under as a matter of course.they viewed the award of fees not as a penalty for failure to win a patent infringement suit,but as appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances.perkins.the provision enabled them to address unfairness or bad faith in the conduct of the losing party,or some other equitable consideration of similar force,which made a case so unusual as to warrant.see also pennsylvania crusher bethlehem steel,listing as adequate justification s for fee awards fraud practiced on the patent office or vexatious or unjustified litigation 
six years later,congress amended the provision and recodified it as.whereas had specified that a district court could in its discretion award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party,the revised language of which remains in force today provides that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.we have observed,in interpreting the damages provision of the patent act,that the addition of the phrase exceptional cases to was for purposes of clarification only.general motors devex,see also,at.and the parties agree that the recodification did not substantively alter the meaning of the statute 
for three decades after the enactment of,courts applied it as they had applied in a discretionary manner,assessing various factors to determine whether a given case was sufficiently exceptional to warrant a fee award.see,true temper steel,kearney trecker giddings lewis,siebring hansen.
in,congress created the federal circuit and vested it with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases.in the two decades that followed,the federal circuit,like the regional circuits before it,instructed district courts to consider the totality of the circumstances when making fee determinations under.see,rohm haas crystal chemical,cases decided under have noted that the substitution of the phrase in exceptional cases has not done away with the discretionary feature yamanouchi pharmaceutical,danbury pharmacal,in assessing whether a case qualifies as exceptional,the district court must look at the totality of the circumstances 
in,however,the federal circuit abandoned that holistic,equitable approach in favor of a more rigid and mechanical formulation.in brooks furniture,dutailier int l,the court held that a case is exceptional under only when there has been some material inappropriate conduct related to the matter in litigation,such as willful infringement,fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,misconduct during litigation,vexatious or unjustified litigation,conduct that violates fed.civ,or like infractions.at.absent misconduct in conduct of the litigation or in securing t
