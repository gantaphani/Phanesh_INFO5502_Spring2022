bellingham insurance agency,bia,filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition.respondent peter arkison,the bankruptcy trustee,filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court against petitioner executive benefits insurance agency ebia and others alleging the fraudulent conveyance of assets from bia to ebia.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the trustee.ebia appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court decision after de novo review and entered judgment for the trustee.while ebia appeal to the ninth circuit was pending,this court held that article iii did not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a counterclaim for tortious interference,even though final adjudication of that claim by the bankruptcy court was authorized by statute.stern marshall.in light of stern,ebia moved to dismiss its appeal for lack of jurisdiction.the ninth circuit rejected ebia motion and affirmed.it acknowledged the trustee claims as stern claims,claims designated for final adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter,but prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter.the court of appeals nevertheless concluded that ebia had impliedly consented to jurisdiction.the court of appeals also observed that the bankruptcy court judgment could instead be treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,subject to de novo review by the district court.
under the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,federal district courts have original jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases and may refer to bankruptcy judges two statutory categories of proceedings core proceedings and proceedings.see generally.in core proceedings,a bankruptcy judge may hear and determine and enter appropriate orders and judgments,subject to the district court traditional appellate review.b.in proceedings those that are not core but are otherwise related to a case under title,c final judgment must be entered by the district court after de novo review of the bankruptcy judge proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,except that the bankruptcy judge may enter final judgment if the parties consent,c.
in stern,the court confronted an underlying conflict between the act and the requirements of article iii.the court held that article iii prohibits congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with the authority to finally adjudicate the core claim of tortious interference.the court did not,however,address how courts should proceed when they encounter a stern claim.
stern claims may proceed as within the meaning of c.lower courts have described stern claims as creating a statutory gap,since bankruptcy judges are not explicitly authorized to propose findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding.however,this gap is closed by the act severability provision,which instructs that where a provision of the act or its application is held invalid,the remainder of th e act is not affected thereby.stat.as applicable here,when a court identifies a stern claim,it has held invalid the application of b,and the remainder not affected includes c,which governs proceedings.accordingly,where a claim otherwise satisfies c,the bankruptcy court should simply treat the stern claim as.this conclusion accords with the court general approach to severability,which is to give effect to the valid portion of a statute so long as it remains fully operative as a law,free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight,and so long as the statutory text and context do not suggest that congress would have preferred no statute at all,ibid.
section c procedures apply to the fraudulent conveyance claims here.this court assumes without deciding that these claims are stern claims,which article iii does not permit to be treated as core claims under b.but because the claims assert that property of the bankruptcy estate was improperly removed,they are related to a case under title.accordingly,they fit comfortably within the category of claims governed by c.the bankruptcy court would have been permitted to follow that provision procedures,to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review.
here,the district court de novo review of the bankruptcy court order and entry of its own valid final judgment cured any potential error in the bankruptcy court entry of judgment.ebia contends that it was constitutionally entitled to review by an article iii court regardless of whether the parties consented to bankruptcy court adjudication.in the alternative,ebia asserts that even if such consent were constitutionally permissible,it did not in fact consent.neither contention need be addressed here,because ebia received the same review from the district court that it would have received had the bankruptcy court treated the claims as proceedings under c.

executive benefits insurance agency,peti tioner peter arkison,chapter trustee of the estate of bellingham insurance agency.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
in stern marshall,this court held that even though bankruptcy courts are statutorily authorized to enter final judgment on a class of claims,article iii of the constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from finally adjudicating certain of those claims.stern did not,however,decide how bankruptcy or district courts should proceed when a stern claim is identified.we hold today that when,under stern reasoning,the constitution does not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a claim,the relevant statute nevertheless permits a bankruptcy court to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to be reviewed de novo by the district court.because the district court in this case conducted the de novo review that petitioner demands,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals upholding the district court decision.
nicolas paleveda and his wife owned and operated two companies aegis retirement income services,aris,and bellingham insurance agency,bia.by early,bia had become insolvent,and on january,the company ceased operation.the next day,paleveda used bia funds to incorporate executive benefits insurance agency,ebia,petitioner in this case.paleveda and others initiated a scheme to transfer assets from bia to ebia.the assets were deposited into an account held jointly by aris and ebia and ultimately credited to ebia at the end of the year.
on june,bia filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of washington.peter arkison,the bankruptcy trustee and respondent in this case,filed a complaint in the same bankruptcy court against ebia and others.as relevant here,the complaint alleged that paleveda used various methods to fraudulently convey bia assets to ebia ebia filed an answer and denied many of the trustee allegations.
after some disagreement as to whether the trustee claims should continue in the bankruptcy court or instead proceed before a jury in federal district court,the trustee filed a motion for summary judgment against ebia in the bankruptcy court.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for the trustee on all claims,including the fraudulent conveyance claims.ebia then appealed that determination to the district court.the district court conducted de novo review,affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,and entered judgment for the trustee.
ebia appealed to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.after ebia filed its opening brief,this court decided stern,supra.in stern,we held that article iii of the constitution did not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a counterclaim for tortious interference,at,even though final adjudication of that claim by the bankruptcy court was authorized by statute,see part,infra in light of stern,ebia moved to dismiss its appeal in the ninth circuit for lack of jurisdiction,contending that article iii did not permit congress to vest authority in a bankruptcy court to finally decide the trustee fraudulent conveyance claims.
the ninth circuit rejected ebia motion and affirmed the district court.in re bellingham ins.agency.as relevant here,the court held that stern,supra,and granfinanciera,nordberg,taken together,lead to the conclusion that article iii does not permit a bankruptcy court to enter final judgment on a fraudulent conveyance claim against a noncreditor unless the parties consent,at.the ninth circuit concluded that ebia had impliedly consented to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction,and that the bankruptcy court adjudication of the fraudulent conveyance claim was therefore permissible,at.the court of appeals also observed that the bankruptcy court judgment could instead be treated as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,subject to de novo review by the district court,at.
we granted certiorari.
in stern,we held that article iii prohibits congress from vesting a bankruptcy court with the authority to finally adjudicate certain claims,at.but we did not address how courts should proceed when they encounter one of these stern claims a claim designated for final adjudication in the bankruptcy court as a statutory matter,but prohibited from proceeding in that way as a constitutional matter 
as we explain in greater detail below,when a bankruptcy court is presented with such a claim,the proper course is to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court will then review the claim de novo and enter judgment.this approach accords with the bankruptcy statute and does not implicate the constitutional defect identified by stern.
we begin with an overview of modern bankruptcy legislation.prior to,federal district courts could refer matters within the traditional summary jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts to specialized bankruptcy referees see northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,plurality opinion.summary jurisdiction covered claims involving property in the actual or constructive possession of the bankruptcy court,claims regarding the apportionment of the existing bankruptcy estate among creditors.see brubaker,a summary statutory and constitutional theory of bankruptcy judges core jurisdiction after stern marshall,am.bankr.proceedings to augment the bankruptcy estate,on the other hand,implicated the district court plenary jurisdiction and were not referred to the bankruptcy courts absent both parties consent.see macdonald plymouth county trust,see also brubaker,supra,at.
in,congress enacted sweeping changes to the federal bankruptcy laws.see stat.the bankruptcy reform act eliminated the historical distinction between summary jurisdiction belonging to bankruptcy courts and plenary jurisdiction belonging to either a district court or an appropriate state court.northern pipeline,supra,at plurality opinion see also norton norton bankruptcy law and practice,ed.instead,the act mandated that bankruptcy judges shall exercise jurisdiction over all civil proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to cases under title.b c,supp.iv.under the act,bankruptcy judges were vested with all of the powers of a court of equity,law,and admiralty,with only a few limited exceptions.northern pipeline,at plurality opinion quoting.notwithstanding their expanded jurisdiction and authority,these bankruptcy judges were not afforded the protections of article iii namely,life tenure and a salary that may not be diminished,at.
in northern pipeline,this court addressed whether bankruptcy judges under the act could constitutionally be vested with jurisdiction to decide a contract claim against an entity not otherwise a party to the proceeding,at.the court concluded that assignment of that claim for resolution by the bankruptcy judge violates art.iii of the constitution.at,plurality opinion see,at rehnquist,concurring in judgment.the court distinguished between cases involving public rights,which may be removed from the jurisdiction of article iii courts,and cases involving private rights,which may not.see,at plurality opinion,at rehnquist,concurring in judgment.specifically,the plurality noted that the restructuring of relations,which is at the core of the federal bankruptcy power,must be distinguished from the adjudication of private rights,which belong in an article iii court,at,and.
against that historical backdrop,congress enacted the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of the act at issue in this case.see et.under the act,federal district courts have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title,a,and may refer to bankruptcy judges any proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to a case under title,a bankruptcy judges serve terms subject to removal for cause,a,e,and their salaries are set by congress,a.
the act largely restored the bifurcated jurisdictional scheme that existed prior to the act.the act implements that bifurcated scheme by dividing all matters that may be referred to the bankruptcy court into two categories core and proceedings.see generally it is the bankruptcy court responsibility to determine whether each claim before it is core or.b fed.rule bkrtcy.proc.for core proceedings,the statute contains a nonexhaustive list of examples,including as relevant here proceedings to determine,avoid,or recover fraudulent conveyances.b h.the statute authorizes bankruptcy judges to hear and determine such claims and enter appropriate orders and judgments on them.b.a final judgment entered in a core proceeding is appealable to the district court,a,which reviews the judgment under traditional appellate standards,rule.
as for proceedings,proceedings that are not core but are otherwise related to a case under title the statute authorizes a bankruptcy court to hear the proceeding,and then submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.c.the district court must then review those proposed findings and conclusions de novo and enter any final orders or judgments.ibid.there is one statutory exception to this rule if all parties consent,the statute permits the bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter appropriate orders and judgments as if the proceeding were core.c.
put simply if a matter is core,the statute empowers the bankruptcy judge to enter final judgment on the claim,subject to appellate review by the district court.if a matter is,and the parties have not consented to final adjudication by the bankruptcy court,the bankruptcy judge must propose findings of fact and conclusions of law.then,the district court must review the proceeding de novo and enter final judgment.
stern marshall,confronted an underlying conflict between the act and the requirements of article iii.in particular,stern considered a constitutional challenge to the statutory designation of a particular claim as core.the bankrupt in that case had filed a counterclaim for tortious interference against a creditor to the estate,at.section b c,as added by the act,lists counterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate as a core proceeding,thereby authorizing the bankruptcy court to adjudicate the claim to final judgment.see supra this page.the respondent in stern objected that congress had violated article iii by vesting the power to adjudicate the tortious interference counterclaim in bankruptcy court.stern,at.
we agreed,at.in that circumstance,we held,congress had improperly vested the bankruptcy court with the judicial power of the united states,just as in northern pipeline,at,slip,at.because n o public right exception excuse d the failure to comply with article iii,we concluded that congress could not confer on the bankruptcy court the authority to finally decide the claim,at.slip,at.
stern made clear that some claims labeled by congress as core may not be adjudicated by a bankruptcy court in
