defendant tkn sales,tkn,appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,barbara jones,judge,declaring that,as applied to plaintiff gtfm,llc.gtfm,the requirement of the minnesota sales representative act,that certain claims for violation of that statute be resolved only through binding arbitration denies gtfm a jury trial,in violation of the seventh amendment to the united states constitution,and permanently enjoining tkn from demanding arbitration of its current dispute with gtfm under the minnesota statute.the district court ruled principally that tkn statutory claims against gtfm were analogous to claims for breach of contract and that the statute requirement that they be submitted to binding arbitration is thus unconstitutional.tkn challenges that conclusion on appeal.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the minnesota statute does not violate gtfm seventh amendment rights,and we reverse.
background 
although there is an underlying controversy between the parties,the facts material to this appeal are not in dispute.gtfm,a new york limited liability company headquartered in new york,is a manufacturer of apparel.tkn,a minnesota corporation whose principal place of business is in missouri,is an apparel distributor.in,gtfm and tkn entered into an oral agreement for tkn to distribute one of gtfm clothing lines to retailers in various locations,including minnesota.tkn compensation was to be in the form of commissions based on the quantity of goods it sold.in mid,disputes arose between tkn and gtfm with respect to the terms and performance of the contract.
the minnesota sales representative act msra or the act applies to sales representative agreements,agreements by which,inter alia,a manufacturer grants a sales representative the right to offer the manufacturer goods for sale,where there is a community of interest between the parties in the marketing of the goods at wholesale,subd.e.a sales representative,within the meaning of the act,is one who is compensated,in whole or in part,by commission,id.subd.d,and who is a minnesota resident,or whose principal place of business is in minnesota,or whose geographic sales territory includes all or part of minnesota,see id.subd.a.as set forth in greater detail in part.below,the act contains provisions governing,inter alia,the termination or renewal of such agreements and the prompt payment of commissions.the act also provides that t he sole remedy for a manufacturer who alleges a violation of any provision of this section is to submit the matter to arbitration,subd.a,and that a sales representative has the option of either submitting a matter to arbitration or bringing suit in court,see id.the arbitrator is given the power to,inter alia,reinstate the agreement,award damages,and grant other relief for frivolous claims or defenses.see id.subd.b.the arbitrator decision,though subject to judicial confirmation,is final and binding.id.subd.c.
in august,pursuant to msra,subd,tkn served on gtfm a demand for arbitration arbitration demand to be conducted by the american arbitration association in minneapolis,minnesota,and a complaint arbitration complaint.the demand described the nature of the dispute as w rongful termination of independent sales representative agreement in violation of,subdivision,and f ailure to pay earned commissions in violation of,subdivision and.tkn arbitration demand dated august.the arbitration complaint asserted the above claims for statutory violations,plus a claim for breach of contract it requested,inter alia,reinstatement of the sales representative agreement,damages in excess of for each of tkn three claims,and attorneys fees.gtfm,after unsuccessfully seeking a stay of the proceedings and a transfer of the arbitration from minneapolis to new york city,commenced the present action in the southern district of new york.
gtfm complaint challenged the constitutionality of msra on the ground that its provision for arbitration violates gtfm right to a jury trial under the seventh amendment to the constitution.gtfm premised federal jurisdiction on the existence of a federal question,to wit,msra constitutionality,and on diversity of citizenship.although gtfm complaint contained allegations as to the merits of the underlying business dispute,its only requests for relief,other than the usual catchall phrase such other and further relief as to the court seems just and proper,were for a declaratory judgment that the act as applied would violate its seventh amendment right to a jury trial,and a permanent injunction against arbitration.gtfm moved for a preliminary injunction to halt the pending minnesota arbitration tkn to dismiss gtfm complaint.the district court,with the consent of the parties,treated gtfm motion as one for summary judgment,and proceeded directly to the merits of gtfm attack on the minnesota statute.
in an opinion order dated april,wl opinion,relying principally on chauffeurs,teamsters helpers local terry,d,and tull united states,d,the district court ruled that gtfm is entitled to a jury trial because most of tkn claims,including those asserted under msra,seek legal,as contrasted with equitable,relief.the court began by noting that 
t he seventh amendment preserves the right to a jury trial in s uits at common law in federal court.const.amend.vii tull united states,d.the right to a jury trial is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.beacon theatres,westover,d internal quotation and citation omitted.
the seventh amendment right to a jury trial attaches to suits in federal court in which legal rights and remedies,as distinguished from equitable rights and remedies,are to be determined.see chauffeurs,teamsters helpers local terry,d curtis loether,d daisy group,newport news.that is,the seventh amendment applies not only to common law causes of action that existed in the eighteenth century,but also to actions brought to enforce statutory rights that are analogous to causes of action.feltner columbia pictures television,d quoting granfinanciera,nordberg,d tull,at,d.
opinion at,wl footnote omitted.the court dismissed tkn argument that the seventh amendment has not been incorporated into the fourteenth amendment and hence gives gtfm no right to avoid arbitration here,stating that 
t his as far as it the mark.but for the msra mandatory and binding arbitration system,tkn would have had to commence its action in either state or federal court,because it is undisputed that there was no agreement among the parties to arbitrate.had tkn commenced this action in state court,there is no dispute that gtfm would have had the right to remove the matter to federal court under.once in federal court,gtfm would have the right to a jury trial.
the fact that the msra,a state law,requires arbitration does nothing to change this conclusion.the right to a jury trial in federal court is clearly a question of federal law.simler conner,d kampa white consolidated industries,cir.federal law controls the issue,even in cases such as this,where the federal court would be enforcing a right and even when a state statute or state constitution would preclude a jury trial in state court.gipson kas snacktime,cir citing byrd blue ridge rural,d.
opinion at,wl.
the district court stated that tkn claim for breach of contract was one as to which gtfm clearly has a right to a jury trial.see id.at.it ruled that gtfm has the right to a jury trial as well on tkn claim under of the minnesota statutes for unpaid commissions and lateness penalties because that claim seeks both a traditional legal remedy,as to which a jury trial right attaches,and civil penalties,r emedies that are intended to punish culpable individuals,as opposed to those intended simply to extract compensation or restore the status quo,which traditionally were issued by courts of law,not courts of equity,id.at quoting tull united states,at.
as to tkn claims that gtfm violated other provisions of msra,causes of action that did not exist at common law,the court stated,in pertinent part,as follows 
to determine whether the right to a jury trial attaches to msra claims,the court applies the tull analysis,mindful that the second inquiry is the more important.see tull,at.as for the first the nature of the issues involved is analogous to actions at common msra provides a specialized remedy for a breach of contract claim involving sales representatives and supplies additional terms to sales representative agreements regarding notice and grounds for termination.an action brought pursuant to the msra,therefore,is premised on a breach of contract,including the terms added by the statute.the seventh amendment question depends on the nature of the issue to be tried rather than the character of the overall action.terry,at.quoting ross bernhard,d emphasis in terry.because tkn msra claim presents the legal issue of breach of contract,the first prong of the tull test would strongly suggest that gtfm is entitled to a jury trial 
the second,and more important,tull inquiry resolves the issue.it requires the court to examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable.see terry,at.on its msra claim,tkn seeks contract damages,a civil penalty under.and reinstatement of the contract.see.b.as discussed above,contract damages and the civil penalty are clearly legal remedies.
opinion at.the court noted that although reinstatement of the contract would be equitable relief,the joinder of that claim with legal claims did not eliminate gtfm right to a jury trial on the legal claims.see id.at.
the court concluded that because the msra mandatory and binding arbitration system operates to deny gtfm its right to a jury trial,the msra is unconstitutional as applied to these facts.opinion at footnote omitted.the court declared the msra provision for arbitration unconstitutional and permanently enjoined the minnesota arbitration proceeding.this appeal followed.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
ii.discussion 
the seventh amendment to the united states constitution provides,in pertinent part,that i n suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved const.amend vii.the federal rules of civil procedure,governing cases in the federal courts,provide that t he right of trial by jury as declared by the seventh amendment to the constitution or as given by a statute of the united states shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.a.
the seventh amendment has not,however,been applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment and hence does not require that jury trials be held in proceedings in state tribunals.see,gasperini center for humanities,d seventh amendment governs proceedings in federal court,but not in state court curtis loether,d supreme court has not held that the right to jury trial in civil cases is an element of due process applicable to state courts through the fourteenth amendment walker sauvinet.the states,so far as the fourteenth amendment is concerned,are left to regulate trials in their own courts in their own way.a trial by jury is not,therefore,a privilege or immunity of national citizenship,which the states are forbidden by the fourteenth amendment to abridge.
the district court,as set out in part i above,viewed the inapplicability of the seventh amendment to state proceedings as irrelevant because if tkn had sued gtfm in state court,gtfm would have had the right to remove the matter to federal court under,and o nce in federal court,gtfm would have the right to a jury trial,because t he right to a jury trial in federal court is clearly a question of federal law,simler conner,d per curiam,opinion at federal law requires a jury trial when the claims asserted and at least some of the remedies sought are legal rather than equitable,see id.at.however,other than simler,most of the cases relied on by the district court for the proposition that federal law is determinative are cases in which the jurisdiction of the district court was premised on the presence of federal questions.see,feltner columbia pictures television,d copyright infringement,c chauffeurs,teamsters helpers local terry,d reporting and disclosure act,granfinanciera,nordberg,d suit by bankruptcy trustee,see a tull united states,d clean water act,curtis loether,d fair housing act,beacon theatres,westover,d sherman and clayton antitrust laws.
to be sure,simler conner,cited by the district court,was a diversity case but the focus of that case was simply whether a lawyer suit to recover fees from his client should be characterized as legal or equitable,and the precise question was whether the proper characterization was a matter of federal law or state law.with that focus in mind,the simler court stated that the characterization of that claim as legal or equitable for purposes of whether a right to jury trial is indicated must be made by recourse to federal law,at.but simler prefaced that statement with the observation that i n diversity cases,of course,the substantive dimension of the claim asserted finds its source in state law,id.
substantive state limitations in diversity cases 
when a federal court jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship,w e put to one side the considerations relevant in disposing of questions that arise when a federal court is adjudicating a claim based on a federal law,guaranty trust york,and we act as only another court of the state,id.at.in guaranty trust,the court considered whether a federal court whose jurisdiction over a suit for breach of trust was based solely on diversity was required to honor a state statute of limitations.the court stated that the answer depended on whether the state statute governed merely the manner and means by which a plaintiff could recover or whether it was instead a matter of substance in the sense that the federal court disregard of the statute would significantly affect the result of the litigation,causing that result to differ from the outcome that would be reached in state court.id.at.the court stated that the intent of the decision in erie tompkins,
was to insure that,in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties,the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same,so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation,as it would be if tried in a state court 
plainly enough,a statute that would completely bar recovery in a suit if brought in a state court bears on a right vitally and not merely formally or negligibly.as to consequences that so intimately affect recovery or a federal court in a diversity case should follow state law.
guaranty trust,at.emphasis added.the court added that 
the operation of a double system of conflicting laws in the same state is plainly hostile to the reign of law.certainly,the fortuitous circumstance of residence out of a state of one of the parties to a litigation ought not to give rise to a discrimination against others equally concerned but locally resident.the source of substantive rights enforced by a federal court under diversity jurisdiction,it can not be said too often,is the law of the states.whenever that law is authoritatively declared by a state,whether its voice be the legislature or its highest court,such law ought to govern in litigation founded on that law,whether the forum of application is a state or a federal court and whether the remedies be sought at law or may be had in equity.
id.at.emphasis added.
these principles were applied to an arbitration question in bernhardt polygraphic of america,a contract action that raised the question of whether the federal court sitting in diversity was required to apply a vermont statute that made an agreement to arbitrate revocable at any time before an arbitration award was actually made 
we deal here with a right to recover that owes its existence to one of the states,not to the united states.the federal court enforces the right by rules of procedure which it has acquired from the federal government and which therefore are not identical with those of the state courts.yet,in spite o
