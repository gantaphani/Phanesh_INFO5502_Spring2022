this appeal raises questions of the scope of the comity doctrine,which generally forbids federal courts from interfering with a state enforcement of its tax laws and its criminal laws,and of whether a penalty imposed under new york tax code is civil or criminal for purposes of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.defendant the commissioner of the new york state department of taxation and finance the commissioner or the department appeals from a permanent injunction issued by the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn.the injunction forbids the department from imposing penalties on plaintiffs zaid abuzaid and arref pursuant to tax law b i.the penalty in question arises by reason of the plaintiffs violations of a new york law that taxes the sale of cigarettes and provides for the issuance of tax stamps evidencing payment of the required taxes.
plaintiffs were prosecuted,convicted,and sentenced under criminal provisions of the new york tax law for their violations.thereafter,under b i,the commissioner assessed the separate tax penalties at issue in this case.plaintiffs brought this action seeking an injunction to bar the department from collecting the b i penalties.their suit contends that the imposition of the penalties would constitute a second punishment for their crimes and is thus prohibited by the double jeopardy clause.the district court agreed and enjoined the imposition of the penalties.the commissioner appealed.
we reverse the judgment.the district court was barred by the comity doctrine from granting injunctive and declaratory relief to plaintiffs because such relief would interfere with the state administration of its tax laws.moreover,the district court erred in finding that b i constitutes a criminal penalty.we conclude instead that b i provides for a civil penalty and that plaintiffs therefore did not suffer double jeopardy when the department imposed the penalties on them.in view of our conclusion that plaintiffs claim is without merit,we dispose of this case by instructing the district court on remand to dismiss the suit with prejudice.the entry of such a ruling is not barred by comity because the dismissal with prejudice of an action challenging a state tax law in no way interferes with or disrupts the state administration of its tax laws.
background 
plaintiffs abuzaid and kassem owned small newsstands,which sold cigarettes.the state of new york charges a cigarette tax of per carton of cigarettes.to collect the tax,the state sells sales tax stamps to stamping agents who affix the stamps to the cigarettes and sell the stamped cartons to retailers such as plaintiffs.see tax law.in a sting operation that spanned from may to august,undercover agents from the department sold cartons of cigarettes bearing counterfeit stamps to abuzaid,and cartons with counterfeit stamps to kassem.abuzaid and kassem,among others,were arrested and charged under n.tax law,which makes it a felony to willfully attempt in any manner to evade or defeat the cigarette taxes and to willfully possess for the purpose of sale unlawfully stamped cigarettes.tax law a,c.in may,abuzaid and kassem separately pled guilty to violating tax law e,a class d felony abuzaid received a sentence of probation not to exceed five years,and he agreed to forfeit certain assets that had been seized by the department.kassem was sentenced to a conditional discharge not to exceed three years,and he also agreed to forfeit certain assets seized by the department.neither abuzaid nor kassem contest their guilt or challenge their plea agreements.
in november,pursuant to tax law b i,the department sent abuzaid a notice of determination informing him that he was being assessed a penalty of for possessing the unlawfully stamped cigarettes sold by the undercover agents during the sting operation.in the same month,kassem received a similar notice informing him that he would be assessed a penalty of.section b i provides,in relevant part,that the commissioner may impose a penalty of not more than one hundred fifty dollars for each two hundred cigarettes,or fraction thereof,in excess of one thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages in the possession or under the control of any person 
on november,plaintiffs brought this action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york to block the department from collecting the penalty.they asserted that the b i penalties were punitive in nature and would thus amount to an unconstitutional second criminal punishment for the same wrongful conduct.the department responded that b i provides for a civil penalty,which does not implicate the double jeopardy clause.the department also argued that the district court was prohibited from entertaining plaintiffs claim by the tax injunction act tia,codified at,and the comity doctrine.
as an initial matter,the district court found that the tia,which prohibits a federal district court from interfering with the assessment or collection of state taxes when the state provides an adequate remedy,see,does not apply to this case because b i is a penalty rather than a tax.see abuzaid,wl,at.the court did not address the issue of comity as a bar to granting relief to plaintiffs.turning to the merits of plaintiffs claim,the court concluded that b i is punitive under the balancing test outlined in kennedy mendoza martinez,d.the court explained that,although the new york legislature did not intend that b i operate as a criminal sanction,the law is effectively a criminal punishment because it is meant to punish and deter criminal conduct,it covers conduct that is already a crime,and it requires scienter for the imposition of more severe penalties.see abuzaid,wl,at.since plaintiffs had already been subjected to a criminal prosecution for the same conduct,the court declared that the imposition of b i penalties against plaintiffs would violate the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment,and it enjoined the commissioner from imposing any such penalties against plaintiffs.see id.at.
the commissioner brought this appeal.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see ellicott square court mountain valley indem,cir.to justify summary judgment,the moving party must show entitlement to judgment as a matter of law and the absence of any genuine dispute of material fact.see.a.
the department contends that both the tia and comity barred the district court from granting declaratory and injunctive relief to plaintiffs on their challenge to tax law b i.as to the comity principle,we agree.this doctrine prohibits the federal courts from granting relief that would interfere with the state administration of its tax laws moreover,we believe that b i provides a civil penalty not a criminal punishment and that the district court conclusion to the contrary was error.because a dismissal of this action with prejudice would not interfere with the state administration of its tax laws,comity does not prohibit us from denying plaintiffs claim on the merits.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss the action with prejudice.
comity barred the district court from granting relief 
the comity doctrine instructs federal courts to refrain from granting relief to in suits that contest taxpayer liability in a manner that interferes with a state administration of its tax system.see levin.at.comity demonstrates a proper respect for state functions and a continuance of the belief that the national government will fare best if the states and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in separate ways.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has stressed that c omity constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity because states rely on tax revenues to run their governments.id.therefore,the court has ruled that the comity doctrine prohibits federal courts from granting declaratory or injunctive relief against state taxing authorities in favor of,see fair assessment in real estate ass n,mcnary,d great lakes dredge dock huffman,and from awarding damages personally against the taxing officials in suits contesting the constitutionality of state taxes brought under,see fair assessment,at,so long as the plaintiffs have access to state remedies that are plain,adequate,and complete,and may ultimately seek review of the state decisions in the supreme court,id.footnote omitted.
under these comity principles,the district court erred in granting declaratory and injunctive relief to plaintiffs the relief granted by the district court judgment undoubtedly disrupted and interfered with the state administration of its tax system.see levin.at.regardless of whether assessments made under tax law b i might be regarded as penalties imposed under the state tax laws designed to encourage payment of taxes,rather than as taxes,they are indisputably part of the state tax system.plaintiffs have made no demonstration that they did not have access to state remedies for their constitutional objections that are plain,adequate,and complete and that include the right to seek review of the state decisions in the supreme court.fair assessment,at.the supreme court has previously determined in other litigation related to the tia that new york does provide plain,speedy and efficient forums for individuals to bring constitutional challenges to its tax laws.see tully griffin,d.because the court has discern ed no significant difference between remedies that are plain,adequate,and complete as that phrase has been used in articulating the doctrine of equitable restraint,and those that are plain,speedy and efficient within the meaning of the tia,plaintiffs had recourse to a plain,adequate,and complete remedy in a new york state forum.fair assessment,at.
plaintiffs assert that neither the tia nor comity bar the injunctive and declaratory relief granted by the district court because b i is a criminal penalty rather than a tax provision.the district court adopted this reasoning in declining to apply the tia.see abuzaid,wl,at however,we find this argument to be without merit.even if we viewed b i as a criminal penalty,and not as part of the state tax system,its administration would be similarly protected from federal court interference by another branch of the comity doctrine.it is well established by supreme court authority that comity bars federal courts from restraining state criminal prosecutions absent a showing of bad faith,harassment,or other extraordinary circumstance.see younger,at.we have ruled that abstention under younger is mandatory when there is a pending state proceeding,that proceeding implicates an important state interest,and the state proceeding affords the federal plaintiff an adequate opportunity for judicial review of his or her federal constitutional claims.spargo n.state comm on judicial conduct,cir.these conditions were all present when plaintiffs sought federal court intervention to bar the state from imposing the b i penalties.state proceedings were pending against them,as evidenced by the notices of determination assessing the b i penalties the proceedings implicated the important state interest of collecting penalties resulting from plaintiffs abuse of the state scheme for the taxation of cigarettes and plaintiffs had ample opportunity in the state courts to obtain review of their constitutional objections,with the further opportunity to seek review of an adverse decision in the supreme court.moreover,plaintiffs do not allege bad faith or harassment on the part of the department.
therefore,comity prohibited the district court ruling regardless of whether the state imposition of the penalty under b i is deemed a tax or a criminal punishment.
ii.double jeopardy 
crucial to plaintiffs contention that the double jeopardy clause bars imposition of the b i penalties is their assertion that the penalty is a criminal punishment.double jeopardy arises when a defendant is prosecuted or punished more than once for a crime.see dep t of revenue kurth ranch,d the double jeopardy clause protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal,a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,and multiple punishments for the same offense.if the penalty imposed by b i is a civil penalty,and not a criminal punishment,plaintiffs claim of double jeopardy fails.see hudson united states,d helvering mitchell.notwithstanding that they may have a punitive aspect,not all penalties are criminal punishments that fall under the protections of the double jeopardy clause.in mendoza martinez,at,the supreme court established the framework for determining whether a penalty provision is deemed civil or criminal for double jeopardy purposes.we first look to whether the legislature,in establishing the penalty,intended it as a punishment.see id.at.we then consider an array of other factors to evaluate whether in practice the provision effectively imposes a criminal penalty.see id.at.
legislative intent 
while recognizing that labels applied by the legislature are not necessarily determinative,we find that the language and structure of strongly suggest a legislative intent to establish a civil,rather than a criminal,penalty.as an initial matter,states that the criminal penalties for the misconduct addressed in that section are to be found in other parts of the tax code.see tax law for criminal penalties,see article of this chapter.furthermore,the penalties imposed under b i are assessed and reviewed through an administrative process that could potentially involve the commissioner,an administrative law judge,the tax appeals tribunal,and the state courts.see tax law b iii providing for penalty determination and review through the administrative process outlined in tax law id.describing the administrative process for a tax determination.if the legislature had intended the punishment to be criminal,it would most likely have established a criminal enforcement process administered directly in the courts.see hudson,at explaining that the conferral of the authority to issue debarment orders upon administrative agencies is prima facie evidence that congress intended to provide for a civil sanction rather than a criminal punishment.
plaintiffs argue that the text of supports their position that the b i penalty was intended by the legislature to be criminal.they point out that,while c and d,which provide other related penalties,both state that the commissioner may impose a civil penalty,tax law c d emphasis added,b i states only that the commissioner may impose a penalty,without including the word civil.plaintiffs contend that the omission of the word civil indicates that the legislature considered the b i penalty to be criminal.this argument might have more force if the statute exhibited care to employ the adjective civil each time its reference was to a civil penalty,and to omit it in all references to criminal penalties.section,however,makes numerous references to penalties without specifying whether they are civil or criminal.plaintiffs would likely respond that each reference to a penalty,in the singular,without specification of civil or criminal refers to a criminal penalty,and that references to penalties in the plural without specification include both civil and criminal penalties.such an interpretation is not obviously wrong on its face,but it is speculative at best and is far less persuasive in view of the assertion in that criminal penalties are listed in another chapter of the tax code and the establishment by b iii of an administrative procedure for determining and reviewing penalties.
practical effect 
mendoza martinez instructs that we next consider a number of factors,which may help to determine whether in practice the particular provision functions as a criminal punishment.at.the opinion directs that we consider 
w hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint,whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment,whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter,whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment retribution and deterrence,whether the behavior to
