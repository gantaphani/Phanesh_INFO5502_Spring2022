plaintiff delroy askins appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york mcmahon,dismissing his claims of constitutional torts involving arrest without probable cause and malicious prosecution in violation of.the complaint named as defendants the city of new york,new york police officer symon,and additional police officers whose names were unknown to the plaintiff,identified in the complaint as sergeant john doe and officer john doe.only the city and officer symon were served with process.the district court dismissed the complaint against officer symon on the basis of qualified immunity because,in arresting plaintiff,symon was merely carrying out instructions received from other officers and could not have known whether there was a proper basis for the arrest.no appeal is taken from the dismissal of the case against symon.as for the suit against the unidentified police officers,who had not been served with process,the court ruled that the suit was irremediably untimely,because the limitations period had passed,and,under federal rule of civil procedure c,subsequent amendment of the complaint to name them properly would not relate back to the time of the original complaint.as for the suit against the city,the court ruled that municipal liability could not be established where the plaintiff failed to establish the liability of any individual defendant who acted on the city behalf.the plaintiff contests the court rulings with respect to the john doe defendants and the city.
with respect to the timeliness of the plaintiff suit against the john doe officers,we conclude that askins waived the arguments he advances on this appeal by failing to raise them in the trial court.however,we agree with askins that the dismissal of his claims against the city of new york was error.we therefore vacate the judgment in favor of the city and remand those claims for further consideration.
background 
the facts as alleged in the complaint are as follows.on february,askins entered an apartment building at park avenue and street in manhattan.askins is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair.upon entering the apartment building,he hoisted himself out of his wheelchair and started to pull himself up a flight of stairs.while he was going up the stairs,two uniformed police officers,who did not identify themselves by name,approached him.askins believed that one of the officers appeared to outrank the other.in this litigation he has identified the ranking officer as sergeant john doe and the other as officer john doe.the officers immediately began to search his wheelchair and backpack.sergeant doe spotted a blue rubber cap attached to the catheter waste bags affixed to askins wheelchair and incorrectly believed it was a crack pipe.a continued search of askins belongings turned up a kitchen knife.a third officer,police officer symon,arrived and arrested askins,who was then arraigned for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and criminal trespass in the third degree.all charges against him were dismissed on may.
nearly three years later,on february,askins,proceeding pro se at the time,filed the initial complaint in this suit.the complaint was served on the city on may,and on officer symon on july.against the police officers,the complaint asserted claims of constitutional torts relating to false arrest and malicious prosecution.against the city,the complaint asserted a claim of municipal liability pursuant to monell department of social services,d,resulting from the torts committed by the police officers.askins served interrogatories on the city requesting the identities of the doe defendants.the city returned them,unanswered,asserting that they were premature because federal rule of civil procedure d forbids seeking discovery before the parties have conferred as provided in rule f.
the city and officer symon then noticed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of,inter alia,qualified immunity.after completion of the summary judgment briefing,but prior to the district court ruling,askins obtained counsel.on may,his counsel requested leave to file an amended complaint and asked the district court to defer ruling on the summary judgment motions until he took discovery.with respect to discovery,the judge denied the request,referring to her individual rules,which provided as soon as a notice of motion raising the issue of qualified immunity is filed,all discovery is stayed,except for the plaintiff deposition.askins city of new york,joint appendix ja.with respect to the request for leave to amend the complaint,the court granted the motion,authorizing the filing of an amended pleading within days.ja.the amended complaint,which counsel timely filed on may,expanded on the municipal liability claims by asserting that the constitutional violations committed by the officers were pursuant to custom and policy established by the city,as required by monell.the amended complaint did not identify the doe defendants by name and did not significantly alter the allegations against the individual officers.
on february,nearly five years after askins claims arose,the district court granted defendants motions for summary judgment,dismissing all the claims.the court ruled that officer symon was entitled to qualified immunity because he had no prearrest participation in the facts and arrested askins in reasonable reliance on his fellow officers representations that probable cause existed for the arrest.as noted,askins does not appeal this portion of the district court ruling.
the trial court further held that any amendment of the complaint to identify sergeant doe and officer doe by name would be futile because the limitations period on askins claims had expired since the filing of the original complaint,and any amended complaint identifying the doe defendants by name would not relate back to that original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c,because failure to name unidentified officers is not a mistake.c.the court then turned to the claim of municipal liability.the court ruled that counsel amendment of the initial pro se complaint was futile.assuming without deciding that the amended pleading successfully asserted municipal policies and customs that could render the city liable for the torts of its officers,the court nonetheless ruled that the city could not be liable where the plaintiff was unable to establish a violation of his rights because all of the alleged violations against individual officers were either timebarred or barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity.

denial of leave to amend the complaint to name the doe defendants 
when a denial of leave to amend is based on a legal interpretation,such as a determination that amendment would be futile,a reviewing court conducts a de novo review.hutchison deutsche bank sec,cir.however,i t is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.in re nortel networks.sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also wal mart stores,visa,cir the law in this circuit is clear that where a party has shifted his position on appeal and advances arguments available but not pressed below,waiver will bar raising the issue on appeal.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in this case,askins waived any argument that an amended complaint naming the doe defendants would relate back to the original complaint.he failed to make any such argument in opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment.furthermore,in a may,letter,askins counsel wrote to the court that he was uncertain whether any form of tolling or estoppel would be available to hale the john doe defendant officers into the litigation at this late date.ja.it is clear that askins had the opportunity in the district court to argue that a new complaint naming the doe defendants would relate back.for whatever reason,he did not make that argument.askins does not argue that the district court otherwise erred by subsequently dismissing the claims against the doe defendants,and because his argument that an amended complaint naming the doe
