in this action pursuant to,plaintiffs,the animal rights front,arf and two of its members,lisa zalaski and derek oatis,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut vanessa bryant,judge,entered after a bench trial in favor of defendant,hartford police sergeant daniel albert,on claims that albert violated plaintiffs first,fourth,and fourteenth amendment rights when he arrested zalaski and oatis at the public site of a children foot race during which plaintiffs were protesting the treatment of animals by race sponsor ringling brothers and barnum bailey circus ringling brothers.see zalaski city of hartford,d specifically,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in finding that the challenged arrests were supported by probable cause to think that zalaski and oatis were engaged in disorderly conduct in violation of.a,see id.at and even if probable cause were lacking,qualified immunity shielded albert from liability for damages,see id.at we affirm on the ground of qualified immunity without deciding the question of whether there was actual probable cause to arrest zalaski and oatis for disorderly conduct under connecticut law.see pearson callahan,doninger niehoff,cir.
background 
the pertinent facts,detailed in the district court page memorandum decision,are largely undisputed.see zalaski city of hartford,d.in any event,after a bench trial,we would set aside those factual determinations only for clear error,which is not evident here.see inwood,ives.
a.the red nose run 
on april,riverfront plaza a public park that the city of hartford leased to riverfront recapture,a private,company was the site of the first annual red nose run,an event that invited children as young as age four to participate in five foot races ranging in length from yards to a mile.approximately persons,the majority of them young children,were expected to attend the event,a fundraiser for the boys girls club of hartford.the run were the hartford marathon association and ringling brothers.indeed,the run was scheduled to coincide with the arrival in hartford of the ringling brothers circus.
all red nose run races began from the same point in riverfront plaza and progressed down a curved walkway.as the walkway veers leftward toward the connecticut river,it is abutted on the right by a triangular patio platform,raised by three steps.the part of the patio approached from the walkway by the steps is approximately feet in length.as it approaches the patio,the walkway is bordered on both sides by grassy knolls dotted with trees.
red nose run organizers installed a temporary tent on the patio platform.there,children and their parents could register for,and reunite after,the races.at that site,each participating child also received a prize and complimentary refreshments were available.
b.the challenged arrests 
plaintiffs initial refusal to move from the walkway 
joining the children and parents attending the red nose run were approximately to animal rights activists,there to protest ringling brothers treatment of animals.four of these activists,including plaintiffs zalaski and oatis,were members of arf zalaski and oatis carried a foot by foot banner proclaiming,got freedom the animals do.the two other attending arf members carried a foot by foot banner portraying a moribund elephant and the phrase the saddest show on earth.
at least some of the protestors,among them zalaski and oatis,initially located themselves on the walkway near the patio steps.a arf member testified that this was an ideal spot because it faced the start of the races and,thus,children would have to run directly at the protestors and their signs,tr.
a number of parents complained to race organizers about protestors yelling at and frighten ing children at the race site,tr.they requested that the protestors be relocated away from the children.organizers and a park ranger asked protestors on the walkway to move to one of the bordering grassy knolls,where other protestors had already situated themselves.arf members,including zalaski and oatis,refused to move,prompting a call to the hartford police department.
sergeant albert dealings with zalaski and oatis 
defendant sergeant albert was one of the officers who responded to riverfront plaza.much of his interaction with plaintiffs leading to the challenged arrests is recorded in a video that is part of the record on appeal.in the video,an event organizer is heard asking protestors to work with me,rec,while oatis tells albert that the protestors intend no harm to children participating in the races,rec.the last thing we are going to do is have some kids trip on each other or have something bad happen.after surveying the scene and learning that race organizers had a permit for the event,sergeant albert requested that arf protestors on the walkway move up onto the patio steps.the arf protestors,including zalaski and oatis,complied.
on the steps,the protestors no longer obstructed the walkway where races would be run,but,with their outstretched signs,they did partially block access to the area.upon hearing complaints to this effect,sergeant albert asked the arf protestors on the steps to join the other protestors on the grassy knoll.at trial,albert explained that he made the request because he expected the problem of free passage on the steps to worsen as more races were run and more people sought access to the platform.see,tr.t he platform was filling up,the obstructing i thought had increased because there w ere more people that had to,you know,work their way around this banner.there were more runs to come,more waves of runs to come.there would be more people wanting to use the platform.albert testified that he viewed his directive as a reasonable compromise between the protestors and other race attendees.id.at.if the protestors on the steps moved to the nearby grassy knoll,where other protestors were already located,then t he platform would not be obstructed.they,the protestors would have the right to demonstrate,and the marathon people,the ringling people,would have their right to their private property and have their event and continue to,you know,give out the food and the prizes.id.at.
two arf members complied with sergeant albert request.zalaski and oatis,however,refused,whereupon albert arrested them for criminal trespass and misdemeanor obstruction of free passage.plaintiffs were formally charged with the latter offense,see,but that charge was dismissed a week later and no further prosecution was pursued.
c.the instant action 
on april,arf,zalaski,and oatis together represented by attorney oatis filed this action against sergeant albert and the city of hartford for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and interference with free expression.on january,following a bench trial,the district court rejected plaintiffs claims and directed the entry of judgment in favor of albert.see zalaski city of hartford,d at.
specifically,the district court ruled that albert did not violate plaintiffs first amendment rights by directing them to move from the patio steps to the grassy knoll because,although plaintiffs protest raised a matter of public concern and riverfront plaza qualified as a public forum,albert direction was and a reasonable time,place,and manner restriction.see id.at.in any event,the district court concluded that,even if albert conduct did violate the first amendment,he would be shielded by qualified immunity because a reasonable police officer would not have understood the complex and nuanced contours of first amendment jurisprudence as applied to the circumstances presented.id.at.
the district court further rejected plaintiffs false arrest and malicious prosecution claims,finding that,irrespective of the particular offenses informing sergeant albert decision to arrest or the formal filed charge,probable cause supported arresting zalaski and oatis for disorderly conduct.see id.at citing.a and reasoning that plaintiffs hindering parents and children access to the registration area provided probable cause to think they were obstructing pedestrian traffic.the district court concluded that albert was,in any event,shielded by qualified immunity on these claims as well because,if actual probable cause did not support zalaski and oatis arrests,there was at least arguable probable cause to support a reasonable officer decision to take them into custody.see id.at.the district court concluded that qualified immunity was further warranted because,insofar as albert had sought to achieve a balance among the protestors right to expression,the organizers permit rights,and the government interest in public safety,a reasonable officer in his position could have thought that his relocation directive was lawful.see id.at.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
probable cause.qualified immunity review 
in evaluating a challenge to a judgment entered after a bench trial,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see bessemer trust,n.branin,cir.among the conclusions of law that we review de novo is a decision affording a defendant qualified immunity.see walczyk rio,cir.
qualified immunity shields law enforcement officers from claims for money damages provided that their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have been aware.see,ashcroft,harlow fitzgerald.two questions inform qualified immunity analysis.first,do the facts show that the officer conduct violated plaintiff constitutional rights if the answer to this question is no,further inquiry is unnecessary because where there is no viable constitutional claim,defendants have no need of an immunity shield.but if the answer is yes,or at least not definitively no,a second question arises was the right clearly established at the time of defendant actions see ashcroft.at walczyk rio,at.
courts are no longer required to answer these questions in sequence.see pearson callahan,at,overruling in part saucier katz.addressing the latter question first is particularly appropriate where the former turns on difficult or novel questions of constitutional or statutory interpretation,but it is nevertheless clear that the challenged conduct was not objectively unreasonable in light of existing law.coollick hughes,cir see also ashcroft.at.
in making the latter determination,the inquiry is not how courts or lawyers might have understood the state of the law at the time of the challenged conduct.rather,t he relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,at emphasis added accord winfield trottier,cir.if the illegality of the conduct would not be so apparent,the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.see walczyk rio,at.thus,even if a right is clearly established in certain respects,qualified immunity will still shield an officer from liability if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on the legality of the action at issue in its particular factual context.malley briggs.in short,if at least some reasonable officers in the defendant position could have believed that the challenged conduct was within the bounds of appropriate police responses,the defendant officer is entitled to qualified immunity.saucier katz,at accord walczyk rio,at.
as these precedents make clear,qualified immunity provides a broad shield.it does so to ensure that those who serve the government do so with the decisiveness and the judgment required by the public good.filarsky delia,internal quotation marks omitted.toward that end,it affords officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments without fear of potentially disabling liability.messerschmidt millender,internal quotation marks omitted.in sum,qualified immunity employs a deliberately forgiving standard of review,amore novarro,cir internal quotation marks omitted,that provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,malley briggs,at accord ashcroft.at.
probable cause standard 
plaintiffs submit that the district court erred in finding that albert arrests of zalaski and oatis were supported by probable cause or even arguable probable cause to think that these two arf members were engaged in any violation of connecticut law.in evaluating this argument,we are mindful not only that qualified immunity is a forgiving standard but also that probable cause is a fluid one that does not demand hard certainties,illinois gates,or mechanistic inquiries,florida harris,describing probable cause as practical,standard for assessing probabilities in particular factual context.
under both federal and connecticut law,probable cause to arrest exists when police officers have knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a crime.walczyk rio,at internal quotation marks omitted see state james.thus,probable cause does not demand that an officer belief that a suspect has committed or is committing a crime be correct or more likely true than false.texas brown.it requires only facts sufficient to establish the sort of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent people,not legal technicians,act.florida harris.at alteration in original quoting illinois gates,at.
even where a reviewing court,applying these principles,concludes that probable cause to arrest was lacking in a given case,an officer will still be entitled to qualified immunity if he can establish that there was arguable probable cause to arrest.escalera lunn,cir.arguable probable cause exists if either a it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause existed,or b officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met.id.internal quotation marks omitted accord walczyk rio,at.here,we need not,and do not,decide whether there was actual probable cause to arrest zalaski and oatis for disorderly conduct under connecticut law because we conclude,in any event,that there was arguable probable cause to support the arrests.
connecticut disorderly conduct statute 
because even an assessment of arguable probable cause requires some consideration of connecticut prohibition of disorderly conduct,we begin with the relevant statutory text 
a person is guilty of disorderly conduct when,with intent to cause inconvenience,annoyance or alarm,or recklessly creating a risk thereof,such person obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic or congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a reasonable official request or order to disperse.
connecticut supreme court has construed this misdemeanor intent element to mean predominant intent.state indrisano.thus,to support a conviction for disorderly conduct under a,the defendant predominant intent must be to cause inconvenience,annoyance or alarm,rather than to exercise his constitutional rights.id.at the predominant intent requirement appears to derive from colten commonwealth,in which the kentucky court of appeals,construing a similarly worded statute,stated that p redominance can be determined either from the fact that no bona fide intent to exercise a constitutional right appears to have existed or from the fact that the interest to be advanced by the particular exercise of a constitutional right is insignificant in comparison with the inconvenience,annoyance or alarm caused by the exercise,id.at,quoted in state indrisano,at.
albert argues that a reasonable officer should not be expected to know of indrisano gloss on the intent requirement of a in making a probable cause determination.in support,he cites amore novarro,a case in which this court recognized the general rule that we impute knowledge of the case law to public officials,id.at,but found a limited exception in the unusual case in order to advance the broader goals of qualified immunity,id.at.we deemed amore an unusual case because the arresting officer there actually reviewed penal law text at the time he placed defendant under arrest,unaware that the section he consulted had been declared unconstitutional some years earlier.see id.at.here sergeant albert did not review the text of a before placing zalaski and oatis under arrest indeed,he did not even arrest them for disorderly conduct.these circumstances locate this case a considerable distance from amore.in any event,we do not here decide what constitutes an unusual case falling within amore exception because we conclude that a reasonable officer in the circumstances presented by this case,even when charged with knowledge of indrisano,would have had arguable probable cause to believe zalaski and oatis were violating.a.thus,our ensuing analysis does not and need not afford albert the benefit of any amore exception.
arguable probable cause to think plaintiffs engaged in disorderly conduct 
plaintiffs submit that no reasonable officer could have thought probable cause existed to arrest them for disorderly conduct in violation of a because a their conduct did not completely impede pedestrian traffic,as they argue is required to obstruct that traffic and b there was no basis to conclude that their predominant intent was to cause inconvenience,annoyance or alarm,rather than to exercise their constitutional rights to free speech.state indrisano,at neither argument is convincing 
obstruction 
because the word obstructs,as used in.a providing that anyone who obstructs vehicular or pedestrian traffic with requisite intent is guilty of disorderly conduct,is not defined by statute,it is properly given its common meaning.see.the common meaning of obstruct,as the district court observed by reference to the dictionary,is to block or close up by an obstacle to hinder passage,action or operation to cut off from sight.zalaski city of hartford,d at quoting merriam webster online dictionary,visited.the district court concluded that obstruction was evident in this case from the fact that the plaintiffs,by holding a large sign on the steps leading to the platform,hindered the passage of participants into the registration tent.id.
plaintiffs do not dispute this finding of hindrance.rather,they contend that a hindrance is not enough to constitute the proscribed obstruction.relying on the first dictionary definition of obstruct,plaintiffs submit that a prohibits only actions that fully block or impede pedestrian traffic,which their actions on the steps at issue did not.
plaintiffs point us to no connecticut precedent clearly limiting the term obstruct in a to a complete blockage of pedestrian traffic.to be sure,in state muckle,which upheld the convictions of abortion protestors under a,evidence indicated that signs and baby carriages that the protestors positioned on a sidewalk leading to an abortion clinic effectively blocked that walkway,forcing pedestrians to step off the sidewalk to negotiate around the obstructions and to get to the clinic,see id.at.but in noting these circumstances,the muckle court did not state that only the complete blockage of a sidewalk could demonstrate obstruction amounting to disorderly conduct.nor would such a conclusion be obvious to a reasonable police officer given that,in other criminal contexts,connecticut appears to have construed the word obstruct to prohibit hindrance short of total impediment.see,state biller,consulting dictionary definition of obstruct,which included hinder,in holding that defendant who merely delayed search of his person could be found guilty of interfering with police officer under.gen stat.state beck.cir,adopting definition of obstruct as to interpose obstacles or impediments,to hinder,impede,or in any manner intrude or prevent in holding that individual who boarded police wagon and demanded to be taken to station with arrestees could be convicted of obstructing justice in violation of.gen stat.internal quotation marks omitted state neubauer.cir,requiring only that conduct,to obstruct officer,in some manner,hinder the officer or make his job difficult.
on qualified immunity review,we need not here conclusively decide the scope of obstruction proscribed by connecticut disorderly conduct statute.we need only conclude,as we now do,that connecticut has not so clearly limited obstruction to the condition of fully blocking pedestrian traffic as to foreclose a reasonable officer from making an arguably correct finding of probable obstruction based on plaintiffs actions in blocking part of the steps at the red nose run.this is not to suggest that an officer would have arguable probable cause to arrest an individual for disorderly conduct under the connecticut statute based simply upon the person presence in a location being utilized by others.we conclude only that the facts known to the police in this case namely,that individuals were holding a large banner,positioned partially in front of a clearly visible point of ingress and egress to be used predominantly by young children permitted reasonable officers to think that probable cause existed to support arrests for disorderly conduct.
predominant intent 
plaintiffs contend that,even if a reasonable officer could have had probable cause to think that plaintiffs were obstructing pedestrian traffic at the red nose run,the officer could not reasonably have thought that their predominant intent was to cause inconvenience,annoyance,or harm rather than to exercise their constitutional rights.we disagree.
an assessment of intent frequently depends on circumstantial evidence.see,united states macpherson,cir collecting cases recognizing that mens rea elements of knowledge and intent are often proved through circumstantial evidence.but unlike at trial,where circumstantial evidence must support a finding of culpable intent beyond a reasonable doubt,a probable cause determination,and thus an arguable probable cause determination,can be made on substantially less evidence.state clark,at see illinois gates,at t he term probable cause,according to its usual acceptation,means less than evidence which would justify condemnation.quoting locke united states,cranch,marshall.moreover,because the practical restraints on police in the field are greater with respect to ascertaining intent,the latitude accorded to officers considering the probable cause issue in the context of mens rea crimes must be correspondingly great.cox hainey,cir see paff kaltenbach,cir recognizing that arresting officers must make judgment calls in determining suspect state of mind see also conner heiman,cir observing that whether inference of innocent intent was also reasonable,or even more reasonable,does not matter so long as the culpable intent conclusion was itself reasonable.
with these principles in mind,we consider the totality of the circumstances at the time of the challenged arrests.at the outset,we recognize as sergeant albert himself appears to have recognized that plaintiffs protests about ringling brothers treatment of animals qualify as protected speech.the record demonstrates that sergeant albert never attempted to silence or delay that speech.rather,he sought to relocate it by a modest distance of approximately feet,from a set of steps where protesters were hindering pedestrian traffic to a nearby grassy knoll where other protestors were already situated and exercising their first amendment rights.
in requesting relocation,albert knew that organizers of the red nose run had a permit for their activities.he knew that numerous young children would be participating in the run and that those children,some by themselves,others with attending adults,would have to use the steps in moving between the walkway where races were to occur and the platform where a tent was set up for registration,prizes,and refreshments.albert knew that some people had already complained that the protestors holding large banners were hindering pedestrian traffic on or near the steps.he anticipated that these concerns would only increase as more races were run.see,tr.there were more runs to come,more waves of runs to come.there would be more people wanting to use the platform.he also knew that there had been earlier complaints of children being frightened by protestors shouting at them.while oatis assured albert that the protestors did not wish any har
