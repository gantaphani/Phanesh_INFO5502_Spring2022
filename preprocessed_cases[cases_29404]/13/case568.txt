upon remand from this court,see united states,cir,ernesto was resentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of months.once again appeals.
he asks,in conclusory fashion,that we declare the statutory mandatory minimum unconstitutional as applied to him,but he supplies no supporting argument.he did not present a argument below so the claim is waived.
the argument that did raise below and which he reiterates in somewhat fleeting fashion here is unavailing.courts have uniformly rejected the claim that a no greater than necessary language authorizes a district court to sentence below the statutory minimum.see united states samas,cir,petition for cert.filed,united states huskey,cir united states franklin,cir united states roberson,cir.
there being neither error of law nor abuse of discretion in the imposition of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence,the judgment of the district court entered on june,is affirmed.
this case,and its outcome,is a notorious example of oppressive injustice culminating in an outrageous adjudication.it is a stain on the robes of american justice.appellant was convicted of aiding and abetting the murder of an police officer.he was convicted even though his,the murderer himself,who initially tried to pin for the murder and was the government star witness,testified unequivocally that cirilo muñoz had no advance knowledge about his plan to murder and did not assist him in committing the murder in any way.united states,cir mcauliffe,dissenting.we are now called upon to affirm the imposition of a harsh mandatory minimum sentence,which only compounds the injustice caused by conviction.because i have taken an oath to uphold the law irrespective of my personal views,i am left without a principled choice in this appeal other than to concur,and,in the process,register my most vehement disagreement with the warped outcome of this case.
as i have previously expressed elsewhere,there are many aspects of this case long and troubled history that call into question the fairness of our criminal justice system.see united states,cir decision of torruella,united states,cir torruella,concurring.chief among these defects is a mistake made by our own court eleven years ago when it found the evidence at trial sufficient to establish that had foreknowledge that his accomplice would kill the undercover officer,at.the error of this decision is cogently and thoroughly expressed by judge mcauliffe in his dissent.see id.at.
were i on the original panel in,i would have voted to vacate conviction.were the issue brought before us again,i would vote to revisit that decision the finding that the evidence was sufficient is so obviously wrong as to rise to the level of manifest injustice vitiating the law of the case doctrine.see ellis united states,cir see also conley united states,cir en banc boudin,law of the case is not a straight jacket but can be the discretion of the court that made the invoked several different bases.id.at distinguishing precedent limiting restrictions on post conviction review where only proceedings are involved but the sufficiency of the evidence supporting conviction is not the issue presented in this appeal,and i see no way,under the present posture of this case,to reopen his conviction,unless he were to develop grounds for filing a new collateral challenge.see calderón thompson,d see also in re davis,d,wl appellant original petition for writ of habeas corpus remanded to district court to consider alleged new evidence of innocence,eighteen years after conviction for murder of a police officer 
in again registering my concern with his conviction,i can only invoke and not improve on the words of judge easterbrook 
nothing we do as judges in criminal cases is more important than assuring that the innocent go free false accusations of crime must be caught by prosecutor and petit jury we can not reverse a conviction just because the main witnesses may have been confused or,worse,are liars.now and again,however,a case arrives in which something transparently has gone wrong,and we must act.every time we reverse a conviction on account of insufficient evidence,we avert many more 
united states martínez de ortiz,cir easterbrook,concurring rehearing granted judgment vacated,cir superseded by cir en banc.
what we are presented in this appeal raises a fresh and separate injustice.the mandatory minimum sentence imposed on is yet another example of the imprecise and overly harsh application of our restrictive sentencing regime.see united states poland,cir torruella,concurring criticizing the mandatory minimum in that case,stating i n the real life scenario of sentencing,such a regime makes little sense because it takes away much of the discretion from where it should be,those on the front lines of the criminal justice system.this regime imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on that is three years longer than that imposed on,the one who actually orchestrated and committed the murder,at torruella,remanding for resentencing,in part,because e ven in our legal system,the cases that are reported do not support the disparity extant in this case between,a minor aider and abettor,and lugo sánchez,the principal and murderer.
the district court comments at sentencing encapsulate the absurdity of this case 
the court has reviewed the record in this case and finds that this defendant,in this case,especially concerning the evidence that was presented at trial,had a mitigating sic role.defendant had to the evidence,and for sentencing purposes,had lack of prior knowledge of lugo sánchez plans and intentions to kill the undercover police officer.in fact,the defendant turned down two of lugo sánchez invitation to injure the victim in this case.moreover,defendant was nowhere in the vicinity when lugo sánchez killed the victim.lastly,lugo sánchez testified that he did not know the defendant had followed him and that he did not ask him to do so.
the district court made these findings on a preponderance of the evidence standard,which only underscores that the evidence was insufficient to convict in the first place.but,the district court was further by the mandate of congress into imposing the statutory minimum of twenty years imprisonment.and we are similarly into affirming that sentence.
a series of coincidences have laid bare a system of law,which in particular circumstances has failed to protect him from the oppressive power of government and its bureaucracy.the result is that a adolescent has been condemned to spending his entire adult life incarcerated in a federal prison.to this wrongful outcome have contributed all three branches of government,with congress making its contribution on this appeal through its draconian mandatory minimums.
our prior decisions and the laws passed by congress command this result,which i must obey.i write this opinion so that this injustice is not forgotten in our otherwise summary disposal of appeal.his case calls out for clemency and relief,and should serve to remind us both of the flaws in our system of adjudicating guilt and the dangers of mandatory minimums.
i thus concur in the judgment.
for a full review of the tortuous procedural history of the conley saga,a situation not totally irrelevant to the present case,see united states conley,cir conley i,cert.denied,d united states conley,d conley ii united states conley,cir conley iii conley united states,d conley iv.
i note that in re davis,although distinguishable in material respects,does offer a glimmer of hope at achieving relief from his improper conviction.davis involves an state conviction,in which the petitioner on a subsequent petition for collateral review claimed mere presence during the murder of a police officer,supported by new evidence in the nature of several exculpatory affidavits not presented at trial.in dissent,justice scalia questioned whether any of the allegedly new evidence was in fact new,as it had already been considered and rejected multiple times.id.at,wl,scalia,dissenting.although presents no new evidence of actual innocence here,the fact that the supreme court is willing to revisit a conviction even older than provides some h
