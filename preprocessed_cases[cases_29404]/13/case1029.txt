cory lott lott appeals from the month sentence imposed in the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions,iii,district judge,following his guilty plea to failure to register as a sex offender in violation of.a.lott contends that the district court should have dismissed the indictment because at the time of lott interstate travel,the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,stat.codified at and et,was not applicable to preact offenders such as lott.lott also contends that the district court erroneously applied an sentencing enhancement under the united states sentencing guidelines.section b c.we reject lott arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in november,lott was convicted in new york of attempted sexual abuse and sentenced to one year probation.as a result of his conviction he was required under state law to register as a sex offender in new york,but he failed to do so.in,congress passed sorna,which requires sex offenders to register in each jurisdiction in which they reside,work,or go to school however,sorna does not specify whether this requirement pertains to offenders whose offenses predate sorna effective date.
lott eventually moved to south carolina,where in he was convicted under state law for failure to register.in,lott moved to vermont and failed to register,as the government alleges was required by sorna.in november,lott sexually assaulted a year old girl and fled the state.in february,vermont obtained an arrest warrant for lott on a charge of lewd and lascivious conduct in connection with this assault.in september,a federal grand jury returned an indictment alleging that lott had traveled to vermont in late without registering as a sex offender,in violation of sorna,a.twelve days later,lott pled guilty in vermont state court to two misdemeanor prohibited acts counts based on the assault.he was sentenced to six to twelve months imprisonment.
lott then moved to dismiss the federal indictment,raising a number of challenges to the validity of sorna as applied.the district court denied the motion to dismiss.on august,lott pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement that preserved his right to appeal his challenges to the application of sorna.at sentencing,the district court calculated the sentencing guidelines range to be to months,including an enhancement pursuant to b c for committing a sex offense against a minor while he was in status.defense counsel objected to the sentencing enhancement.the district court overruled defense counsel objections and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.
lott appeals the constitutionality of sorna registration requirement to conduct that preceded sorna effective date and also appeals the application of the sentencing enhancement.
discussion 
i.the retroactivity of sornaa.sorna 
sorna was enacted to establish a comprehensive national system for the registration of sex offenders.the act requires those convicted of certain sex crimes to provide state governments with and to update information,such as names and current addresses,for inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.reynolds united states.the act makes it a crime for a person who is required to register under the act and who travels in interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly fai l to register or update a registration.id.alteration in original quoting a.
the statute does not specify whether its registration requirements apply retroactively to sex offenders who are convicted prior to sorna enactment.however,sorna section d gives the attorney general the authority to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of sorna.in,the supreme court,resolving a disagreement between circuit courts and construing section d,held in reynolds that sorna registration requirements do not apply to offenders until the attorney general specifies that they do apply.at.
the attorney general has issued three sets of regulations that arguably adequately specify that sorna registration requirements apply to offenders the interim rule in february,the sentencing,monitoring,apprehending,registering,and tracking smart guidelines in july.july,and the final rule in december.the final rule postdates lott travel to vermont and is therefore not applicable.
validity of smart guidelines 
lott challenges the validity of both the interim rule and the smart guidelines.because we find that the smart guidelines validly extended sorna applicability to offenders,we need not decide whether the interim rule had the same effect.
as to the smart guidelines validity,lott argument is twofold.first,he argues that the smart guidelines are interpretive rules rather than substantive rules because the attorney general authority to issue the guidelines flows from sorna section b and because the attorney general conceded this point.substantive rules independently have the force of law,but interpretative rules can only clarify existing law.see united states yuzary,cir.if lott is correct,then the smart guidelines can not validly specify that sorna registration requirements apply to offenders.second,lott claims that even if the smart guidelines were issued pursuant to the attorney general substantive rulemaking authority,the attorney general did not comply with the requirement of the administrative procedure act apa.we disagree with both of these arguments.
the smart guidelines were an act of substantive rulemaking.the notice proposing the guidelines specifically stated these proposed guidelines carry out a statutory directive to the attorney general,in section b of sorna b to issue guidelines to interpret and implement sorna.may.the reference to the attorney general section b authority to interpret and implement sorna does not support lott conclusion that the guidelines are interpretative.interpretive rules do not create rights,but merely clarify an existing statute or regulation.state gas saranac power partners,cir internal quotation marks omitted.substantive rules,however,create new law,right s,or duties.id.substantive rules implement the statute.chrysler brown,emphasis added.see also am.broad,fcc,cir the phrase substantive rules adopted as authorized by law refers,of course,to rules issued by an agency to implement statutory policy.by specifying that the attorney general has the power to implement sorna,section b plainly gives the attorney general the authority to issue substantive rules.
moreover,section b implementation power incorporates section d authorization to the attorney general to specify the applicability of the requirements of sorna to offenders.d see united states whitlow,cir b authority appears to subsume the narrower power to make retroactivity determinations united states stevenson,cir e ven if the smart guidelines were solely promulgated under b,the attorney general still had authority to address the retroactivity of sorna in substantive rules pursuant to b,because b incorporates by reference d.
and finally,the proposed smart guidelines specifically reference section d in their discussion of retroactivity.see.at stating that the regulation making sorna requirements apply to all sex offenders were issued pursuant to the authority under sorna section d.the apa requires only that a proposed rule provide some notice of the legal authority for that does not prescribe the form that notice must take.u.b see stevenson,at the apa does not require that the proposed rule cite the relevant legal authority in a certain location,but rather requires just that notice must be given for any proposed rule.
lott also argues that the attorney general conceded that the smart guidelines are interpretive rules.lott relies on the fact that the attorney general,after publishing the smart guidelines,found it necessary to publish the final rules.he further relies on the fact that at the time of publication of the smart guidelines,the attorney general took the position that sorna applied to offenders by force of the statute.
the publication of the final rule was not,however,a concession by the attorney general that the earlier rules were invalid.as
