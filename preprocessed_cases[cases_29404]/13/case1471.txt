the plaintiffs in this case,union members and employees of american airlines,were mostly on the losing side of a union election.they blame the loss,at least in part,on american,which suspended them during the campaign and then fired them for allegedly posting racist campaign fliers.although american later reinstated them,the plaintiffs also want their names cleared of the taint of racism flowing from american conclusion that they posted racist fliers.the plaintiffs also object to campaign fliers posted by their opponents in the election.to clear their names and recover for their loss of reputation,the plaintiffs filed a defamation suit in new york state court against american,two of its managers,and three union members who ran against them.
american removed the case to federal court,arguing that because the plaintiffs defamation claims were minor disputes under the railway labor act rla,et,the district court had jurisdiction over the claims,and because the rla preempts claims that are minor disputes,the claims should be dismissed.the district court carol bagley amon,judge agreed in part,dismissing one count of the complaint as preempted and remanding the other two counts to state court.
unlike the district court,we do not reach the question whether the plaintiffs claims are the type of minor disputes that,under the rla,are within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of arbitral panels established pursuant to the rla.instead,we hold that even if claims qualify as minor disputes under the rla,the rla does not completely preempt those claims and therefore does not provide federal courts with original jurisdiction over them.the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction over this case.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment and remand with instructions that the case be remanded to state court.
background 
in the spring of,plaintiffs john sullivan,david virella,and vincent argentina,american airlines employees,ran for reelection to their positions as officers of air transport local of the transport workers union of america.defendants and fellow employees michael chiofalo,albert gil,and peter perez ran on an opposing slate.according to the plaintiffs,during the campaign,the defendants posted in the workplace fliers disparaging sullivan,virella,and argentina 
meanwhile,someone posted a flier accusing defendant gil of having lied about his ethnicity.american airlines has strict rules about racial harassment in the workplace,and defendants stan roberts and edwin argonza,managers at american,investigated the posting of this flier.in the course of the investigation,american suspended with pay plaintiffs sullivan,virella,argentina,and john kennedy a fellow employee but not a candidate.voting in the union elections took place while the plaintiffs were suspended sullivan and virella lost their elections.
as a result of its investigation,american concluded wrongly,according to the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs had posted the flier about gil.american fired all four plaintiffs and issued notices of termination,termed final advisories,that included statements accusing them of having posted the flier.but after the plaintiffs lodged a grievance with the union protesting their termination,american backed down.american reinstated them,but it recast the final advisories termination notices as second advisories warnings that reiterated american finding that the plaintiffs had posted the flier about gil.
not satisfied with just returning to work,the plaintiffs filed suit in new york state court alleging three counts of defamation.count accused opposing candidates chiofalo,gil,and perez of defaming plaintiffs sullivan,virella,and argentina under state law by posting libelous fliers about the plaintiffs count also alleged that american was liable for the defamation because it allowed the fliers to remain on a company bulletin board.count accused american and its managers roberts and argonza of defaming all four plaintiffs by,inter alia,issuing the final advisories that asserted that the plaintiffs had posted the flier about gil.count accused chiofalo alone of defaming all four plaintiffs by asserting,at a union meeting,that the plaintiffs had posted the flier about gil.
american responded by removing the case to federal court on the basis that counts and asserted claims governed by the railway labor act rla,the provisions.the rla gives primary jurisdiction over disputes between airlines and their employees that grow out of grievances,or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,or working conditions to board s of adjustment arbitral panels established under the rla.see see also id.first i governing railroads atchison,topeka santa fe ry.buell,d.such disputes are known as minor disputes under the rla,as distinguished from major disputes,which involve the formation of agreements cbas and are governed by different provisions of the rla.see consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d explaining the difference between minor and major disputes.the provisions of the rla are not relevant to this case.
on its face,the plaintiffs complaint raises only defamation claims.the supreme court has explained,however,that where the resolution of a claim depends on an interpretation of a agreement,the claim is preempted by the rla and must be brought before one of the arbitral panels established pursuant to the rla.hawaiian airlines norris,d.american argued before the district court that because resolution of the defamation claims against it counts and of the complaint would require the district court to interpret the agreement,the claims were preempted and could not be heard in state or federal court.
as to count,the district court disagreed.it found that the defamation claim based on american alleged endorsement of defamatory fliers posted by chiofalo,gil,and perez could be evaluated without reference to the cba and thus was not preempted by the rla.as to count,however,the district court agreed with american that resolving it would require interpreting the cba and that it was preempted.it is from the dismissal of count alone that the plaintiffs appeal to this court.
ii.discussion 
because the district court dismissed count on the pleadings,we review the district court decision de novo,taking the allegations in the complaint as true and making all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.ziemba wezner,cir per curiam.the plaintiffs raised only claims in their complaint,and the district court understandably,though mistakenly,accepted the premise of american notice of removal that if the claims in counts and were preempted by the rla,the district court had jurisdiction over the case to decide the preemption question that premise,though it found some support in our case law when the district court made its ruling,was mistaken.to understand why,we must examine the law of federal preemption in general and rla preemption in particular as well as the difference between complete preemption,which can be the basis for federal jurisdiction,and ordinary preemption,which can not.
preemption and federal jurisdiction 
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.const.art.iii,cl.american removed this case to federal court under,which permits removal only of actions over which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction id.a see also id.b.if it exists at all,original jurisdiction in this case can be based solely on jurisdiction under,which gives federal district courts jurisdiction over suits arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the district court assumed as did the parties that if count was preempted by the rla,a federal statute,count therefore arose under federal law.
the plaintiffs,however,raised only claims in their complaint.as a general rule,a suit seeking recovery under state law is not transformed into a suit arising under federal law merely because,to resolve it,the court may need to interpret federal law.see gully first bank.not every question of federal law emerging in a suit is proof that a federal law is the basis of the suit.this principle underlies the rule,which dictates that federal jurisdiction can be founded only on those allegations in a complaint that are well pleaded.see rivet regions bank of,d caterpillar williams,d.the rule mandates that in assessing jurisdiction,a federal court must disregard allegations that a complaint would not,allegations about anticipated defenses.rivet,at.a defense is not part of a plaintiff properly pleaded statement of his or her claim.thus,a plaintiff may not create federal jurisdiction by alleging in his complaint that the defendant anticipated federal defense should fail.see franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust for southern,d.
while the rule directs federal courts to disregard certain elements of a complaint in assessing federal jurisdiction,federal courts sometimes do the inverse read into a complaint elements that the plaintiff omitted.the doctrine,a corollary to the rule,rests on the principle that a plaintiff may not defeat federal jurisdiction by artfully pleading his complaint as if it arises under state law where the plaintiff suit is,in essence,based on federal law.see rivet,at.see also franchise tax,at.i t is an independent corollary of the complaint rule that a plaintiff may not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal questions in a complaint.marcus v.at t,cir.faced with such an artfully,misleadingly pleaded complaint,the federal court may construe the complaint as if it raised the federal claim that actually underlies the plaintiff suit.rivet,at.
the doctrine includes within it the doctrine of complete preemption id.the artful pleading doctrine allows removal where federal law completely preempts a plaintiff claim.under the doctrine,certain federal statutes are construed to have such extraordinary preemptive force that claims coming within the scope of the federal statute are transformed,for jurisdictional purposes,into federal,completely preempted.see metro.life ins.taylor,d.when a plaintiff raises such a completely preempted claim in his complaint,a court is obligated to construe the complaint as raising a federal claim and therefore arising under federal law the supreme court has only found three statutes to have the requisite extraordinary preemptive force to support complete preemption of the relations act lmra,see avco aero lodge,d a of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a,see metro.life,at.and and of the national bank act,see beneficial bank anderson,d 
the doctrine must be distinguished from ordinary preemption,also known as defensive preemption.see,james moore et,moore federal practice b i iii ed discussing types of preemption.many federal more than support complete support a defendant argument that because federal law preempts state law,the defendant can not be held liable under state law.see,bates dow agrosciences llc,d explaining that b,a provision of the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra,preempts certain conflicting state laws and rules cipollone liggett group,d discussing what type of claims are preempted by various federal statutes related to cigarettes green mountain vermont,cir holding that the interstate commerce commission termination act of,et,preempts a vermont law as applied to certain railroads.ordinary defensive preemption comes in three familiar forms express preemption,conflict preemption,and field preemption see cipollone,at.green mountain,at.the supreme court has left no doubt,however,that a plaintiff suit does not arise under federal law simply because the defendant may raise the defense of ordinary preemption.see caterpillar,at.i t is now settled law that a case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense,including the defense of,even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff complaint,and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.franchise tax,at.
preemption under the rla 
ordinary preemption is plainly a viable defense under the rla pursuant to governing railroads and governing airlines,minor disputes must be heard in the first instance before arbitral panels,not courts,and claims that are disguised minor disputes are therefore preempted by the rla.see,hawaiian airlines,at.a determination that respondent complaints constitute a minor dispute would his actions.further,the court in hawaiian airlines established that the test for finding ordinary preemption under the rla is the same as the test under of the lmra.hawaiian airlines,at.holding that lingle norge div.of magic chef,d,an lmra case,provides an appropriate framework for addressing under the rla and adopt ing the lingle standard to resolve claims of rla.
the key question,however,is whether the analogy drawn by the court between rla and lmra preemption as to ordinary preemption also extends to complete preemption.hawaiian airlines came to the supreme court from the hawaii supreme court,not from the lower federal courts,id.at,so the court had no occasion to consider whether the rla,as does of the lmra,supports federal jurisdiction by completely preempting claims within its scope.the district court in this case assumed that the rla supports complete preemption of minor disputes and therefore focused on determining whether the plaintiffs defamation claims were such disputes,which are subject to ordinary preemption and can only be heard initially before arbitral panels.in their briefs before this court the parties take a similar approach,assuming that the rla supports complete preemption and fighting over whether the complaint in this case meets the standards for ordinary preemption outlined in hawaiian airlines.
because complete preemption may be crucial to the existence of federal jurisdiction,we can not rely on the parties assumptions about complete preemption under the rla.we have an independent obligation to ensure that federal jurisdiction exists,bender williamsport area sch,d,which requires us to consider whether the rla actually supports complete only possible basis for jurisdiction in this case.at oral argument we asked the parties whether geddes american airlines,cir,which held that there was no complete preemption under the rla,affected their arguments in this case,and we directed the parties to brief the question.
american argues that complete preemption under the rla is not an open question in this circuit and directs our attention to shafii british airways,plc,cir.a panel of this court in shafii stated that where a complaint raises claims that are in fact preempted by the rla,the action may properly be removed to the federal courts,even when the plaintiff complaint does not itself include a federal cause of action.id.at.this circuit rule directs us generally to follow the decisions of prior panels until they are overruled either by this court sitting en banc or by the supreme court.gelman ashcroft,cir.a subsequent panel may,however,reconsider a prior panel holding that would otherwise be binding precedent not only when it has been directly overruled,but also where there has been an intervening supreme court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent.union of needletrades,indus.textile employees ins,cir.
it appears that the panel in shafii assumed that hawaiian airlines was a case and that the analogy between lmra and rla preemption established by that case was total.because the court more recent decision in beneficial national bank,the court latest opinion,entirely undermines this assumption about the rla,we must reconsider shafii conclusions about rla preemption without hearing this case en banc.
the conflation of ordinary and complete preemption under the rla reflected in shafii reading of hawaiian airlines,and in the briefs of the parties in this case,is unsurprising,for under of the lmra,establishing ordinary preemption also establishes removability.see c expressly giving federal courts original jurisdiction over suits under the lmra.in other words,in any particular lmra case,the defensive and inquiries collapse into one.but the inquiry into whether the rla or the lmra is completely preemptive is different,and requires looking at the federal statute rather than a particular claim.see charles alan wright,ar
