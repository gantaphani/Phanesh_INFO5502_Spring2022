johan torres was indicted on august,for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in an amount that carries a maximum term of life imprisonment.a.he pled guilty under a plea agreement pointing to a minimum guideline sentence of months,then sought unsuccessfully to withdraw his plea,and now appeals from his conviction and sentence.
the background events are as follows.torres surrendered on march,and was held without bail.beginning in may,torres counsel and the assistant united states attorney ausa began discussing the possibility of a plea agreement for a considerable period,an offer by the government of years imprisonment was on the table but was never accepted by torres.
the critical events involve the period of september through september,with torres trial scheduled to begin on monday,september.seemingly the chronology is not perfectly clear,torres and his trial counsel he is represented on appeal by a different attorney met with the ausa on thursday,september on thursday,september,there was another meeting of the ausa and counsel whether torres was present is unclear the government says yes and he says no.
during the september meeting,according to torres,the ausa stated,on my children,if you go to trial,i going to give you life,if you do sign today,for each day that goes by,i sic will give you two more years.torres refused the offer but on thursday september the ausa disclosed the names of four government witnesses to torres counsel.that night,torres called his lawyer and asked him to make a deal.
on september,friday before the trial,who knew only that he had asked his lawyer to make a deal,was brought unexpectedly to the courthouse where his lawyer presented him with a plea agreement modeled on one that had been offered the preceding may but the amount of drugs stipulated,together with firearms and leadership enhancements previously proposed,would lead to a minimum guideline sentence of years and months,which the government said it would recommend.
torres now says that he was extremely reluctant to sign but his lawyer pressed him hard,saying sign,sign,sign.torres says that in substance he spent only minutes with his lawyer considering the proposed translation of the terms of the agreement and whatever discussion took he accepted the terms proposed and was taken before a magistrate judge who on consent conducted the rule hearing and then recommended acceptance of the agreement.
according to torres,on the same evening september,he had second thoughts and sought to contact his lawyer in order to withdraw the plea.a formal motion for withdrawal of the plea was not filed until september,apparently because the district court was closed for some of the intervening time due to a hurricane that hit puerto rico.in the motion,torres counsel justified his request on the ground that torres had only minutes in which to understand the plea agreement and agree to accept it apparently by coincidence the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation on the same day,perhaps without knowing of the motion.
on november,the district court denied torres motion to withdraw the plea.on november,torres filed two pro se submissions with the district court,advising the court for the first time of the alleged threat by the ausa and of his own counsel advice to sign,sign,sign.torres also said that his own counsel had failed to describe the ausa conduct in the initial motion to withdraw the plea,even though torres wanted him to do so.
torres counsel separately filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial,again arguing that minutes was insufficient time for torres to comprehend the plea.the district court denied both motions.just prior to his sentencing hearing torres submitted a third pro se motion requesting permission to withdraw his plea,repeating and elaborating on earlier claims,further criticizing his own counsel,and also stating that he had asked his counsel to withdraw from representing him.
at sentencing,the district court conducted an abbreviated hearing on the plea withdrawal question,allowing torres to state his reasons for requesting withdrawal and inviting counsel for both torres and the government to present arguments.after hearing these statements,the district court again denied the motion to withdraw the plea and sentenced torres,consistent with the plea agreement,to months in prison.
on this appeal,represented by new counsel,torres presents two claims first,that his original counsel did not properly represent him and,because of a conflict of interest,should have withdrawn from the case and second,that the district court should have allowed torres to withdraw his plea.the former claim requires a motion under the harder issue is whether torres should be afforded a evidentiary hearing as to the plea withdrawal issue.
torres first claim rests upon the sixth amendment right to assistance of counsel,const.amend.vi,but it is not the usual claim that torres original counsel bungled the example by ignoring a meritorious defense or urging torres to agree to an unsound plea or misconducting the trial.such a claim,usually hard to sustain,would require torres to show that counsel advice was manifestly incompetent and that the incompetence had probably altered the outcome.strickland washington,d.
instead,torres says that during the plea withdrawal phase,trial counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest with his client.such a showing,also resting upon sixth amendment case law,is sometimes called a per se violation of the sixth amendment.united states,cir see also cuyler sullivan,d.what that phrase means is that torres,if he showed such a conflict,arguably would be entitled to relief based on an assumption of prejudice or,more exactly,without the need to prove prejudice.cuyler,at.
that is the rub.sixth amendment attacks on counsel are rarely allowed on direct appeal because they require findings as to what happened and,as important,why counsel acted as he rarely developed in the existing record.so,the defendant is usually remitted to a petition under section.still,relief can be granted on appeal if the facts are undisputed,sometimes feasible where an actual conflict is claimed,at.
in this case no actual conflict of interest could be found on the undisputed facts.true,torres asserted in the district court and on this appeal that his counsel failed to protect him against abusive conduct by the ausa and,instead,pressed him unduly to sign the agreement.this,it is suggested,gave his own trial counsel a conflicting interest to suppress or ignore information that could have helped torres win his motion to withdraw his plea.
yet at this stage we have only torres word as to what occurred and no explanation from counsel as to either his version of these events or why he made the choices he did.torres says that his counsel did not protect him from improper threats.but the pressure applied by the we assume torres version of the threat is conceded by the government perhaps distasteful would not show wrongdoing.see bordenkircher hayes,d.nor is it clear what counsel could have done to protect torres.
the hard reality is that plea bargaining in criminal cases is not for the delicate minded.most prosecutors,we think,would avoid,for multiple reasons including the prospect of appeals like this one,so striking a calibration of the consequences of delay and so severe a threat if this is what happened.yet the government costs rise as trial approaches and the best deal from the prosecutor is ordinarily available before the investment in final trial preparations.
torres claim of conflict does not depend on showing that the ausa misbehaved.he says that his counsel failed to include mention of the ausa threat in counsel motion or reconsideration request,even though torres so requested and even though most lawyers would probably think it useful context to support the later plea withdrawal motion.it would be enough to show that his own counsel had a significant interest in concealing information that would assist his client.
but there is no obvious reason why trial counsel would have any interest in concealing wrongdoing by the prosecutor,nor would he have m
