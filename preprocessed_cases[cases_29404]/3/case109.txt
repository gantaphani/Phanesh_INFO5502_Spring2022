in the summer of,defendants katherine christianson and bryan rivera were members of the earth liberation front,identified by the fbi as a domestic group.besides attending meetings and protests,they also found time to destroy several research projects at a forest service facility in rhinelander,wisconsin.they were not prosecuted until eight years later when they were indicted for and pleaded guilty to destroying government property.the district court sentenced christianson to months and rivera to months imprisonment respectively both sentences were substantially lower than the recommended guideline range but the government does not contest them.on appeal,the defendants challenge the district court calculation rivera also argues that the district court erred in applying the terrorism enhancement.we affirm.
in july,katherine christianson went to the earth first rendevous in tennessee with her of several years,ian wallace there they met daniel mcgowan and bryan rivera.during the rendevous,the four discussed vandalizing the forest service forest service facility in rhinelander,wisconsin,where the forest service was conducting several experiments on trees.
after the rendevous,the four traveled to minneapolis,minnesota,to demonstrate at the international society of animal genetics conference.during their time at the conference,they traveled to rhinelander and conducted reconnaissance of the facility.after seeing the site,they determined that four people would be needed to effectively carry out their mission.needing a fifth person to act as a driver,wallace recruited a friend from high school.
on the night of july,the four entered the facility and damaged or destroyed more than trees,either by cutting them down or by girdling them.girdling,or as it is more commonly known ring barking,consists of completely removing a strip of bark around a tree outer circumference,causing the tree eventual death.xiii oxford english dictionary ed.in addition to destroying the trees,they used etching cream and spray paint to leave their calling card on several forest service vehicles.the group,however,had to cut short its sortie after fearing they would be discovered by a security guard.although they left in haste,they were careful to dispose of their clothes and tools on the way back to eau claire,wisconsin,where they dropped off their driver before returning to minneapolis 
the next day,christianson and mcgowan issued a press release in the name of the earth liberation front elf and on behalf of native forests everywhere.in the communique,they claimed responsibility for the attack and admonished their allies 
to cease quibbling with the forest service over details of their genocidal plans the sooner we realize that the forest service,like industry,are capitalists driven by insane desire to make money and control life,the better.than sic we can start taking more appropriate action.
what they meant by more appropriate action is not clear,but from elf other attacks,it could be read as foreshadowing further acts of violence against the forest service.from there,the case went cold.
eventually,in january,wallace was implicated in an attempted bombing on the campus of michigan tech university.he subsequently cooperated with the authorities and shared the details of the attack on the rhinelander facility.christianson and rivera were ultimately indicted and pleaded guilty to willfully injuring property belonging to the united states,causing damage greater than,in violation of and.the government initially estimated the loss amount was between half a million and a million dollars.
at sentencing,christianson challenged the loss calculation.to support its position,the government called don riemschneider to testify he was a research plant scientist at the rhinelander facility in the summer of.after the attack,riemschneider had prepared a report for his supervisor and the fbi on the damage from the attack.in it,he estimated a total loss amount in excess of based on the damage caused to the western black cottonwood cottonwood experiment and an advanced generation clone experiment that was destroyed.for various reasons,he did not include estimates for any of the other experiments that were destroyed by the defendants.at sentencing,he produced his report and repeated his initial estimates,further explaining their bases.he estimated that to replicate the cottonwood experiment it would cost.he based this total on the project costs between,when it was most active during those years he estimated the project cost at per year.in support of this total,he cited three specific expenses that made up the bulk of the costs the gathering of samples for the experiment,the costs of maintaining the experiment and the cost of hiring a technician to assist in collecting measurements during two years of the experiment.riemschneider also stressed that this amount was calculated using costs between,and it would be much higher today.he also added that funding for the project was discontinued in it is unclear whether the defendants conduct had anything to do with that decision.
after hearing riemschneider testimony and the arguments of counsel,the district court adopted riemschneider estimate of as the loss amount attributable to christianson conduct,noting this was a very very conservative estimate and lower than what was actually experienced.it also found that christianson crime was among those listed in the terrorism enhancement under and that she committed those acts to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion.the application of the terrorism enhancement automatically raised her offense level to,with acceptance of responsibility,and her criminal history to a category vi.her guideline range was then calculated at months.after consulting the factors at,the district court sentenced christianson to months in prison.
the same district court sentenced rivera.at sentencing,rivera agreed to the loss amount calculated at christianson hearing but argued that the terrorism enhancement was inapplicable.the district court overruled his objection.he had the same guideline range as christianson months.but after noting his lack of an apology or some form of regret,the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.
on appeal,both defendants challenge the district court loss findings.their argument is.first,they contend that the forest service did not suffer a loss because the cottonwood experiment was terminated and thus worthless.second,they claim the district court erred in calculating the loss amount at because the evidence presented for the value of the cottonwood experiment and the advanced generation clone experiment was unreliable.they do not dispute the figures tied to the vehicles.
this is a mixed question of fact and law.the district court assessment of the amount of loss is a factual finding,which we will not disturb unless it is clearly erroneous.united states berheide,cir.however,the district court conclusion that the destruction of the cottonwood experiment caused the forest service to suffer a loss,as that term is used in,is reviewed de novo.id.defendants argument on this point hinges on the fact that the cottonwood experiment funding was discontinued in.they argue that once the funding was cut the experiment and the trees ceased to have any value.this is obviously not so.the fact that the experiment funding was cut in does not mean that the experiment was worthless or that the forest service did not suffer a loss.the trees value was not defined in relation to their continued funding,nor was there any evidence they would be the moment funding was discontinued.rather,the trees were an essential part of a experiment,the fruits of which were never realized because of defendants conduct.if the defendants chose a different method of protest that night,the trees would still be there and the prior decades of research and toil would not be lost.the district court did not err in holding that defendants conduct caused the forest service to suffer a loss 
the crux of defendants challenge to the total is that the district court erred when it accepted riemschneider testimon
