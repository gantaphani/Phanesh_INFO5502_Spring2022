the question in this case is whether the electronic appointment calendars of six united states department of agriculture usda officials are agency records within the meaning of the freedom of information act foia,a b.the consumer federation of america cfa seeks production of the calendars in an effort to discover whether the officials participated in ex parte meetings with industry representatives while a rulemaking was pending.the district court held that the calendars are not agency records and therefore not subject to production under foia.we reverse that holding with respect to five of the six calendars.

seeking to learn whether usda officials had met exclusively,or nearly exclusively,with industry representatives who favor ed the weakening of the original proposed rule,id.quoting pl.mot.for summ.at,cfa filed a foia request for access to the public calendars of six senior officials for all meetings with individuals,businesses,trade associations other organizations and the subject of the meetings.letter from cfa to usda at.when usda failed to provide a substantive response within the statutory time period,cfa filed suit in district court to compel production of the calendars.
after cfa suit and subsequent motion for summary judgment were filed,usda notified the plaintiff that fsis does not maintain a public calendar for any of its personnel,but that each of the six named officials maintained an electronic calendar on the fsis computer system.letter from usda to cfa at.although usda asserted that the electronic calendars were personal agency records subject to disclosure under the foia,it stated that the six officials had independently volunteered to release their personal calendars,with appropriate redactions,for the periods requested.id.at.usda sent the redacted pages to cfa on february.the redactions were both extensive,blocking out the overwhelming majority of the calendar entries and inconsistent moreover,hundreds of pages,including entire months,were not produced because usda did not cite any foia exemptions to justify the redactions,cfa argued that the court should require the agency to produce the remainder of the calendars or provide a satisfactory explanation for its failure to produce them.consumer fed of,d at quoting pl.reply mem.at.
usda for summary judgment on march.in support of its motion,the agency filed affidavits from the six officials.the six were usda under secretary for food safety elsa murano,deputy usda under secretary for food safety merle pierson,fsis administrator garry mckee,deputy fsis administrator linda swacina,acting fsis administrator barbara masters,and assistant fsis administrator philip derfler.the affidavit filed by fsis administrator mckee stated 
in order to better communicate about my availability,to prevent,among other things,double booking of periods of time,my personal calendar was shared with my secretaries,my special assistant,and the fsis senior management council,which consisted of the other assistant and deputy administrators for fsis.calendar entries were distributed to these few individuals and were in no way distributed widely within usda or fsis.

on july,the district court issued an opinion concluding that the officials appointment calendars maintained on their personal computers are not agency records within the meaning of the statute.consumer fed of,d at.it therefore granted usda motion for summary judgment and dismissed cfa complaint.this appeal followed.
foia grants the district court jurisdiction to enjoin an agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.a b.hence,the court must determine whether the defendant agency has improperly withheld agency records.kissinger reporters comm.for freedom of the press,d quoting a b.the only question at issue on this appeal is the validity of the district court determination that the usda calendars are not agency records.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment on this question de novo.see students against genocide department of state.in the foia context this requires that we ascertain whether the agency has sustained its burden of demonstrating that the documents requested are not agency records.gallant nlrb,see united states dep t of justice tax analysts,d grand cent,cuomo,cir under foia,s ummary judgment may be granted on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory statements,and if they are not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith.gallant,at internal quotation marks omitted.

mindful of this caution,our circuit has adopted a totality of the circumstances test to distinguish agency records from personal records.the test focus es on a variety of factors surrounding the creation,possession,control,and use of the document by an agency.bureau of affairs,at there is no precedent in which we have applied that test to facts directly paralleling those before us.this is due,at least in part,to the technological advances of recent years.
both usda and cfa agree that the precedent that is most nearly on point is bureau of national affairs united states department of justice,a case that concerns paper documents as opposed to electronically stored and retrievable data.in that case,this court considered inter alia whether either of two types of agendas and desk appointment by attorney general for antitrust william baxter constituted agency records under foia.see id.at.the desk calendars contained entries that generally reflect ed the location of a meeting or appointment,the people expected to be present,and on occasion,the general purpose of the meeting or appointment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the daily agendas similarly reflected baxter schedule on a given day.id.in addition to agency business,both the calendars and the daily agendas listed personal appointments wholly unrelated to the business of the antitrust division.id.referring to the desk calendars see id.at referring to both items.
addressing the factors relevant to the totality of the circumstances test,the court noted a number of characteristics shared by the two types of documents.both were created by agency employees,and both were located within and in that sense,were within the possession of the justice department.see id.at.with respect to control,the court indicated that neither the daily agendas nor the desk calendars were placed into agency files,id.at,and that the department required neither their creation nor their retention.see id.at.
what ultimately distinguished the two types of documents was how they were used within the agency.id.at.the purpose of the agendas was to inform the staff of baxter availability they facilitated the operations of the antitrust division.id.consonant with that function,the agendas were distributed to top staff within the antitrust division so that they would know baxter schedule on a given day.id.at.this,bureau of national affairs held,rendered the daily agendas agency records.id.at.
in contrast to the agendas,the desk calendars were retained solely for the convenience of the individual official in organizing his personal and business appointments.id.at.accordingly,although baxter top assistants occasionally had access to the calendars,id.at,they were not distributed to other employees.id.at emphasis in original.this,bureau of national affairs ruled,rendered the desk calendars personal rather than agency records.see id.
bureau of national affairs provides the template necessary to decide this case and,in so doing,to distinguish between the calendars of five of the usda officials and that of the fsis administrator derfler.we consider the principal factors identified in bureau of national,control,and.as we explain,use is the decisive factor here.
as was true of both the daily agendas and the desk calendars in bureau of national thus insufficient by itself to distinguish between agency and personal six usda calendars were created by agency employees and were located within the agency in this case,resident on its computer system.like both baxter agendas and his calendars,the usda calendars were generated within the agenc y and were prepared on government time,at government expense and with government materials,including the appointment calendar software itself.bureau of affairs,at internal quotation marks omitted.in the context of these cases,the question is whether the employee creation of the documents can be attributed to the agency for the purposes of foia.id.at.to answer that question,we must examine two additional factors control and use.
in support of the contention that it does not control the requested calendars,usda declares without explanation that neither its own regulations nor the federal records act fra,et,requires its employees to create or retain the subject calendars.cfa disputes with only slightly more explanation the latter point,asserting that the calendars are records subject to the fra and not disposable at an employee discretion.determining which position is is,whether the usda employees are in fact free to dispose of their a complicated endeavor one that both parties largely avoid.
fortunately,we need not decide whether retention of the calendars was wholly within the officials discretion.although compelled retention or creation might well establish that a document is under usda control,the absence of such a requirement does not resolve the issue since federal law did not require the preservation or creation of the daily agendas in bureau of national affairs.see at.indeed,in that case,we expressly reject ed the government invitation to hold that the treatment of documents for disposal and retention purposes under the various federal records management statutes determines their status under foia.id.at although t hose statutes prescribe how federal agencies are to create,dispose of,and otherwise manage documents and other material,they can not be used as the divining rod for the meaning of agency records under foia.id.
usda also contends that the officials calendars are not agency records because they were not integrated into the agency files.appellee br.this point goes both to control and to use which we discuss next,and was significant in kissinger reporters committee.there,the supreme court considered whether notes of telephone conversations that henry kissinger made while serving as a presidential assistant in the office of the president an entity not covered by foia became agency records when he transferred them to the state department an entity covered by foia upon becoming secretary of state.see at.the court held to the contrary 
the papers were not in the control of the state department at any time.they were not generated in the state department.they never entered the state department files,and they were not used by the department for any purpose.if mere physical location of papers and materials could confer status as an agency record kissinger personal books,speeches,and all other memorabilia stored in his office would have been agency records subject to disclosure under the foia.
id.at.emphasis added.
it is not at all clear that the usda calendars never entered the agency files in the sense in which the word was used in kissinger.usda cites nothing to support its claim in this regard although the agency may be referring to technical records designations that it has made under the fra,see,designations under that statute,as we have noted,do not determine a document status under foia.nor is there any indication that the kissinger court used the term files in a technical sense.the court found that kissinger white house records did not become part of the state department files simply because they were stored in his office at the department,a matter of mere physical location.at.as we explained in bureau of national affairs,kissinger held that the mere physical transfer of kissinger documents to the state department did not by itself render them agency records.at.
the usda calendars,by contrast,were not just stored in their authors offices,but were accessed and updated on a daily basis.indeed,although not dispositive,the technological changes in the period since assistant attorney general baxter kept his appointments in paper calendars are not without significance.the technologically savvy usda officials kept their calendars on the fsis computer system,letter from usda to cfa at,thus necessarily subjecting them to the control of that system administrators.at a minimum,this suggests that usda had more control over its officials calendars than the justice department had over baxter.
in any event,even if the usda calendars never entered usda files,that would not decide the question before us.in bureau of national affairs,the court found that neither the desk calendars nor the daily agendas were placed into agency files.at.nonetheless,the latter were held to be agency records.see id.at.
as in bureau of national affairs,with creation,possession,and control not dispositive in determining whether the calendars are agency records,we must shift our attention to the manner in which the documents were used within the agency.see at where,as here,a document is created by an agency employee consideration of whether and to what extent that employee used the document to conduct agency business is highly relevant for determining whether that document is an agency record within the meaning of foia.see also id.at here,the calendars of the five most senior usda officials have use characteristics that mirror those bureau of national affairs found critical in determining that baxter daily agendas were agency records.
first,baxter agendas were used to inform other staff of baxter whereabouts during the course of a business day so that they could determine baxter availability for meetings.at.similarly,the usda officials affidavits state that their calendars were used to better communicate about their availability,to prevent,among other things,double booking of periods of time,mckee aff.indeed,some of the redacted calendars submitted for our review contain not only their own subjects schedules,but also notations regarding the whereabouts of others,such as when colleagues were traveling outside the office and each indicates when the subject official was scheduled to meet with his or her colleagues,as well as where not redacted with industry representatives 
second,and consonant with their use in facilitating the scheduling of agency business,bureau of national affairs stressed that a distinguishing characteristic of baxter agendas was that they were distributed to other employees,rather than retained solely for the convenience of the individual officials.at emphasis in original.employing the same word,the usda officials declared that their calendars were distributed to other agency employees,mckee aff.moreover,as with baxter agendas,which were distributed to top staff within the antitrust division,at,the calendars of the five senior usda officials were distributed to top fsis staff.administrator mckee calendar,for example,was distributed to the senior management council,which consisted of the assistant and deputy administrators for fsis,as well as to his special assistant and secretaries.mckee aff.with the exception of assistant administrator derfler calendar,the calendars of the other officials had similar distribution lists.see supra notes.
at oral argument,counsel for usda contended,for the first time,that the affidavits use of the word distributed was misleading because the usda officials calendars were not printed and physically distributed to the listed recipients,but instead simply made available on the recipients computers.see oral arg.tape at.although this fact does not appear in the record below,we do not doubt its truthfulness.however,there does not appear to be any practical difference between the former practice of distributing information in printed form on hard copies and the modern practice of allowing others access through network computers.in any meaningful sense,the usda calendars were electronically distributed to the listed recipients and were used by them to schedule agency meetings and prevent conflicts 
our focus on use helps to ensure that a document subject to disclosure under foia is an agency record and not an employee record that happens to be located physically within an agency.bureau of affairs,at citing kissinger,at.unlike secretary kissinger documents,which were merely stored in his office and not used by the department for any purpose,at,the usda calendars were continually updated and used to conduct agency business.and unlike a personal diary containing an individual private reflections on his or her which the individual does not rely upon to perform his or her duties,at,the five usda calendars were in fact relied upon by both their authors and their authors colleagues to facilitate the operations of the fsis,id.at.gallant,at holding that letters sought in a foia request were personal rather than agency records because they were created for a purely personal objective and neither the author nor other employees reli ed on the correspondence to carry out the business of the agency.
usda protests that,because the calendars contain personal as well as business entries,they can not be considered agency records.there is no doubt that the presence of such information may be relevant in determining the use of a document.bureau of affairs,at.but as we said in bureau of national affairs,the inclusion of personal information does not,by itself,take material outside the ambit of foia.id.were that not true,an official could avoid disclosure of the only documentation of a meeting held with industry officials during the pendency of a very information that cfa seeks in this by adorning the document with personal entries.in bureau of national affairs,we held that baxter daily agendas were agency records,notwithstanding that the personal information contained in the agendas was identical to that found in baxter appointment calendars,which we found to be personal records.id.at.the distinguishing factor was that the agendas were distributed to staff for their use in determining baxter availability for meetings,while the calendars were created for the personal convenience of baxter so that he could organize both his personal and business appointments.id.the calendars of the five senior usda officials are indistinguishable from baxter agendas in that regard,and,accordingly,usda has failed to sustain its burden of demonstrating that the documents requested are not agency records.gallant,at.
this is not to say,of course,that the officials personal calendar entries must be produced along with those relating to agency business.to the contrary,both sides agree that the personal entries may be redacted,and we so held in bureau of national affairs.see at the personal information contained in the agendas may be redacted from the copies made available to bna.cfa does not seek information about the usda officials lunches with friends or trips to the dentist it simply wants to know what the government is up to,a goal that is in accord with the basic policy of foia.reporters,at.internal quotation marks omitted.that documents must be redacted to protect personal information does not contravene the conclusion that they are agency records.
finally,we address the sixth usda of assistant administrator provides a counterpoint to the above analysis.while,like his more senior colleagues,derfler distributed his calendar to better communicate about his availability,he distributed it only to his secretary and any temporary secretaries that filled in for his permanent secretary.derfler aff.this places derfler electronic calendar on the same side of the line as assistant attorney general baxter desk calendars,which were similarly distributed only to his secretary,and which bureau of national affairs held were not agency records.
as the court explained,use of the documents by employees other than the author is an important consideration in ensuring that personal papers are not swept into foia reach.bureau of affairs,at.an inquiry is therefore required into the extent to which the creator of the document and other employees acting within the scope of their employment relied upon the document to carry out the business of the agency.id.in this case,there is no evidence that other employees apart from his secretary relied on derfler calendar.rather,like baxter calendars,it was not distributed to other employees.id.at emphasis in original.and just as that fact distinguish ed baxter desk calendars from his daily agendas,so,too,it distinguishes derfler electronic calendar from those of his superiors.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment that the electronic calendar of assistant administrator derfler is not an agency record.for the same reasons,however,we reverse the court judgment that the calendars of the other five senior usda officials are not agency records.
so ordered.
while i concur in the majority holding that five of the six calendars are agency records and thus subject to disclosure under foia and that derfler calendar is not,i do so reluctantly because i believe the majority places too much stock in bureau of national affairs,united states department of justice bna,and leaves some key questions unanswered.
the value of bna as precedent is,i believe,diminished after the united states supreme court decision in united states department of justice tax analysts,d.in bna,the court relied heavily on the authors purpose in creating the documents.it was primarily for that reason that the court determined that baxter daily agendas were agency records but his appointment calendars were not.the daily agendas were created to inform the staff of baxter availability,bna,at,whereas the appointment calendars were created for baxter personal convenience,id.at.after bna,however,the supreme court determined that the author intent is irrelevant to whether a document is an agency record.in that case,the agency argued that the documents were not prepared to be relied upon in agency decisionmaking and therefore were not agency records.rejecting the argument,the court noted,this argument,however,makes the determination of agency records turn on the intent of the creator of a document relied upon by an agency.such a mens rea requirement is nowhere to be found in the act.tax analysts,at.tax analysts thus appears to have rejected the rationale used in bna.in light of tax analysts,bna utility as a template,op.at,is,to me,q
