the only question on appeal is whether the district court erred in dismissing as moot a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment.we hold that it did.
the trade sanctions reform and export enhancement act of the tsra,limits restrictions imposed unilaterally by the president on exports of food,medicine,and other agricultural products to iran,libya,north korea,sudan,and cuba.aimed at lifting embargoes to expand export opportunities particularly for agricultural products,see cong.rec.drafters statement of hagel and ashcroft,the tsra provides that the president may not impose a unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction against a foreign country or foreign entity without the prior approval of congress.a as relevant here,of the tsra authorizes limited restrictions on exports of agricultural products to countries that the state department has determined to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.id.a such exports require a license,which will authorize exports pursuant to contracts entered into during the license period so long as the products are shipped within one year of the signing of the covered contract.the licensing requirements shall be no more restrictive than license exceptions administered by the department of commerce or general licenses administered by the department of the treasury,except for procedures involving export licenses to an entity in such country,or in the area of afghanistan,promoting international terrorism.id.
the treasury department,through the office of foreign assets control ofac,published an interim rule on july,to carry out tsra with regard to exports to iran and other countries,stating in the preamble it was adopting an expedited licensing process,with deadlines for agency action that in material respects are the same as those of the commerce department under this expedited process,ofac would refer the application to other agencies,and,provided the license application met the requirements set forth in the regulations,ofac would issue the license so long as no objection was received within nine business days.however,on march,ofac announced that the events of september,had magnified concerns about international terrorism,that the volume of license requests has increased substantially since the inception of the tsra program,and that applications are now much more complicated than the earlier ones.sudanese sanctions regulations iranian sanctions regulations,ofac march regulations.although confirming it would continue to conduct a review of license applications consistent with the requirements of section of tsra,ofac stated,however,that ofac processing may take longer than the time periods suggested at the inception of the tsra program.id.
del monte fresh produce company is a vertically integrated producer,marketer,and distributor of fresh fruits and vegetables,and facilitates sales abroad by its foreign affiliates,such as del monte foods fze together del monte.on august,del monte submitted an application to ofac for a license the august license to export agricultural commodities to ten entities in iran,none of which were listed on either of the two terrorists lists identified in commerce department regulations.del monte alleges that because the august license application contained all of the information specified in ofac regulations,ofac referred the application to the state department on august,and that the state department responded on september,without raising an objection to issuance of the license.still,ofac did not issue the license.del monte repeated inquiries to ofac about the status of the license revealed only that its application was pending.on november,del monte was advised by ofac help desk that its august license application was still pending.
on november,del monte filed suit.it had been more than days since ofac had received the august license application,more than days since ofac referred the application to the state department,and more than days since the state department response.on november del monte filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court scheduled a status conference on that motion,and ofac issued the august license to del monte.
del monte filed an amended complaint on january,seeking a declaratory judgment that ofac failure to issue the august license until november,constituted agency action that was both unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed under the administrative procedure act apa.in addition to alleging facts relating to ofac unlawful delay in issuing the august license,del monte alleged that ofac licensing inaction action at issue in this case is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,because the time required to litigate the case was longer than the mandatory deadlines and the time necessary for the government to review the application.am.compl.further it alleged,b ecause facilitating sales of,and selling,food products to iran is,and has been,a part of del monte ongoing business plan,del monte will continue to apply for ofac licenses in the future on a continuing basis,id,and t here is a reasonable expectation that del monte will be subject to the same inaction action by ofac again in the future with respect to future license applications,id.
the district court granted the government motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on grounds of mootness pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.del monte fresh produce united states,d.the district court observed that where a plaintiff seeks only declaratory relief as a remedy for a defendant past conduct,the action will be moot unless one of two exceptions to mootness applies.with regard to the capable of repetition yet evading review exception,the district court concluded that because del monte amended complaint only sought relief for the handling of the august license application,and ofac had already issued that license,it is impossible for delay of that application to reoccur.id.at.with regard to the voluntary cessation exception,the district court credited the representations of ofac and concluded that its issuance of the august license on november,was independent of del monte lawsuit.
del monte appeals the dismissal of its amended complaint on the principal ground that the claim for relief falls within the capable of repetition but evading review exception to the mootness doctrine.our review is de novo.see munsell dep t of.
a case is moot when the challenged conduct ceases such that there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated in circumstances where it becomes impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.united states philip morris usa,quoting city of erie pap,d.in at least two kinds of cases the fact that the specific conduct that gave rise to the case has ceased does not mean that the challenge to the legality of that conduct is moot.city of houston,dep t of housing urban.
first,a plaintiff challenge will not be moot where it seeks declaratory relief as to an ongoing policy.id.at.in super tire engineering mccorkle,d,the supreme court held that although a claim for injunctive relief preventing payment of welfare benefits during a strike was moot because the strike had ended,the employers request for declaratory relief was not moot because the state ongoing policy of paying strike benefits was,on the employers theory of the case,immediately and directly injurious to the employers economic positions.of course,plaintiffs challenging an ongoing policy must demonstrate standing to bring such a challenge and that the request for declaratory relief is ripe.city of houston,at.
second,even though the specific action that the plaintiff challenges has ceased,a claim for declaratory relief will not be moot even if the plaintiff has made no challenge to an ongoing underlying policy,but merely attacks an isolated agency action,so long as the specific claim fits the exception for cases that are capable of repetition,yet evading review,or falls within the voluntary cessation doctrine.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in olmstead ex rel.zimring,d,the supreme court held that the challenge by two mental patients to their confinement in a segregated environment was not mooted by their transfers because in view of the multiple institutional placements they had experienced,the controversy they brought to court was capable of repetition,yet evading review.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also cal.coastal comm granite rock,d.del monte has chosen this second route by alleging that ofac failure to act promptly on del monte august license application is capable of repetition yet evades review.
under the capable of repetition yet evading review exception to mootness,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.clarke united states,en banc quoting murphy hunt,d alteration in original see also honig doe,d.when these two circumstances are simultaneously present,spencer kemna,d,the plaintiff has demonstrated an exceptional circumstance,in which the exception will apply,see clarke,at.its theoretical justification is somewhat obscure,christian knights of ku klux klan invisible empire,district of columbia kkk,the evading review aspect perhaps suggesting justiciability by necessity while its capable of repetition aspect assuring that the parties have a sufficient interest in the result,the exception is well established.del monte has met its burden on both prongs.
first,a challenge to the timeliness of ofac response to applications for a license can not be fully litigated before the expiration,let alone the granting,of the requested license.by evading review the supreme court has meant evading supreme court review.id.this court has held that agency actions of less than two years duration can not be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,so long as the short duration is typical of the challenged action.pub.utils.comm ferc,burlington surface transp.the tsra license covers only contracts signed during a one year period shipments pursuant to the contract must be made within a year of the date the contract is signed.a.moreover,even though ofac has announced that it may not be able to process license applications within the deadlines allegedly required by the tsra,the longest delay identified by del monte was only days and the average time for ofac to act on license applications from july to march did not exceed business days.am.compl.del monte opp to mot.to dismiss,ex.del monte challenge thus meets the prong of the exception.
second,in order to decide whether the same type of inaction or unreasonable delay is sufficiently likely to recur,the court must first determine exactly what must be repeatable in order to save the case from mootness.people for the ethical treatment of animals,gittens peta,see also clarke,at.three circuit precedents provide instruction 
in peta the court adopted a functional approach,explaining that t he wrong that is,or is not,capable of repetition,must be defined in terms of the precise controversy it spawns,that is,the wrong must be put in terms of the legal questions it presents for decision.at emphasis added.in that case the issue presented by peta first amendment challenge to the government allegedly pretextual rejection of peta submission to a display of,statutes was highly.as such,the court concluded that the wrong suffered by peta was unlikely to recur,and that the claim was therefore moot.
in clarke,the en banc court explained that the wrong at issue for mootness purposes is defined by the plaintiffs theory set forth in the complaint.clarke,at.there,members of the council challenged a federal statute as a violation of their first amendment rights because it conditioned appropriations for the district of columbia on the council amendment of the human rights act.id.the united states had suggested the injury be defined as congressional use of funding to induce appellees to enact specific language allowing religiously affiliated institutions to discriminate against homosexuals the council members had suggested the issue was whether congress can coerce their votes by withholding appropriated funds.id.at.this court rejected both suggestions the united states position because it included facts completely irrelevant to any intelligible formulation of plaintiffs claim,and the council members suggestion because it attempted to press a broader notion of their injury than the one on which they originally sought relief.id.instead,the court focused on identifying the factors that were essential to plaintiffs original theory of their claim,concluding that even broadly conceived the injurious act of which the council members conditioning of funding on the council enactment of legislation in specific language was not reasonably likely to recur.id.at.
in kkk,at,although the klan challenged no regulations on their face,and its complaint concerned only its requests for an october,parade permit,the court held the controversy was capable of repetition because there was a reasonable likelihood that in the future the klan would seek parade permits,raising the same concerns of violence.the klan had requested a permit to march along constitution avenue from to streets on october,citing the risk of violence incited by the klan presence,the district government granted a parade permit for only four blocks.as this court subsequently explained,the wrong in the kkk case was not limited to the treatment of the klan application for the october,parade,but rather consisted of the district government refusal,in alleged violation of the first amendment,to grant a parade permit because the march would provoke violence.peta,at.
the district court approach in identifying the wrong alleged in del monte amended complaint failed to adhere to this precedent.in agreeing with this approach,our dissenting colleague does likewise.dis.op.at.the district court concluded,and the government maintains on appeal,that del monte claims are not capable of repetition because the alleged wrong was the delay in acting on del monte august license application.on this view of the mootness inquiry,because the august license was granted,the wrong is not capable of repetition.however,the district court approach focuses on whether the precise historical facts that spawned the plaintiff claims are likely to recur,rather than whether the legal wrong complained of by the plaintiff is reasonably likely to recur,as our precedent requires.see peta,at kkk,at clarke,at.
del monte has shown there is a reasonable likelihood it will be subjected to the same challenged action in the future.it alleged that ofac was required to,but did not,grant del monte license,am.compl,nine business days after ofac refer red the application for review by other agencies,when the other agencies lodge d no objection within that nine period,id.according to the amended complaint,this deadline was imposed by tsra incorporation of commerce and treasury department regulations as a ceiling on the restrictiveness of the licensing procedures and by ofac adoption of the nine deadline.id.ofac failure to respond to the august application until november,was,del monte alleged,unlawful in two ways it constituted action unlawfully withheld and action unlawfully delayed.id.therefore,under the theory in the amended complaint,it was irrelevant whether ofac can or will delay action on the august license application what matters is whether it is reasonably likely that del monte will suffer the same type of legal withheld approval or unlawful delay by ofac in violation of tsra the future.to answer this jurisdictional question,we look to the complaint and the undisputed facts in the record.herbert acad.of.
when del monte filed suit on november,ofac had not granted the august license because standing is assessed as of the time a suit commences,del monte has standing to seek declaratory relief.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.with regard to mootness,del monte proffered the unchallenged declaration of its as
