syverson has bought and sold livestock since,doing business as syverson livestock brokers in wanamingo,minnesota.he is registered under the packers and stockyards act psa as both a market agency and a dealer.this dual registration means that he can traffic in livestock either as a market agency working on a commission basis,gleaning profit from the fees charged for arranging transactions,or as a dealer,deriving profit from the difference between his cost basis and sale price.in,syverson was ordered to cease and desist from i ssuing accounts of purchase or sale which fail to show the true and correct nature of the livestock transaction accounted for therein and causing false records to be prepared.in re todd syverson,p s docket no,june.
in the spring of,syverson entered into an arrangement with lance quam,in which quam sought to purchase approximately sixty cows during the coming summer quam intended to breed the cows.syverson agreed to provide the cows at his purchase price,plus a commission of,and additional expenses,including trucking 
during the summer of,syverson purchased cattle at the zumbrota livestock auction in zumbrota,minnesota.the auction sold different types of cattle on different days of the week.the monday auction included a variety of cattle,including open not pregnant cows,feeder cattle,calves,market cattle,fat cattle,and dairy cows being sold for slaughter.typically,although not always,cattle sold at the monday auction were sold for slaughter and priced by the pound.the monday auction is colloquially known as the slaughter or cull auction,and most cattle sold at this auction are slaughtered shortly thereafter.cattle sold at the monday auction are given a identification tag,commonly known as a slaughter tag.
on tuesdays,dairy cows are auctioned.cows sold at the dairy auction are generally bound for dairy farms and priced by the head rather than by weight.compared to the cattle sold at the monday slaughter auction,cows sold on tuesday tend to be of higher quality and are typically more expensive.in order to be sold at the tuesday auction,a cow must have received a veterinary inspection that evaluates the overall health of the cow and the state of the udders.the cow must also be tested for brucellosis and tuberculosis.a cow that passes the veterinary inspection can be given a identification tag,marking it as suitable for the tuesday dairy auction.importantly,a cow that has already received a slaughter tag can have its slaughter tag replaced with a dairy auction tag if it passes a veterinary inspection.
at both auctions,an individual that puts cattle up for sale is known as the consigner,as they have consigned their cattle to the auction for sale.the consigner remains the owner of the cattle during the auction and bears the risk that the cattle may die while at auction.ownership is transferred when a successful bid is made for the cattle.if the consigner does not feel the bidding is at a fair price,then he may either stop the bidding and withdraw his cattle from the auction at no charge known as a or repurchase the cattle from his own consignment,incurring auction fees.
on at least eight occasions during the summer of,syverson bought cattle at the monday slaughter auction,had the cattle inspected by a veterinarian,for the dairy auction,and then consigned for sale the next day in the tuesday dairy auction.syverson repurchased the cows from his own consignment and paid auctioneering fees of approximately twenty to dollars per head.syverson then delivered some of these repurchased cows to quam,accompanied by an invoice that showed the tuesday dairy auction price,a commission of,a veterinary fee,and the cost of trucking 
to understand these transactions,it is useful to consider an example.at the monday slaughter auction on august,syverson bought a cow weighing pounds,at a price of per hundredweight,for a total purchase price of.the cow four digit slaughter tag was.after passing a veterinarian examination that evening,the cow was for the tuesday dairy auction.
at the tuesday dairy cow auction the following day,syverson consigned cow to the auction and then repurchased the same cow from his own consignment for.syverson had the auction segregate the cow into its own pen and invoice the cow as order for quam.the cow was then taken to a veterinarian for various shots and delivered to quam later that day.for this cow,syverson invoiced quam,which included for syverson purchase price,a commission,a veterinary fee,and for trucking.with the invoice,syverson included his tuesday dairy auction receipt,representing that he had paid for the cow.syverson did not disclose that he had repurchased the cow from his own consignment or that the cow had been initially purchased at the monday slaughter auction.as a result,the total amount invoiced to quam was greater than the amount syverson paid for the cow at the monday slaughter auction.
in february,quam received eight cows from syverson.the trucker making the delivery,jim klecker,said to quam,oh,you the one,and then related rumors circulating at the zumbrota auction,that todd syverson was buying these cattle on monday and turning around and running them up on tuesday and selling them to somebody and they did know who.klecker reported that he had spoken to syverson about this rumor and that syverson had responded,well,just keep it quiet about who we tell about where we got cattle there.nobody else needs to know.
acting on this information,quam acquired veterinary records from the zumbrota auction.the records showed that syverson had been repurchasing dairy cows from the tuesday dairy auction that he had initially purchased at the monday slaughter auction,confirming what klecker had said.on may,quam complained to the grain inspection,packers and stockyard administration gipsa about his dealings with syverson.robert merritt,the minnesota resident agent for gipsa,commenced an investigation.gipsa requested that syverson produce for inspection his business records for.syverson did not turn over records of his business with quam,stating that he had lost the records during a move.although syverson turned over other records,the records of transactions with quam were missing.after speaking with his lawyer,syverson produced some records of his business with quam,claiming that they had been misfiled.these records,however,did not include the initial price or source of the cows that were supplied to quam.
on december,gipsa filed a formal complaint against syverson,alleging that his violated a as an unfair or deceptive practice and that his failure to keep proper business records violated.gipsa complaint sought a cease and desist order,a fine,and suspension of syverson registration under the psa.
an administrative law judge alj held a hearing on april.the alj issued her decision on august,concluding that syverson,acting as a dealer under the psa,had violated a by engaging in a deceptive and unfair practice,and had violated for his failure to produce his business records for inspection.in re todd syverson,p s docket no,wl,syverson i.the alj found that syverson had intentionally withheld the invoices that he had sent to quam.the alj assessed a civil penalty of and ordered syverson to cease and desist from similar violations of the psa.
on september,gipsa appealed the alj decision to the judicial officer.gipsa argued that syverson had acted as a market agency,not as a dealer,and that his violations were serious violations of the psa.gipsa emphasized that syverson had been ordered in to cease and desist from misrepresenting important facts about livestock purchases and sales to his customers.according to gipsa,a suspension was warranted.syverson denied that he had violated the psa and argued that no sanction should be imposed.
the judicial officer issued his final decision on august.in re todd syverson,p s docket no,wl,syverson ii.he concluded that syverson had acted as a market agency.in reaching this conclusion,the judicial officer considered a number of factors syverson had charged quam what appeared to be a commission of per head there was a agreement between syverson and quam for the purchase of cattle syverson listed each expense that he incurred on his invoice veterinary and trucking fees,rather than providing a comprehensive price syverson communicated his cost basis to quam,a practice that dealers tend to avoid syverson presented an invoice to quam that not only showed his cost basis,but also showed from whom syverson had purchased the cattle,a practice required of market agencies,not dealers and on at least one occasion,syverson segregated the cattle that he repurchased at the tuesday dairy auction into an order lot for quam,suggesting that syverson had repurchased the cattle specifically for quam,rather than merely to fill his own inventory.the judicial officer stated that although none of these factors alone was dispositive,the great weight of the evidence led him to conclude that syverson was acting as a market agency.
accordingly,the judicial officer determined that syverson had violated a by engaging in unfair and deceptive practices and that his violations were most serious.the judicial officer ordered syverson to cease and desist from similar practices and from failing to produce his records for inspection.beginning his discussion of whether a suspension was appropriate,the judicial officer recited the secretary of agriculture sanction policy 
t he sanction in each case will be determined by examining the nature of the violations in relation to the remedial purposes of the regulatory statute involved,along with all relevant circumstances,always giving appropriate weight to the recommendations of the administrative officials charged with the responsibility for achieving the congressional purpose.
in re farms linn county,agric.applying this policy,the judicial officer stated that the administrators of the psa had recommended a suspension.he noted that the purpose of an administrative sanction is to deter future violations,that the case involved serious violations of the psa,and that syverson had not been deterred by a prior cease and desist order.the judicial officer then concluded that a suspension was warranted.on september,syverson timely filed this appeal,and the judicial officer stayed his order pending our review of his decision.the secretary of the department of agriculture argues for affirmation of the judicial officer decision.
we review de novo the judicial officer conclusions of law.rice wilcox,cir.great deference,however,is accorded to the judicial officer construction of the psa,given that he is charged with enforcing it.van wyk bergland,cir citing griggs duke power,d.
the factual findings of the judicial officer will be sustained if they are supported by substantial evidence.e states cattle dep t of,cir.substantial evidence is a deferential review standard,requiring only the presence of such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.states cattle,at quoting consol.edison of new york nlrb.evidence may be substantial even when two inconsistent conclusions might have been drawn from it.iowa farms united states,cir.this standard applies with equal force when the judicial officer has reached a conclusion different from that reached by the administrative law judge.farrow dep t of,cir.we may not substitute our judgment for that of the judicial officer as to what may be inferred from the evidence.lewis butz,cir.
we review the judicial officer imposition of sanctions for abuse of discretion.ferguson dep t of,cir quoting butz glover livestock comm,d.the judicial officer abuses his discretion when the sanction imposed is unwarranted in law or without justification in fact.conforti united states,cir.
syverson argues that the judicial officer erred in concluding that he was acting as a market agency when selling cattle to quam.the psa defines a market agency as any person engaged in the business of buying or selling in commerce livestock on a commission basis or furnishing stockyard services.c.under the act,a dealer is any person,not a market agency,engaged in the business of buying or selling in commerce livestock,either on his own account or as the employee or agent of the vendor or purchaser.d.the distinction between a market agency and a dealer is critical to the administration of the psa a market agency owes a fiduciary duty to his customer and is held to a higher standard of conduct than a dealer.united states donahue,cir.see generally stafford wallace.explaining the construction and purposes of the psa.
the appearance of the word commission on an invoice is not dispositive.ferguson,at.rather,the nature of the business relationship is determinative of whether a registrant acted as a market agency or a dealer.id.at.to flesh out the nature of the relationship,we have found relevant whether the invoices of the registrant led customers to believe they consisted of the actual purchase price plus transactional fees whether the registrant made representations to customers that his only profit was the transactional fees whether the registrant told customers that he was acting as a market agency whether the registrant purchased cattle with a specific customer in mind whether the registrant made adjustments to the price of cattle in light of quality concerns.id.at.while all of these factors are relevant,none are conclusive.id.at.
the question before us is whether there was substantial evidence supporting the judicial officer determination that syverson was acting as a market agency,that is selling on a commission basis.c states cattle,at.review for substantial evidence does not require that we agree with the judicial officer,but merely that we find his determination to be a reasonable one.states cattle,at.given the totality of the evidence,we conclude that it was.
syverson provided quam with invoices that included a commission of per head,and those invoices made it seem as though the price was syverson cost plus transactional fees.syverson words and actions represented that his profit was gleaned from the transactional fees,not from the difference in his cost basis and the sale price.the invoicing system that syverson used was typical of a market agency dealers tend to refrain from displaying their cost basis and market agencies,unlike dealers,are required to attach invoices showing their cost basis and the origin of the animal.syverson conformed to the invoicing requirements of a market agency,displayed his cost basis,and itemized his expenses as a market agency typically would.there was evidence that syverson segregated cattle at the auction into specific order lots for quam.while none of these factors alone would be sufficient,the totality is substantial evidence that syverson was acting as a market agency.
syverson disagrees and contends that the record is virtually devoid of evidence that he was acting as a market agency.first,he argues that the judicial officer did not give proper deference to the administrative law judge contrary finding that he was acting as a dealer.we do not agree,for as we have previously said,the judicial officer may substitute his judgment for that of the administrative law judge.farrow,at.
second,syverson states the following factors weigh against a finding of market agency he claims that the per head commission was not in fact a commission,but rather a flat fee syverson testified that the word commission o
