jason mages challenges a decision of the united states department of agriculture usda requiring him to repay more than in farm program benefits on the grounds he was not a separate person entitled to receive benefits and he engaged in a scheme or device to evade farm program requirements.we reverse and remand.
jason mages hereinafter jason or mages is a young farmer.he grew up on his parents farm near paynesville,minnesota.in,at age,mages started his own farming operation.when he turned,mages already owned his own land and farm equipment,and he other land he obtained his own insurance and financing.he made his own planting decisions and performed his own labor.for all the years between and,mages certified on applications for farm program benefits that his farming operation was separate and distinct from any other operation and that he provided of the active personal management of his farm.between and,jason received in farm program benefits.
like many farmers do,mages occasionally swapped labor or equipment with his parents he also entered a verbal agreement the crop agreement with rodi,a farm corporation established by his parents,ron and diane mages.under the crop agreement,mages and rodi jointly purchased crop inputs such as fertilizer,herbicides,and seed to obtain discounts.records were kept of the purchases,with each paying a percentage of the purchase price commensurate with their share of the products.both mages and rodi thereby realized a reduction in input costs they could not have obtained making those purchases separately.
the crop agreement also pertained to the sale of the crops.mages joined his crops with those of rodi,which in turn entered into marketing contracts with other entities.when the crops were combined in this manner,the larger volume contracts allowed both mages and rodi to realize a higher price for their commodities than if sold separately.the contracts were in rodi name because mages father had relationships with the buyers,and mages sought to take advantage of such relationships.because the contracts were in rodi name,scale tickets issued by grain elevators were also in rodi name even when the crops reflected on the tickets were mages crops.similar to the joint purchases of crop inputs,mages and rodi kept records of the crop sales and periodically settled their respective income amounts under the crop through cash payments to each other and at other times through the use of offsets of amounts owed from rodi to mages or vice versa.
in,a potential wetlands violation was identified by the usda on farmland managed by rodi.farming operations that commit wetlands violations are ineligible for some or all farm program benefits.in addition,persons affiliated with wetlands violators may be ineligible for some or all farm program benefits.after rodi potential wetlands violation was identified,the usda reviewed the status of jason mages farming operation to determine whether mages was a separate person under for purposes of receiving farm program benefits.at that time,the usda determined mages was a separate person.
ron and diane mages were indicted by a federal grand jury in october with a host of offenses arising,in part,from their ownership interest in rodi and another corporation identified as gmi.the indictments included allegations the mageses defrauded creditors in their bankruptcy proceeding by concealing their interests in rodi and gmi and defrauded the usda by receiving farm program payments despite wetlands violations committed by one or both corporations.the indictment also charged jason mages with two counts of engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property in violation of on the grounds he had obtained significant funds from rodi.ron and diane were convicted by a jury who found they but not jason were an alter ego for rodi and gmi.jason contended he was innocent because the rodi payments he received were for his own crops marketed with rodi crops under the crop agreement.he presented detailed evidence during the trial tracing all transactions between himself and rodi and establishing the legitimacy of the transactions.the jury acquitted jason of all charges.
in november,the meeker county farm service agency fsa initiated an investigation into the relationship between the farming operations of ron and diane mages,rodi,clem jebb a friend of ron and diane named by them as the president of rodi in corporate documents,jason mages,and his sister,sara mages.the meeker county fsa committee determined jason mages was not separate and distinct from rodi.after the stearns county and kandiyohi county fsa committees made similar determinations,jason mages appealed the decisions to the minnesota state committee.
on october,the state committee issued its decision.the state committee made the following findings of fact 
jason submitted farm operating plans to fsa showing he had interest in his farming operation and that he had no interest in any other farming operation.
the fact that jason stated in the state committee hearing that rodi had no written agreement with jason to market his grain and in fact received no monetary compensation for marketing his grain.
a statement from wayne fridgon sic crop insurance adjuster in which wayne say sic jason told him rodi was his farm name.
a statement from victor bruer,crop insurance loss adjuster in which victor say sic rodi scale tickets were presented to him as tickets from all three mage sic farming operations.
the fact that jason had used rodi scale tickets to claim and receive crop insurance indemnities on his farm.
testimony showing that rodi actually contracted jason beans.an action which made rodi liable for delivery of beans producer sic on jason farm.
the fact that rodi shared in the proceeds from jason farming operation as evidenced by checks issued to rodi from the sale of crops grown on jason farm.
the fact that court records show that from to,of the monies paid out by rodi,went to jason mages.
the fact that jason amended a grain contract for rodi and signed the contract rodi by jason mages.
the fact that rodi claimed proceeds from the sale of his beans as taxable income for rodi.
rodi paid jason debts as evidenced by testimony from larry serbus,manager klein burger,bird island mn.
the fact that clem jeb sic,who had been granted immunity from prosecution if he told the truth,stated that he had never talked to jason about rodi,while jason said he talked directly to clem about issues dealing with rodi.
appellee app.at.
based on these fact findings,the state committee concluded 
jason mages did not meet the criteria to be considered a person separate and distinct from any other producer.jason farming operation does not meet the commensurate share rule.jason is ineligible from fsa program payments from through.in addition the state committee determined that jason had many opportunities to disclose the information concerning his relationship to rodi.his failure to do so prevented the county committee sic from making proper eligibility determinations.as a result the state committee determined that jason had participated in a scheme to earn payments he was not entitled to from through 
jason appealed the state committee decision to the usda national appeal division nad.on january,after an informal hearing,the nad hearing officer made the following findings of fact 
the appellant has participated in usda programs since as a separate person,eligible for maximum benefits under program payment limitations.from through he collected in program benefits subject to payment limitations.
from through,the appellant identified and certified himself as a separate person for usda program purposes.he identified farms that he owned and rented.his farm plan and annual updates show that he contributed of the labor and management including marketing.he indicated that he had read and understood regulations regarding the designation of a separate person.
rodi,is a separate farming entity that was managed by the appellant father.the appellant mother was the bookkeeper.in a potential wetland violation was identified on rodi managed land.this led to a review of the appellant status as a separate person because of usda benefits.this review ended with a determination that appellant was a separate person.
a usda office of inspector general oig review of rodi found that between and nearly of rodi proceeds totaling went to the appellant.these proceeds were mainly from the marketing of his crops through rodi contracts.
in and,the appellant documented crop losses for insurance purposes using rodi scale tickets.he was subsequently paid crop insurance indemnities based on them.
in,the appellant paid a personal debt to the company using rodi navy beans.
from rodi had wetland violations on land that were sic corporately controlled.
based on these fact findings,the nad hearing officer made the following pertinent conclusions 
the regulations require a separate and distinct interest in crops,separate responsibility,and separate accounts from that of any other entity.the appellant relationship with rodi violates theses regulations because the appellant interest in the crops through this informal arrangement fails the separate and distinct test.the agency correctly determines that the appellant was not a separate person for usda programs from.
rodi contracts were used to market the appellant commodities.therefore rodi had a contribution to and an interest in the appellant farming operation that was at risk,namely default of these marketing contracts.the appellant was under no written obligation to provide the crops for the contracts.
the role that rodi played in marketing the appellant grain established an interest in the appellant operation.if the agency had known of this arrangement,rodi would have been due a portion of the appellant benefits under the commensurate share rule.because rodi had an interest in the appellant commodities,the agency correctly concludes that the appellant was not a separate person for usda benefits.
rodi is an entity that has been in violation of wetland provisions and therefore ineligible for usda benefits.completely revealing the appellant relationship with rodi could result in his ineligibility for usda programs.the agency correctly concludes that not revealing this relationship is a scheme or device that if not designed sic disclosed,has the effect of evading the correct determination of the appellant operation.
the agency decision that the appellant was not a separate person for usda program purposes and that he participated in a scheme or device was not erroneous.
mages made a timely request to have the nad hearing officer decision reviewed by the director of the nad.on april,the nad issued a director review determination adverse to mages.focusing on the same facts identified by the state committee and the nad hearing officer,the director review made the following pertinent conclusions 
t he appellant crops were marketed under rodi,contracts and the proceeds were paid directly to rodi.the appellant used rodi,scale tickets to claim and receive crop insurance payments.the appellant has not shown a separate and distinct interest in the crops produced nor a separate responsibility for such.substantial evidence supports the hearing officer determination that the agency did not err in determining that the appellant was not a person separate and distinct from any other individual or entity.
the appellant certified himself as a person,separate and distinct from other individuals and entities and concealed the interest that rodi,had in his farming operation.substantial evidence supports the hearing officer determination that the agency did not err in its decision that the appellant participated with rodi,in a scheme or device to avoid payment limitation provisions and received payments to which he was not entitled.
appellant app.at.
in accordance with the provisions of the administrative procedure act apa,mages filed an action in federal district court requesting review of the final agency decision.following a hearing on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court upheld the agency decision.mages filed a timely appeal with this court.
on appeal,mages does not challenge the usda factual findings.instead,mages challenges whether the usda properly concluded he did not have a separate and distinct interest in his farming operation and therefore was not eligible to participate in usda farm programs as a separate person,and whether the usda properly concluded he engaged in a scheme or device to evade the farm program requirements.
when reviewing the district court opinion upholding the administrative agency decision,this court must render an independent decision on the basis of the same administrative record as that before the district court.united states massey,cir citing moore custis,cir.we will set aside an agency decision if it arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.w e accord substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.south dakota united states dep t of interior,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
separate and distinct interest 
first,mages challenges the usda determination he did not have a separate and distinct interest in his own farming operation.
to be considered a separate person eligible for farm program payments,an individual or entity must,in part,h ave a separate and distinct interest in the land or the crop involved.the usda determined mages did not have a separate and distinct interest and thus was not a separate person after concluding rodi had an interest in mages crops arising from the crop agreement.mages disputes rodi had any interest in his crops.in the alternative,he contends he satisfied the separate and distinct interest test even assuming rodi had an interest in his crops.
to satisfy the separate and distinct interest test,mages need only have had an interest in the land or the crop involved.emphasis supplied.mages had a separate and distinct interest in the land involved in his farming operation.mages owned his farmland or it.there is no evidence rodi had an interest in mages land.thus,even assuming rodi had an interest in the crops grown on the issue we need not address for purposes of resolving mages separate person in the pertinent regulations indicates rodi alleged crop interest somehow negates mages separate and distinct interest in the land.the usda decision is flawed because it required mages to show a separate and distinct interest in his land and crops,notwithstanding the disjunctive nature of the regulation the usda decision on this issue is plainly inconsistent with the regulation and therefore can not stand.
in addition to its determination mages failed the separate and distinct interest test because rodi had an interest in his crops,the usda also seems to have implicitly,if not expressly,found mages had an interest in rodi and therefore failed the separate and distinct interest test for that reason.even assuming mages had some interest in issue we need not address for purposes of resolving mages separate person having an interest in another farming operation did not negate mages separate person status given mages separate and distinct interest in his own farmland 
scheme or device 
next,mages challenges the usda decision he engaged in a scheme or device to evade payment limitations under the farm program.farm payments may be withheld or required to be refunded if a person adopts or participates in adopting a scheme or device designed to evade this part,the farm program or that has the effect of evading this part.the regulation further provides participation in a scheme or device includes c oncealing information that affects the application of this part or s ubmitting false or erroneous information.id 
the agency determined mages participated in a scheme or device for three reasons.first,the usda determined mages engaged in a scheme or device by applying for farm program payments as a separate person.because the usda wrongly concluded mages did not have a separate and distinct interest in his farming operation,it follows he did not engage in a scheme or device merely by applying for farm program payments as a separate person.
the last two reasons given in support of the scheme or device determination focus primarily on mages crop agreement with rodi.first,the usda concluded rodi had an interest in mages crops because of the crop agreement and the nondisclosure of the interest violated the commensurate share rule under.second,the usda seems to have concluded in the alternative mages had an interest in rodi,and the nondisclosure of this interest prevented the agency from making a correct determination about whether mages was ineligible for farm programs as an affiliated person of a wetlands violator under.we address each of these conclusions in turn.
the commensurate share rule 
the commensurate share rule requires an individual or entity to have both a share of the profits or losses from the farming operation that is commensurate with the individual or entity contribution to the operation,and c ontributions to the farming operation that are at risk in order to be considered eligible for farm program payments.a b.in accord with this commensurate share rule,farm program payments are made to those entities or individuals who are actively engaged in farming with interests in a farming operation according to those respective interests.
in other words,if rodi had a contribution to jason mages farming operation that was at risk and rodi was otherwise eligible to participate in the farm program rodi would have been due a portion of mages farm program payments.but if rodi was not eligible to participate in the farm program,no one,including mages,would have been entitled to receive the portion of the farm program payments which corresponded to rodi at risk contribution.the usda contends mages violated the commensurate share rule by receiving farm program payments which corresponded to rodi contribution to mages farming operation,and since rodi was ineligible to receive farm program payments as a wetlands violator,no one should have received the farm program payment attributable to rodi interest in mages farming operation.
application of the commensurate share rule to the crop agreement between rodi and mages necessarily turns on whether rodi had a contribution to mages farming operation that was at risk.id.at b.n either the statute nor the regulations define the phrase at risk.presumably,it is used in its ordinary sense and means that a contribution must be a true economic investment in the farming operation.such an investment carries with it the potential for personal gain or loss in accordance with the performance of the farming operation.christopher kelley alan malaskey,federal farm program law a lawyer guide,mitchell.
in the agency proceedings,the only reason given by the usda to support the conclusion rodi had an at risk contribution to mages farming operation was 
rodi contracts were used to market the appellant commodities.therefore rodi had a contribution to and an interest in the appellant farming operation that was at risk,namely default on these marketing contracts.the appellant was under no written obligation to provide the crops for the contracts.
appellee app.at.thus,the usda concluded rodi had an at risk contribution to mages farming operation because,without a written agreement,rodi had no remedy if mages failed to provide crops for rodi contracts.
the usda conclusion,which turns on whether the crop agreement was in writing,is not legally sound.the contract between rodi and mages did not have to be in writing to be enforceable.see mcardle williams,indicating oral contracts are generally valid and enforceable under minnesota law see also eklund vincent brass and aluminum,quoting rowe noren pattern and foundry,where an oral contract may be completed in less than a year,even though it is clear that in all probability the contract will extend for a period of years,the statute of frauds is not violated.
neither mages nor rodi,nor the usda for that matter,dispute the existence of an agreement between rodi and mages.if mages had breached the crop agreement by failing to provide rodi sufficient crops to satisfy its marketing contracts,rodi would be entitled to sue mages for breach of contract.rodi alleged contribution to mages farming operation via the crop marketing agreement was not at risk,therefore,because mages had a contractual duty to provide the crops and rodi had a contractual remedy if mages breached.rodi did not have a true economic investment in mages farming operation because its interests were merely contractual in nature.the usda conclusion the lack of a written agreement placed rodi contribution at risk is not in accordance with law,a,and therefore can not stand.
because rodi did not have a contribution to mages farming operation that was at risk,it follows mages did not violate the commensurate share rule,or engage in a scheme or device,by failing to disclose the existence of the crop agreement with rodi 
affiliated person of a wetlands violator 
as we have noted,the usda factual findings also seem to indicate the agency found mages had an interest in rodi.as we also noted,such a finding does not support the conclusion mages was not a separate person entitled to apply for farm program payments,nor does it support a conclusion mages violated the commensurate share rule.such an interest could,however,support the conclusion mages was an affiliated person of a wetlands violator under,if mages alleged interest in rodi meets the requirements of.
the usda never actually determined mages was an affiliated person of a wetlands violator.instead,after noting both and rodi status as a wetlands violator,the agency concluded c ompletely revealing the appellant relationship with rodi could result in his ineligibility for usda programs.appellee app.at emphasis supplied.
at the outset,we hold the usda conclusion mages engaged in a scheme or device merely on the grounds his disclosure of an interest in rodi could result in ineligibility is arbitrary and capricious.the usda scheme or device determination depends upon mages having submitted false or erroneous information.if,in fact,mages interest in rodi if any does not meet the requirements of an affiliated person under,then it follows he did not submit false or erroneous information by not revealing the interest and the usda scheme or device determination can not stand.we therefore review the usda findings to determine whether mages actually had an interest in rodi,the disclosure of which would result in his ineligibility for farm program payments.
subsections b and c of divide affiliated persons of a wetlands violator into two categories depending upon whether the wetlands violator was a person or an entity.in this case,the wetlands violator was rodi,a corporation,and thus mages had to be an affiliated person of a corporation to be considered ineligible for farm program payments.under the regulation,only shareholders holding more than twenty percent of the shares of a corporation are affiliated persons of a wetlands violator.c.the administrative record contains no evidence indicating mages held any shares in rodi.in an abundance of caution,however,we will address the usda factual findings to determine whether they support the implied conclusion rodi was,in essence,an alter ego not only of mages parents,ron and diane,but also of mages himself.
a the crop agreement fact findings 
most of the usda factual findings focus on the crop agreement between rodi and mages,and certain consequences of the crop agreement in mages dealings with third parties.specifically,the usda found 
the crop agreement was not in writing and rodi received no monetary compensation from mages for the crop agreement 
rodi scale tickets were presented to a crop insurance adjuster as tickets for both rodi and mages farming operations,and mages used rodi scale tickets to claim and receive crop insurance indemnities 
rodi contracted mages beans,making rodi liable for delivery of beans produced on mages farms 
rodi paid mages debts with the klein burger company and 
from to,as much as of the monies paid out by rodi went to mages.
appellee app.at.none of these factual findings support the implied conclusions ma
