the question raised by this petition is whether the admissibility of an alien under the special agricultural worker saw program is determined only as of the date of admission for lawful temporary residence under a,or whether it is determined both as of that date and as of the date of adjustment to lawful permanent residence under a.we hold that admissibility is determined as of the date of admission for lawful temporary residence,and is not redetermined as of the date of adjustment to lawful permanent residence.we therefore grant the petition for review.
factual background 
on about november,jaime,a citizen of mexico,was admitted to lawful temporary resident status under the saw provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina,a.it is undisputed that at the time he was granted temporary resident status,satisfied the requirements for admissibility under a.on december,status was automatically adjusted to lawful permanent resident under a.
on march,after his admission as a lawful temporary resident under a,but before his adjustment to lawful permanent resident status under a,pled guilty to possession for sale of a controlled substance in violation of california health and safety code.the court imposed a fine and a suspended sentence of days in county jail.in,the immigration and naturalization service ins sought to remove as an inadmissible alien under a a on the ground that,due to his drug conviction,he was inadmissible at the time his status was adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident.contended that because he had been admitted under the saw program,his admissibility had been determined at the time of his admission as a lawful temporary resident under a.therefore,according to,the ins could not seek removal on the ground that he was inadmissible.
the immigration judge ij ordered removed as an inadmissible alien under a a.the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirmed the ij decision in a streamlined order.
timely petitioned for review in this court.a panel denied the petition,holding that because had been convicted of his crime before his adjustment to lawful permanent resident status under a,he never successfully adjusted to that status.thus,according to the panel,the ins could seek his removal as an inadmissible alien under a a rather than as a lawful permanent resident.gonzales,cir.we have vacated the decision of the panel and taken the case en banc to consider petition anew.gonzales,cir.
because this was a streamlined decision,we review the ij decision as the final agency action.see falcon carriche ashcroft,cir,as amended.we review the legal questions presented de novo.de martinez ashcroft,cir,as amended.we give chevron deference to established constructions by the bia of the statutes it is charged to administer.ins,d citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d ghaly ins,cir.
ii.jurisdiction 
the government has argued that under a c we lack jurisdiction to review the petition because is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in a.this argument was made prior to the enactment of the real id act of,stat.section a a iii of the act amended to add a new subsection.that subsection provides nothing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.a d.we are presented with a reviewable question of law whether admissibility is determined not only as of the date of his admission to lawful temporary status under a,but also as of the date of his adjustment to lawful permanent status under a.the government contended,and the ij concluded,that the statute requires that admissibility be determined as of both dates.if the ij construction of the statute is wrong,is not removable on the ground charged by the government.we have jurisdiction under to review the ij legal conclusion.
iii.discussion 
the saw program was established by congress in as a legalization program for certain alien agricultural workers.under a,the attorney general shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if the attorney general determines that the individual has applied for such adjustment within eighteen months of november,has resided in the united states and performed agricultural work for at least during the period ending on may,and is otherwise admissible as an immigrant.after a statutorily prescribed time period,the attorney general then shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.id.a.
under a a,the attorney general may terminate an individual temporary resident status at any time prior to adjustment of status to a lawful permanent resident.under a b,the attorney general may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary resident status under a if,inter alia,the alien is convicted of a felony committed in the united states.however,if the attorney general does not act affirmatively to terminate an alien temporary resident status under a,that status is automatically adjusted to permanent resident under a after the passage of the requisite time period.
the government,however,contends that a a dictates a different timetable for determining admissibility than just described.section a a provides 
inadmissible aliens 
any alien who at the time of entry or adjustment of status was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time is deportable.
emphasis added.the government contends that the admissibility of all aliens already admitted to lawful temporary resident status under the saw program under a is determined,for purposes of any adjustment of status,as of the date of that adjustment.by the government logic,conviction rendered him inadmissible at the time of his adjustment from temporary to permanent legal resident status.therefore,according to the government,is removable as an inadmissible alien under a a.
the legal question is narrow,but the consequence is important.if the admissibility of an alien admitted under the saw program is determined at the time of his initial adjustment of status to lawful temporary resident under a,and if the alien status is thereafter automatically adjusted to lawful permanent resident without further inquiry into admissibility,the government may institute removal proceedings against the alien.but the government must do so on the premise that the alien is a lawful permanent resident alien rather than that the alien is inadmissible.
lawful permanent resident aliens have important protections in removal proceedings that are not provided to inadmissible aliens.for example,depending on the circumstances,a lawful permanent resident alien is entitled to seek relief under section c of the ina,c repealed,and ins cyr,d,or to seek cancellation of removal under a.in case,the relevant protection is that provided by section c and cyr because he pled guilty to his drug offense in,prior to the adoption of three statutes limiting the availability of relief under section c.see cyr,at.
the bia has authoritatively construed the statute in the manner urged by.in matter of,wl bia,had been admitted to lawful temporary resident status under the saw program.sought to return to the united states from mexico,but was excluded from reentry because marijuana was found in his car at the border.in discussing his excludability under,the bia carefully described the operation of the saw program and a 
s ection a of the act a adjusts the status of an alien granted lawful temporary status under section a a to that of a lawful permanent resident on the basis of a fixed schedule,without regard for the alien admissibility at that time.this mechanism is perhaps unique under the immigration laws,since an alien admitted for temporary residence under section a may apparently adjust his or her status to that of a lawful permanent resident even if physically outside of the united states 
it is true that section a b of the act,a b supp.iv,permits the attorney general to deny a lawful temporary resident adjustment of status under section a and terminate temporary resident status upon,inter alia,the alien commission of an act that renders him or her inadmissible under section a of the act.however,the language of this provision is permissive in nature only it does not mandate an examination of a lawful temporary resident admissibility before adjustment to permanent status,such as is the case with respect to adjustment under section.
t he record reflects that the service clearly could have proceeded to deny the applicant adjustment of status under section a of the act and to terminate his lawful temporary resident status,but did not.we do not find this omission,however,to constitute a new determination of the applicant admissibility to the united states,as the service was not obliged to make such a finding before the automatic adjustment of the applicant status took place on december.
id.at internal citation omitted.the bia held that was excludable from the united states because of his attempt to smuggle marijuana into the united states,but that he was excludable only as a lawful permanent resident alien,not as a temporary resident.the bia was explicit on this point the necessary conclusion is that these exclusion proceedings are still proper despite the applicant adjustment of his status to that of lawful permanent resident under section a of the act a.id.at emphasis added.
we conclude that the bia opinion in,published in,is alone dispositive of this case as a clear,authoritative explication of the operation of a.we give chevron deference to published decisions of the bia interpreting the immigration statutes it is charged to administer.as stated by the supreme court in ins,d 
the attorney general,while retaining ultimate authority,has vested the bia with power to exercise the discretionary power and authority conferred upon the attorney general by law in the course of considering and determining cases before it.d.based on this allocation of authority,we recognized in,d,that the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.
despite this statement in,the dissent contends that we should not give chevron deference to.it gives three reasons.first,the dissent states that the applicable immigration statutes have changed considerably since.diss.op.at.in a broad sense it is,of course,true that the immigration statutes have changed considerably since.but the narrower issue relevant to this case is whether any of the applicable statutes has changed.the dissent fails to identify any statutory provision applicable to this case that has changed since.
second,the dissent states that the attorney general of the united states does not share the panel reading of.it seems anomalous to give deference to an agency determination that is contrary to the position taken by the head of the agency.this statement disregards that the attorney general has vested his discretionary interpretive authority to the bia,see d,at,and that the bia has already interpreted the statutory provisions at issue.the position of the government in this case is a litigating position taken in opposition to a published decision of the agency charged with administering the statute.see bowen georgetown university hospital,d we have never applied the principle of chevron and other cases to agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,rulings,or administrative practice.smiley citibank south dakota,d of course we deny deference to agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,rulings,or administrative practice.citing bowen.
third,the dissent states that if there is more than one possible construction of,then neither this court nor the bia is bound under chevron to the majority interpretation of.conceding arguendo the dissent premise that there is more than one possible construction of,the dissent conclusion does not follow from its premise.whenever a statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation,chevron deference is owed to an interpretation provided by the agency charged with administering the statute.in this case,that agency is the bia.contrary to the dissent statement,the bia is not bound under chevron to follow any particular interpretation of an ambiguous provision of our immigration statutes.rather,it is this court that is bound under chevron.also contrary to the dissent statement,we are not providing an interpretation of in this case.rather,we are following the interpretation of provided by the bia in,as required by chevron.
we note for good measure that prior to the panel decision in this case,the bia consistently followed in an unbroken string of unpublished opinions.such unpublished decisions are not entitled to chevron deference,see skidmore swift,but they serve to underline the correctness of our reading of the bia decision in.
for example,in re,wl bia,is factually indistinguishable from this case.like,was an agricultural worker admitted under the saw program.also like,he was convicted of a drug offense between the time of his admission to temporary resident status and his adjustment to permanent resident status.citing,the bia held that had successfully adjusted to permanent resident status despite the drug conviction.it wrote 
r espondent became a lawful temporary resident of the united states on june,as a special agricultural worker saw pursuant to section of the act the respondent drug conviction was entered august,after she had already filed her saw application.on december,her status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident pursuant to section of the act.
the rules and procedures for adjustment to permanent status under section a of the act a differ from those relating to adjustment of status under section of the act.whereas adjustment pursuant to section of the act requires that an alien be admissible to the united states at the time of his adjustment to lawful permanent residence,adjustment pursuant to section a of the act has no such requirement.instead,pursuant to section a c of the act,an alien admissibility to the united states is determined as of the time of his adjustment to that of lawful temporary resident.after the alien has been granted lawful temporary resident status under section a of the act,section a mandates that his status be adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident based on a fixed schedule and without further reference to his admissibility see matter of juarez,i n,wl bia see also matter of,i n,bia.
id.internal citations and footnotes omitted.the bia therefore disagree d with the dhs that was inadmissible to the united states when she adjusted her status to lawful permanent resident,and ineligible for section c consideration.id.
to the same effect are in re,wl bia june,p ursuant to section a c of the act,an alien admissibility to the united states is determined as of the time of his adjustment to that of lawful temporary resident after the alien has been granted lawful temporary resident status under section a of the act,section a mandates that his status be adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident alien based on a fixed schedule and without further reference to his admissibility.see matter of.in re acuna martinez,wl bia,u nlike section of the act,which requires both a discretionary determination and consideration of statutory requirements such as the alien continuing admissibility,provisions set forth at section do not mandate an examination of a lawful temporary resident admissibility,but rather provide for an automatic adjustment after years of status as a temporary resident.see matter of.and in re,wl bia,after the alien has been granted lawful temporary resident status under section a of the act,section a mandates that his status be adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident based on a fixed schedule and without further reference to his admissibility.see matter of.
iv.no remand under ins ventura 
the government contends that the bia unpublished decisions just described did not answer the question now before a requires that the admissibility of saw workers must be determined at the time of readjustment of status to permanent resident alien under a.it argues that therefore,at a minimum,we should remand this case to the bia under ins ventura,d,for an answer to that question.for two reasons,we disagree with the government contention that a ventura remand is required.
first,contrary to the government contention,the bia unpublished decisions did answer the question now before us.for example,is,as noted above,factually indistinguishable from this case.the bia concluded that had successfully adjusted her status and was therefore eligible for relief under section c.the necessary premise underlying that conclusion is that,and saw aliens in her position,were not inadmissible at the time of their adjustment to permanent resident status under a.the bia conclusion thus addressed precisely the question now before us,for the key phrase in a a is i nadmissible at the time of adjustment of status.
second,until the panel decision in this case,the bia consistently followed the construction of a articulated in and reflected in the unpublished decisions described above.as a result of the panel decision in the case now before us,the bia felt compelled to change its construction.in,the bia initially decided in re,wl bia,in accordance with.in the course of its unpublished decision,the bia wrote what had,by,become a virtual boilerplate 
the rules and procedures for adjustment to permanent status under section a of the act a differ from those relating to adjustment of status under section of the act.whereas adjustment pursuant to section of the act requires that an alien be admissible to the united states at the time of his adjustment to lawful permanent residence,adjustment pursuant to section a of the act has no such requirement.instead,pursuant to section a c of the act,an alien admissibility to the united states is determined as of the time of his adjustment to that of lawful temporary resident after the alien has been granted lawful temporary resident status under section a of the act,section a mandates that his status be adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident based on a fixed schedule and without further reference to his admissibility.see matter of,i n,bia.
after the decision of the panel in this case,the government moved to reopen in.in an unpublished decision granting the motion,the bia wrote 
initially,we note that in our august,decision,we determined that pursuant to section a c of the act,an alien admissibility is determined at the time of adjustment to lawful temporary status and is not revisited as subsequent adjustment to lawful permanent status is based upon a fixed schedule without further reference to admissibility.however,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit has recently held that adjustment of status occurs on the date of the automatic adjustment to lawful permanent status under the saw program,rather than on the earlier date when the alien received lawful temporary status.see perez enriquez ashcroft,cir.accordingly,the dhs motion is granted.
in re,wl bia.
in its second decision in,the bia gave no other reason than the decision of the panel for reversing its long and consistent line of decisions based on.we have no doubt that,left to its own devices,the bia would have continued to adhere to its decision in and later cases,for the bia made clear that its second decision in was compelled by the decision of the panel of this court.we now hold,on en banc consideration,that this decision of the panel was incorrect.in this circumstance,we have no reason to remand this case to the bia under ventura.
conclusion 
based on the text of a,the bia decision in construing that text,and the bia consistent application of in later decisions,we hold that admissibility for an agricultural worker under the saw program is determined as of the date of adjustment of status to lawful temporary resident under a.admissibility is not redetermined as of the date of automatic adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident under a.we therefore grant petition for review,vacate the order of removal,and remand to the bia for appropriate further proceedings.
petition granted remanded.
i,too,agree with most of the majority opinion.however,i also agree with judges bybee and silverman that a remand under ins ventura,d,is in order.although the bia ruling in matter of,bia,implicitly controls this decision,the agency must be given an opportunity to make an explicit holding that the relevant admissibility date for a special agricultural worker saw applicant is the date of admission as a lawful temporary resident.i am persuaded that this is the correct reading of the saw provisions.as the bia stated in,adjustment of status under the saw provisions involves a different procedure whereby the applicant status is adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident on the basis of a fixed schedule,without regard for the alien admissibility at that time.id.at.
i agree with much of the majority opinion.i write separately because i believe that the majority has overstepped the bounds of ins ventura,d.the majority finds that bia has previously construed a to mean that admissibility is determined only as of the date of admission to lawful temporary status.see matter of,wl bia.it agrees with bia and affords these decisions chevron deference.op.at.it then contrasts bia prior position with its position in this case,which bia evidently felt compelled to take because of the panel original decision.finding bia position in this case inconsistent with its prior position,the majority concludes that bia decision in this case must be erroneous and vacates the order of removal.
i am with the majority until that final step.i am not so confident that we can reach that conclusion for bia,even though we may have invited the error.an agency has a duty of consistent dealing.it also has the duty,in the first instance,to construe the statutes it enforces.having determined that bia has treated in a manner inconsistent with bia prior rulings,i would grant the petition and remand to bia for an explanation.it seems to me that bia has three options.first,it can determine that its ruling in case is,indeed,inconsistent with its prior rulings and can grant him the same relief.based on bia observations in in re,wl bia,on the panel opinion in this case,see op.at,i would be surprised if bia did not acknowledge that it made a mistake in case and correct it.second,bia can explain why situation is factually different from matter of and the cases following it.or,third,bia can explain that it has changed its view on how section a should be construed.
it is the possibility that bia will pursue this last option that raises the greatest concerns.the supreme court has rejected the argument that an agency interpretation is not entitled to deference because it represents a sharp break with prior interpretations of the statute in question.rust sullivan,d quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.an initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone,because the agency must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on continuing basis.chevron,at.thus,t he bia is not estopped from changing a view it believes to have been grounded upon a mistaken legal interpretation.good samaritan hosp.shalala,d.i do not read the majority decision to conclude that there is only one possible construction of section,so that any other construction would be unreasonable as a matter of law.see gonzales,cir concluding that bia departed from its prior practice and that its interpretation is unreasonable,and we need not defer to it.were bia to change its view,we might afford its new position something less than full chevron deference,see good samaritan,at.ins,d,but i do see that we can preclude bia from offering a reasonable rationale supporting its departure from prior practice.seldovia native ass lujan,cir.
because i do think that we can prejudge how bia should treat this case,i respectfully dissent as to part iv of the opinion.generally
