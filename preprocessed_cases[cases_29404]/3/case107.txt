the plaintiffs in this case are dairy farmers who annually produce over million pounds of milk.they challenge the regulations promulgated by the defendant secretary of agriculture to implement the federal milk income loss contract program.when a producer signs a contract to join the program,it begins receiving monthly payments on the eligible milk it produces and,under the statute transition rule,a payment for eligible milk it produced between december,and the month before the contract was signed.the statute includes a limitation restricting the quantity of milk upon which payment can be made each fiscal year to million pounds.the department of agriculture regulations under attack here apply the limitation to payments under the transition rule as well as to the monthly payments.the district court found that the statute did not unambiguously forbid the secretary interpretation of the statute and,moreover,that the secretary interpretation was reasonable.the court therefore denied the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief and granted the secretary motion to dismiss.
for the reasons set out below,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on may,president bush signed into law the farm security and rural investment act of,stat,which,in,created an income support program for dairy farmers that provides for direct federal payments to milk producers when a specific price index falls below a certain level.see id.at,codified at.in order to receive payments through the program,dairy farmers must enter into a contract with the secretary of agriculture.once a dairy farmer has entered into a contract,the farmer is eligible for two categories of payments monthly payments on eligible production beginning the month the farmer enters into the contract and ending september,see g and a retroactive,payment for production during the transition period between december and the month in which the farmer enters the contract.see h.the statute does not specify a month in which dairy farmers must enter contracts,just that the secretary must offer such contracts from july until september.see f.
section reads,in pertinent part 
b payments.the secretary shall offer to enter into contracts with producers on a dairy farm located in a participating state under which the producers receive payments on eligible production.
d payment quantity.
in general.subject to paragraph,the payment quantity for a producer during the applicable month under this section shall be equal to the quantity of eligible production marketed by the producer during the month.
limitation.the payment quantity for all producers on a single dairy operation during the months of the applicable fiscal year for which the producers receive payments under subsection b shall not exceed pounds 
f signup.the secretary shall offer to enter into contracts under this section during the period beginning on the date that is days after the date of enactment of this act may,and ending on september.
h transition rule.in addition to any payment that is otherwise available under this section,if the producers on a dairy farm enter into a contract under this section,the secretary shall make a payment in accordance with the formula specified in subsection c on the quantity of eligible production of the producer marketed during the period beginning on december,and ending on the last day of the month preceding the month the producers on the dairy farm entered into the contract.
in october,the secretary of agriculture issued regulations implementing the dairy assistance program.under the regulations,the cap in d limiting payment quantity to million pounds of milk per year was made applicable to transition period payments under h,as well as to the monthly payments for milk produced after a contract has been signed.see b.in response,the plaintiffs filed this action,seeking a declaratory judgement that dairy producers who are entitled to payments during the transition period are entitled to a payment on all the milk produced and marketed during the transition period,not just million pounds a year.they requested an injunction compelling the secretary to modify the regulations at to allow dairy producers uncapped transition payments.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for injunctive relief and granted the secretary motion to dismiss the case with respect to the cap on transition payments,the court found that does not unambiguously forbid the regulations from making transition payments subject to the cap and that the secretary regulation was permissible and reasonable.applying chevron deference,the court upheld the secretary determination that the cap applies to transition payments as well as prospective payments under the contract.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
the parties agree that chevron,d,governs this case under chevron,in reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,we must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if,after employing traditional tools of statutory construction,id.at,we determine that congress intent is clear,then that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.see also barnhart thomas,d applying chevron.
ii.the application of the cap to transition payments 
both the plaintiffs and the defendant in this case argue that congress spoke directly to the issue of whether the payment cap in d applies to transition payments.obviously,however,they do not agree on what congress said.the plaintiffs argue that congress clearly intended that the cap not apply to transition payments and that the secretary regulations therefore violate the statute.the secretary,on the other hand,contends that congress clearly intended that all payments under would be limited by the cap and that the department regulations are consistent with the statute.both parties argue that the plain language of the statute,legislative history,and the structure and purpose of the statute support their positions.
statutory language 
in statutory construction cases,t he first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.barnhart sigmon coal,d citation omitted.the plaintiffs argue that the plain language of unambiguously requires the secretary to make transition payments without limitation.they point out that subsection h requires payment on eligible production and note that congress did not limit the definition of eligible production in either subsection a or h.they argue that if congress had intended the cap to apply to transitional payments,it could have written the statute to say so in subsection h itself.as the secretary points out,however,subsection h provides that payments shall be made according to the formula in subsection c which incorporates the payment quantity in subsection d,the subsection that includes the payment cap.thus,according to this reading of the statute,the fact that subsection h itself does not include a limitation on quantity is not determinative because the payment formula for which it provides incorporates the payment cap in subsection d.
by its terms,however,the payment cap in subsection d applies only to payments under subsection b.thus,the central question in this case is whether transition payments are payments under subsection b,the section of the statute that orders the secretary to offer to enter into contracts with dairy farmers under which the farmers will receive payment for eligible milk production.the plaintiffs assert that transition payments are not payments under subsection b.they maintain that creates two similar but distinct programs that cover farmers during different,described in subsection e,that covers farmers during the period after they sign contracts and another,described in subsection h,that covers farmers f
