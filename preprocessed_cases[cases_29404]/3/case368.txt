hein and ellen hettinga,owners of sarah farms,and with their son gerben of gh dairy,appeal the dismissal of their complaint challenging the constitutionality of two amendments to the agricultural marketing agreement act amaa.the hettingas alleged that the amendments,which subjected certain large of milk to contribution requirements applicable to milk handlers,were invalid as a bill of attainder and a violation of equal protection and due process.the question on appeal is whether the hettingas were required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit against the united states.we hold that exhaustion was neither jurisdictionally nor prudentially required.the plain text of the exhaustion requirement in the amaa does not apply to constitutional challenges to the amaa itself,as distinct from challenges to regulatory orders and attendant obligations.because the hettingas objections do not involve an alleged defect in a marketing order and the secretary lacks the power to provide a remedy,requiring exhaustion as a prudential matter would not protect administrative agency authority or advance judicial efficiency.accordingly,we reverse.
the milk business is highly regulated by the secretary of agriculture pursuant to the amaa.see edaleen dairy,llc johanns.the secretary issues milk marketing orders that regulate payments made from milk handlers processors and distributors to milk producers farmers.id.in order to protect producers from variations in prices,handlers are required to pay into a pool for milk bought from producers the funds in the pool are distributed on a pro rata basis to the producers.block cmty.nutrition,d.

parties have long been required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking relief from federal courts,mccarthy madigan,d,either as a matter of congressional command or to protect the authority of the agency and to promote judicial efficiency,id.at.where congress specifically mandates,exhaustion is required.but where congress has not clearly required exhaustion,sound judicial discretion governs.mccarthy,at.citations omitted.whether a statute is intended to preclude initial judicial review is determined from the statute language,structure,and purpose,its legislative history,and whether the claims can be afforded meaningful review.thunder basin coal reich,d citation omitted.
where exhaustion is required,there still is a separate question whether the requirement is jurisdictional,and thus nonwaivable,or.in avocados plus veneman,this court,in observing that the distinction between jurisdictional and exhaustion is purely a question of statutory interpretation,id.at,set a high bar for determining that a statute requiring exhaustion is jurisdictional in order to mandate exhaustion,a statute must contain s weeping and direct statutory language indicating that there is no federal jurisdiction prior to exhaustion,or the exhaustion requirement is treated as an element of the underlying claim.id.at quoting weinberger salfi,d.this court will presume exhaustion is unless congress states in clear,unequivocal terms that the judiciary is barred from hearing an action until the administrative agency has come to a decision.id.quoting pension fund benefit plan c stockton tri.
prudential exhaustion,in turn,serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency.mccarthy,at.prudential exhaustion is not required where it would occasion undue prejudice to subsequent assertion of a court action,for example through excessive delay an agency may not be empowered to grant relief,for example because it lacks institutional competence to resolve the particular type of issue presented,such as the constitutionality of a statute or because an agency may be competent to adjudicate the issue presented,but still lack authority to grant the type of relief requested or the agency is biased.id.at.
section a of the amaa imposes a mandatory administrative exhaustion requirement on milk handlers seeking to challenge the provisions of a milk marketing order.edaleen dairy,at see block,at.united states ruzicka.there is no similar requirement for producers because the amaa affords them no administrative remedy.see stark wickard.see also ruzicka,at.where a sues in its capacity as a handler,as it does in challenging the secretary order subjecting it to obligations,it must exhaust.edaleen dairy,at.thus,were the hettingas challenging the secretary milk marketing order for the vegas area,they would be required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit challenging those orders.block,at.ruzicka,at.edaleen dairy,at.the hettingas complaint,however,is directed at the amendments to the amaa,not a milk marketing order.the complaint alleges that t he mrea,as adopted,contained provisions that singled out and punished the hettingas,citing subparagraphs m and compl.
the government advances two arguments that the hettingas are nonetheless challenging a milk marketing order rather than the mrea,but neither is persuasive.first,the government maintains that only such orders,and not the mrea,impose affirmative obligations to pay fees.the mrea,in fact,provides that large located in states regulated by milk marketing orders that sell milk in unregulated states shall be subject to the price and pooling obligations of the marketing orders.m.it further provides that no large in arizona shall be exempt from the relevant milk marketing order.id
