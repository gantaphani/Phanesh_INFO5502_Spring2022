introduction 
this case arises from lazy y ranch attempt to lease grazing lands from the state of idaho.the leases were auctioned by the state and although lazy y was the high bidder,the leases ultimately were awarded to other parties.lazy y filed a complaint under,alleging that various state officials violated the equal protection clause when they rejected its bids.in particular,lazy y alleged that the officials discriminated against lazy y because it has perceived ties to conservationists and is a washington corporation that was attempting to enter the idaho grazing market.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that lazy y failed to state an equal protection claim and,alternatively,that they were entitled to qualified immunity.defendants motion relied on various documents indicating they had articulated a legitimate reason for rejecting lazy y,that leasing to lazy y would involve increased administrative costs because the lands were unfenced and cattle could wander onto adjoining property.the district court struck most of defendants extraneous documents and ultimately denied their motion to dismiss.this interlocutory appeal followed,with defendants relying on the collateral order doctrine as a basis for appellate jurisdiction.
as we explain below,lazy y has properly alleged that defendants violated its rights under the equal protection clause,and also that they violated clearly established law.we therefore affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the complaint and unchallenged extraneous documents 
the following facts come from allegations in lazy y first amended complaint and the few extraneous documents that the district court considered as part of defendants motion to dismiss.
overview of idaho endowment lands 
the lands lazy y tried to lease are known as endowment lands.endowment lands are controlled by the idaho state board of land commissioners,also called the land board.idaho,art.ix.the land board must carefully preserve the endowment lands and manage them in such manner as will secure the maximum financial return to the institution to which the land is granted.id.the land board has designated the lands at issue here to be leased to private entities for the benefit of public schools.
under state law,leases on public school endowment lands may not exceed years subject to exceptions not relevant here.idaho code.at the beginning of every calendar year,the idaho department of lands idl gives public notice of all leases that are expiring on december of that year and offers new leases to qualified members of the public.when the idl receives more than one qualified application for the same lease,the idl shall auction off and lease the land to the applicant who will pay the highest premium bid therefore.id.the idl auction is not necessarily final,however,as the land board has the power to overturn it.see id.
lazy y bids 
in response to an idl notice in early,lazy y applied for leases on nine grazing lands.with one exception,the prior lessees also applied for the new leases,as did some third parties.given the competing applications,defendant tracy behrens,who was then the idl range program manager,notified applicants that auctions would be held and that they should submit management proposals addressing various environmental concerns.lazy y obtained a resource assessment from the idl to ensure that its proposals were consistent with idl concerns,and timely submitted the proposals.the proposals indicated that lazy y would improve environmental conditions on the land.
lazy y alleges that it first experienced unfair treatment on june,when behrens told it that its management proposals did not adequately address idl concerns and would need to be modified.according to lazy y,the idl had routinely leased endowment land to other parties without requiring more specific grazing management proposals than lazy y.lazy y also alleges that the proposals of existing lessees would have led to land damage that idl sought to avoid and that lazy y proposals addressed.behrens singled out lazy y proposals,lazy y says,because the idl and land board believed that lazy y was connected to conservationists who have sought to improve state land management.
after lazy y submitted new proposals,the parties further disputed their adequacy,and behrens at one point suggested that lazy y might not be familiar with the applicable procedures because it was not from idaho.lazy y responded that its president was an idaho resident and that it was fully licensed to do business in idaho.eventually,idl accepted the proposals as complete.
in august,the idl scheduled auctions for five of the leases lazy y was the high bidder for all five.according to lazy y,however,an agent for prior lessees named wally butler orchestrated efforts to deprive lazy y of the leases by appealing the auctions the appeals allegedly were on the verge of being denied by idl staff,but before staff could act,defendant and idl director winston wiggins unilaterally invalidated the auctions.wiggins said he did so a result of an administrative staff had inadvertently failed to circulate lazy y management proposals to competing bidders before the auctions.lazy y alleges that wiggins justification was a pretext,again to cover discrimination based on lazy y perceived connection to conservationists and out of a desire to protect prior lessees from competition 
after a delay of several months,during which the prior lessees continued to use the grazing lands,the land board ultimately approved wiggins decision to void the auctions.in february,the land board scheduled new auctions for the five leases,as well as a sixth for which no auction had previously been conducted because of disputes over improvements on the land.the six auctions were held in june,and lazy y was again the high bidder on each one.lazy y winning bids totaled.
this time,none of the competing bidders appealed the auction results.however,wiggins put the leases on the land board agenda for august.six days before the land board met,behrens recommended that it deny lazy y leases because taking them from the prior lessees would present a significant increase in administrative costs.as stated in an idl staff memo provided on august,the increased costs would result because the lands covered by the leases constitute only a portion of larger grazing allotments that were not divided by fences,and the previous each case the second highest grazing rights on the adjacent land.the memo cited increased costs associated with inspecting the sites to ensure that cattle from adjacent lands would not drift onto the unfenced endowment lands.the memo estimated that lazy y plans would entail increased administrative costs of approximately over the terms of the six leases.this purported increase would dwarf the total by which lazy y bids exceeded the bids of the second highest bidders.
the august,memo was the first time the idl had ever mentioned increased administrative costs associated with new lessees.according to lazy y,this justification was pretextual,and suggested that defendants should never have opened the leases for public bidding since the only parties who could avoid increased management costs were the prior lessees.in attacking the assertion of increased administrative costs,lazy y claims 
defendants failed to establish their prior administrative costs 
defendants failed to establish that additional inspections would really be required 
defendants assertion of increased costs for staff time was belied because they were not planning to hire additional staff 
the vast majority of endowment lands leased for grazing are isolated parcels within larger grazing allotments,so defendants management costs already reflect that fact 
other than in connection with past efforts by conservationists to obtain state grazing leases,defendants have rarely if ever cited similar concerns to deny a state lease 
the idl regularly loses money on endowment lands because its administrative costs outstrip the modest revenues from leases 
the idl rarely undertakes the supervision necessary to ensure that other grazing lessees comply with management requirements for land preservation 
defendants ignored the possibility that the denial of lazy y lease would lead to litigation costs.
lazy y also alleges that the administrative costs rationale appeared after behrens,wiggins,and idl assistant director george bacon spoke with representatives of the local livestock industry in meetings that excluded lazy 
in response to the assertion of administrative costs,lazy y wrote to wiggins on august,offering to provide additional fencing pay for additional administrative costs incurred,up to over the course of the new leases,or such additional amount as may be shown as reasonably necessary.notwithstanding lazy y additional offer,the land board denied lazy y all six leases at its august meeting,and instead awarded them to the second highest bidders.lazy y alleges that the board governor jim risch,secretary of state ben ysursa,superintendent of schools marilyn howard,attorney general lawrence wasden,and state controller keith dismissed its offer to cover increased costs,thus evidencing their discriminatory treatment of lazy 
lazy y filed its complaint on august,and quickly amended it to include similar allegations concerning denial of a seventh lease in september.the first amended complaint seeks damages and injunctive relief.
defendants motion to dismiss and challenged extraneous documents 
defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint under rule b,arguing that lazy y failed to state an equal protection claim and that they enjoyed qualified immunity from the claims for damages.in support of the motion,defendants submitted the june memo from behrens to lazy y,which included various idl documents related to grazing plan requirements.defendants also submitted ten other exhibits minutes and transcripts of the february,august,and september land board meetings six total documents idl memoranda submitted at each of the three meetings three total documents and an august,letter from lazy y to wiggins.
magistrate judge williams,acting as the district court with the consent of the parties,considered the june memo from behrens to lazy y,the august idl memorandum,and the august letter from lazy y to wiggins.the relevant portions of these documents are referenced above.
on motion by lazy y,the district court struck defendants other exhibits.the exhibits related to the february meeting indicate that wiggins told the land board that the idl failure to circulate lazy y proposals was an administrative error.they also reflected board members accepting wiggins explanation and agreeing that new auctions were a fair solution.
the stricken august meeting transcripts reflect defendant bacon,then the idl assistant director,telling the land board that the lands at issue lacked internal fences and would be difficult to graze as separate units.bacon also told the land board that the second highest bidders leased or owned the adjacent that ostensibly avoided the need for fencing.superintendent howard said she believed that lazy y offer of compensation to cover increased administrative costs should not be considered because it was beyond the expectations at the time of auction.controller johnson said he agreed and questioned whether even would cover the costs of fencing off the grazing lands.governor risch said he agreed with johnson.the board voted unanimously to deny the leases.
to the same effect are the stricken materials concerning the september land board meeting,where the board awarded the seventh lease to the second highest bidder.the idl recommended rejecting lazy y bid because of increased administrative costs,which it represented were approximately over ten years.after counsel for lazy y offered to reimburse idl up to or provide appropriate fencing,the board expressed concern that this would be inadequate,and voted unanimously to grant the leases to the second highest bidders.
although the district court struck most of defendants exhibits,it ruled that even considering all of them,defendants motion to dismiss lacked merit.the motion was therefore denied.defendants timely appealed.
iii.jurisdiction 
we begin by briefly addressing lazy y suggestion that we lack appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.lazy y argues that defendants attacks on the order denying the motion to dismiss exceed the scope of the collateral order doctrine upon which they allege jurisdiction,and the order granting lazy y motion to strike documents is unappealable under any doctrine.we disagree.
in general,a party is entitled only to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered.see digital equip.desktop direct,d.however,under the collateral order doctrine,a litigant may appeal from a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,but must,in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system,nonetheless be treated as final.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine,a district court decision must be conclusive,resolve important questions completely separate from the merits,and render such important questions effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment in the underlying action.id.
because qualified immunity is immunity from suit itself and not merely a defense to liability,orders denying qualified immunity may be immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine,including orders denying a motion to dismiss.see mitchell forsyth,d.such an order is reviewable to the extent that it raises an issue of law.see id.at.batzel smith,cir.
here,contrary to lazy y suggestion,we do not construe defendants appeal to depend on their version of the facts.rather,defendants argue that lazy y allegations of pretext and animus are irrelevant under equal protection law,because they have articulated legitimate reasons for rejecting lazy y bids.in other words,defendants argue that their articulated purposes end the inquiry and mean that lazy y claims of actual improper motives fail to establish an equal protection violation.they also argue that lazy y brings class of one claims that are either incognizable or not clearly established in the context of public contracting.these are contentions of law.see armendariz penman,cir en banc.
moreover,whether defendants exhibits should have been considered is essentially a legal question,and the order granting the motion to strike was simply part of the rule b analysis,as the district court resolved that motion solely to establish the record for the motion to dismiss.see branch tunnell,cir discussing when extraneous documents could be considered on a motion to dismiss,overruled on other grounds by galbraith county of santa clara,cir.we see no reason to treat the order striking documents as separate from the order denying the motion to dismiss.we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review both orders.
iv.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.jensen city of oxnard,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the plaintiff must allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d see.b.in general,the inquiry is limited to the allegations in the complaint,which are accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.sprewell golden state warriors,cir.however,we need not accept as true allegations contradicting documents that are referenced in the complaint or that are properly subject to judicial notice.see outdoor media group,city of beaumont,cir.
a.the motion to strike 
defendants contend the district court abused its discretion in striking their exhibits because the exhibits were either referenced in the complaint,or judicially noticeable.defendants appear correct,see united states ritchie,cir branch,at,particularly because they do not offer the extraneous documents for their truth,but to show their articulated rationales for denying lazy y the leases.however,we need not decide the issue because we conclude,as the district court did,that defendants motion to dismiss lacks merit even if each extraneous document
