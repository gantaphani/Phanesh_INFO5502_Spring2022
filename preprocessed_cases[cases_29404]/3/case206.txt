perishable agricultural commodities act 
the panel affirmed the district court summary judgment in favor of the defendant in an action brought by produce growers under the perishable agricultural commodities act.
the growers sold their perishable agricultural products on credit to a distributor,which made the distributor a trustee over a paca trust holding the perishable products and any resulting proceeds for the growers as beneficiaries.the distributor sold the products on credit to third parties and,through a transaction described as a factoring agreement,transferred its own resulting accounts receivable to defendant agricap financial.the distributor business later failed,and the growers did not receive payment in full from the distributor for their produce.the growers sued agricap.
the panel affirmed the district court holding that,pursuant to boulder fruit express heger organic farm sales transp.factoring,cir,a commercially reasonable factoring agreement removes accounts receivable from the paca trust without a trustee breach of trust,thus defeating the growers claims.the growers argued that a paca trustee true sale of trust assets,which does not breach trust duties,occurs when the trustee transfers not merely the right to collect the underlying accounts,but also the risk of on those accounts.the panel concluded that boulder fruit implicitly rejected the test,and this implicit rejection was necessary to its holding.accordingly,boulder fruit controlled the outcome of the growers case.
concurring,judge melloy,joined by judge gould,wrote that boulder fruit was wrongly decided and that the ninth circuit,sitting en banc,should eliminate a circuit split,speak expressly to this issue,and join the second,fourth,and fifth circuits by adopting a separate,threshold,test.
per curiam 
appellants are produce growers growers who sold their perishable agricultural products on credit to a distributor,tanimura distributing,tanimura.pursuant to the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,this arrangement made tanimura a trustee over a paca trust holding the perishable products and any resulting proceeds for the growers as beneficiaries.tanimura then sold the products on credit to third parties and transferred its own resulting accounts receivable to appellee agricap financial agricap through a transaction agricap describes as a factoring agreement or sale of accounts although described as a sale of accounts,agricap initially referred to the arrangement as a credit facility,and the written agreement was entitled agricap financial corporation factoring and security agreement.further,the factoring agreement involved many hallmarks of a secured lending arrangement,including security interests in accounts and all other asset classes except inventory ucc financing statements subordination of other debts and substantial recourse for agricap against tanimura in the event agricap was unable to collect from tanimura customers for example,agricap was entitled to force tanimura to repurchase accounts that remained unpaid after days,and agricap could enforce this right by withholding payments from tanimura.
tanimura business later failed,and growers did not receive payment in full from tanimura for their produce.growers sued agricap alleging the factoring agreement was merely a secured lending arrangement structured to look like a sale but transferring no substantial risk of nonpayment on the accounts the accounts receivable and proceeds remained trust property under paca because the accounts receivable remained trust property,tanimura breached the paca trust and agricap was complicit in the breach and beneficiaries such as growers held an interest superior to agricap,and agricap was liable to growers.
agricap moved for summary judgment arguing that,pursuant to boulder fruit express heger organic farm sales transportation factoring,cir,a commercially reasonable factoring agreement removes accounts receivable from the paca trust without a trustee breach of trust,thus defeating the growers claims.growers acknowledged that a paca trustee generally may sell trust assets on commercially reasonable terms without breaching trust duties.growers argued,however,that pursuant to nickey gregory,llc agricap,llc,cir,reaves brokerage,sunbelt fruit vegetable,cir,and endico potatoes,cit,cir,a court should not review the commercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement unless the court first determines a true sale actually occurred according to growers,a true sale occurs when a paca trustee transfers not merely the right to collect the underlying accounts,but also the risk of nonpayment on those accounts 
relying on boulder fruit and describing the cited cases as a circuit split,the district court granted summary judgment.the district court noted the ninth circuit in boulder fruit expressly addressed the commercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement but implicitly rejected a separate,test.further,the court noted the factoring agreement in boulder fruit transferred even less risk than the factoring agreement in the present case in boulder fruit,the factoring agent enjoyed unrestricted discretion to force the distributor to repurchase accounts.the court therefore held that,even if boulder fruit could accommodate the test,the facts of boulder fruit controlled and precluded relief for growers.finally,the court concluded that the factoring agreement was commercially reasonable because agricap paid to tanimura of the face value of the accounts as an payment and ultimately paid to tanimura an even greater percentage of the face value of the transferred accounts.
on appeal,growers argue that we are not bound by boulder fruit because the absence of discussion of the test in boulder fruit leaves open the question of whether that test should apply in the ninth circuit.agricap counters that boulder fruit settled the issue because the beneficiaries in boulder fruit asked the court to apply the test the parties in that case briefed the issue the issue was squarely before the court yet,the court did not apply the test.
applying de novo review,arizona tohono nation,cir,we agree with the district court conclusion that boulder fruit controls the outcome in the present case.see united states lucas,cir.noting that subsequent panels are bound by prior panel decisions and only the en banc court may overrule panel precedent.in some cases,an earlier panel election not to discuss an argument may prevent future panels from concluding the earlier panel implicitly accepted or rejected an argument.after all,under the doctrine of stare decisis a case is important only for what it decides for the what,not for the why,and not for the how.in re osborne,cir.t he doctrine of stare decisis concerns the holdings of previous cases,not the rationales.in boulder fruit,however,implicit rejection of the test was necessary to the holding.we reach this conclusion because the factoring agreement in boulder fruit involved virtually no transfer of risk from the distributor to the factoring agent had the boulder fruit court not implicitly rejected the test,the holding of the case necessarily would have been different.
further,because the factoring agreement in the present case transferred a small degree of risk of,at least when compared to the agreement at issue in boulder fruit,we agree that boulder fruit would preclude relief to the growers even if it were possible for our panel to adopt the test.
finally,growers do not seriously contend on appeal that the factoring agreement was otherwise commercially unreasonable.the factoring agreement in the present case is,in many material respects,similar to the agreement in boulder fruit.and,agricap paid to tanimura under the current factoring agreement well in excess of what the ninth circuit previously described as a reasonable factoring rate.boulder fruit,at in any case,a factoring discount of was never shown to be commercially unreasonable.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
we concur.we write further,however,because we believe boulder fruit was wrongly decided and the ninth circuit,sitting en banc,should eliminate this circuit split,speak expressly to this issue,and join the second,fourth,and fifth circuits by adopting a separate,threshold,test.
congress intended paca to prevent secured lenders from defeating the rights of beneficiaries.the congressional focus upon the relative rights of these two groups is unmistakable.as such,before assessing the commercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement,it is first necessary to examine the substance of a factoring agreement to ensure a true sale has occurred.in the absence of a true sale,superficial indicators and labels surrounding a factoring agreement should be of no consequence.the substance of the transaction matters.if the substance of a transaction reveals a secured lending arrangement rather than a true sale,the accounts receivable remain trust assets.thus,unpaid trust beneficiaries hold an interest in accounts receivable and their proceeds superior to all unsecured and secured creditors such that the trust beneficiaries should prevail.
this conclusion enjoys further support in the simple fact that any attempt to assess the commercial reasonableness of a factoring agreement without carefully examining the substance of the rights transferred is an incomplete and abstract exercise.whether a factoring discount of,or more is reasonable in any given situation can not be determined without first assessing what the factoring agent has contracted to do and what risk the factoring agent has accepted.analyzing a factoring discount by looking exclusively at an initial payment without considering the availability of recourse and without assessing the nature of the rights and risks actually transferred from the distributor to the factoring agent examines only part of the transaction.such an exercise is not grounded in reality and is akin to declaring a price to be reasonable without first identifying the product or service that carried that price.
we address below the structure and purpose of paca,the circuit split regarding the test,and the application of that test to this case.
i.the paca trust 
congress enacted paca in to prevent unfair business practices and promote financial responsibility in the fresh fruit and produce industry.boulder fruit,at.congress amended paca in to remedy the burden on commerce in perishable agricultural commodities and to protect the public interest caused by accounts receivable financing arrangements that encumber or give lenders a security interest in the perishable agricultural commodities superior to the growers.id.alteration in original quoting c.paca attempts to remedy this burden through the creation of a statutory trust 
perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission merchant,dealer,or broker in all transactions,and all inventories of food or other products derived from perishable agricultural commodities,and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities or products,shall be held by such commission merchant,dealer,or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the transaction,until full payment of the sums owing in connection with such transactions has been received by such unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents.
c.this provision imposes a nonsegregated floating trust on the commodities and their derivatives,and permits the commingling of trust assets without defeating the trust.endico potatoes,at citation omitted.
g eneral trust principles apply to questions involving the paca trust,unless those principles directly conflict with paca.boulder fruit,at.and,because o rdinary principles of trust law apply to trusts created under paca,the trust assets are excluded from the estate should the dealer,the paca trustee go bankrupt.sunkist growers,fisher,cir.
under general trust principles,a breach of trust occurs when there is a violation by the trustee of any duty which as trustee he owes to the beneficiary.boulder fruit,at quoting restatement second of trusts.federal regulations set forth a paca trustee primary duties,requiring the trustee to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities.id.quoting d.the duty to maintain trust assets is broad,such that a ny act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility,including dissipation of trust assets,is unlawful and in violation of paca.id.second alteration in original quoting d.
because the floating trust under paca permits the commingling of trust assets and permits the paca trustee to convert trust assets into proceeds,the transferees of trust assets,such as agricap here,are liable only if they had some role in causing a breach or dissipation of the trust.boulder fruit,at see also restatement second of trusts if the trustee transfers trust property to a third person without commit ting a breach of trust,the third person holds the interest so transferred or created free of the trust,and is under no liability to the beneficiary.
against this backdrop,the current parties and all circuit courts addressing the issue agree that a paca trustee true sale of accounts receivable for a commercially reasonable discount from the accounts face value is not a dissipation of trust assets and,therefore,is not a breach of the paca trustee duties.see nickey gregory,at the assets of the trust would thus have been converted into cash and the receivables would no longer have been trust assets.obviously,under this scenario,the factoring agent would own the accounts receivable and would be able to do with them what it wished.reaves brokerage,at boulder fruit,at endico potatoes,at.such a sale is merely a conversion of trust assets from accounts receivable into cash.these circuits also agree that any purported security interest for a lender in assets is inferior to the trust beneficiaries claims and rights.see,nickey gregory,at thus,if the accounts receivable were held as collateral to secure repayment of a loan,they would also have been held for the benefit of produce sellers,and the produce sellers would have effectively enjoyed a position in them.endico potatoes,at because the factoring agent held only a security interest its interest is subject to the rights of the paca trust beneficiaries.the factoring agent must disgorge amounts collected on the accounts after the distributor bankruptcy filing to the extent necessary to satisfy claims of paca trust beneficiaries.in fact,in boulder fruit,notwithstanding the absence of discussion of a or test,the ninth circuit provided an illustration making clear that use of assets as collateral to secure a debt could not create a priority security interest for a lender greater than the position enjoyed by paca trust beneficiaries 
farmer sells oranges on credit to broker.broker turns around and sells the oranges on credit to supermarket,generating an account receivable from supermarket.broker then obtains a loan from bank and grants bank a security interest in the account receivable to secure the loan.broker goes bankrupt.under paca,broker is required to hold the receivable in trust for farmer until farmer was paid in full use of the receivable as collateral was a breach of the trust.therefore,farmer rights in the supermarket receivable are superior to bank.in fact,as a trust asset,the supermarket receivable is not even part of the bankruptcy estate.

ii.test for identifying true sales 
the treatment of true sales and security interests,therefore,is clear.what remains unclear is the analysis to apply when the true nature of the transaction is ambiguous.how should a court treat a transaction if the parties to a factoring agreement label the transaction a sale of accounts but provide substantial recourse for the factoring agent,such as requiring the distributor to repurchase accounts or permitting the factoring agent to withhold payments or otherwise recoup payments already made to the distributor what if,such labels notwithstanding,the recourse and security provided include a security interest in the accounts receivable has a true sale actually occurred 
growers and the second,fourth,and fifth circuits apply a threshold test to determine if such a transaction is a true sale or a mere secured lending relationship.agricap,relying on boulder fruit,argues the court need only ask if the transaction was commercially reasonable.
in boulder fruit,the ninth circuit held factoring agreements do not per se breach the paca trust because,consistent with general trust principles,a trustee can sell trust assets unless the sale breaches the trust.at.the court concluded a commercially reasonable sale of accounts for fair value is entirely consistent with the trustee primary duty under paca and d to maintain trust assets so that they are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable commodities.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court indicated that whether a factoring agreement is commercially reasonable depends upon the terms of the agreement.for example,a paca trustee who sells accounts for pennies on the dollar,just to turn a quick buck,might well have breached the paca trust,while a trustee who factors accounts at a commercially reasonable rate would not.id.
in reaching its conclusion,the boulder fruit panel stated the factoring agreement actually enhanced the trust for three reasons.id.at.first,it allowed the distributor to quickly convert accounts receivable to cash id.second,in the course of performance,the distributor actually received more for the accounts than the accounts would prove to be worth.id.and third,a factoring discount of was never shown to be commercially unreasonable.id.the ninth circuit therefore considered not only the payment from factoring agent to distributor but also the actual sums paid to the distributor by the factoring agent during the course of performance of the factoring agreement the ninth circuit did not,however,examine the substance of the rights transferred to determine what the factoring agent agreed to do,what risk the factoring agent accepted when it accepted the right to collect on the transferred accounts,and whether the transaction properly should be deemed a sale rather than a mere secured lending arrangement.rather,the ninth circuit in boulder fruit merely characterized the transaction as a sale or factoring agreement without discussing the factoring agent rights and ability to seek recourse against the distributor.
in contrast,the fourth,fifth,and second circuits considered it necessary to examine the rights and risks transferred between the parties to a factoring agreement.see nickey gregory,at reaves brokerage,at endico potatoes,at.as the fourth circuit stated,i f the accounts receivable were not sold but rather were given as collateral for a loan,then the accounts receivable would have remained trust assets,subject to the factoring agent security interest.nickey gregory,at emphasis in original.whether the accounts receivable remained accounts or were converted into cash,however,the factoring agent position with respect to that cash would have been subordinate to the claims of produce sellers while they remained unpaid.id.in contrast,i f the distributor had transferred these trust assets by means of a sale in exchange for cash,the transaction would have been nothing more than a permissible conversion of trust assets from one form to another,from accounts receivable into cash.id.at.if such a true sale had occurred,the accounts receivable would no longer have remained trust assets,and the commodities sellers would not have had any claim for payment from them.id.at.
nickey gregory,at,and reaves brokerage,at,involved factual patterns similar to the present case.endico potatoes involved a similar question whether a purchaser of accounts was a bona fide purchaser for true value or merely a lender.at.in these cases,the courts examined the text and legislative history of paca,as well as the regulations promulgated under paca,to conclude congress intended to elevate the interests of produce growers above the interests of secured lenders.see,nickey gregory,at,endico potatoes,at.the fourth circuit noted in particular that representatives of the secured lending community had expressed concern over paca likely effect upon secured lenders and the factoring industry.nickey gregory,at.the court concluded that congress nevertheless found the balance of policy interests to favor placing those lenders in a position subordinate to unpaid growers.id.
for example,the house report explaining the paca amendments states 
of perishable agricultural commodities in the normal course of their business transactions,operate on bank loans secured by the inventories,proceeds or assigned receivables from sales of perishable agricultural commodities,giving the lender a secured position in the case of insolvency.under present law,sellers of fresh fruits and vegetables are unsecured creditors and receive little protection in any suit for recovery of damages where a buyer has failed to make payment as required by contract.
at,as reprinted in.the second circuit,citing this report,explained 
according to congress,due to the need to sell perishable commodities quickly,sellers of perishable commodities are often placed in the position of being unsecured creditors of companies whose creditworthiness the seller is unable to verify.due to a large number of defaults by the purchasers,and the sellers status as unsecured creditors,the sellers recover,if at all,only after banks and other lenders who have obtained security interests in the defaulting purchaser inventories,proceeds,and receivables.
endico potatoes,at.given this focus,it becomes evident that this circuit focus,too,should be upon the true nature of the transactions at issue and the true nature of the parties roles,that of seller and buyer or that of secured lender and borrower.
importantly,congress not only knew it was elevating the interests of growers above the interests of secured lenders,congress expressly found the secured lenders practices had been resulting in a burden on commerce,at,and further found the creation of statutory trust would aid commerce.as recognized in nickey gregory,the american bankers association had testified to congress that creation of the paca trust would create difficult ies for lenders in administering their secured loans.at.congress nevertheless made th e policy choice to make the unsecured credit extended by commodities sellers superior to the position of lenders holding a security interest in those commodities and proceeds.id.the house report stated 
the committee believes that the statutory trust requirements will not be a burden to the lending institutions.they will be known to and considered by prospective lenders in extending credit.the assurance the trust provision gives that raw products will be paid for promptly and that there is a monitoring system provided for under paca will protect the interests of the borrower,the money lender,and the fruit and vegetable industry.prompt payments should generate trade confidence and new business which yields increased cash and receivables,the prime security factors to the money lender.
given the remedy congress created to address the perceived problem creation of the trust elevating commodities sellers interests over lenders interests,given congress clear concern with the relative interests of secured lenders and commodities sellers,and given the general backdrop of trust law in particular,a trustee ability to sell or convert trust assets,courts must focus on the true substance of transactions and not on superficial indicators or labels.simply put,it runs counter to paca and its history to permit the simple use of the words sale or purchase or factoring agreement to control for purposes of assessing the relative rights of lenders and produce growers.
iii.transfer of primary or direct risk as the hallmark of a true sale 
the second,fourth,and fifth circuits conclude a transfer of the primary or direct risk of on the accounts stands as the hallmark of a true sale.nickey gregory,at reaves brokerage,at endico potatoes,at.in addition,these courts as well as the regulations under paca focus upon trust asset encumbrance and dissipation in relation to what the terms of a factoring agreement could
