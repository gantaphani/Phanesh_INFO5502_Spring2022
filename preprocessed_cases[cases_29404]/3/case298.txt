appellants collectively ponderosa and hillside are dairies located outside california that sell their raw milk to processors located in california.ponderosa and hillside brought suit against william and yates collectively california,secretary and undersecretary of the california department of food and agriculture,following the enactment of amendments to california milk pooling plan the amendments made dairies,such as ponderosa and hillside,subject to the pooling plan for the first time.three issues are presented on appeal whether of the federal agriculture improvement and reform act farm bill insulates california pooling amendments from commerce clause challenges whether appellants equal protection clause causes of action were sufficiently pled and whether the pooling plan amendments violate the privileges and immunities clause of the constitution.
background 
california has operated a unique milk price stabilization and marketing program since the.the program classifies milk products into five categories class includes fluid products such as the several varieties of milk class includes yogurt,cottage cheese and heavy cream class includes frozen milk products class includes butter and dry milk and class includes cheeses.the program establishes minimum prices for raw milk depending upon the class of product for which the milk will be used.the program was created to address destructive trade practices that resulted because processors that predominantly made class products could afford to pay more for raw milk than could processors making other classes of products 
the california legislature enacted the gonsalves milk pooling act of to address market disparities that resulted from the existing price stabilization and marketing program.california pooling plan seeks to eliminate pricing inequalities by pooling the revenues generated by the sale of raw milk and redistributing the revenues among all producers according to a blended price that is based on milk usage across the state regardless of the use for which a particular producer milk is purchased.at the same time,the minimum prices that are used to calculate each processor obligation to the pool for raw milk pool obligation vary according to the produced.accordingly,class processors typically have a larger pool obligation than do processors of other end products.in sum,the pooling system reduces the competition among dairy farmers for contracts with class processors and reduces the incentives class processors have to extract concessions from the dairies that supply their milk.
the pooling plan redistributes the pooled revenues according to a quota system that includes both a quota and an overbase price.california producers are allocated quota share based upon their historic class milk production.quota shares can also be purchased from other producers.owning quota is beneficial because quota price exceeds overbase price by hundredweight and producers are paid at quota price for milk contributed to the pool up to the amount of quota shares they own.the lesser,overbase price is paid for milk contributed to the pool in excess of quota.consequently,many producers have elected to purchase quota shares in order to maximize the price they receive for their raw milk.
each month,the california department of food and agriculture calculates the gross amount each processor owes its various producers processors are authorized to subtract from the gross amounts certain deductions such as transportation and regional quota allowances where the total value of milk that a processor uses is greater than the amount the processor owes its producers,the processor pays the difference into the pool equalization fund.conversely,a processor is paid from the pool equalization fund when the total amount the processor owes its producers exceeds the value of the milk it used.
prior to the amendments,producers who sold milk to california processors were not included in the pooling plan.processors paid producers directly and the milk purchased from those producers was not included in the processor total pool obligation.under the amended plan,milk purchased from producers is counted towards each processor total pool obligation and processors are credited the lesser of their blend price or the quota price regardless of how much the processor pays the producers.
in an order dated july,the district court granted california motion to dismiss with respect to all of the causes of action raised by the two complaints save those based on the commerce clause of the constitution.pertinent to the appeal,the dismissed causes of action included claims that were premised on the equal protection and privileges and immunities clauses of the constitution.the equal protection clause causes of action were dismissed because the district court found that they were not sufficiently pled.the privileges and immunities clause causes of action were dismissed because the district court found that the pooling plan does not discriminate against nonresidents.
in an order dated july,the district court granted california motion for summary judgment and dismissed the remaining commerce clause causes of action.the court relied on shamrock farms veneman,cir,which it found stood for the proposition that of the farm bill immunizes california pooling plan from commerce clause challenges.final judgment as to each case was entered on august.this appeal followed.
discussion 
shamrock precludes commerce clause claims.
reviewing the district court grant of summary judgement de novo and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to ponderosa and hillside,see balint carson city,cir en banc,we find that there were no genuine issues of material fact and the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.shamrock forecloses ponderosa and hillside commerce clause claims.
shamrock involved commerce clause and fourteenth amendment challenges to california milk laws.the shamrock plaintiffs were an arizona dairy and processor who regularly distributed packaged fluid milk in california.their complaint alleged that california milk composition requirements,which mandate minimum identity standards for the content of fluid milk,effectively precluded them from distributing whole and skim milk in california during certain seasons of the year and from distributing milk in california during the whole year.the shamrock plaintiffs could not meet the minimum identity standards because they did not fortify,standardize or otherwise alter the content of the milk they distributed.also at issue were fortification allowances which,according to the shamrock plaintiffs,provided an unfair competitive advantage to processors.the district court granted california motion to dismiss and this court affirmed.both courts found that congress,in enacting of the farm bill,intended to protect the milk composition requirements from commerce clause limitations.see shamrock,at.
the appellate court premised its decision on the language of.section provides,
nothing in this act or any other provision of law shall be construed to preempt,prohibit,or otherwise limit the authority of the state of california,directly or indirectly,to establish or continue to effect any law,regulation,or requirement regarding the percentage of milk solids or solid not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail or marketed in the state of california or the labeling of such fluid milk products with regard to milk solids or solids not fats.
the unanimous panel found the any other provision of law language persuasive and indicative of congress intent to create a blanket exclusion for california composition requirements.see id.at.with respect to the pricing and pooling laws,the appellate court analyzed the connection between those laws and composition requirements and found them to be interrelated and mutually interdependent.id.at.because of this connection,the court stated that the pricing and pooling laws fall under the ambit of the prohibition against indirect limitations on laws,regulations,or requirements regarding milk standards that is stated in.id.at.as a result,the court concluded that the pricing and pooling
