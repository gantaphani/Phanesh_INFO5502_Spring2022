background 
ucpa,a wholly owned subsidiary of universal cooperatives,universal,is a cooperative that manufactures and sells chemicals.ucpa is a minnesota limited liability company with its principal place of business in minnesota.scottsdale,a wholly owned subsidiary of nationwide mutual insurance company,is an excess and surplus lines insurance company.scottsdale is an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in arizona.
in,universal purchased a commercial general liability insurance policy policy from scottsdale for.the policy,effective from may,to may,listed ucpa as a named insured.in relevant part,the policy provided the following coverage 
insuring agreement 
scottsdale will pay those sums that ucpa becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies.scottsdale will have the right and duty to defend ucpa against any suit seeking those damages.however,scottsdale will have no duty to defend ucpa against any suit to which this insurance does not apply.
b.this insurance applies to property damage only if 
the property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and 
the property damage occurs during the policy period 
the policy defined property damage as including p hysical injury to tangible property.
the policy contained a pollution exclusion,disclaiming coverage for property damage which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants.the policy defined pollutants as including any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.
the policy provided ucpa with million in coverage for each occurrence of property damage,defining occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.coverage was subject to a deductible for each occurrence.the costs of defending ucpa from a lawsuit were subject to the deductible,but not the million coverage limit.
arkansas lawsuit 
on may,more than cotton farmers sued ucpa and four other herbicide manufacturers in the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas arkansas lawsuit.the cotton farmers alleged that,in june and july,neighboring rice farmers applied tens of thousands of pounds of the manufacturers herbicides to control weeds in their rice fields.the farmers claimed the herbicides contained dichlorophenoxyacetic acid,a phytotoxin,or plant poison,that is extremely toxic to cotton plants.the cotton farmers alleged the drifted and damaged fields in five arkansas counties.
on june,the cotton farmers served ucpa with their complaint,which asserted state law claims of strict products liability deceptive trade practices negligent design,testing,and warning breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and implied warranty of merchantability.invoking diversity jurisdiction under,the cotton farmers sought compensatory and punitive damages,attorney fees,and costs from the herbicide manufacturers.
on june,ucpa tendered the arkansas lawsuit to scottsdale for defense and indemnification.on july,scottsdale agreed to defend ucpa subject to a complete reservation of its rights under the policy.scottsdale reminded ucpa of the policy deductible and declined to provide ucpa a defense.
declaratory judgment action 
on july,the day before scottsdale provisionally agreed to defend ucpa,scottsdale filed this declaratory judgment action against ucpa in the united states district court for the district of minnesota district court,pursuant to and.scottsdale invoked the district court diversity jurisdiction under,alleging the parties were citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs.among other things,scottsdale asked the district court for declarations that scottsdale has no duty to defend or indemnify ucpa and,in any event,a property damage deductible applies.
in its answer,ucpa denied the amount in controversy exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs,pointing out the attorney fees and costs expended in the arkansas lawsuit did not exceed as of the date this action was commenced,and the cotton farmers have not alleged that they are seeking damages from ucpa in excess of the deductible.in its counterclaim,ucpa sought a declaration that ucpa had the right to select its own defense counsel,in part because t here are numerous conflicts of interest between scottsdale and ucpa,including the deductible.ucpa also alleged breach of contract,asserting scottsdale violated the policy by failing to pay the attorney fees and costs ucpa had expended on the arkansas lawsuit.
scottsdale moved for summary judgment,and ucpa moved to dismiss.scottsdale asked the district court for a declaration that the pollution exclusion relieved scottsdale of any obligation under the policy to defend and indemnify ucpa in the arkansas lawsuit.ucpa asserted the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the requisite amount in controversy was lacking and the parties dispute was not ripe for adjudication.
in its resistance to scottsdale motion for summary judgment,ucpa argued the district court should equitably estop scottsdale from enforcing the pollution exclusion because scottsdale conspired with ucpa broker to raise the policy premium,and the pollution exclusion rendered the policy coverage illusory.in the alternative,ucpa asked the district court to refrain from issuing total summary judgment in scottsdale favor because,on december,the cotton farmers filed an amended complaint to offer a second theory as to how the herbicide manufacturers damaged their cotton plants.in addition to their original drift theory,ucpa now alleged some had landed on target but had later relofted and drifted onto the cotton fields.ucpa speculated any damages from relofting might have resulted,not from any toxic effect of,but from relofted particle essences inhibiting photosynthesis by blocking sunlight as with dust.under the relofting theory then,ucpa posits,might not qualify as a pollutant under the policy.the amended complaint also added an additional herbicide manufacturer as a defendant.
on march,the district court issued an order expressing three primary holdings.first,the district court held the amount in controversy exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs.the district court found ucpa argument to the contrary in its motion to dismiss was not well taken because,a s ucpa is well aware,there is much more than at stake in the underlying litigation.
second,the district court held t here is no doubt that scottsdale duty to defend can be resolved without any further record development,and therefore the case is ripe.in a footnote,however,the district court stated scottsdale contends that both its duty to defend and the duty to indemnify can be resolved in a declaratory judgment at this time.however,whether scottsdale has the duty to indemnify may depend on the theory of liability that is successful against ucpa in the underlying litigation.
third,the district court held scottsdale did not have a duty to defend ucpa.the district court determined any alleged conspiracy between scottsdale and the broker to raise ucpa premium would not invalidate the pollution exclusion the pollution exclusion did not render the policy coverage illusory and the relofting theory fell within the pollution exclusion.
notwithstanding the district court footnote appearing to indicate at least a portion of scottsdale complaint was not ripe,the district court observed t he pollution exclusion applies to bar coverage in the underlying case,granted scottsdale motion for summary judgment in its entirety,and denied ucpa motion to dismiss in its entirety.without referencing scottsdale complaint or ucpa counterclaims,the clerk of court entered the following formal judgment defendant motion to dismiss is denied and plaintiff motion for summary judgment is granted.ucpa appeals.

amount in controversy 
ucpa criticizes the district court determination that the amount in controversy exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs,as conclusory,and a complete mystery because the order contains no supporting facts or analysis.ucpa maintains scottsdale must prove the amount in controversy actually exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs jurisdictional minimum plus the policy deductible.in support of its argument that the amount in controversy does not exceed this threshold,ucpa points out ucpa had only incurred in defense costs when scottsdale brought suit the complaint in the arkansas lawsuit does not specifically allege an amount in controversy between each plaintiff and ucpa,so there is no evidence regarding ucpa potential liability and in late september,the district court in the arkansas lawsuit determined the six herbicide manufacturer defendants are not jointly and severally liable.
when the two parties to an action are citizens of different states,as they are here,a federal district court jurisdiction extends to all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs.kopp kopp,cir quoting a.a complaint that alleges the jurisdictional amount in good faith will suffice to confer jurisdiction,but the complaint will be dismissed if it appear s to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount.id.quoting larkin brown,cir quoting in turn paul mercury indem.red cab.if the defendant challenges the plaintiff allegations of the amount in controversy,then the plaintiff must establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.kopp,at quoting mcnutt motors acceptance.
when the legal certainty standard announced in larkin is combined with the burden of proof established in mcnutt,it appears that the relevant legal rule is that the proponent of diversity jurisdiction must prove a negative by a preponderance of the evidence in order to avoid dismissal of his or her case.a leading treatise,for example,suggests that the proponent of federal jurisdiction must show that it does not appear to a legal certainty that the claim for relief is for less than the statutorily prescribed jurisdictional amount.charles alan wright,arthur miller,and edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.
it is well established that the requirements for diversity jurisdiction must be satisfied only with respect to the time of filing.see grupo dataflux atlas global group.subsequent events reducing the amount in controversy do not destroy diversity jurisdiction.rosado wyman.subsequent events may,however,be relevant to prove the existence or nonexistence of diversity jurisdiction at the time of filing.see,grinnell mut.reins.shierk,cir observing that,only six months after a declaratory judgment action was filed by an insurer against an insured,the plaintiff in the underlying liability action argued to a jury that a award was appropriate against the insured.
applying the foregoing legal standards,we hold the district court did not clearly err in finding the amount in controversy exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs,when scottsdale filed the instant declaratory judgment action against ucpa.see.we agree scottsdale alleged the jurisdictional minimum in good faith.therefore,scottsdale only needed to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that it did not appear to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy was less than what it alleged.see kopp,at.
in a declaratory judgment action such as this one,wherein an insurer sues an insured to determine its obligation to defend and indemnify,the amount in controversy in the declaratory judgment action ordinarily equals the probable costs of defense and indemnification of the underlying litigation less any applicable deductible.see,capitol indem.miles,cir while the policy deductible is relatively high probable costs of defense and indemnification of the arkansas lawsuit nonetheless exceeded,exclusive of interest and costs,when scottsdale filed the instant declaratory judgment action.under the terms of the policy,scottsdale was potentially liable for million dollars in property damage plus the cost of defending ucpa from the cotton farmers.see budget higashiguchi,cir holding policy limits are relevant to determining the amount in controversy when the validity of the entire policy is at issue or the value of the underlying tort claim exceeds the limits at the time of filing,scottsdale and ucpa did not know the arkansas district court would not hold the herbicide manufacturers jointly and severally liable.the alleged breadth of the arkansas lawsuit was staggering,and it seemed likely the cotton farmers would pursue damages in excess of the policy property damage limits.
the cotton farmers allegations in their governing complaint corroborate this commonsense assumption.each of the cotton farmers invoked diversity jurisdiction under,thereby implicitly alleging each claim exceeded,exclusive of interest or costs.see allison sec.benefit life ins,cir it is well settled that each plaintiff,even in a class action,must individually satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirement.exxon mobil allapattah,holding permits exercise of jurisdiction over additional plaintiffs who fail to satisfy the minimum requirement,as long as other elements of diversity jurisdiction are present and at least one named plaintiff satisfies the requirement.
less than one month after scottsdale filed this declaratory judgment action,ucpa asserted the arkansas lawsuit would require discovery,two years of pretrial litigation,depositions by each defendant of each plaintiff,and a week trial the following year,ucpa indicated discovery alone would cost millions of dollars and would be a massive undertaking,involving plaintiffs,defendants,herbicide applicators,over applications of,and claim fields.see generally grinnell mut,at stating actions may be relevant to determine the amount in controversy at the time of filing 
as indicated,it is unclear whether the district court held scottsdale entire complaint was ripe as the district court directions to the clerk of court,the terms of the clerk of court formal judgment,and the district court remark that the case is ripe suggest or only such portion of the complaint seeking a declaration that scottsdale did not owe a duty to defend ucpa was ripe as the district court footnote and its subsequent failure to analyze scottsdale alleged duty to indemnify might indicate.not surprisingly,ucpa and scottsdale express different views as to the meaning and effect of the district court order.
ucpa contends the district court held scottsdale complaint was not ripe with respect to its request for a declaration that scottsdale owed no duty to indemnify ucpa in the arkansas lawsuit.ucpa points out scottsdale did not and concludes the district court holding of unripeness is now the law of the case.
scottsdale maintains the district court held its entire complaint was ripe.scottsdale reasons any confusion engendered by the district court failure to explicitly discuss scottsdale alleged duty to indemnify disappears when one bears in mind i t is axiomatic
