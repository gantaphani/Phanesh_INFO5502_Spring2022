this case arises from claims that two agricultural companies leveraged the hiring of undocumented immigrants in order to depress the wages of their legally documented employees.we are called upon to decide two significant issues.first,we must determine whether,under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,legally documented agricultural workers have standing to sue their employers,whom they allege depressed their salaries by conspiring to hire undocumented workers at below market wages.second,we must consider the constitutionality of supplemental subject matter jurisdiction involving a party over whom there is no independent basis for federal court jurisdiction.the district court resolved both questions in favor of the defendants and dismissed this lawsuit on the pleadings.we reverse.
background 
olivia mendoza,juana mendiola,and the purported class employees are agricultural laborers for zirkle fruit company and matson fruit company growers,which operate fruit orchards and packing houses in eastern washington,the heart of washington fruit industry.according to the complaint the employees are persons legally authorized to be employed in the united states.they worked for the growers at wages that are substantially depressed because of the illegal immigrant hiring scheme.pursuant to the scheme,zirkle and matson knowingly hire workers of illegal status because the illegal workers are willing to accept wages that are significantly lower than wages would be in a labor market comprised solely of legally authorized workers.they do so for the purpose of depressing employee wages below the levels they would otherwise be required to pay if they were unable to hire substantial numbers of illegal immigrants who,due to their economic situation and fear of asserting their rights due to their illegal status,can be easily exploited and who are therefore willing to work for depressed wages.the complaint provides substantial background and detail about the scope of the challenged scheme 
eastern washington is the heart of washington famed apple and fruit industry.this area is uniquely suited for growing fruit 
in washington state there are more than fruit packers and orchard pickers of fruit.many operations require unskilled,laborers for harvesting and packing and other related tasks requiring manual labor.while the industry now generates over billion,many of these workers live in poverty.
defendants matson and zirkle operate fruit orchards and packing houses.matson and zirkle are motivated to keep labor costs as low as possible and,due to a variety of complex social and economic factors,the industry demand for workers has attracted many workers of mexican citizenship.many of these mexican nationals are illegal immigrants who have been smuggled into the harbored in the by relatives,friends,and the employers.matson and zirkle knowingly hire workers of illegal status because illegal workers are willing to accept wages that are significantly lower than wages would be in a labor market comprised solely of legally authorized workers.
the immigration and naturalization service has conducted investigations finding that as much as half the growers workforce is employed illegally,and the growers have been targeted for raids and other law enforcement procedures.
according to the complaint,the scheme is facilitated by selective employment agency,a separate company that employs the workers and then loans them to the growers.defendants matson and zirkle use selective employment as a front company for the purpose of perpetrating this scheme with the hope that each will be thus shielded from charges that they violated federal law.although selective employment was named only as an enterprise,not as a defendant,in the federal rico claim,the complaint alleged a state conspiracy claim that did name selective employment as a defendant.
the district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b although the district court held that the employees pled a direct injury because there was no intervening third party from whom their injury was derived,the court dismissed the complaint on grounds that the damages were too speculative and difficult to ascertain 
the employees moved for reconsideration,proffering a proposed amended complaint that alleged a conspiracy broader than the named growers and included more specific causation allegations.the amended complaint states that the growers and unnamed conspirators comprise a large percentage of the fruit orchards and packing houses in the area,and therefore affect wages throughout the labor market for apple pickers and fruit packers,such that competition with respect to wages is stifled and suppressed.the proffered complaint also adds six paragraphs explaining how the scheme injures the workers.nonetheless,the district court denied the motion,clarifying that it was not dismissing merely for difficulty of proof,but for lack of concrete injury and proximate causation.
in addition,the district court,quite reluctantly,granted selective employment motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.the district court determined that it was bound by ayala united states,cir,cert.granted,d,cert.dismissed,d,which it characterized as holding jurisdiction unconstitutional.
discussion 
we note at the outset that the district court dismissed this case on the pleadings.consequently,our review is de novo,and we may affirm the dismissal only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.swierkiewicz sorema,d quoting hishon king spalding,d.in the rico context,a t the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.now scheidler,d quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
the district court offered two bases for dismissal on the pleadings rico standing and supplemental jurisdiction.we discuss those issues below,but first we address one proffered alternative ground for affirming the dismissal for failure to state a claim,an argument that need not detain us long.rico prohibits engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity,defined as violating certain laws as such,a predicate illegal act must be alleged.c,f.the district court held that the illegal immigrant hiring scheme as pleaded involved a predicate rico act,knowingly hiring undocumented workers in violation of immigration and naturalization act.we are unpersuaded by the growers argument that the district court erred in this respect.their argument rests on a hypertechnical reading of the complaint inconsistent with the generous notice pleading standard.see swierkiewicz.at.the complaint alleges that the defendants had knowledge of illegal harboring smuggling.even if knowledge of smuggling were required by the statute,an issue about which we express no opinion,the complaint easily contains this allegation.we affirm the district court analysis and reasoning on this issue,and turn to standing and supplemental jurisdiction.
statutory standing 
we turn first to the statutory standing requirements particular to rico.under rico,a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate united states district court for civil damages.c.this statute is quite similar to the antitrust statute granting standing to any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws,a,and consequently the two have been interpreted in tandem.holmes sec.inv.protection,d.the employees allege an injury to their property in the form of lost wages the key task is to determine whether this injury was by reason of the growers alleged violations,a requirement the supreme court has interpreted to encompass proximate as well as factual causation.
in a series of cases beginning in the antitrust context and later extended to rico,the supreme court clarified that potential plaintiffs who have suffered is,injury derived from a third party direct statutory standing.brick illinois,d gen l contractors.state council of carpenters,d holmes,at.illinois brick held that government consumers could not sue on a theory that high prices were passed on to them as a result of the defendants illegal scheme.at.similarly,in associated general contractors,unions lacked standing to sue a contractors association for an illegal conspiracy to use nonunion subcontractors because such a conspiracy would directly victimize the union subcontractors,not the unions.at.holmes extended the requirement to rico nonpurchasing customers,forced to cover costs when brokers became insolvent as a result of an illegal stock manipulation scheme,could not sue for this derivative harm.at.
in this circuit,we focus on three nonexhaustive factors in considering causation,that is whether the injury is too remote to allow recovery 
whether there are more direct victims of the alleged wrongful conduct who can be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general whether it will be difficult to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff damages attributable to defendant wrongful conduct and whether the courts will have to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.
ass of.pub.hosp.dists.philip morris,cir.quoting oregon health welfare trust fund philip morris,cir,cert.denied,d.at this stage of the proceedings,we can not say that there is no set of facts that could be proved,to satisfy these requirements.swierkiewicz.at.
our analysis is guided by two key cases,both decided after the district court original opinion.see knevelbaard dairies kraft foods,cir commercial cleaning servs.colin serv,cir.
the relationships among the parties in this case bear a striking resemblance to those in knevelbaard dairies,an antitrust case in which we recently held that the plaintiffs had standing.there,milk producers sued defendant cheese producers,who illegally fixed the price of cheese,which in turn set the price of milk artificially low.at.applying classic antitrust standing principles,we looked to the chain of causation between plaintiff injury and the alleged restraint in the market.id.at quoting am.ad mgmt.general,cir.we concluded that the milk producers injury was sufficiently direct.their allegations that they would receive less for milk than they otherwise would have received in the absence of the defendants unlawful conduct were disputed claims of causation and injury that can not be decided on a rule b motion.id.at.the employees here,like the milk producers in knevelbaard dairies,claim a direct market injury as a result of the alleged illegal hiring scheme or in the case of knevelbaard dairies,as a result of the price fixing in the cheese market.in fact,the causation allegations here are more direct than knevelbaard dairies,as the employees allege a direct impact on the labor market,not the more attenuated claim of an impact on the cheese market,which in turn affected the milk prices.
the second circuit,the only circuit to have considered allegations of illegal immigrant hiring based on the same predicate act as that at issue here,held that the plaintiffs had standing to sue under rico.in commercial cleaning,a competitor alleged that the defendant janitorial service underbid it by relying on laborers that the defendant knew to be undocumented.at.the injury was not derivative of an injury to a third party because the theory of commercial claim is that colin undertook the illegal immigrant hiring scheme in order to undercut its business rivals.id.at.similarly here,the employees allege that the illegal hiring scheme was divined in order to depress the normal labor market.
turning to the first factor,taking the allegations in the complaint as true,we are unable to discern a more direct victim of the illegal conduct.the documented employees here do not complain of a harm.they allege that the scheme had the purpose and direct result of depressing the wages paid to them by the growers.thus,as the district court correctly determined,plaintiffs have stated a claim that they are the direct victims of the illegal hiring scheme.
as in knevelbaard dairies and commercial cleaning,the scheme aims to gain an illegal commercial,disproportionate bargaining power in employment the growers dealings with the employees.neither the government nor the undocumented workers are an intervening third party in this scheme,despite the growers arguments to the contrary.the claims here thus differ fundamentally from injury cases.see imagineering kiewit pac,cir holding that minority and subcontractors could not sue general contractors under rico for an illegal scheme to evade federally required quotas because the direct harm was to competitor general contractors who complied with the quotas oregon laborers,at holding that health care trust funds could not sue tobacco companies under rico because their injury derived from the smokers injury.pub,at same for health care providers.in contrast to these other cases,the alleged scheme here was intended to give the growers a contract advantage at the expense of the documented workers,a direct rather than a injury.
we also note that the undocumented workers can not be counted on to bring suit for the law vindication.holmes,at hoffman plastic compounds nlrb,d holding that undocumented workers are not entitled to backpay wrongfully withheld in a labor dispute.although not dispositive,see oregon laborers,we heed the supreme court example and consider this factor in our analysis.as the district court noted,the fact that rico specifically provides that illegal hiring is a predicate offense indicates that congress contemplated the enforcement of the immigration laws through lawsuits like this one.f.
the second concern to which we direct our attention is the speculative measure of harm.the district court noted that intervening factors could have interfered with the plaintiffs receiving higher pay absent the defendants hiring of undocumented workers.these intervening factors include the wage paid by other orchards in the area,the skill and qualifications of each plaintiff,the profitability of the defendants businesses without the undocumented workers,and the general availability of documented workers in the area.in other words,the district court dismissed the complaint based on the conclusion that factors other than the scheme coupled with the growers power in the relevant labor market could account for the plaintiffs depressed wages.the difficulty with this reasoning is that the employees allege that the growers singularly have the ability to define wages in this labor market,akin to monopsony or oligopsony power.see phillip areeda,et,antitrust law.they further allege that it is the illegal scheme that has caused their injury.the proposed amended complaint lays to rest any remaining doubt about attributing the alleged harm to the scheme,by spelling out a broad conspiracy causing direct harm to the workers.for example,it makes clear that the scheme involves fruit growers that comprise a large percentage of the fruit orchards and packing houses in the area,and therefore affect wages throughout the labor market.
the district court analysis focused primarily on,not proximate cause,and it is inappropriate at this stage to substitute speculation for the complaint allegations of causation.as we explained in knevelbaard dairies when we rejected the claim that milk prices might have been lower due to independent factors instead of the cheese price fixing whether experts will be able to measure the difference between the allegedly restrained price for milk and the price that would have prevailed but for the antitrust violation remains to be seen in deciding a rule b motion we are dealing only with the complaint allegations,which in this instance do not make the claim speculative.at.
similarly here,the workers must be allowed to make their case through presentation of evidence,including experts who will testify about the labor market,the geographic market,and the effects of the illegal scheme.questions regarding the relevant labor market and the growers power with
