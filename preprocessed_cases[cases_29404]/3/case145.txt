plaintiff john ballanger,ballanger,sought judicial review of a ruling by the united states department of agriculture usda in which the usda found ballanger converted wetlands for agricultural use in violation of,and thereby became ineligible to receive certain usda benefits.the matter was fully briefed,argued,and submitted to the district court and the district court refused to disturb the agency decision.ballanger appeals,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
ballanger lives in iowa and owns farmland in schuyler county,missouri.when ballanger purchased the schuyler county farmland,he was told by the seller that it did not contain any wetlands.in,ballanger used a bulldozer and brush cutting equipment to clear woody vegetation and other plants from approximately five acres of land for conversion to row crop planting.the present case centers on a dispute as to whether ballanger actions in clearing the land constituted the conversion of a wetland.
in spring,the schuyler county farm service agency the county fsa sought a determination from the natural resources conservation service the conservation service that,for the crop year,ballanger farm complied with highly erodible land conservation and wetland conservation provisions of the food security act of,codified in part at.this section provides,generally,that the conversion of wetlands for use in the production of agricultural commodities or the production of agricultural commodities on converted wetlands makes the person taking such actions ineligible for certain usda benefits.id.the term converted wetland is defined,in relevant part,as 
wetland that has been drained,dredged,filled,leveled,or otherwise manipulated including any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow,circulation,or reach of water for the purpose or to have the effect of making the production of an agricultural commodity possible 
after two visits to ballanger schuyler county farm in april and august,the conservation service concluded that acres of his land qualified as converted wetlands.ballanger was informed of this decision and appealed it to the conservation service.as part of that appeal process,the conservation service visited his farm a third time in december.after this third visit,the conservation service concluded that of the acres qualified as converted wetlands.this land had,among other characteristics,hydric soil,hydrophytic vegetation,wetland drainage patterns,and oxidized root channels in the upper twelve inches of soil,which are all characteristics of wetlands.see,a defining the term wetland with reference to hydric soils and with reference to saturation levels at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
ballanger appealed to the county fsa.before the county fsa,ballanger stated that he neither applied for a good faith determination that might have excused his actions nor pursued mitigation of the wetland conversion because he believed such actions would have been an admission or acquiescence in the wetlands determination of the conservation service.the county fsa affirmed the conservation service determination that the schuyler county farm contained acres of converted wetlands.based on the finding that the wetlands were converted to row crop use in,ballanger was declared ineligible for usda payments as of crop year.ballanger had received usda payments from,and he was ordered to repay the amounts he received,plus interest,for a total amount of.
ballanger then appealed the county fsa ruling to the usda national appeals division.the national appeals division affirmed,as did a usda deputy director upon ballanger subsequent request for a director review of the determination of the national appeals division.through all the stages of appellate review,ballanger argued generally that he did not believe the land at issue was a wetland and that he did not believe his removal of vegetation effected any change in any wetland function of the land.
following exhaustion of these successive layers of administrative review,ballanger challenged the usda final action in district court.before the district court,ballanger raised the following specific arguments.first,he argued that it was improper for the conservation service to rely on data obtained on a visit to his land that occurred outside the growing season.second,he argued that the conservation service failed to follow the wetland determination methodology in effect at the time of the purported conversion.third,he argued that the conservation service must consider whether the removal of vegetation had only a minimal effect on wetland functions before making a wetland violation determination.the district court found that,although ballanger had taken his case through the required levels of administrative review,he had not raised these three specific issues with the agency.the district court held that,in the context of a wetlands determination,it is not sufficient merely to exhaust administrative remedies.rather,a litigant must specifically raise before the agency those issues he seeks to litigate in court.therefore,the district court refused to consider ballanger three,unexhausted issues.
ballanger also raised an argument that he had specifically presented in his administrative appeals,namely,whether the removal of woody vegetation in and of itself qualifies as the manipulat ion of a wetland as defined in a a,or whether there must be a showing that the removal of woody vegetation impacted the flow of water.the district court considered and addressed this issue,finding that the usda regulations interpreting those sections define manipulation of a wetland to encompass the removal of woody vegetation for conversion of land to agricultural use,without the need for a separate showing of impact upon wetland function.see a.based on these conclusions,the district court affirmed the administrative rulings.
ii.discussion 
issue exhaustion 
the first question presented for our review is whether,to properly exhaust administrative remedies related to a wetlands violation determination by the usda,a landowner must specifically raise before the agency all of the issues he or she attempts to raise in federal court,must the landowner merely exhaust his administrative remedies or must he exhaust his remedies specifically as to each issue 
the controlling supreme court precedent on this issue is sims apfel,d.sims explains that the need for issue exhaustion is,first and foremost,a question of statutory construction and that agencies generally have the power to pass regulations requiring issue exhaustion.id.at.where the relevant statutes and regulations do not clearly require issue exhaustion,however,a issue exhaustion requirement may be appropriate.id.at.the basis for a issue exhaustion requirement is an analogy between the relationship and the trial court relationship where the agency proceeding is adversarial,the analogy holds,parties are held responsible for raising issues in a manner similar to litigants in court,and issue exhaustion is required where the agency proceeding is not adversarial,the analogy does hold,and issue exhaustion is not required.id.at.
in sims,the court stated that a party failure to develop an issue before an agency can not be fairly attributed to the party opposing the agency action if the nature of the agency proceeding was not adversarial and if the agency itself was responsible for identifying issues and creating a record.id.at.this is in contrast to the adversarial model of trial courts where each party must develop the factual bases for its specific claims and raise those specific issues it wishes to preserve for appeal.
sims involved a social security proceeding in which an administrative law judge served an investigative role and had an independent duty to develop the record.id.social security proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.it is the alj duty to investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits,and the council review is similarly broad.internal citation omitted.as a result,
