sugar cane growers cooperative of florida,florida crystals corporation,and refined sugars,appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment holding that appellants lacked standing.the court dismissed their claims that the united states department of agriculture failed to comply with the administrative procedure and the food security act of in implementing a program for the sugar crop by press release.we think appellants have demonstrated standing and because the department did not comply with the apa or the food security act,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand to that court to in turn remand to the department.
in the united states,sugar production,which the government supports through a variety of programs,is about evenly divided between sugar cane and sugar beet production.this suit involves the department choice of a particular method of support.appellants are small,medium and sugar cane growers,processors,refiners and marketers,who together make up a significant portion of the total domestic sugar cane production,which mostly occurs in the gulf belt and hawaii.sugar beets grow primarily in the north and west,and sugar beet farmers tend to harvest significantly fewer acres per producer than sugar cane farmers.the department supports sugar production through a program of loans if the market price of sugar drops below the forfeiture price,producers may forfeit their crops to the department in satisfaction of these loans rather than try to repay in cash,which effectively guarantees a minimum price for harvested and processed sugar.with the low sugar prices over the past several years,the department has accumulated more than tons of sugar,for which it pays approximately million per month in storage fees.the presence of that potential supply or overhang may depress somewhat sugar prices and it exacerbates the problem of limited sugar storage,which is particularly troublesome for sugar beet farmers.
the food security act gives the department authority to implement a pik program for sugar,which it did for sugar beet farmers in august.for the pik program,sugar beet farmers submitted bids to the department offering to destroy or divert a certain amount of their crops in return for sugar from usda storage.a farmer bid is his asking price for that amount of destruction the price is expressed in terms of a percentage of the average value of the crop yield for the acreage diverted.thus,a farmer bidding percent would receive eight dollars for every acre destroyed if an average acre of their farm produced ten dollars worth of sugar.in fact,the average bid was approximately percent and resulted in the distribution of about tons of government sugar and the diversion of approximately acres.participants were prohibited from participating in future pik programs if they increased their acreage planted with sugar beets over levels.the agency did not proceed by notice and comment,but no party challenged that decision or the program itself.
appellants claim the pik program unfairly provided participants with government sugar which gave them a competitive advantage over appellants.and they claim that the program depressed sugar prices.actually,the price of sugar rose,but it is not clear what caused the increase.according to appellants,although initial forecasts predicted that the diverted acreage would lead to lower sugar crop volume in,subsequent forecasts increased substantially in the months following implementation of the pik tons per acre in december from tons per acre before august.appellants contend that the yield increase or yield slippage resulted in part from farmers taking their crops out of production for the pik program.with the yield slippage,additional beet sugar supplies ended up on the market,and pik farmers received more sugar through the program than they would have if they had produced sugar on the diverted acres.and the greater supplies of sugar,it is argued,necessarily depressed sugar prices below that which would otherwise have obtained.the government insists that the program had a positive effect on the price of sugar,at least in part because it reduced the government sugar supply and storage fees,ameliorating the overhang effect and storage scarcity problem.
in january,the department met with interested persons including representatives of appellants and indicated that while it was considering a pik program for the sugar crop,it would not do so without notice and comment.the agency also asked those present about the effectiveness of the pik program and their thoughts on the desirability and structure of a potential program.appellants claim that they were unable to comment satisfactorily because the data on the program was not yet available.before august,department employees had approximately a dozen contacts with sugar industry representatives regarding the possibility of a program.
the department announced by an august,press release,however,that it was implementing a pik program for the sugar crop without using apa rulemaking.the agency followed that announcement a week later with a notice of program implementation in the september,federal register.for the pik program,the department set a ton limit in order to encourage more competitive bidding and made both beet and cane sugar producers eligible.but a statutory restriction limiting payments to per producer effectively eliminated appellants opportunity to participate because of their size.particularly troubling appellants,the government waived its pik program restriction on future eligibility by participants who had increased their crop acreage it merely included a similar restriction on participants.in contrast to the pik program,in which the government disbursed all of the allotted sugar at the same time,in the department indicated that it would stagger disbursement.after announcing the program,the department received more than bids and accepted bids,some as high as percent.the final data on bids is not a part of the summary judgment record,nor is the disbursement schedule.
appellants filed suit shortly after the press release appeared,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.they argued that the department did not comply with the apa because it promulgated a rule without rulemaking that it violated the food security act of by not making required findings and that the department violated the regulatory flexibility because it did not consider the impact of the program on small businesses.it was argued that the pik program caused appellants two injuries first,it gave participants a competitive advantage by providing them with sugar second,it had a depressive effect on prices.
the district court,with the agreement of the parties,converted appellants motion for preliminary injunctive relief into a summary judgment motion.the court concluded that appellants failed to establish standing on two grounds first,they had not shown an second,they had not established causation because they had not demonstrated that the department would have decided against implementing the program following notice and comment.the court nevertheless decided the merits,holding that the pik program was a rule subject to procedures,but the department failure to comply with those procedures was harmless.appellants food security act and regulatory flexibility act claims were not addressed.
we,of course,begin with standing.appellants claim that the department gave sugar beet farmer participants a competitive advantage by giving them sugar.participants will use that competitive advantage to capture market share and customer good will,or so the argument goes.the government responds by pointing out and appellants do not dispute that refined sugar is a commodity market.in light of that,appellants have not explained how any cost advantage participants could gain would translate into a meaningful competitive advantage 
on the other hand,appellants are on much sounder economic ground in claiming that the pik program had a depressive effect on sugar would have clearly injured appellants.they produced an affidavit from brian and studies by two independent industry analysts,each of which i
