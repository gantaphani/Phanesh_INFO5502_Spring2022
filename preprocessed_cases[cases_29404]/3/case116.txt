liquid sales,provided products and marketing services to farmers.unfortunately,it fell on hard times and closed its doors on august,leaving behind millions of dollars of debt that it owed to wells fargo bank.the debt was secured by,among other things,accounts receivable,and one of those accounts was with defendant paul siegel.when it could not collect from,wells fargo turned to siegel to collect the monies siegel owed to under an oral contract.after a bench trial,the district court concluded that the scope of the agreement was not as broad as wells fargo believed,and thus that wells fargo could not recover against siegel.wells fargo appeals we affirm.
over the years,wells fargo loaned a substantial amount of money to,which was in the business of selling fertilizer,chemicals,and various farming services,including a program through which tried to help grain producers obtain the best price for their production.at times,the program included trading in grain futures.
one of customers was paul siegel,who has been a farmer since the.siegel relation with began in the early,when he attended several meetings at facilities about grain marketing and trading.siegel also had discussions about strategies with ceo,john buzz gibbons.frequently giving informal sales pitches to farmers at breakfast meetings,annual dinners,barbeques,and the like,gibbons was the face and engine of.around siegel decided to move his business to,because it charged a lower commission than the company he had been using.at first siegel simply bought fertilizer and chemicals from soon he began to participate in its marketing program.it is undisputed that at that time,siegel and gibbons speaking for entered into an oral contract that set the terms of siegel participation in the program.the point of contention is whether that agreement included siegel authorization for to trade futures on his behalf.
siegel kept his business with for six years,until ceased operations on august,and wells fargo sued to recover the millions that owed on its loans.wells fargo suit in the circuit court of kendall county resulted in an order granting it possession of the collateral on those loans.that order may have ended one phase of the litigation,but it marked the beginning of a new one wells fargo collection efforts.
one step wells fargo took was to send a letter to siegel,demanding that he pay wells fargo,the balance that wells fargo alleged was due on siegel account.the letter further demanded that siegel pay another,the amount that wells fargo said was due on a loan that siegel took out from the commodity credit corporation ccc,a government agency that loans money to farmers using commodities as collateral.both parties agree that paid off the ccc loan on siegel behalf in september.the question remaining is whether siegel repaid for its discharge of that debt wells fargo says no siegel says yes.
when siegel ignored its payment demand,wells fargo initiated this lawsuit in federal district court,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction.it claimed that siegel had breached his contract with by failing to pay the sums due under his account and his ccc loan,and by virtue of the state court order that siegel now owed those sums to wells fargo.the complaint,filed in september,also asserted a third claim,based on approximately in goods and services that allegedly provided to siegel but for which siegel had not paid.after discovery,wells fargo moved for summary judgment on each claim.the district court denied the motion for the counts based on the account and the ccc loan,but granted it with respect to the claim for in goods and services.siegel motion challenging the judgment against him was denied he paid the amount due on that claim.
wells fargo remaining two claims proceeded to a bench trial,which took place on april.wells fargo did not produce a single witness who could testify about the formation of any contract,verbal or otherwise,between and siegel.instead,the bank relied primarily on documentary evidence,including financial records and accounting books,audit letters,and commodity statements sent to siegel purportedly reflecting the status of his account.it also introduced more than documents evidencing individual transactions between siegel and over the course of their business relations.wells fargo argued that these documents provided conclusive proof that siegel and had an oral agreement,and that the agreement included siegel authorization for to engage in futures trading on his behalf.
in its appellate briefs,wells fargo refers to the documents showing individual transactions between siegel and as contracts.each document shows the crop year in which that particular trade took place.some,but not all,of them refer to corn futures or bean futures,and some use other words,such as puts and calls,that imply transactions.for each of these documents,sent a invoice to siegel.siegel kept a copy of the invoices in his files,and many of them were entered into evidence.
siegel testified at the trial on his own behalf.indeed,with respect to the ccc loan,he provided the only evidence in the record.we address everything related to that issue below.with respect to the alleged debts related to futures trading,siegel asserted that his arrangement with gibbons and hence was only an agreement to sell grain for cash.he maintained that he did not anticipate any futures trading,and that he never gave permission to perform options or futures trading on his behalf.rather,as he described it,he simply delivered grain to and got paid for it.he never thought that he owed any balance to,because only a few days normally elapsed between his delivery of the grain and his receipt of payment.as for the documents that wells fargo now calls contracts,siegel testified that they were not intended to be contracts at all they were just the records generated after a trade took place,to confirm that the transaction had occurred.sent them to siegel with instructions that he sign and return them,and he obliged.he the documents plainly siegel frequently put question marks and comments on the forms.he explained that he did so because he did not understand the terms and wanted to indicate that he neither understood nor agreed with the parts of the documents to which his comments were directed.though he often wrote questions on the forms before returning them,no one from responded to his concerns.
siegel also testified about a series of audit confirmation letters that were entered into evidence.the letters were similar to the commodity statements that siegel received,in that each showed the amount that believed siegel owed on his account as of a given date.the audit letters requested that siegel confirm directly to our auditors the amount receivable from to you on date on your farmer marketing account.they then displayed two columns crop year and amount due.the last line of the columns reflected the total balance that thought was owed or due on the account,followed by an instruction that the letter recipient should inform our auditors whether this balance is in agreement with your records.indicate your answer below and mail it to our auditors in the enclosed,stamped envelope.at the bottom of the page were two choices,followed by a signature line 
the balances shown above are correct.
the balances shown above are not correct.see detail of the difference on the reverse side of this form.
on the audit letters dated august,and september,siegel put an x next to the option stating that the balances were not correct,but he did not provide any explanation on the back of the form before signing and returning it.on the letter,however,he wrote that the amounts reflected are not cash debt but grain to be delivered.he testified at trial that what he was trying to say with that note was that i had confusion about why i ever got this and that i was simply making a statement that my account with was zero and that the only ongoing activity on the account was that i was selling grain.
on the last audit letter in the record,dated august,siegel checked the box stating that the balances shown above are correct.next to that he wrote,per phone call with buzz and its clarifications.ps.siegel signed the letter on october.at trial,siegel testified that he had gotten a letter identical to the one dated august,approximately one month before the letter reproduced in the record arrived.we can not find a copy of this first letter in the record,but siegel stated that he received it,reviewed it,and,as he had done in the previous two years,checked the box indicating that the balances were not correct.he also wrote that he did not understand or agree with the numbers on the form he then signed it and sent it in the enclosed envelope,as instructed.sometime after doing so,he received a phone call on september,from gibbons.siegel testified that following his phone conversation with gibbons,he received another copy of the same letter,again dated august.that is the version we have in the record on it,siegel wrote that the balances were correct,per phone call with buzz and its clarifications.nevertheless,when asked during about his response on the august letter,siegel stated that it was not his intent to indicate that the balances were correct 
q.you testified that you,in fact,believed that this checkmark here was false,that indeed you believed that the balances were not correct is that your testimony 
all right.so you told the auditor something that you believed was false 
i believe that with the note here,that clarified what i was trying to say.
well,does anything in the note say that the balances are not correct 
a.in my mind,yes.
and how was the auditor going to know that was what was in your mind,siegel 
i presume if they had a question about it,they could have called me.
q.but when you sent to whom did you send this document 
all right.but you realized,did you not,that it would go to the auditors,ultimately 
a.it came to me from.it was going back to.
q.but you understood it was for use by the auditors did you not 
a.it was a request from to.
well,in the document,requests that you confirm to the auditors that the balances are correct is that what it says 
when asked on redirect why he sent the form to rather than to the auditors,siegel replied that he did so b ecause it came to me with a stamped envelope with liquid sales as both the return address and the mailing address.siegel was then dismissed no one asked him about the clarifications that he received from gibbons over the phone.gibbons did not testify at the trial,and so the court did not hear his view of the phone,for that matter,did it hear gibbons perspective on the scope of his oral contract with siegel.though siegel petitioned to compel gibbons testimony,the district court denied that request.it is notable that it was siegel,and not wells fargo,who actively sought gibbons testimony,in light of the fact that gibbons was the only person who could potentially have refuted or undermined siegel version of the dealings between siegel and.
the court also heard from several other witnesses.wells fargo presented the testimony of two former employees,cindy mcdonald and barbara germaine.mcdonald worked for as a customer contact representative and general who relayed messages from customers to gibbons.she stated that gibbons handled all of the trading decisions,and that while it was her general understanding that the marketing program involved the trading of futures,she could not confirm whether siegel account involved futures transactions or if siegel was aware that trading in futures was occurring.she testified that she had never spoken personally with siegel,that she was not a contact for siegel account,and that she did not know whether siegel had authorized certain trades on his account.she was also unable to say whether certain documents entered into evidence were true and accurate.she did,however,testify that it was her understanding that the documents sent to wells fargo calls contracts and siegel labels as mere trade confirmations of trade that were generated after the transaction occurr ed.
like mcdonald,germaine testified that she was never contacted personally by siegel,that she was never assigned to siegel account,and that she did not have any personal knowledge about his account.the district court found that while these witnesses appeared credible,their testimony was of limited relevance due to their lack of personal knowledge on key issues,and their testimony was merely tied to general assertions in regards to business practices and the documentary evidence presented by wells.the court emphasized that these witnesses said that they did not have any personal knowledge relating to certain business practices at,which were controlled by gibbons.
to supplement his own testimony,siegel called an expert witness,philip malefyt.the court found that malefyt was qualified to testify and offer expert opinions concerning certain issues before this court,including guaranteed minimum price contracts,hedge to arrive contracts,purchase to arrive contracts,and premium bid contracts.malefyt testified that in his opinion,trading strategy was designed to generate commission income for itself,and that its accounting methods with respect to the marketing program were not customary.his opinion was that the marketing program was in reality a ponzi scheme.documents sometimes reflected money coming in,but they failed to recognize liabilities and rolled over losses so that they would not show up on the books.malefyt also pointed to places in accounting records where amounts that should have been entered as net losses were instead noted as net gains.the district court found that malefyt credibly testified and supported his conclusions that did not follow reliable accounting practices and that its records were not accurate or reliable.it also pointed out that to the extent that malefyt has offered certain legal conclusions or testimony relating to topics that he did not have expertise in,we have disregarded such testimony.
siegel attempted to introduce evidence of a lawsuit that wells fargo filed against clifton gunderson,llc,the certified public accounting firm that hired to conduct its audits.in that suit,wells fargo accused clifton gunderson of professional negligence,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,and breach of contract relating to the accounting firm work on financial statements.the complaint alleged that grain inventory balance was grossly overstated and that its financial condition based on that inventory was overstated and inaccurate.siegel wanted the complaint admitted as the statement of a,but the district court granted wells fargo motion in limine to exclude it.in granting that motion,the court also excluded evidence that explained,at least in part,why gibbons was unavailable to testify he was incarcerated as a result of his conviction for crimes relating to the operation of.
the district court issued its memorandum opinion on june.it found that siegel and entered into a verbal contract in that established the terms of siegel participation in the marketing program.the court also found,as siegel had argued,that no written contract memorialized siegel participation in the program or the obligations associated with it,and that siegel did not anticipate doing any futures trading,nor did he ever enter into an oral agreement authorizing to perform futures trading on his behalf.the bottom line was that siegel never agreed,verbally or in writing,to allow to trade futures on his behalf.it also concluded that siegel had offset payment on the ccc loan by delivering grain as collateral,and so it ruled against wells fargo on that claim as well.
on appeal,wells fargo has tried to reargue the facts,recognizing that it must show that the district court committed clear error.see fed.civ.a.as we have often commented,this is a heavy burden,given the deference we owe to the district court credibility findings and assessment of the relative weight of the evidence.
we first address the claim pertaining to siegel account.the district court concluded that wells fargo has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a written or oral agreement formed between siegel and that authorized to trade futures or options on siegel behalf.the court noted that the bank witnesse
