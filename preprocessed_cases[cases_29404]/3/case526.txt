on may,gary thompson,the plaintiff below and the appellee here,operated a year old reinco,manufactured hydroseeder.an upright pipe on the hydroseeder broke during the operation causing a slurry of water,mulch,and seed to exit the pipe rapidly.the break caused thompson to fall to the ground eleven feet below and suffer serious injury.thompson brought suit alleging that reinco negligently designed and manufactured the hydroseeder.the case went to a trial before a jury.in response to a question on a special verdict form,the jury found that reinco did not act negligently in any respect.
thompson filed a motion for a new trial claiming,among other things,that the trial judge end of trial ruling removing thompson alleged comparative negligence from the jury consideration was inadequate to avoid jury confusion over the role of comparative negligence in the case.the trial judge agreed and granted thompson motion for a new trial.
reinco appeals that decision.because the record supports the jury finding that reinco was not negligent in the first instance and does not support a finding that the jury verdict was clearly the result of confusion,we find that the trial judge abused her discretion by granting a new trial.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the superior court and remand with instructions to reinstate the original jury verdict and to enter judgment for reinco.
martom landscaping employed thompson.martom owned a hydroseeder that reinco manufactured in.this hydroseeder mixed water,mulch,and seed in a gallon tank until it formed a slurry.to apply the slurry to an area,an individual stood on the hydroseeder platform,or operating deck,and used a spray nozzle.the spray nozzle was attached to an upright pipe on the operating deck that moved the slurry from the gallon tank.the upright pipe on the operating deck was schedule pipe made of carbon steel.
on may,thompson operated the hydroseeder.thompson was working with william wilson,mark thompson and howard mahan.while thompson was standing on the operating deck the upright pipe on the operating deck broke,causing the slurry to rapidly flow out of the pipe.the slurry rushed out of the broken pipe,went thirty feet in the air,and caused thompson to fall to the ground eleven feet below.thompson suffered permanent impairment to both of his feet as a result of the fall.thompson brought suit against reinco for negligently designing and manufacturing the hydroseeder and the case went to a trial before a jury.
procedural history 
at trial,the primary issue relevant to this appeal was whether the upright pipe broke because of reinco negligent manufacture or design.thompson expert,colberg,testified,among other things,that reinco negligently designed the hydroseeder by using schedule carbon steel for the upright pipe rather than stainless steel reinco expert,clauser,testified that there were several downsides to using stainless steel and that reinco did not negligently design the hydroseeder by using carbon steel for the upright pipe because the engineering turned out to be a fail safe part,a part that would leak before it would break and tell you that it was wearing out.
as a part of its defense,in addition to simply denying that it acted negligently in any way,reinco wanted the jury to infer that thompson himself acted negligently because he fell while carelessly removing a clog in the upright pipe.reinco wanted to develop this theory based on coworker wilson deposition testimony that thompson was on the operating deck removing a clog immediately before the accident.reinco counsel attempted to inject the clog issue into the trial during his crossexamination of coworker mahan.counsel asked mahan,would you get clogs in the area of the tower that is shown in exhibit thompson counsel objected,claiming that clogs were not an issue in the case because both thompson and reinco experts agreed that the mere existence of a clog would not have caused the pipe to break.reinco counsel explained that he was not offering the evidence to show that the clog itself caused the pipe to break,rather,he wanted to suggest that thompson slipped when he removed the clog and grabbed onto the upright pipe to catch his fall,causing the pipe to break 
the trial judge,hesitant to allow mahan to be questioned about clogs,stated 
here is the problem,counsel,without knowing all the facts through all the testimony,because obviously they have come in,it is difficult for me to decide the analysis in a vacuum.i concerned for potential for confusion with the jury and i concerned about the prejudicial nature of this testimony,because it is the only thing that injects clogs into the case.i do draw the inference and i do believe it would be fair to the jury to draw the inference that a clog in the hose existed because there has been no expert testimony on that point.i going to allow your inquiry into this area.if i get the sense that the jury is getting confused i will stop the questioning and try to craft a curative.
i will tell you that i made an error on the analysis as the rest of the testimony unfolds and expert opinions come in.i wo hesitate to rectify anything that this will cause with the jury reaching a verdict not in favor of the plaintiff.i know that this is little solace for the plaintiffs.although,it is hanging by a thread,counsel gets to question about this.it is relevant that wilson says he heard the plaintiff say it.it is not inadmissible hearsay,it is unfortunate that wilson is subject to vigorous on this issue.i have a lot of reservation about it coming in,but at this point,based on what i know so far it would be error not to.so i going to give you a leash.i do not want any suggestion,no matter how subtle,from the defense that somehow you are going to be able to prove that the clog caused what transpired here.there is no testimony to support that here.the only relevance of the clog is to explain your theory of why he was up there and why he caused this accident.
reinco counsel then continued to question mahan.mahan acknowledged that he had experienced clogs and that when that happened he would clear the clog by removing the nozzle and placing a metal rod into the pipe 
later in the trial,the trial judge again returned to the issue raised by the specter of the clog.on crossexamination,reinco counsel asked thompson the following what could you do to get rid of that jet clog thompson counsel objected,claiming that the question went beyond the scope of direct.the trial judge called counsel to side bar and stated 
this is what my concern is,you are injecting,repeatedly,references to clogs.and my idea of limiting the evidence to allow you to say what wilson said the plaintiff told him did not mean to open the door to sending the jury off wondering if there is a clog.i sitting here listening to the repeated references to clogs and i worried sick that the jury is focusing on that.and the only relevance is,as you initially proffered,that puts him on top of the truck.i think prejudicial value is getting greater and greater.i want you to stick to what wilson said and not hypothetical situations.
the trial judge again did not find it necessary to give a cautionary or limiting instruction,nor did thompson counsel ask for one.reinco counsel did not ask thompson any further questions about clogs.
at the close of the evidence,thompson moved for a directed verdict on the issue of thompson comparative negligence.the trial judge granted thompson motion and declined to charge the jury on comparative negligence with respect to the plaintiff.
when instructing the jury,the trial judge properly defined negligence and clearly explained that thompson alleged comparative negligence was no longer an issue in the case.the trial judge then sent the jury to deliberate and gave the jury a special verdict form with the following questions do you find that the defendant reinco,was negligent,do you find that martom was negligent and the martom negligence was a superseding cause of plaintiff injuries,do you find that reinco,was negligent in a manner proximately causing plaintiff injuries,state the full amount of your award of damages to the plaintiff,gary thompson.the jury answered the first question no.that response obviated the need to answer the remaining questions.
after the jury january,finding that reinco did not negligently design or manufacture the hydroseeder,thompson counsel sent a letter to the trial judge requesting permission to exceed the normal four page limit for a motion for a new trial.the trial judge granted the extension and also stated,please specifically address inter alia the issue of whether plaintiff comparative negligence which was later dismissed by the court confused the jury.on february,thompson filed his motion for a new trial.the trial judge granted thompson motion in a letter opinion 
i have reviewed the plaintiff motion for a new trial and the defendant opposition thereto.i recall the trial of this case very well.i had a concern when the jury returned its verdict,and i have a greater concern now,that the jury was confused by the court ruling after all the evidence was submitted that as a matter of law plaintiff was not comparatively negligent.i am convinced that a new trial is warranted.
my initial concern was heightened after reviewing the instruction on misuse and superceding cause and the testimony of wilson and mahan over plaintiff repeated objections about clogs and the procedure for removing clogs.the court has serious reservations that the mere mention of clogs may have convinced the jury,without adequate factual basis,that the plaintiff may have been attempting to clear a clog from the pipe when it fractured,or thereby caused it to fracture.
given the mechanics of trial,the court was required to issue multiple rulings with respect to different witnesses at various points throughout the trial on the clog issue and this,coupled with the inherent unpredictability of witness testimony despite counsel best efforts to prepare their witnesses and the court efforts to limit their testimony to only admissible evidence,resulted on more than one occasion in irrelevant and prejudicial testimony about clogs being presented to the jury.the court believes this testimony created an improper inference of comparative negligence in the jury mind.
the court is also concerned that the testimony offered by clauser about the replaced deck and the condition of the supply pipe which he never examined caught the plaintiffs by surprise because it was not part of his original expert opinion,and was highly prejudicial,not very probative,and very confusing.
in light of the confusion caused by the introduction of evidence on comparative negligence,the court multiple rulings during trial on the issue of clogs and the resultant prejudicial piecemeal testimony regarding the same,and clauser testimony,this court is convinced that it must grant a new trial to prevent injustice.see mccloskey mckelvey.plaintiff motion for a new trial is therefore granted 
on april,reinco filed a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal challenging the trial judge ruling granting thompson motion for a new trial.the trial judge entered an order certifying the interlocutory appeal,which we accepted on may.
reinco contends that the trial judge erred by granting thompson motion for a new trial.thompson relies on the last paragraph of the trial judge letter opinion to contend that the trial judge gave three valid reasons justifying her decision to grant a mistrial testimony suggesting that thompson acted negligently confused the jury irrelevant and prejudicial testimony on the clog issue and the resultant piecemeal testimony about the clog confused the jury and clauser testimony confused the jury.
reading the letter opinion in its entirety,we find that reasons and are essentially the same because the only evidence cited in the trial judge opinion arguably supporting a comparative negligence claim is the inference from wilson testimony that while attempting to remove a clog,thompson must have slipped,grabbed the upright pipe,and caused it to break the trial judge apparently assumed the jury disregarded her instruction that any contention that thompson acted negligently was out of the case.interestingly,the trial judge opinion does not address the significance of the jury rejection of the threshold question specifically directed to them concerning reinco negligence,a necessary predicate to consideration of thompson comparative negligence.
we review a trial judge decision granting a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion thus,our inquiry becomes whether the trial judge abused her discretion when she granted thompson motion for a new trial on the basis that the jury verdict resulted from confusion about whether there was a clog,whether the clog caused the pipe to break,the sludge to emit and thompson to slip and fall,and the relevance of those alleged facts to thompson alleged negligence and clauser testimony about the condition of the replacement deck and the supply pipe 
the standard for granting a new trial is well settled.a new trial is warranted only if the jury verdict is clearly the result of passion,prejudice,partiality,corruption,or confusion,or the evidence preponderates so heavily against the jury verdict that a reasonable jury could not have reached the result.
a.the facts do support the jury verdict 
we preface our discussion by noting that the evidence supported the jury verdict here,and historically,the trial judge inherent power to grant a new trial has been tempered by the deference given to a jury findings as required by the delaware constitution little evidence supported reinco alleged negligent design and manufacture.that issue essentially focused on which expert was more credible.the experts respective testimony could have convinced a reasonable juror that clauser was more qualified than colberg to address the factual issues related to negligent manufacture and design.clauser was a metallurgical engineer who had extensive experience designing large industrial type machines colberg,was in contrast,a mechanical engineer with no experience in designing large industrial machines.moreover,colberg did not have clauser extensive experience with the metallurgical issues that arise when stainless steel was used for only portions of large industrial machines given the credentials of the parties respective experts,the jury could have chosen to accept clauser opinion that the schedule carbon steel pipe was a fail safe product that required no warnings because it would leak before breaking completely and to reject colberg opinions.thus,there is credible testimony supporting the jury finding that reinco did not negligently design or manufacture the hydroseeder.
introduction of evidence of a clog,a broken pipe and thompson comparative negligence 
we find that the trial judge abused her discretion by granting thompson motion for a new trial on the ground that merely hearing wilson evidence that suggested that thompson tried to remove a clog,slipped,and broke the pipe by grabbing it would have necessarily confused the jury.the record simply does not support her conclusion that the jury verdict clearly resulted from confusion.the trial judge evident belief that the jury confused the mere presence of a clog with the pipe breaking resulting in thompson fall is speculation.the jury never gave any indication that it was confused.the jury never sent a note to the trial judge.it neither rendered an inconsistent verdict,nor rendered a verdict against the great weight of the evidence.the record suggests no basis to conclude that the jury ignored the judge instruction that thompson was not negligent as a matter of law.in fact,the jury response to the special verdict form removed the predicate for them to even consider thompson alleged comparative negligence.
thompson suggests that the trial judge was in the best position to observe the demeanor of the jury and that her statements throughout the trial about the clog evidence indicated that she considered the clog testimony to be confusing to the jury.thompson ignores the fact that the trial judge stated early on that,if i get the sense that the jury is getting confused i will stop the questioning and try to craft a curative.even though the trial judge
