the primary issue in this case is whether the state,through the department of agriculture and consumer services department,is acting within permissible constitutional boundaries by destroying privately owned citrus trees that are within feet of a tree infected with citrus canker,even though the destroyed trees show no outward signs of infection and appear healthy.to resolve this issue,we must address the constitutionality of section,florida statutes citrus canker law,which contains the statutory authority for the department to destroy privately owned citrus trees under its citrus canker eradication program for the reasons expressed in this opinion,we hold that the citrus canker law is constitutional.
the fourth district court of appeal expressly declared the citrus canker law constitutional,concluding that the statute did not deny either substantive or procedural due process as guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and article i,section of the florida constitution.see.dep t of agric.consumer servs.haire,so d,dca.the fourth district further concluded that section,florida statutes,which authorizes search warrants,was unconstitutional under the fourth amendment to the united states constitution and article,section of the florida constitution.see so d at.however,the fourth district determined that there was no fourth amendment violation in the inclusion of multiple properties in a single affidavit and search warrant,and in the magistrate use of an electronic signature.see id.
although the state does not appeal the determination that section is unconstitutional,the petitioners,who own citrus trees that have been destroyed or are targeted for destruction,contend that the citrus canker law is unconstitutional because it allows for the destruction of private property without full and just compensation and fails to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard prior to removal of the citrus trees.the petitioners also challenge the fourth district holding that it is permissible under the fourth amendment for a magistrate to issue a single search warrant for multiple properties and use an electronic signature.
citrus canker history to date 
citrus canker is a disease that is caused by citrus canker bacteria,which attack the fruits,leaves and stems of citrus plants.the bacteria are spread from tree to tree primarily by rain or the contamination of equipment or plant material.although the fruit of an infected tree remains edible,the disease causes defoliation,fruit drop and loss of yield,as well as blemishes on the fruit and a loss of quality.in severe cases,citrus canker can cause girdling of the stems and death of the tree.
efforts to eradicate citrus canker date from its discovery in 
citrus canker was discovered in florida in and eradication programs continued through the mid.in the mid,an asian strain of citrus canker,xanthomonas axonopodis,the strain of citrus canker at issue in this case,was discovered in manatee county.it was considered eradicated in and the eradication program halted in.however,in an outbreak was discovered around the miami international airport.
stem lesions can survive for many years and are capable of producing bacterial inoculum eight to ten years later.although symptoms of citrus canker may be seen seven to fourteen days after infection,the maximum visualization does not occur until approximately to days after infection.this makes it difficult to control a disease which easily spreads through rain or contamination of equipment or plant material.
haire,so d at quoting.dep t of agric.consumer servs.city of pompano beach,so d,dca.the department has assessed the effect of citrus canker on florida citrus industry,concluding that 
citrus canker would have an immediate impact on the fresh citrus industry which comprises percent of the commercial citrus industry,amounting to two billion dollars in losses if not eradicated.if it continues to spread,a federal quarantine could be placed on the state.the quarantine would effectively shut down the distribution of fresh citrus products to other states or internationally.
id.at quoting city of pompano beach,so d at.
for a period of time,the citrus canker eradication program called for destruction of citrus trees within a radius of an infected tree.as explained by the fourth district in its decision below,the department later determined that this distance was not effective at stopping the spread of citrus canker 
the foot radius was adopted in the as a result of a study conducted in argentina.however,that study did not take into account what would happen in an urban setting.
in county,the destruction of citrus trees within a foot radius of an infected tree was not reducing the occurrences of citrus canker.therefore,the department decided to initiate a study the gottwald study that would measure the distances that citrus canker,asian strain,would spread in south florida.
the gottwald study kept track of over trees in four sites and determined the distance between the diseased trees and the newly infected trees.the study showed that the eradication program which used the foot radius was inadequate because it only captured about thirty to percent of infection that spread from a diseased tree.
the results of the gottwald study were presented at a meeting in orlando attended by approximately twenty individuals and scientists.those at the meeting examined the findings.after considering a range of distances between diseased trees and newly infected trees at the various sites,those present determined that in order to destroy percent of newly infected trees,it was necessary to destroy trees within a foot radius of a diseased tree,thereby creating a buffer zone which would prevent citrus canker from spreading any further.
in march,the citrus canker technical advisory task force,a body of regulatory individuals,scientists and citrus industry representatives who deal with the issue of citrus canker,unanimously recommended that the department adopt a policy to destroy trees within a foot radius of a diseased tree in order to eradicate citrus canker.
id.quoting city of pompano beach,so d at alterations in original footnote added.the department adopted the task force recommendation,which was soon the subject of a legal challenge.the procedural history of the challenge to the administrative rule is set forth in the fourth district opinion.see id.at.however,it is the constitutionality of the subsequently passed statute,which also adopted the radius,which is the focus of this case.
ii.citrus canker law 
during the legislative session,section was amended to require the department to remove and destroy all citrus trees infected with the citrus canker bacteria and all citrus trees exposed to infection.see,laws of codified at.stat.the legislature defined infected trees as those harboring the citrus canker bacteria and exhibiting visible symptoms of the disease.a.stat.citrus trees that are e xposed to infection are those located within feet of an infected tree.b 
in order to carry out the destruction of infected and exposed trees the department is authorized to provide notice to property owners of the removal of such trees by immediate final order ifo.see a.the ifo serves as notice to the property owner that the subject citrus trees will be removed and destroyed unless the property owner requests and obtains a stay from the appropriate district court of appeal no later than ten days after delivery of the ifo.see id.
with respect to compensation,section,florida statutes,titled citrus canker eradication compensation to homeowners whose trees have been removed,provides in pertinent part 
the department of agriculture and consumer services shall provide compensation to eligible homeowners whose citrus trees have been removed under a citrus canker eradication program.funds to pay this compensation may be derived from both state and federal matching sources and shall be specifically appropriated by law.eligible homeowners shall be compensated subject to the availability of appropriated funds.
the amount of compensation for each tree removed from residential property by the citrus canker eradication program shall be per tree.if the homeowner property is eligible for a shade dade or a shade florida card,the homeowner may not receive compensation under this section for the first citrus tree removed from the property as part of a citrus canker eradication program.
the specification of a amount paid for the residential citrus canker compensation program does not limit the amount of any other compensation that may be paid by another entity or pursuant to court order for the removal of citrus trees as part of a citrus canker eradication program.
for the fiscal year only,and notwithstanding the amount specified in subsection,the amount of compensation for each tree removed from residential property by the citrus canker eradication program shall be.this subsection expires july.
emphasis supplied.
section thus specifies that eligible homeowners receive or for each destroyed tree,depending on when the trees were destroyed,see,and subject to the availability of appropriated funds.however,if the homeowner property is eligible for a shade dade or a shade florida card the homeowner may not receive compensation for the first citrus tree removed from the property as part of the eradication program.see emphasis supplied.lastly,subsection of section states that the amount paid under this compensation program does not limit the amount of any other compensation that may be paid by another entity or pursuant to court order.emphasis supplied.
the petitioners argue that the fourth district erred in concluding that the citrus canker law does not deny either substantive or procedural due process.we address each of these issues separately below.
substantive due process 
in both the federal and florida constitutions there are two separate constitutional provisions that protect an individual property provisions that prohibit the taking of private property for public use without just compensation,see const.amend.v art.x.const and those provisions that prohibit the deprivation of life,liberty or property without due process of law.see const.amends.v,xiv,art.i.const a citizen right to due process of law encompasses both procedural and substantive due process.see state,so d.substantive due process protects the full panoply of individual rights from unwarranted encroachment by the government.dep t of law enforcement real property,so d.
the due process clauses involve what is commonly referred to as the state police power,while the compensation clauses concern the state power of eminent domain.see county expressway auth,so d.in joint ventures,department of transportation,so d,we explained the difference between eminent domain and the police power 
under the power of eminent domain,the state has the inherent right to take private property for public use without the consent of the owner.shavers duval county,so d.in so doing,the state is obliged to make full compensation.indeed,the florida legislature has implemented a complete statutory scheme in chapters and,florida statutes,to assure the payment of such compensation.
however,as justice holmes recognized,the seemingly absolute protection of required compensation is qualified by another inherent power of the state,the police power.pennsylvania coal mahon.although both powers impact on private property,there is a distinction between the power of eminent domain and the police power 
t he former involves the taking of property because of its need for the public use while the latter involves the regulation of such property to prevent its use thereof in a manner that is detrimental to the public interest.
sackman,nichols the law of eminent domain,at to ed footnotes omitted,emphasis in original.
id.at footnote and parallel citations omitted.regardless of whether the property is taken for public use under the power of eminent domain or is destroyed under the police power because it is deemed detrimental to the public interest,the end result for the property owner is a deprivation of his or her private property.
this case involves the destruction of private property under the state police power,which implicates substantive due process concerns.as they did below,the parties first dispute the appropriate standard of review to be applied in deciding whether the amendment to section denies substantive due process.the petitioners assert that because the citrus canker law infringes on fundamental property rights it can be upheld under this court decision in corneal state plant board,so d,only if the threat is imminently dangerous and the destruction radius is justified only within the narrowest limits of actual necessity.this standard is similar to the strict scrutiny standard of review,which requires that the state prove that the legislation furthers a compelling state interest through the least intrusive means.see chiles state employees attorneys guild,so d,see also in re forfeiture of piper navajo,so d,indicating that a forfeiture statute must be narrowly tailored to achieve the state objective through the least intrusive means.in a strict scrutiny analysis,legislative conclusions are not taken at face value and do not obviate the need for judicial scrutiny.chiles,so d at quoting chiles state employees atty guild,so d,dca.
the department,on the other hand,contends that because the citrus canker law is a valid exercise of the state police power to protect the health,welfare,and safety of the public,all that is required is that the law not be arbitrary or capricious,and the court need only determine that the law bears a reasonable and substantial relationship to the purpose sought to be attained.under this standard of review,referred to as either the reasonable relationship or the rational basis test,a state statute must be upheld if there is any reasonable relationship between the act and the furtherance of a valid governmental objective.lane chiles,so d,emphasis supplied.specifically,with respect to substantive due process,a statute is valid if it bears a rational relation to a legitimate legislative purpose in safeguarding the public health,safety,or general welfare and is not discriminatory,arbitrary,or oppressive.chicago title ins.butler,so d.in applying this standard of review,a court must remain cognizant of the legislature broad range of discretion in its choice of means and methods by which it will enhance the public good and welfare.horsemen benevolent protective ass div.of wagering,so d,see also eastern air lines,dep t of revenue,so d,under the rational basis test t he burden is on the one attacking the legislative enactment to negate every conceivable basis which might support it.
because the fourth district concluded that the citrus canker law is a valid exercise of the state police power and provides for compensation for the destruction of trees having value,the court determined that the reasonable relationship test applied.see haire,so d at.we agree with this determination.
broadly speaking,the police power allows the state to adopt statutory regulations for the protection of the health,safety,morals and general welfare of the public.see graham estuary,so d,state plant bd.smith,so d.regarding this case,there is no question that the protection of the citrus industry is a legitimate objective for the use of the state police power.see dep t of agric.consumer servs.growers,so d,department order requiring the destruction of healthy but suspect citrus trees was a valid exercise of police power state dep t of citrus,so d,police power based regulations of florida citrus industry have been upheld in many cases.johnson state,so,it is within the state police power to protect the citrus industry,which directly or indirectly affects the welfare of a great portion of the population of the state.in fact,the petitioners do not dispute that the state has broad latitude to use its police powers to protect the citrus industry.further,although the petitioners challenge the legislature characterization of the emergency nature of citrus canker effect on the citrus industry the trial court made no findings of fact contrary to the legislature findings in this regard.thus,we find no basis for concluding that the eradication of citrus canker is not a legitimate use of the state police power.
with respect to the issue of the appropriate standard of review,we have held that a ll property rights are held subject to the fair exercise of the police power,golden mccarty,so d,emphasis supplied and have used the reasonable relationship test,which the state asserts is applicable in this case,to evaluate statutes and regulations that infringe on property rights however,we have also recognized that the absolute destruction of property is an extreme exercise of the police power and is justified only within the narrowest limits of actual necessity,unless the state chooses to pay compensation.corneal,so d at emphasis supplied.we have explained that 
w here property is destroyed in order to save property of greater value,a provision for indemnity is a plain dictate of justice and of the principle of equality,and that statutory regulation of the power to destroy property in this situation is always accompanied by statutory duty of compensation.
id.quoting ernst freund,the police power public policy and constitutional rights,at alteration in original.
in corneal,this court specifically addressed the state destruction of healthy citrus trees as a means of controlling the spread of a citrus disease known as spreading decline.see id.at.the rule adopted by the state plant board to control the disease required the removal and burning of both infected and uninfected trees within a certain distance from infected trees.see id.at.the court cited domestic animals infected with a contagious disease and a burning building as examples of circumstances that justify the destruction of property without compensation.see id.at.distinguishing those situations,the court held that because the burrowing nematode,which causes spreading decline,offers no immediate menace to the trees in a neighboring grove and the healthy citrus trees were not imminently dangerous,the regulation requiring the destruction of healthy trees without compensation exceeded the scope of the state police powers.id.at.
under corneal,in order for the legislature to enact a valid statute pursuant to its police power that results in a total destruction of property without compensation,the statute must be justified by the narrowest limits of actual necessity and the threat must be imminently dangerous.however,as explained by the fourth district 
w here compensation is given,the statute need only pass the reasonable relationship test.indeed,if it were otherwise,then all condemnation proceedings would be governed by the narrow tailoring standard,which is not the case.see,canal auth.miller,so d,noting reasonable necessity,not absolute necessity,is the standard for eminent domain.the cases requiring narrow tailoring,including in re forfeiture,involve forfeitures of property without compensation for the takings.the requirement of just compensation for a taking substitutes one form of property,tangible property,for another,money.a forfeiture,on the other hand,results in an actual loss of all property to the owner.
haire,so d at.
the petitioners claim that corneal strict standard of review applies to the citrus canker law because the statute does not obligate the state to pay just and full compensation,even though section requires the department to provide compensation to eligible homeowners whose citrus trees have been removed under a citrus canker eradication program.the petitioners contend that the compensation provided for in section is inadequate to bring the statute within the ambit of the deferential reasonable relationship test because it represents only token compensation rather than full and just compensation,and because it is subject to legislative appropriations.
the petitioners specifically point to the statutes at issue in state plant board smith,so d,and department of agriculture consumer services bonanno,so d,as compensation statutes that meet the requirements of corneal.in smith,this court reviewed an act adopted by the legislature in response to corneal,which provided for the payment of compensation for the destruction of uninfected trees,not to exceed per acre.smith,so d at.although the court held that the legislature could not fix the maximum amount of compensation and found that portion of the statute invalid,see id.at,the court further held that the remainder of the statute met the requirements of just compensation because it required the plant board to pay just and fair compensation to citrus growers who had their trees removed.see id.at.
bonanno involved a challenge to an administrative presumptive compensation schedule adopted by the legislature to compensate owners whose trees were destroyed as a result of the citrus canker eradication program.see so d at.in upholding the statute,this court reasoned,in part,that the statute set a floor on the value of destroyed plants,which the owner could rebut with evidence showing that in a particular case those values would not provide just compensation.see id.at.
in this case,we conclude that under the statutory scheme the state is obligated to provide more than token compensation if the state has destroyed a healthy,albeit exposed tree section expressly states that the specified amount does not limit the amount of any other compensation that may be paid pursuant to court order for the removal of citrus trees as part of a citrus canker eradication program.emphasis supplied.thus,the citrus canker law sets a compensation floor that is consistent with the established principle that the determination of what is just compensation is a judicial function that can not be performed by the legislature.smith,so d at quoting spafford brevard county,so.
in accord with our precedent,we conclude that the schedule established by the legislature sets a floor but does not determine the amount of compensation.when the state destroys private property,the state is obligated to pay just and fair compensation as determined in a court of law.we emphasize that the fact that the legislature has determined that all citrus trees within feet of an infected tree must be destroyed does not necessarily support a finding that healthy,but exposed,residential citrus trees have no value 
moreover,the statement in section that compensation is subject to the availability of appropriated funds does not relieve the state from its responsibility to provide full and just compensation.the state conceded this point during oral argument,observing that this is nothing more than a reiteration of the language in section,florida statutes,which expressly provides that n either the state nor any of its agencies shall pay or be required to pay monetary damages under the judgment of any court except pursuant to an appropriation made by law.we agree that this proviso is not a limit on the state obligation to pay compensation for the destruction of exposed citrus trees.
with this important clarification of the challenged statute,we conclude that the fourth district properly applied the reasonable relationship test.we next consider whether the fourth district correctly concluded that the citrus canker law did not violate substantive due process because it was neither arbitrary nor capricious and bears a reasonable relationship to the goal of canker eradication.haire,so d at.
in holding section unconstitutional the trial court focused not only on the perceived lack of compensation for the removal of healthy trees but also on its finding that the science underlying the gottwald study is unsound and,therefore,not an acceptable basis for the legislature to enact the removal radius.see id.at.in reversing the trial court,the fourth district concluded that the trial court erred in rejecting the legislative choice based on its own view of the scientific evidence and improperly substituted its judgment for that of the legislature,which determined that the eradication zone was justified by the best available science.see id.at the trial court erred in rejecting the legislative choice based upon the court own view of the scientific evidence presented.we agree.
the legislature had before it a published scientific study that concluded that a removal radius was required to successfully eradicate citrus canker.the fact that the legislature did not subject the gottwald report to an adversarial trial or the requirements of courtroom admissibility under the test does not make the legislature action in adopting the removal radius arbitrary or capricious,or not reasonably related to the goal of citrus canker eradication.in addition,the fact that the trial court heard testimony during a hearing,whereas the legislature did not,is not a significant consideration under rational basis review.that there was conflicting evidence presented to the trial court regarding the appropriateness of gottwald methods indicates that the issue of whether to adopt gottwald conclusions was a matter of debate for the legislature as judge warner explained in her opinion in this case 
l egislatures are not limited to acting only where there is scientific certainty.see johnson city of cincinnati,cir citing ginsberg new york,d.to make scientific precision a criterion of constitutional power would be to subject the state to an intolerable supervision hostile to the basic principles of our government sproles binford.here,the legislature had before it the advice of the technical advisory board,which reviewed the study,along with the state practical experience in fighting citrus canker for nearly twenty years.the study it relied upon was peer reviewed and published,two strong indicators of general acceptance in the scientific community.when the subject lies within the police power of the state,debatable questions as to reasonableness are not for the courts but for the legislature,which is entitled to form its own judgment id.at.see also gandy borras,so.the trial court believed the legislature should have subjected the study to adversarial testing,as in a trial.however,under a rational basis test,a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom beach communications,d.
haire,so d at parallel citations omitted.
whether the best means of eradicating citrus canker have been chosen by the legislature is a question directed more towards the wisdom of the legislation than to its asserted rationality.see,so d at.although such an inquiry is appropriate under the strict scrutiny standard of review,which requires that the legislative conclusions be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny,it is an inappropriate judicial inquiry under the rational basis standard of review.even the petitioners conceded at oral argument that under rational basis review it was within the legislature discretion to adopt the removal radius based on the gottwald report.as judge warner concluded 
t he legislature action was amply supported by the scientific studies and florida practical experience with citrus canker.the legislature followed the recommendations of the scientific community to eradicate the disease.destruction of exposed trees and those within the area where the disease is likely to spread is neither arbitrary nor capricious and bears a reasonable relationship to the goal of canker eradication.the trial court erred in rejecting the legislative choice based upon the court own view of the scientific evidence presented.
haire,so d at citation omitted.we agree with this determination and for all the reasons discussed above conclude that the citrus canker law withstands the substantive due process challenge.
procedural due process 
procedural due process serves as a vehicle to ensure fair treatment through proper administration of justice where substantive rights are at issue,dep t of law enforcement,so d at,and requires both fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.see keys citizens for responsible gov t.keys aqueduct,so d.the petitioners do not assert that section provides for inadequate notice of the intended removal of exposed trees,but contend that the lack of a hearing denies tree owners a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the propriety of the department removal order.
in smith,this court addressed the summary destruction of citrus trees pursuant to the state pull and treat program implemented for containing and eradicating spreading decline disease,and held that absent an imminent danger of the spread of the disease,summary destruction of both infected and uninfected trees was a violation of procedural due process.see so d at.in concluding that no imminent danger of spread existed with respect to spreading decline,the court relied on the facts developed in corneal that showed that the burrowing nematode that caused the disease travels underground from one tree to another at an average rate throughout the state of trees,or feet,per year.id.at quoting corneal,so d at.the court expressly noted that spreading decline is not carried by the wind or by insects from grove to grove.id.emphasis supplied.
as recognized by several of the district courts of appeal,citrus canker,unlike spreading decline,has the potential to be carried great distances by wind and rain.see sapp farms.dep t of agric.consumer,so d,dca nordmann.dep t of agric.consumer,so d,dca denney conner,so d,dca.in denney,the first district,in reviewing an immediate final order issued by the department,held that the department has shown that the threat to the public interest in the citrus industry represented by citrus canker is of sufficient gravity and urgency that the effect of the immediate final order should not be further stayed.so d at.relying on denney,the fifth district held that the department could constitutionally order the destruction of suspect citrus trees by immediate final order.see nordmann,so d at.thus,this court conclusion in smith that summary proceedings were not justified to eradicate spreading decline does not apply to citrus canker.conner carlton,so d,indicating that summary eradication of a plant disease is warranted when it shows its emergent or epidemic effects campoamor state live stock sanitary,so,w hen epidemics arise or are threatened or when the common good is otherwise in hazard,summary proceedings may be authorized.
moreover,in light of our conclusion that the citrus canker law does not violate substantive due process by requiring the destruction of exposed citrus trees,the only required showing by the department prior to destruction of a particular tree is that the tree marked for removal is within feet of an infected tree.whether the department establishes this required showing is the issue to be considered by the appellate court in an appeal of the ifo,allowing homeowners to seek review of the relevant facts prior to destruction.accordingly,we approve the fourth district conclusion that the citrus canker law does not deny homeowners procedural due process.
iii.search warrant restrictions 
the petitioners also seek review of the fourth district decision to quash the trial court orders restricting the department application for search warrants.these restrictions require that the department submit a single application and obtain a single warrant for each piece of property to be searched,and prohibit the warrants from being signed by the magistrate by electronic signature.the fourth district held that it is within the magistrate discretion to decide both whether to issue multiple warrants or a single warrant to search multiple properties based on a single application,and whether to use an electronic signature.see haire,so d at.we review each of these issues in turn.
single warrant for multiple properties 
chapter,florida statutes,provides for the issuance of a warrant upon proper affidavits which provide probable cause for the search and particularly describe the place to be searched.see.stat.as noted by the fourth district,there is nothing in chapter that indicates that if a single affidavit meets these requirements with respect to multiple properties,multiple warrants could not be issued based on a single application and affidavit.see haire,so d at.
further,we reject the petitioners argument that because search warrant statutes are to be strictly construed,see,morris state,so d,dca,chapter must expressly authorize the issuance of multiple warrants based on a single affidavit in order for a magistrate to have the
