plaintiff kenneth buckingham filed a complaint in the district of nevada against the secretary of the united states department of agriculture,the chief of the united states forest service,the regional forester for the intermountain region,the forest supervisor for the national forest,and the district ranger for the santa rosa ranger district collectively,the forest service.buckingham sought judicial review,pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,of the forest service decision to cancel his permit to graze cattle in the santa rosa ranger district of the national forest,claiming,inter alia,that the forest service erroneously enforced a permit lacking clearly defined pasture boundaries violated buckingham fifth amendment procedural due process rights by not affording him adequate pre or procedures failed to give him notice and an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance as required by the apa,c and improperly considered buckingham prior history of with his permit in making its decision.the district court upheld the forest service decision,and this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction to review this decision under,and we affirm.
background 
legal background 
the forest service manages national forests,national grasslands,and land utilization projects on over million acres of land within the united states collectively,the national forest system.the forest service administers the national forest system under the national forest management act of nfma,which establishes a process for forest planning,native ecosystems council forest,cir.first,the forest service develops a land and resource management plan forest plan for each unit of the national forest system.id.citing a.second,the forest service implements each forest plan by approving or disapproving actions.id.
the forest service authorizes grazing within the national forest system on allotments pursuant to the federal land policy and management act of flpma.allotments are designated area s of land available for livestock grazing.b.the forest service divides allotments into smaller areas,referred to as units or pastures.or.natural desert ass forest serv.onda,cir.
the forest service exercises its authority under the flpma to permit grazing on allotments by way of three different types of actions,see onda,at,all of which must be consistent with the applicable forest plan,see i.first,the forest service issues grazing permits,which are document s authorizing livestock to use national forest system or other lands under forest service control for the purpose of livestock production.b see also p,a.typically,a grazing permit will specify the number,kind,and class of livestock,the allotment to be grazed,and the period of use.onda,at.the standard term of a grazing permit is ten years.see b c.the forest service is authorized to cancel,modify,or suspend grazing and livestock use permits in whole or in part if the permittee fails to comply with the requirements of his or her permit,or with governing regulations.id.a.
second,the forest service develops an allotment management plan amp,which is a document that specifies the program of action designated to reach a given set of objectives as to a specific allotment,including the manner in and extent to which livestock operations will be conducted in order to meet the,sustained yield,economic,and other needs and objectives as determined for the lands,involved.id.b see also natural res.def.council,hodel,characterizing an amp as the penultimate step in the multiple use planning process and as basically land use plans tailored to specific grazing permits quoting george coggins,the law of public rangeland management iv flpma,pria,and the multiple use mandate,envtl.the forest service incorporates the amp into the applicable grazing permit unless it has not prepared an amp or it determines that an amp is unnecessary,in which case it includes in the permit itself such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate for management of the permitted or leased lands.u.e.
third,the forest service develops and issues annual operating plans aops or instructions aois.whereas the amp relates the directives of the applicable f orest p lan to the individual grazing allotment the aoi annually conveys these more directives into instructions to the permittee for annual operations.onda,at.because an aoi is issued annually,it is responsive to conditions that the forest service could not or may not have anticipated and planned for in the amp or grazing permit id.at.the forest service typically incorporates the aop or aoi,like an amp,into the grazing permit,which then governs the permit holder grazing operations for the next year.id.at.
ii.factual and procedural background 
buckingham resides in paradise valley,nevada,and owns and operates a livestock operation located within the national forest.in,the forest service issued buckingham a grazing permit for land in the buttermilk allotment of the national forest santa rosa ranger district.the forest service attached a map of the buttermilk allotment to the permit,reflecting the allotment boundaries and those of its various pastures.from through,the forest service issued an aop annually,specifying the pastures buckingham could use within the buttermilk allotment,spring city,buttermilk,black ridge,lye creek,buttermilk meadows,the number of animals permitted in those pastures,and the dates of use for those pastures.the forest service expressly incorporated each aop into buckingham applicable grazing permit.
buckingham renewed his grazing permit in and.the permit included a map showing the relevant boundaries for the buttermilk allotment,but the permit did not.nevertheless,the forest service issued an aop or aoi annually from through,identifying the specific pastures where buckingham was authorized to graze his livestock and describing the uses he was authorized to make of those pastures.some of the aois or aops,which the forest service expressly incorporated into buckingham permit,contained maps of the buttermilk allotment.
beginning in january,buckingham commenced what became a persistent pattern of permit violations.between january and june,the forest service issued at least seven notices of to buckingham because he had grazed his cattle in rested pastures.in addition to those notices of,the forest service twice suspended and once cancelled percent of buckingham authorized use within the buttermilk allotment because he grazed his livestock in rested units and on the allotment after the authorized off date.
in june,the forest service issued a second partial cancellation of buckingham grazing rights under his grazing permit.the forest service informed buckingham that under the aoi,he was permitted to graze pairs in the spring city unit between may and june,and then to graze them in the buttermilk unit from june to august.eight days before the authorized entry date,however,the district ranger discovered pairs that belonged to buckingham grazing in the buttermilk unit,and t he forage use in the area indicate d these cattle had been in that unit for quite some time.the district ranger began his decision by noting buckingham recent and history of and the forest service initial,but unsuccessful attempts to resolve this situation with buckingham.according to the district ranger,i t was apparent to him that buckingham had little regard and made little effort to comply with the terms and conditions of his aoi and his term grazing permit.as a result,the forest service cancelled percent of buckingham authorized use under his grazing permit.the forest supervisor and regional forester affirmed the district ranger decision.
as a result of the forest service june cancellation decision,it replaced buckingham permit with a revised permit incorporating the partial cancellation.under the revised permit,the forest service authorized buckingham to graze only pairs,rather than the previously authorized pairs,during the grazing season.as with the permit,the revised permit did not include a map of the buttermilk allotment or its pastures.
in may,the forest service issued its aoi for the grazing season.the aoi designated the spring city and buttermilk units as rested units and prohibited all grazing on the buttermilk meadows unit.
on july,the forest service issued a notice of to buckingham because the district ranger had observed pairs belonging to buckingham in the buttermilk meadows unit,where grazing was prohibited.
on august,the forest service sent buckingham a decision letter regarding his permit compliance.the letter highlighted the previous notice of delivered to buckingham on july,which had required him to remove all his cattle from the buttermilk meadows unit by july.the letter then informed buckingham that the district ranger had confirmed on two separate inspections,one on august and another on august,that buckingham still had livestock grazing in the buttermilk meadows unit.as a result,the district ranger suspended percent of buckingham authorized use under the permit for three years.it also instructed him to remove all his livestock from the buttermilk meadows unit that same day.
on september,the forest service issued another notice of to buckingham.despite the july and august notices,and the related suspension,the forest service confirmed that buckingham cattle were still grazing in the buttermilk meadows unit on august and august.once again,the notice required buckingham to remove his cattle immediately.the forest service reminded buckingham that he had a repeat and ongoing problem with compliance and instructed him to undertake appropriate actions or management to prevent future violations.
buckingham failed to heed the forest service warnings.the forest service confirmed that buckingham cattle were still grazing in unauthorized areas of the buttermilk allotment,including the buttermilk meadows unit,on september,and november.consequently,on november,the forest service issued a decision cancelling buckingham grazing permit in its entirety.in addition to listing buckingham recent permit violations,the letter recounted his long history of,noting that from to,the forest service had issued him ten letters,three suspensions,and two partial cancellations.the district ranger concluded his letter as follows due to repeated with the terms and conditions of your term grazing permit,it is my decision to cancel the entire buttermilk c h term grazing permit of pairs.
the forest supervisor and the regional forester affirmed the district ranger decision.the regional forester decision constituted a final agency action.e.
buckingham promptly filed an action in the district court for the district of nevada seeking judicial review of the forest service actions.ultimately,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court ruled in favor of the forest service,holding,inter alia,that buckingham failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his claim that the permit was unenforceable for its failure to contain proper maps and boundary descriptions the agency did not violate buckingham procedural due process rights by failing to provide him with a pre or hearing the agency complied with the requirements of c before cancelling buckingham permit and the agency consideration of buckingham history of in its november cancellation decision was not arbitrary or capricious.

discussion 
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
buckingham argues that the forest service cancellation decision was arbitrary and capricious because neither the permit nor the aois included a description or map defining the location and boundaries of the buttermilk allotment pastures where he had grazing and maintenance obligations.the district court declined to reach the merits of buckingham argument,holding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on this claim.we affirm the district court decision that buckingham failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by failing to properly raise this issue before the forest service.
the apa requires plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing suit in federal court.
the purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to allow the administrative agency in question to exercise its expertise over the subject matter and to permit the agency an opportunity to correct any mistakes that may have occurred during the proceeding,thus avoiding unnecessary or premature judicial intervention into the administrative process.
united farm workers.agric.employment relations,cir.the exhaustion requirement applies to claims brought before the forest service.e.
there is no test to determine whether a party has properly exhausted a claim to the forest service the determination must be made on a basis.idaho sporting congress,rittenhouse,cir.although claimants who bring administrative appeals may try to resolve their difficulties by alerting the decision maker to the problem in general terms,rather than using precise legal formulations,claimants are still obligated to raise their problem with sufficient clarity to allow the decision maker to understand and rule on the issue raised.id.emphasis added.
buckingham contends that the district court erred by relying only upon idaho sporting congress in its exhaustion ruling.he asserts that the district court failed to account for our decision in native ecosystems council dombeck,cir,which he asserts refined and explained the standard set out in idaho sporting congress.contrary to buckingham position,native ecosystems council and idaho sporting congress,which were handed down by the same panel on the same day,did not rely upon divergent exhaustion standards or doctrines.any variation in the outcome of the exhaustion issues involved in those two decisions turned on the facts unique to those cases,not different legal standards.
in native ecosystems council,we observed that claims raised at the administrative appeal and in the federal complaint must be so similar that the district court can ascertain that the agency was on notice of,and had an opportunity to consider and decide,the same claims now raised in federal court.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.the record shows that buckingham argued to the forest service that other ranchers with their permit obligations precluded buckingham from complying with his own grazing and maintenance obligations.but that argument is not so similar to buckingham current argument,which turns solely on his permit language rather than his neighboring ranchers conduct,that the forest service would consider those two arguments to be the same claim.buckingham has otherwise failed to direct our attention to any place in the administrative record where he articulated a specific argument related to the permit allegedly vague or deficient description of pasture boundaries.
therefore,this is not a case where buckingham has framed his case in terms rather than precise legal formulations.id.at.rather,buckingham simply failed to address this argument to the forest service with sufficient clarity to allow the agency to understand and rule on the issue raised.idaho sporting congress,at.accordingly,the district court did not err in holding that buckingham failed to exhaust this argument to the forest service.
ii.procedural due process 
buckingham next contends that the forest service violated his fifth amendment right to procedural due process.the due process clause of the fifth amendment forbids the federal government from depriving persons of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.to be entitled to procedural due process,a party must show a liberty or property interest in the benefit for which protection is sought.morrissey brewer.if the party establishes that such an interest exists,a court determines what process was due and whether the party was actually afforded such process.id.at.
here,the district court held that buckingham had a protected property interest in the duration of his grazing permit.the forest service contests this position in a letter to the court dated march,arguing that no such property right exists.because we hold that the forest service complied with the requirements of due process,whether or not buckingham possessed a protected property interest in his grazing permit,we do not reach the question of the exact nature of that property interest here.
to determine whether the forest service administrative procedures leading up to the termination of buckingham grazing permit afforded him due process,we must balance the private interest that will be affected by the action,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used and the value of additional or alternative safeguards,and the government interest,including the additional costs and administrative burdens that additional procedures would entail.mathews eldridge.
whatever the exact nature of buckingham property interest in the disputed grazing permit,it is clear that buckingham livelihood depends,at least in part,upon the right to graze his livestock on national forest lands.the government also has a strong interest in managing livestock permitted to graze in the national forests in order to preserve that valuable land and its resources.cattle control is a vital aspect of protecting that governmental interest.as stated by the forest supervisor in his decision affirming the district ranger june decision,
control of cattle is the most important responsibility of any permittee.all grazing systems and resource management plans and requirements are based on the assumption that a certain permitted number of cattle are located in a certain grazing unit for a particular period of time.this is particularly true in rest units.the resource benefits of a seasons sic rest are essentially eliminated by unauthorized grazing.
with the substantial interests of both parties in mind,we next consider the fairness and reliability of the existing procedures,and the probable value,if any,of additional procedural safeguards.mathews,at.in doing so,we look to the process given buckingham in this case,as well as the process generally given someone whose grazing permit is cancelled,and evaluate the likelihood of the forest service making a mistake.see humphries county of los angeles,cir mathews,at p rocedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases,not the rare exceptions.buckingham argues that the pre and procedures afforded him by the forest service were insufficient.he contends that a n evidentiary hearing,or at minimum,the chance to confront or cross examine witnesses,would have helped assess the many comparative faults and their relationship on the allotment and their impact upon buckingham ability or lack thereof to comply.
we are not persuaded.the base requirement of the due process clause is that a person deprived of property be given an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.brewster bd.of educ.of lynwood unified sch,cir quoting armstrong manzo.nevertheless,procedural due process does not require that the notice and opportunity to be heard occur before the deprivation.parratt taylor,overruled in part on other grounds by daniels williams,u.it can take place through a combination of pre and procedures,cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,or be satisfied with process alone,brewster,at.further,d ue process does not always require an adversarial hearing,hickey morris,cir,a full evidentiary hearing,united states clifford matley family trust,cir,or a formal hearing,memphis light,gas,water div.craft,the opportunity for informal consultation with designated personnel empowered to correct a mistaken determination constitutes a due process hearing in appropriate circumstances.see also id.a hearing in its very essence,demands that he who is entitled to it shall have the right to support his allegations by argument however brief,and,if need be,by proof,however informal.quoting londoner denver,brewster,at the hearing need not even approximate a proceeding in fact,it may be very limited and still pass constitutional muster.quoting gilbert homar.nor is the opportunity to witnesses mandatory in all cases.see brock roadway express,we conclude,however,that as a general rule the employer interest is adequately protected without the right of confrontation and,again so long as the employer is otherwise provided an opportunity to respond at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.internal quotation marks omitted.at bottom,the due process evaluation is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.mathews,at quoting morrissey,at.
before the forest service finally cancelled his grazing permit,it provided buckingham with ample procedures,pre and,to ensure that he could present his side of the story.prior to the november cancellation decision,the forest service notified buckingham in writing of his permit violations on several occasions.it issued notices of to him on july,august,and september.each of those notices informed buckingham of the basis for the alleged,and specified the dates on which forest service personnel had observed his livestock in an unauthorized pasture,the name of the pasture,and how many livestock were seen.in addition,those notices provided buckingham with the name and contact information of the forest service agent to contact if he had any questions or concerns about the letters.moreover,buckingham engaged in conversations with forest service personnel during the grazing season to discuss compliance issues.thus,months before the forest service terminated his permit,the forest service gave buckingham timely notice of the charges against him,as well as the evidence supporting those charges,and afforded buckingham the opportunity to address his concerns or disagreement with the charges directly to forest service personnel.
in addition,following the cancellation,the forest service provided buckingham with two levels of administrative review of its decision.buckingham was entitled to appeal,and did appeal,to the forest supervisor in accordance with c and then to the regional forester in accordance with c.in both cases,he was entitled to present narrative evidence and argument,and a written reply to the agency response.see id.a,c.buckingham was also entitled to present oral argument at the appeal.see id.
buckingham argues that procedures such as an evidentiary hearing and were necessary here because of the many disputed facts involved in his case.nevertheless,buckingham has failed to persuasively explain why he was unable to resolve those factual issues through the ample process he was given.the record shows that buckingham,over the course of many years,was able to raise,and did raise,the same factual disputes before the forest service that he raises now on appeal.the forest service considered whether those matters excused buckingham serial,and concluded they did not.for example,in the forest supervisor april decision upholding the district ranger partial cancellation decision,the forest supervisor acknowledged buckingham proffered explanations for his,gates being left open,neighboring permittees causing the misplacement of his cattle,and determined these explana
