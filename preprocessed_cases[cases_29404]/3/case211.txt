criminal law 
the panel affirmed the defendant conviction under misprision of felony for concealing and failing to notify authorities of her business partner submission of false statements to the united states department of agriculture rural development program in connection with a federal grant application.
the panel held that,to secure a conviction under,the government must prove not only that the defendant knew the principal engaged in conduct that satisfies the essential elements of the underlying felony,but also that the defendant knew the conduct was a felony that to establish the latter,the government must prove the defendant knew the offense was punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year and that sufficient evidence supports the jury finding that the defendant here knew the principal crime was punishable by more than a year in custody.
concurring in part and concurring in the result,judge hurwitz would leave to another day,in a case in which it matters to the outcome,whether the government must prove in a prosecution that the defendant knew the underlying offense was a felony.
fisher,circuit judge 
karen olson appeals her conviction for misprision of felony under.she was convicted of concealing and failing to notify authorities of her business partner submission of false statements to the united states department of agriculture rural development program usda in connection with a federal grant application.she challenges her conviction,arguing the government failed to prove she knew the conduct she concealed constituted a felony.we address her argument in two parts.first,we agree with olson that,to secure a conviction under,the government must prove not only that the defendant knew the principal engaged in conduct that satisfies the essential elements of the underlying felony,but also that the defendant knew the conduct was a felony.see united states,c ourts ordinarily read a phrase in a criminal statute that introduces the elements of a crime with the word knowingly as applying that word to each element.second,applying that standard,we hold sufficient evidence supports the jury finding that olson had the requisite knowledge here.we therefore affirm 
background 
the usda awarded a grant to robert wells to open a milk processing facility.the terms of the grant provided that certain equipment was to be purchased wholly or in part with grant funds,and that the usda would hold a first lien position on any equipment purchased with grant money.although the grant was in wells name,he had an informal handshake partnership with olson,a former alaska executive director of the usda farm service agency who wrote wells grant application.wells described her as the brains behind the grant,and their informal partnership entitled her to percent of the profits from the milk processing facility.
around the same time,kyle beus received a separate usda grant to establish an ice cream and cheese manufacturing facility.the paperwork for both wells and beus grant applications warned that anyone who made false,fictitious or fraudulent statements could be fined or imprisoned for up to five years.
wells,beus and olson agreed to locate their two projects at the same facility.unbeknownst to wells and olson,beus instructed his contractor,nether industries,to inflate the value of certain dairy processing equipment including a cip system and a glycol chilling system on papers submitted to the usda for reimbursement.beus also submitted invoices to nether,allegedly for project expenses,so he could personally receive a portion of the grant money the usda disbursed.
a year into the enterprise,beus told wells and olson he had leased certain technologically obsolete pieces of equipment rather than purchase new equipment as agreed in the original grant application,including a really cheap old glycol unit and an incomplete system.as to some of this equipment,olson informed the usda there had been a change of plans that called for leasing instead of outright purchasing some of the original smaller equipment.she did not do so,however,with respect to the cip system and glycol cooling system.the attached proposed money grant expenditure included a cip system listed at and a glycol cooling system listed at when,in fact,those systems had been leased rather than purchased.
after the usda disbursed the grant funds,olson filed a final report with the department.it included a final list of expenditures by category and completion that once again falsely listed the purchase of a cip system and a glycol cooling system.
olson later became aware that beus had been misappropriating grant funds by submitting false invoices to nether industries and receiving payments which olson described as kickbacks in return.olson also discovered beus had improperly used grant funds to make a personal investment in a milk jug manufacturer.an entry in her day planner around this time reveals that she knew beus actions were improper.she wrote began work on out kyle mess.learning of questionable deals nether kyle spent of our grant on others,so nether way over budget.also,kyle misused our advance as his own stock purchases olson told the project office assistant she could send beus ass to jail.she wrote members of her board that t he revelations of the past week have crystallized for me that beus agreement to the projects was simply a way to divert our grant money into a grandiose plan that has not worked,and that beus has put the entire dairy industry at risk for an investigation closing off all loan sources and public goodwill.
olson was convicted after a jury trial of misprision of felony under.her conviction was based on her knowledge that beus,the principal,submitted false statements to the usda in furtherance of his scheme to misappropriate grant funds in violation of a felony under federal law.olson appeals.
standard of review 
we review a question of statutory construction de novo.united states weitzenhoff,cir.our review of the constitutional sufficiency of evidence to support a criminal conviction is governed by jackson virginia,which requires a court of appeals to determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states nevils,cir.en banc quoting jackson virginia,citation omitted.
discussion 
the misprision of felony statute states 
whoever,having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the united states,conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the united states,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years,or both.
emphasis added.
to establish misprision of felony,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the principal committed and completed the felony alleged that the defendant had full knowledge of that fact that he failed to notify the authorities and that he took affirmative steps to conceal the crime of the principal.lancey united states,cir.alterations omitted quoting neal united states,cir.only the second element is at issue here.
to show a defendant has knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the united states,the parties agree the government must prove at least that the defendant knew the principal engaged in conduct that satisfies the essential elements of the underlying felony.in other words,the defendant must know the facts that make certain conduct fit the definition of the offense.elonis united states,quoting staples united states.the parties disagree as to whether and to what extent the government must also prove the defendant knew such conduct was a felony.we conclude olson has the stronger argument.
first,olson construction is consistent with the general presumption that a mens rea requirement applies to each element of an offense.absent indication of contrary purpose in the language or legislative history of the statute,liparota united states,we ordinarily read a phrase in a criminal statute that introduces the
