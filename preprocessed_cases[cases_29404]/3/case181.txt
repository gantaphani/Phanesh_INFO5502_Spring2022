in this case an ultimate buyer sues up the stream of commerce alleging warranty,contract,and tort claims against the direct seller,tort and warranty claims against the distributor,and tort and warranty claims against the manufacturer.the district court dismissed all claims on motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
holden farms and the nine other plaintiffs whom we shall sometimes collectively call holden farms produce and market hogs.between august,and september,plaintiffs entered into ten contracts with hog slat,a north carolina corporation,for the construction of hog nurseries.seven of the ten contracts were entered into by barry holden on behalf of holden farms.the other three contracts were entered into by the remaining plaintiffs.the plaintiffs and hog slat agree that all of the contracts were fully integrated agreements.five of the ten total contracts contained a clause stating that t his contract is controlled and governed,and the parties agree to be bound,by north carolina law.the other five contained a clause stating that t his contract is controlled and governed,and the parties agree to be bound,by iowa law.
holden farms and the nine other plaintiffs desired to expand their operations.as part of that expansion,holden farms wished to build hog nurseries,and contracted with hog slat for that purpose.hogs are placed in a nursery after they are born but before they are finished for sale.the nurseries are built with slatted floors,supported by beams,so that the hogs refuse does not contaminate their living space.the contracts provided that hog slat would install a plastic flooring manufactured by bcm manufacturing,a canadian corporation,and distributed by double l group,an iowa corporation.bcm and double l were not parties to any of the contracts.
in april,holden farms acted as host for a sales presentation by double l and hog slat to explain the advantages to hog farmers of a new plastic flooring,filter eeze maxima,to be used in the hog nurseries.double l was bcm sole distributor of maxima flooring in the united states.as part of promoting the maxima flooring to holden farms,double l prepared a letter and promotion brochure.the letter was provided to holden farms by a double l representative named borcherding.the letter stated that borcherding was a representative of bcm manufacturing,but it was apparently understood by holden farms that borcherding also represented double importantly for this case,the letter also stated that the warranty is proven the brochure,prepared by double l,but carrying a hog slat logo,also referred to a warranty.the executed contracts explicitly stated,however,that all warranties extended under the contracts were only for one year from the date of substantial completion or for such period as the manufacturer warranty,whichever is less.the contracts did not mention any warranty,although they did refer to a manufacturer warranty.
installation of the first three nurseries was completed by hog slat in october,and the other seven nurseries were completed over the next several years.hog slat followed bcm installation specifications,which called for the use of steel beams to support the flooring.in the summer of,holden farms began to notice problems with the flooring in the first three nurseries built.the constant exposure to hog waste caused the steel support beams to swell and corrode,which in turn caused the plastic floor to buckle.the hogs were able to lift the buckling slats with their snouts,creating gaps in the flooring that they fell through into the manure pit below.approximately feeder hogs were killed as a result,and holden farms had to replace the flooring.
holden farms filed suit against hog slat,bcm,and double l.it alleged that hog slat was in breach of its contracts,violated its express and implied warranties,and was liable for negligent design and negligent misrepresentation.holden farms alleged,as well,that bcm violated its warranty and was liable for negligent design and negligent misrepresentation.finally,plaintiff alleged that double l had violated its warranty and was liable for negligent misrepresentation.plaintiff sought damages,damages,and other expenses.
hog slat moved to dismiss the claims against it pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on the grounds that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations,the rule,and the doctrine.a magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the contract and warranty claims against hog slat because the claims were barred by the time limitation for bringing claims agreed to in the contract and by the rule.determining that the clause governed the tort claims,the magistrate judge recommended that the tort claims be dismissed except as to the loss of the hogs.under iowa and north carolina law,recovery for injuries based on the flawed flooring was precluded by the doctrine.the doctrine provides that a buyer may not recover from a seller or other person claimed to have made warranties with respect to sold goods in a tort action for economic loss to the goods themselves.recovery may be had for such loss only in a warranty or contract action.the district judge adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.
double l filed an answer generally denying the allegations and filed cross claims against hog slat and bcm.hog slat filed an answer as to the remaining claims against it and brought cross claims against bcm and double bcm filed an answer generally denying all claims.
next,hog slat brought a motion for summary judgment.soon after,bcm brought its own motion for partial summary judgment,excepting damages concerning the hogs.double l moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted hog slat motion as to the claim,holding that hog slat owed holden farms no duty.the court,however,preserved the claims but reiterated that it had limited those claims to the loss of the hogs.double l was granted summary judgment on all claims against it,and bcm was granted summary judgment on all claims against it except those relating to damages from the loss of the hogs.
the district court ruling left holden farms with only the claims for the loss of hogs surviving.the parties stipulated to the dismissal of all remaining claims,making the order of the district court final.this appeal followed.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
in considering a motion to dismiss,we must assume that all the facts alleged in the complaint are true.the complaint must be liberally construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.a rule b motion to dismiss a complaint should not be granted unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle the plaintiff to relief.whether a complaint states a cause of action is a question which this court reviews de novo.coleman watt,cir internal citations omitted.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.the party is entitled to all reasonable inferences based on the facts.anderson liberty lobby,d.
we shall address the claims against each party in turn.
holden farms argues that the district court erred when it dismissed its contract claims against hog slat,dismissed its tort claims against hog slat,and granted hog slat motion on its claim.we disagree.
the district court dismissed holden farms claim against hog slat because the time limitation for bringing suit,set out in article iv g of the contracts,had expired 
holden farms argues that the limiting language bars only actions for violation of warranty,but does not preclude other claims for breach of contract.it concedes that the warranty period had expired,but argues that the limitation made in article iv g applied only to the promises made in that article.it places great weight on the title of article iv b contractors additional obligations.thus,since it fashions its suit as a breach of article iv b of the contract,it argues that the district court erred in dismissing its suit.we disagree.
this issue is governed by north carolina and iowa law.neither holden farms nor hog slat challenges the provision as it applies to the claims.because the analysis is the same under either state law,we do not separate our discussion by state.
we think article iv g shows that the parties intended the time limitation for initiating a suit to apply to the whole contract the language of the article discusses both workmanship and the quality of goods used.as such,it is meant as a general limitation setting out when an action on the contract must be brought.
further,even were we not convinced that the parties intended article iv g to create a general time limit for initiating suit,article viii of the contracts would bar such claims.article viii provides,in part,that i n all events,however,owner placement of the hogs in any building shall constitute an acceptance of that building as is with all defects in materials or workmanship.thus,when holden farms placed hogs in the nurseries it gave up the right to sue for breach of contract.
holden farms next asserts that the district court erred in dismissing its related tort claims.first,it argues that the district court incorrectly applied northwest airlines astraea aviation,cir,and that minnesota law governs the tort claims against hog slat.second,it argues that its claims are not barred by minnesota doctrine.because we disagree with the first argument,the second argument becomes moot.we affirm the district court dismissal of these claims.
holden farms argues that the district court erred in holding that,under northwest airlines,the tort claims against hog slat should be governed by the provisions set out in the holden slat contracts.we disagree.the essential principle of northwest airlines is that,under minnesota law,if analysis of the claims connected to a contract involves interpretation of the contract,then the forum will apply the contractual provisions to the tort claims.id.at.here,both the and claims speak to the provisions of the contract.just as in northwest airlines,a lthough mainly styled as torts,these claims stem from hog slat alleged failure promptly to provide functioning parts as required under the contracts.ibid.the rule may be harder to understand with respect to the claims,but the analysis is simplified if one looks to what the allegedly negligent misrepresentation was.holden farms alleges that hog slat negligently promised that the goods would be as warranted for ten years,and that they had a proven performance record,at the april meeting.whether such tortious activity occurred requires an analysis of whether the contract included such warranties and of what the warranties meant.thus,in analyzing the tortious behavior we are essentially analyzing the contract.therefore,the northwest airlines rule applies,and the tort claims against hog slat will be governed by north carolina and iowa law.
we have held that five of the contracts are governed by north carolina law,and five by iowa law.holden farms argues that its tort actions are not barred even if the laws of these states are applied.we first address north carolina law.
under the law of that state,a tort action does not lie against a party to a contract who simply fails to properly perform the terms of the contract,even if that failure to properly perform was due to the negligent or intentional conduct of that party,when injury resulting from the breach is damage to the subject matter of the contract.spillman american homes.spillman is a case involving the sale and installation of a mobile home,and is analogous to the case at bar.the north carolina court of appeals barred spillman from pursuing his claim.so here,where holden farms claims that the hog houses it bought were negligently designed,the claim is barred under north carolina law.
in north carolina,this doctrine,as it is known,appears to apply to all tort actions involving the sale of goods in which damages are alleged to have resulted from defects in the goods sold.the language we have quoted from spillman refers simply to tort action s,and does not appear to distinguish between claims and,say,claims.accordingly,north carolina doctrine bars both tort claims holden farms seeks to assert.we recognize that a contrary implication might be drawn from a recent federal case not cited by the parties,wilson dryvit,d.the case involved the sale of a new home,and the plaintiffs claimed that covering or cladding that was supposed to protect the exterior of the building was defective.claims were stated for negligence,gross negligence,negligent misrepresentation,fraud,and unfair and deceptive acts and practices.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all claims.it first discussed a group of claims it referred to as negligence claims.id.at.these claims alleged,among other things,that the defendant had been negligent in the design and warning of the exterior covering,quoting complaint.the court explained 
north carolina has adopted the economic loss rule,which prohibits the purchaser of a defective product from bringing a negligence action against the manufacturer or seller of that product to recover purely economic losses sustained as a result of that product failure to perform as expected.instead,such claims are governed by contract law.
ibid.citations omitted.this doctrine,the court held,barred plaintiffs claims for negligence and gross negligence.
the court then went on to discuss the claim of negligent misrepresentation separately.see id.at.this claim was dismissed on the ground that any misrepresentations made by defendant had been made to general contractors and to the public,not to the plaintiffs.the separate discussion of the claim,and the fact that it was dismissed on a ground other than the doctrine,may indicate that,for some reason,the court believed that this doctrine barred only claims,and not claims.the court opinion does not say that,nor does it cite any north carolina case so holding,but this may have been what the court intended.however that may be,we are not aware that any north carolina state court case provides the basis for such a distinction,and,despite our respect for the federal district court in north carolina,and its judge,we are not persuaded that the supreme court of north carolina would so hold.
there is an additional reason for rejecting the claim,if such a reason be needed.the tort does not exist when business people are dealing with each other at arm length.kindred of north carolina,bond.hog slat alleged negligent misrepresentations did not concern matters known only to it.contrast the situation in kindred,where the misrepresentations had to do with financial information available only to the defendant,and the arm length rule was not applied.we know of no reasons why holden farms could not have checked out with others the information provided to it by hog slat,bcm,and double so,even if north carolina doctrine,for some reason,does not apply to claims,this claim is barred in the present case under another doctrine of north carolina law.
holden farms also argues that its tort claims were not barred under iowa law.we disagree and affirm the district court.
as a general rule in iowa,e conomic losses to the product itself are excluded from recovery in tort.richards midland brick sales,iowa app.in looking at a particular case,a court faced with both a claim and a theory,should determine whether contract law or tort law is best suited to the nature of the loss claimed ballard amana soc y,iowa internal citation omitted.contract doctrine is appropriate when the loss relates to a consumer or user disappointed expectations due to deterioration,internal breakdown or cause.nelson todd,iowa internal citation omitted.tort theory is generally appropriate when the harm is a sudden or dangerous occurrence,frequently involving some violence or collision with external objects,resulting from a genuine hazard in the nature of the product defect.ibid.we hold that contract law should prevail and bar the tort claims.the deterioration in the flooring was not immediate,and exp
