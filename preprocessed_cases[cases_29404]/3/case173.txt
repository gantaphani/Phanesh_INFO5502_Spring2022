brought this case as a putative class action under sections four and fifteen of the clayton act,for treble the damages caused by an alleged conspiracy in violation of section one of the sherman act.appellants appeal from the district court denial of their motion to certify two classes.we affirm.
appellants allegations and procedural history 
appellants allege as follows monsanto wished to extract the monopoly profits it would have earned from certain genes it had patented,which could be used to develop genetically modified corn and soybean seeds gm seeds but monsanto had surrendered its monopoly over the genes by giving broad licenses to pioneer and syngenta.monsanto therefore secured the agreement of pioneer and syngenta to inflate the prices of their own gm corn and soybean seeds,to support monsanto technology fees for inclusion of the patented genes in seeds monsanto sold rather than to undercut the fees through normal price competition.monsanto propped up its technology fee also by securing the agreement of appellee aventis to limit its production of libertylink soybean seeds,which competed with the gm soybean seed sold by monsanto,pioneer,and syngenta.the parties to the conspiracy performed their obligations under their illegal agreement to an extent sufficient to injure all members of the proposed classes.
appellants moved for certification of two classes.the first class consisted of farmers other than as distributors who,from to present,purchased roundup ready soybean seeds or the right to grow the seeds directly from one of the defendants.the second class consisted of farmers other than as distributors who,from to present,purchased yieldgard corn seeds or the right to grow the seeds directly from one of the defendants.appellants sought certification of these classes under fed.b,which provides for class certification if questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.
to recover damages under section four of the clayton act,plaintiffs must prove defendants violated the antitrust laws and that plaintiffs suffered some resulting injury,and plaintiffs must estimate the measure of damages.amerinet,xerox,cir.appellants allege a conspiracy in violation of section one of the sherman act.for a class to be certified,plaintiffs need to demonstrate that common issues prevail as to the existence of a conspiracy and the fact of injury.see in re visa antitrust,cir.the district court found that plaintiffs satisfied the rule a prerequisites to a class action,but that common questions do not predominate over individual questions.the district court held that neither the existence of a conspiracy to fix prices,nor the existence of some resultant harm constitute questions common to the class.
ii.standard of review class certification law 
a district court denial of class certification is reviewed for abuse of discretion.chaffin rheem,cir.the district court rulings on issues of law are reviewed de novo,and the court abuses its discretion if it commits an error of law.emery hunt,cir.the district court also abuses its discretion if its conclusions rest on clearly erroneous factual determinations.forest park ii hadley,cir.
the requirement of rule b that common questions predominate over individual questions tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.amchem,windsor,d.the nature of the evidence that will suffice to resolve a question determines whether the question is common or individual.see in re visa,at.if,to make a prima facie showing on a given question,the members of a proposed class will need to present evidence that varies from member to member,then it is an individual question.if the same evidence will suffice for each member to make a prima facie showing,then it becomes a common question.see id.
to determine whether common questions predominate,a court must conduct a limited preliminary inquiry,looking behind the pleadings.see general.of southwest falcon,d.in conducting this preliminary inquiry,however,the court must look only so far as to determine whether,given the factual setting of the case,if the plaintiffs general allegations are true,common evidence could suffice to make out a prima facie case for the class.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.see also in re visa,at.when the decision on class certification comes before full merits discovery has been completed,the court must necessarily conduct this preliminary inquiry prospectively.a decision to certify or not to certify a class may therefore require revisiting upon completion of full discovery.
the preliminary inquiry at the class certification stage may require the court to resolve disputes going to the factual setting of the case,and such disputes may overlap the merits of the case.see szabo bridgeport,cir.see also newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.nonetheless,such disputes may be resolved only insofar as resolution is necessary to determine the nature of the evidence that would be sufficient,if the plaintiff general allegations were true,to make out a prima facie case for the class.the closer any dispute at the class certification stage comes to the heart of the claim,the more cautious the court should be in ensuring that it must be resolved in order to determine the nature of the evidence the plaintiff would require.eisen,at.
iii.factual background 
the parties do not dispute the essentials of the factual setting of this case in the early,appellee monsanto was a producer of genetic research pertinent to the seed industry but was not itself a major producer of seeds.monsanto had developed a genetic modification for soybean seeds which made the plants resistant to roundup,a herbicide,and a genetic modification for corn seeds which made them resistant to the european corn borer,a pest.while monsanto enjoyed a lawful monopoly over these genes,by virtue of its patents,it was unable to commercialize the genes itself.in and,monsanto granted broad licenses to appellees pioneer and syngenta,major seed producers and distributors,to develop commercial seeds using these patented genes,thus surrendering its monopoly over the genes.the licenses did not restrict in any material way pioneer or syngenta development,marketing,or pricing of seeds containing the genes.for the soybean licenses,monsanto received full payment from both pioneer and syngenta.for the corn licenses,monsanto received full payment from pioneer.syngenta corn license required payment of royalties which floated with whatever premium syngenta might charge for its gm corn seed sales as compared to its nongm corn seed sales.
after thus surrendering its monopoly over the seed genes to two major seed producers,monsanto in the became a major seed producer in its own right.monsanto also began licensing many other independent seed companies to produce and sell seeds using the patented genes.these licenses,and monsanto own sales of gm seeds,required payment of specified technology fees,separately invoiced,as payment for use of the patented genes.pioneer and syngenta,however,were free to price their gm seeds solely with regard to ordinary price thus to undercut the prices of gm seeds bearing the additional cost of monsanto technology fee.pioneer and syngenta thus threatened monsanto ability to collect the monopoly profits it would have been able to collect had it retained the monopoly conferred by its patents.
appellees pioneer and syngenta are major producers of seeds and compete with each other nationwide.many other firms with local or regional scope are licensed to sell the gm corn and soybean seeds at issue here.
in general,the seed industry markets many hybrids of any general type of seed.specific hybrids are developed with a variety of traits addressed to such variable factors as soil quality,rates of growth,aridity,severity of pest or weed problems,food qualities,and so on.the gm corn and soybean seeds each come in many varieties.monsanto sold over fifty corn hybrids and approximately soybean.syngenta sold approximately thirty of each,and pioneer approximately fifty of each.both seed types were sold nationwide,though sales of some hybrids were geographically limited.in many cases gm corn hybrids were sold alongside corresponding hybrids,which were substantially similar,except for lacking the patented genetic modification.gm soybean hybrids generally did not have corresponding hybrids.
appellees distributed gm seeds either through their own representatives or through retailers and distributors.the proposed classes include only farmers who bought gm the permission to grow from appellees 
iv.district court ruling and discussion 
the record is extensive.the district court made a careful analysis of the evidence and came up with the following resolution rejecting the argument that all members of the class would be able to use the same evidence to prove that they sustained some damage from the alleged conspiracy 
rule b predominance 
plaintiffs must meet all requirements of rule a and fall within one of the categories of rule b to certify their antitrust claims as a class action.amchem products,windsor,d.as stated above,plaintiffs seek to certify their antitrust classes under rule b,the common question or damages class action.to certify a class action under rule b,the court must find that common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual members and class resolution is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.fed.b amchem,at.because plaintiffs can not meet the predominance requirement,i am not authorized to certify the proposed classes.
in seeking class certification,plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating that,as required by rule b,questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.this necessarily requires an examination of the underlying elements necessary to establish liability for plaintiffs claims.see newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.a plaintiff seeking treble damages under of sic of the clayton act,must establish an antitrust violation here,the alleged conspiracy to fix prices and the fact of damage or injury,impact.amerinet,xerox,cir in re msg,at.thus,to satisfy the predominance standard,plaintiffs must show that both conspiracy and impact can be proven on a systematic,basis.plaintiffs can not satisfy either of those prongs.
plaintiffs have not demonstrated that antitrust impact can be measured on a basis with common proof 
to establish cognizable injury under section of the clayton act,plaintiffs must prove that the class members suffered injury to their business or property,impact,as a result of the violation.see state of alabama blue bird body,cir midwestern machinery northwest airlines.the importance of the impact requirement can not be understated,as noted by the court in blue bird 
in making the determination as to predominance,of utmost importance is whether impact should be considered an issue common to the class and subject to generalized proof,or whether it is instead an issue unique to each class member,and thus the type of question that might defeat the predominance requirement of rule b.
at.p roof of injury in a case will generally consist of some showing by the plaintiff that,as a result of this conspiracy,he had to pay supracompetitive prices id.at.to establish antitrust impact,an expert is required to construct a hypothetical market,a market,free of the restraints and conduct alleged to be anticompetitive.concord boat brunswick,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
to meet their burden of proof,plaintiffs offered up expert testimony from leitzinger.defendants have asked me to apply the test of daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,and to disregard his testimony.i will deny defendants motion in limine as i believe it is appropriate for me to consider all evidence at this stage of the proceedings.i have considered all expert testimony offered by both sides in support of or in opposition to class certification and have afforded that testimony such weight as i deemed appropriate.however,leitzinger testimony does not show that impact can be demonstrated on a basis.
simply put,plaintiffs presume impact without any consideration of whether the markets or the alleged conspiracy at issue here actually operated in such a manner so as to justify that presumption.leitzinger assumes the answer to this critical issue and plaintiffs,in turn,have asked the court to rely on this conclusion as support for class certification.i can not presume or assume much less conclude impact here because the evidence submitted during the class certification hearing demonstrates that such a presumption would be improper.
first,the genetically modified seeds are not homogenous products.the market for seeds is highly individualized depending upon geographic location,growing conditions,consumer preference and other factors.
second,plaintiffs allege that only the premium portion of the seed product is the result of the scheme,but the germplasm component of the seed can not be segregated from the rest of the seed.the evidence demonstrated that defendants and their distributors often lowered the overall price of certain seeds,or gave discounts or rebates to certain farmers to offset any alleged premium,and that some farmers in fact paid no premium.
another reason that the actual prices paid by farmers can not be determined with common proof is that the gm seeds were not offered for sale at a uniform price.plaintiffs suggested that defendants nationwide price lists could be used for this purpose,but the evidence offered during the certification hearing demonstrated that these lists did not reflect the actual price paid by farmers.plaintiffs also suggested that this issue could be resolved through a claims procedure that would be implemented after the class certification process.this argument is meritless.the amount of premiums paid,if any,is relevant to a determination of impact,an essential element of a claim,and is not merely an assessment of the amount of damages,which may be properly ascertained at a later time.it is clear that this determination can not be made on a basis,but would involve a inquiry unique to each potential class member.
leitzinger attempted to measure the premium by comparing the price of gm seeds to conventional seeds,but in many instances the gm seeds have no conventional counterpart.therefore,it would be impossible to determine the amount of premium paid.in addition,leitzinger conceded that even this calculation might not accurately affect the amount of the premium because insertion of the gm trait might affect other agronomic characteristics of the seed which might otherwise affect the price.
plaintiffs can not determine the marketplace necessary to establish antitrust impact without a reliable methodology to determine the premiums paid by farmers.in fact,the evidence presented at the class certification hearing showed that conditions for seed sales vary to such a great extent that the prices could be determined only through individualized inquiries for each potential class member.these factors include growing seasons and conditions,regional varieties and farmer preferences.common proof simply can not be used to establish a marketplace in this situation,particularly where the evidence showed that the actual prices paid by many farmers was well below monsanto technology fee.
finally,i am not persuaded that the alleged conspiracy could even be proven with common evidence.the dynamics of this localized industry make it highly unlikely that the existence and workings of the alleged conspiracy could be shown through common proof.
in sum,after carefully considering all the evidence submitted during the class certification hearing,i am convinced that the impact of defendants alleged antitrust violations can not be shown on a basis with common proof.instead,it is a highly individualized,factintensive inquiry that necessarily requires consideration of factors unique to each potential class member.the variety of gm seeds purchased,geographic location,growing conditions and the terms of purchase are all relevant to a determination of impact and can not be shown with common proof on a basis.plaintiffs did not meet their burden of establishing the necessary elements of rule b through the testimony of leitzinger,whose assumptions,presumptions and conclusions fall far short of actually establishing antitrust impact on a basis through common proof.

analysis and ruling to affirm 
in our review,parts of the extensive evidence produced in this case demonstrate that not every member of the proposed classes can prove with common evidence that they suffered impact from the alleged conspiracy.the ability to use common evidence to show impact on all class members can not always be assumed.see,alabama blue bird body,cir.
here damages to all class members must be shown to justify the class action.the district court noted,and appellees emphasize,the following 
since individual seed varieties can be used only in particular geographies,the characterization of list prices as national is misleading and does not reveal a nationwide approach to pricing 
list prices for each of the hundreds of individual seed varieties were set in reference to local competitive circumstances 
list prices differed from variety to variety,and sometimes differed from region to region for a single variety 
premiums varied significantly as well,and frequently were substantially lower than the monsanto technology fee 
many discounts on seeds were anything but alone had over seed discount programs,and regional sales representatives were authorized to negotiate ad hoc discounts in the field,frequently involving free goods and 
heavy and variable discounting led to wide variation in the prices that farmers actually paid,and widespread examples of pioneer and syngenta seeds being sold at zero or premiums.
appellants challenge the district court conclusion that the element of conspiracy,the violation of the antitrust laws necessary to recover treble damages under the clayton act,could not be proved on a classwide basis with evidence common to the class.the district court explanation of its holding is that,the dynamics of this localized industry make it highly unlikely that the existence and workings of the alleged conspiracy could be shown through common proof.at emphasis added.
the district court appears to have held that to prove the conspiracy element,plaintiffs must prove not only the existence of an agreement,but also that defendants actually performed the actions they agreed upon.if it did,it erred.the mere act of agreeing to raise prices,even if the undertaking agreed upon is wholly nascent or abortive,violates the prohibition of conspiracies in restraint of trade of section one of the sherman act.united states oil.if the existence of the agreement is proven,the conspiracy is proven.see fed.jury prac.instr.
the performance of the obligations defendants undertook by virtue of the agreement is not a separately treated element of a conspiracy claim but goes rather to the element of resultant injury.see concord boat brunswick,cir.performance of a conspiracy necessarily implies injury,at.
evidence that appellees entered into a conspiracy that would affect all class members would perforce be evidence common to all class members for proving the conspiracy.see in re linerboard antitrust,cir see also herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions ed.however,proof of conspiracy is not proof of common injury.
we affirm the district court holding that appellants can not prove classwide injury with proof common to the class.
the district court discussion of this issue cites the following reasons farmers buying gm seeds often received varying discounts from the list prices,so each farmer would have to prove separately that he paid an actual transaction price that was the market for seeds is highly individualized,requiring particularized evidence to determine the competitive price that would have prevailed in the locality of any individual farmer prices for gm seeds varied widely,and some farmers paid negligible premiums or no premiums at all for gm seeds,as compared with corresponding seeds plaintiffs expert did not show that the fact of injury could be proven for the class as a whole with common evidence 
we rely on the second,third,and fourth of these holdings.the wide variation in list prices among hybrids and the pricing of some gm hybrids with zero or negligible list price premiums,as compared with corresponding hybrids,would require the purchasers of some hybrids to prove injury through evidence that would vary according to individualized market conditions and thus would not be shared in common with the rest of the proposed classes for the above stated reasons,we affirm the denial of class certification.
the district court memorandum and order does not distinguish between list prices and transaction prices,or between list premiums and transaction premiums.the court noted that in addition to instances in which list prices were discounted,there were cases in which there were no premiums at all.it is clear from our review of the record that the district court was presented with undisputed evidence not only that list prices among hybrids varied greatly,but that in a substantial number of cases,where gm hybrids existed alongside corresponding hybrids,the list prices showed negligible premiums,and in some cases no list premiums at all.therefore we take the district court statement that some farmers in fact paid no premium at all to refer in part to cases in which corresponding list prices showed no premium for gm seeds.
to prove that the members of the proposed classes were injured by paying prices for gm corn and soybean seeds,each plaintiff must be able to present evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that the competitive price was less than the price the plaintiff paid.appellants proffered to the district court certain circumstantial evidence that they have now in hand even without full merits discovery that is common to all members of the proposed classes.appellants evidence consists of,for instance,monsanto projection that,absent collusion,its technology fees would be competed away in the course of four years,combined with evidence showing that in fact the fees were not competed away financial records of pioneer and syngenta quantifying average gm seed premiums for their own sales close in amount to monsanto technology fees documents from appellees indicating that they had given thought,in devising the agreement,to creating techniques to ensure that the premiums would be genuine and effective documents showing that appellees were able to estimate the premiums not publicly identified which their had put into place.
given the facts of this case,however,the above evidence suggesting that appellees adhered to a agreement that raised the average price of gm seeds does not make the appellants must make in order to certify the proposed appellees adherence extended to hundreds of list prices.it is undisputed that there were many hybrids of both corn and soybean seeds,and that list prices varied widely among hybrids,for both general types.for corn seeds,in many cases a gm hybrid had a corresponding hybrid.because no pricefixing conspiracy is alleged as to hybrids,such pairings establish clear listprice premiums for the gm corn hybrids.appellees submitted to the district court,and appellants did not dispute,that some gm corn hybrids had zero or negligible listprice premiums.while a negligible or zero list premium may not conclusively establish the absence of price inflation as to the hybrid at issue,such a premium presents very different factual issues,and requires different proof,than do list premiums that approximate monsanto technology fee.
the undisputed presence of negligible and zero list premiums indicates that if appellees performed their agreement,their performance was not across the board,but extended to some list prices and not to others.consequently,to show injury from price inflation,each plaintiff would need to present evidence that the list prices of the seeds he purchased,not just
