the matter at hand calls upon us to interpret the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,et,specifically,to determine whether a paca licensee bears an implied duty to refrain from paying illegal gratuities to a united states department of agriculture usda inspector,and the scope of the circumstances that constitute reasonable cause for the breach of such a duty.
this case arises out of the rampant corruption that existed for years,if not decades,in the hunts point terminal produce market in the bronx,ny.it is undisputed that many of the produce inspectors hired by the department of agriculture to provide impartial assessments of the condition of agricultural commodities arriving at hunts point for distribution throughout the metropolitan new york city area,far from acting as honest brokers,regularly accepted,and often demanded,cash payments from the merchants they were supposed to serve.when they did not receive payments from a merchant,the unscrupulous inspectors often would delay the performance of their duties or intentionally skew the results of their inspections in a manner calculated to harm the bottom line of the merchant.in contrast,these inspectors gave preferential treatment to the merchants who crossed their palms with silver,quickly responding to their requests for inspections and,at least in some cases,shading the outcomes of their inspections in favor of merchants who agreed to pay.this situation left merchants operating in the hunts point market to decide whether to acquiesce in the corruption and pay the illicit gratuities,knowing that if they did not,they risked operating at a competitive disadvantage the complicit merchants.petitioners g t terminal packaging co,and,by their agent,anthony spinale,chose to pay.the question now before us is whether we may affirm the secretary of agriculture conclusions that the petitioners breached a duty impliedly imposed by the perishable agricultural commodities act in making these illegal payments,and that the situational coercion created by the inspectors corruption did not constitute reasonable cause for this breach.we grant chevron deference to the secretary construction of the scope of the implied duties created by the paca and affirm that construction as reasonable.we do not decide whether the secretary unelaborated determination that the extortion evidenced in this proceeding is not a reasonable cause for spinale payments is similarly entitled to deference under chevron because we would reach the same conclusion upon a de novo review.we therefore deny the petition for review and affirm the secretary decision.
the perishable agricultural commodities act establishes a regulatory regime governing the wholesale trade in perishable goods such as fresh fruits and vegetables as congress explained in enacting an amendment to paca in 
the perishable agricultural commodities act is admittedly and intentionally a tough law.it was enacted in for the purpose of providing a measure of control and regulation over a branch of industry which is engaged almost exclusively in interstate commerce,which is highly competitive,and in which the opportunities for sharp practices,irresponsible business conduct,and unfair methods are numerous.the law was designed primarily for the protection of the producers of perishable agricultural of whom must entrust their products to a buyer or commission merchant who may be thousands of miles away,and depend for their payment upon his business acumen and fair for the protection of consumers who frequently have no more than the oral representation of the dealer that the product they buy is of the grade and quality they are paying for.
the law has fostered an admirable degree of dependability and fairness in this industry chiefly through the method of requiring the registration of all those who carry on an interstate business in perishable agricultural commodities and denying this registration to those whose business tactics disqualify them.

the secretary of agriculture is charged with implementing and enforcing this regulatory regime,which permits only persons and entities that hold a valid license from the secretary to participate in this trade.a by statute,the secretary is empowered to award damages to persons injured by paca violations.see in addition,the secretary possesses authority to revoke a previously granted license if,after the filing of a complaint and subsequent administrative proceedings,see generally,the license holder is found to have committed flagrant or repeated violations of.see a.this sanction is strong medicine,as it has the effect of exiling the violator from the portions of the produce trade governed by the paca.however,it is also integral to congress goal of restricting participation in this critical interstate trade to honest businesspersons.
petitioners g t terminal packaging,g t and,are new york corporations that have held paca licenses since and,respectively.g t deals in wholesale potatoes,while operates in the wholesale tomato trade.the two companies share a common mailing address,a common pool of employees,and operated out of the same office at the hunts point terminal market in the bronx,ny in addition,they share close ties to anthony spinale,who was the director,president and percent owner of g t,and founder and principal manager.
in late,the usda office of the inspector general and the fbi launched an investigation into allegations of corruption in the usda office in hunts point,tipped off by complaints from a variety of growers that wholesalers seemed to be taking advantage of the inspection system at hunts point,forcing growers to make constant price concessions.the investigators discovered that corrupt inspectors were taking cash payments usually per container of produce from produce wholesalers in exchange for agreeing to downgrade produce on inspection certificates,to the substantial financial detriment of growers.the investigation also revealed the existence of an ongoing,coordinated criminal organization operating within the hunts point usda office.supervisory inspectors used their positions to assign corrupt inspectors under them to conduct inspections that were likely to produce payoffs.these inspectors in turn often kicked back a percentage of the cash payments to the supervisors in exchange for the favorable assignments.
william cashin was one of the unscrupulous usda inspectors.after his arrest,cashin cooperated with the ongoing investigation into the hunts point corruption by surreptitiously making audio and video recordings of his interactions with various hunts point inspectors and merchants.cashin cooperation led to the arrest and indictment of seven other usda inspectors.the dragnet also ensnared several merchants who were making payments to the inspectors,including spinale,who was indicted in the southern district of new york on october,and charged with nine counts of bribing a public official in violation of b a and on january,spinale pleaded guilty to count nine of that indictment before magistrate judge ronald ellis.in the course of his allocution,spinale admitted that o n august,i paid money to bill cashin for the purpose of influencing the outcome of his inspection report on a load of potatoes.i told him the specific amount i wanted him to put in the inspection report.on the other dates in the indictment,i paid cashin per inspection to influence the outcome of the report.spinale immediately followed that statement by saying,your honor,i would like to state i never intended to defraud the shippers who had sent me the produce.spinale then reiterated that he was paying cashin to dictate what he was putting into the report.he also gave an affirmative response when the court asked,s o it was cashin job to make reports about the produce that he was inspecting,and you were trying to influence him to write things in the report on august,district judge richard casey accepted spinale plea and sentenced him,upon a downward departure,to a term of probation,including twelve months of home confinement,and a fine.
on june,the government filed an administrative complaint charging g t and with having willfully,fragrantly,and repeatedly violated section of the paca by failing,without reasonable cause,to perform any specification or duty,express or implied,arising out of any undertaking in connection with transactions involving perishable agricultural commodities purchased,received and accepted in interstate or foreign commerce by making payments,through spinale,to cashin.see providing that a regulated merchant is liable for the acts,omissions and failures of any of its agents and officers.specifically,the complaint charged g t with having made illegal payments to a usda inspector in connection with four federal inspections of perishable agricultural commodities between july and august.it similarly charged with having made six illegal payments to a usda inspector between march and june.the petitioners responded by filing a joint answer which,in sum and substance,denied the charges against them but admitted that spinale had been indicted on federal bribery charges and subsequently pleaded guilty to a single count of that indictment.
alj william moran presided over a disciplinary hearing beginning on october,during which he heard extensive testimony from cashin and spinale,as well as other witnesses.spinale testified that he began to make what became customary gratuity payments in,shortly after the petitioners moved to the hunts point terminal market.according to spinale,he and lou guerra,another produce merchant,were talking and i had do know if somebody had handed me an inspection or had an inspection,and i turned around and told them that these people up here,they just impossible to work with.they do know what they looking at,you ca get a fair inspection,you ca get a timely inspection,and guerra made some kind of signal to me and basically he was going like this here rubbing two fingers together,and i said,well,you know,look.if i have to do that,i have to do it.so he turned around and said he going to send somebody to see me and the guy will mention my name and you know what you have to do.spinale testified that he understood guerra to mean that he had to give somebody money t o get a fair inspection or a fast inspection.spinale further described that the next time i ordered an inspection,cashin popped up,and he turned around and said lou said that i should say hello to you,or something similar to that a fter he finished the inspection,i just turned around and slipped a hundred dollars,just gave him the hundred dollars i just gave him a hundred dollars,did ask him anything,he did say anything to me and i did say anything to him.spinale stated that he continued to make cash payments to several inspectors thereafter,including cashin.however,spinale repeatedly denied that he had made the payments to induce the inspectors to make inaccurate inspections of the arriving produce on the contrary,spinale testified that,as a general matter,he gave the inspectors cash for the sole purpose of obtaining fair,fast and accurate inspections.spinale described the inspectors practice of withholding timely and accurate produce inspections unless they were paid as soft extortion,and contended that giving in to that soft extortion was something you had to do if you wanted to run a successful business.it was just a necessity.
spinale account was corroborated in several respects by the testimony of paul cutler and edmund esposito,two former hunts point usda inspectors who,like cashin,were active participants in the bribery scheme and pled guilty to bribery charges.cutler explained that there was a chronic shortage of usda inspectors in the hunts point office,and that because of this shortage it sometimes took a day or two to perform a requested inspection.as cutler testified,this situation created a profit opportunity for inspectors willing to put pressure on merchants to extend gratuities in their direction a lot of times i would come down to do an inspection,like i had applicants would have to sell things,you know,the produce is perishable and they would have to get an inspection in a timely manner and when we came down there,like i said,they would be yelling a lot and saying where were you,you know.and i would be so ticked off at them,because we have a big load,and here you have an applicant yelling at you,and i would try in some of these stores to say hey,if you want a right inspection,i would tell them to pay me.cutler was then asked what he would do if a merchant refused to pay him.if he refused to pay me,it depends on the inspection know,on what defects i found.if it was on the border i would pass it.if he paid me i would add it was on the border,i add like two or three percentage points to fail it.cutler explained that he felt that he had significant power over the merchants in the market because we could kind of force them to pay to get an inspection,or else they knew they would get right inspection.
esposito similarly testified that when hunts point merchants refused to pay him,i usually screwed them.asked to elaborate,esposito stated i would adjust the inspection.if they had an inspection that might fail good delivery,i might go in there and know,change the numbers and make sure that it passed a good delivery,and they would not get an adjustment on it.or i would just change temperatures and make the inspection worthless.esposito also explained that although as many as,merchants were paying the inspectors,not all of paying merchants received the same return on their investments.instead,according to esposito,there were people that paid and you did do nothing for them,but they still paid.and then there was people that you did things for that paid,also.esposito clarified that for the first group y ou just did the normal fair inspection.you gave them a fair inspection and they paid you,but that he would write false inspection reports on behalf of the second group of merchants.esposito did not explain why the inspectors treated some paying merchants differently than others.esposito testified,however,that spinale never asked him to alter,falsify or downgrade an inspection,though he also testified to having given spinale a benefit of doubt on inspections without having been asked to do so because he got paid and spinale is a nice guy.
cashin also testified at the hearing.unlike esposito,cashin asserted that spinale had paid the inspectors for more than just fast,fair and accurate inspections.cashin testified that he and spinale had an understanding that spinale payments were intended to influence,and in fact did influence,the outcome of cashin inspections.according to cashin,this understanding originally arose from an agreement between spinale and another usda inspector,bob snolec,and that when snolec left the usda,cashin took over at g t and,telling spinale,i be coming here a lot,i think,and,you know,i help you like bob helped you.cashin did not describe spinale response to that statement.cashin explained that he provided help for spinale and other merchants that paid him illegal gratuities in any one of three ways,and it a combination of any one of the three factors.the first factor is increasing the number of containers reported on a certificate the second way was to increase on the certificate,under the defects,the percentages of condition and the third way of help was the temperatures recorded on the certificate.by inaccurately recording the quantity and quality of the produce received by the wholesaler,cashin testified that an inspector could reduce the price that a wholesaler would have to pay a supplier for the produce he had received.cashin further testified that he would usually help spinale by adjusting the percentage of defects found in spinale favor,explaining that spinale would be very specific and tell me what he wanted written down,oftentimes telling cashin what to put in his inspection reports,and that when cashin helped spinale,his inspections did not accurately reflect the conditions of the produce received.
on march,judge moran issued a lengthy opinion dismissing the government complaint against the petitioners.judge moran rejected cashin claim that spinale had made the gratuity payments for the purpose of inducing him to make inaccurate inspections,and instead credited esposito testimony that spinale was paying only for a fair and accurate inspection,also finding broadly that in all aspects where cashin testimony conflicted with spinale testimony,spinale testimony was credible and cashin was not.judge moran also took note of the substantial economic power that the inspectors wielded over the hunts point merchants.as judge moran colorfully put it,cashin and his cabal of corrupt cronies knew they had merchants like spinale over a barrel.the merchants could pay them or risk either a delayed inspection or an inspection which rated produce as acceptable when an honest assessment would determine otherwise.in light of these findings,judge moran determined that the payments made by spinale to cashin were a personal fee extracted by cashin for every visit to spinale place of business and that in no instance was spinale benefitting from those visits by obtaining an inspection report which downgraded a load of produce from its actual condition.having found that spinale did not benefit in this way,judge moran declined to extend preclusive effect to the fact or substance of spinale admission of guilt to a federal bribery charge,and found that spinale was not bribing cashin but that unlawful gratuities were made.to judge moran,this distinction was determinative,as he found that a licensee has an implied duty to refrain from paying bribes,but does not bear such a duty to refrain from paying illegal gratuities that do not benefit the licensee.he further found that even if the payment of illegal gratuities constitutes a breach of a paca duty,the illicit payments that spinale had made to cashin did not constitute sufficient cause to warrant revocation of the licenses of g t and when the central contention of the petitioners is that they were being extorted by the agriculture inspectors in that,if they wanted an accurate inspection of the produce,they would have to pay off the inspectors to receive one.
the government appealed judge moran decision to judicial officer william jenson who,pursuant to a,is authorized to make final determinations on behalf of the secretary of agriculture in adjudicatory proceedings.the judicial officer adopted judge moran credibility determinations with respect to the witnesses who had testified at the hearing,and did not explicitly overturn any of judge moran other factual findings.he nonetheless reversed judge moran ultimate decision and revoked the petitioners paca licenses,taking a very different view of both the scope of the petitioners implied duties under the paca and the circumstances under which extortionate pressure may constitute reasonable cause for the breach of an implied duty 
with respect to the first,the judicial officer concluded that paca licensees have a duty to refrain from making payments to usda inspectors in connection with the inspection of perishable agricultural commodities which will or could undermine the trust produce sellers place in the accuracy of the usda inspection certificates and the integrity of usda inspectors,and that a paca licensee payment to a usda inspector,whether caused by bribery or extortion and whether to obtain an accurate usda inspection certificate or an inaccurate usda inspection certificate,undermines the trust a produce seller places in the accuracy of the usda inspection certificate and the integrity of the usda inspector.as such,he concluded that the purpose and reasons for anthony spinale payments to william cashin are not relevant to this proceeding.a payment to a usda inspector in connection with the inspection of perishable agricultural commodities,whether the result of extortion evidenced in this proceeding or bribery and whether to obtain accurate or inaccurate usda inspection certificates,is a violation of section of the paca.
the judicial officer also rejected the petitioners claim that the inspectors practice of soft extortion constituted reasonable cause for the payments made by spinale,concluding that t he extortion evidenced in this proceeding is not a reasonable cause for a commission merchant,dealer,or broker to fail to perform the implied duty to refrain from paying usda inspectors in connection with the inspection of perishable agricultural commodities.moreover,avoidance of inspection delays and avoidance of the issuance of inaccurate usda inspection certificates are not reasonable causes for the commission of such an breach.the judicial officer offered no further explanation of what circumstances might be encompassed by the term reasonable cause,however 
relying on spinale repeated admissions that he had made numerous payments to cashin in connection with cashin inspections of agricultural commodities for the petitioners,the judicial officer concluded that spinale,and therefore the petitioners,had engaged in willful,flagrant,and repeated violations of section of the paca by failing,without reasonable cause,to perform an implied duty arising out of an undertaking in connection with transactions involving perishable agricultural commodities purchased,received,and accepted in interstate or foreign commerce.he therefore ordered the petitioners paca licenses revoked.
this timely petition for review of the secretary decision followed.
the petitioners challenge two conclusions adopted by the secretary in the course of a formal adjudication conducted pursuant to the agency express statutory authority to administer and implement the paca regulatory regime.see b defining the term secretary as used in the paca to mean the secretary of agriculture empowering the secretary of agriculture to enact a paca licensing scheme,enforce that scheme,and award damages to persons injured by paca violations.first,the petitioners challenge the secretary generally applicable view that encompasses a duty to refrain from making a payment to an inspector that only is intended to cause,and does in fact only cause,the inspector to create an accurate and timely inspection report.they argue that because a usda inspector duty is to provide timely and accurate inspections,the secretary construction is unreasonable.second,they challenge the secretary determination,unaccompanied by a comprehensive discussion of the meaning of reasonable cause,that the inspectors actions did not constitute reasonable cause for spinale payments.the petitioners claim that spinale reasonably feared that the petitioners would suffer significant economic loss if he did not pay regular gratuities to the inspectors,and that such a fear must be encompassed by the term reasonable cause.
we consider both of the petitioners arguments against the backdrop of the familiar framework set forth by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.under chevron,f irst,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.footnotes omitted.as a result,unless we find the secretary construction of the statute to be arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,id.at,we must yield to that construction of the statute even if we would reach a different conclusion of our own accord.see regions hosp.shalala,d.
it is firmly established that we review under the chevron standard an agency binding and generally applicable interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering when that interpretation is adopted in the course of a formal adjudicatory proceeding.see united states mead,d citing prior supreme court cases applying chevron to agency adjudicatory decisions freeman burlington broadca
