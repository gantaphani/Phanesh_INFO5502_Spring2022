cave rock,a large rock formation on the eastern shore of lake tahoe,is many things to many people.to the washoe tribe,it is a site of powerful religious and cultural significance.to historians and archaeologists,it sheds light both on historical washoe culture and on the history of american transportation.and,to rock climbers,it offers some of the most challenging climbing in the nation.in this appeal,we consider the united states forest service efforts to balance these competing historical,cultural,and recreational needs in developing a resource management plan for the area.after considerable study and comment,the forest service banned the recreational activity of rock climbing at cave rock.the access fund,a climbing advocacy group,challenged that decision as a violation of the establishment clause of the united states constitution and as arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act apa.
background 
factual background 
partially located within a national forest,cave rock is a culturally,historically,and archaeologically significant site.some of this significance derives from its role as a sacred site for the washoe people,native americans who have lived in the tahoe area for at least years.traditional washoe view cave rock as the site of important mythological events that are central to their cosmology.it is also a symbol of their cultural and religious identity.
under traditional washoe beliefs,cave rock is the most religious feature within the washoe religion,and many washoe compare cave rock to a church.cave rock is considered so powerful and sacred that the health and integrity of washoe society may be jeopardized if traditional practices are not observed there.the washoe believe the rock is the location of an epic confrontation that occurred during the creation of the tahoe landscape between water babies who figure prominently in washoe mythology and a small weasel brother a mythological ancestor of the washoe.
traditional washoe assert that cave rock is to be avoided by all people,except washoe practitioners who have been called to seek power or knowledge at the rock.the presence of others at cave rock,including,is thought to endanger the lives of all.the cave,the top of the rock,and the water beneath the rock are particularly sacred.
the site is also historically and archaeologically significant.two washoe doctors named welewkushkush and big mike were known to visit cave rock during the initial period after settlement.henry moses rupert,an ethnographer and the last known traditional washoe practitioner at cave rock,also visited the site until his death in.the rock is the only washoe site that has been subject to archaeological and ethnographic study,and it contains ancient wooden rat middens that have value.
the rock also reflects developments in the history of american transportation.it has served as an evolving travel corridor that moved aboriginal peoples,early immigrants,commercial freight,and tourists along the east shore of lake tahoe.the rock originally formed part of a trail used prior to settlement later on,settlers constructed a trestle road around the lake side of the rock.in and,two tunnels were blasted through the rock to handle the increasing automobile traffic generated by tahoe tourism,and as a result,highway now runs through the rock.the forest service has recognized that cave rock presents a unique circumstance where four successive generations of road building are preserved in close proximity.
since the late,cave rock has been a popular area for rock climbing.all of the rock climbing occurs on national forest lands.with the advent of sport climbing methods,cave rock overhanging walls have become a coveted challenge for many of the world best climbers.sport climbing is focused on shorter,very technical parts of the rock,and cave rock presents some of the most difficult routes in the nation.sport climbing requires the installation of fixed anchors,which protect against.to that end,climbers drilled permanent bolts into cave rock itself.climbers expanded climbing routes without forest service approval both inside and outside the main cave area.
in the early,unknown individuals added a masonry floor and arranged rock seating in the cave without forest service approval and in violation of federal regulations prohibiting resource damage to the land.the government alleges that a group of climbers made these improvements,and the record suggests that the flooring was added because a climber fell and broke both of his legs.
the washoe consider rock climbing a desecration of cave rock.many washoe view the placement of a single climbing bolt as a defacement,and washoe representatives have repeatedly expressed concern that the intimate sustained contact with the rock that is inherent in climbing is more objectionable than the brief transitory effects of traffic passing through the tunnels that run through the rock.
ii.regulatory framework and agency proceedings 
because cave rock is located within a national forest,the forest service is authorized to develop management plans to coordinate the multiple uses of the land and to prevent harm to natural and cultural resources.e part.in,the forest service determined that cave rock was eligible for inclusion in the national register of historical places as a traditional cultural property and archaeological site.during that time,forest supervisor robert harris determined that technical rock climbing poses an adverse effect to the national register eligibility of cave rock.the nevada state historic preservation office concurred with harris assessment.although climbing may alter the rock physically,the drilling of the rock and placement of anchors has not weakened the structure geologically.
in,the keeper of the national register confirmed that cave rock was eligible for inclusion on the national historic register as a traditional cultural property,an archaeological site,and an historic transportation corridor.the keeper specifically recognized changes to the rock including those changes wrought by climbing affected its physical integrity,but nevertheless concluded the traditional cultural significance and the archaeological importance of the site survived.
shortly after the keeper made his decision,the forest service began developing a new management plan for cave rock.the forest service first implemented a series of orders that prevented the installation of new bolts.in january,juan palma,a new forest supervisor for the area,solicited comments at the beginning of the formal planning process for cave rock required by the national environmental policy act.
the draft environmental impact statement detailed five alternatives for managing cave rock,ranging from taking no action at all to banning all access to cave rock except by traditional washoe practitioners.the alternative palma initially preferred permitted public use,including rock climbing,with various restrictions on new routes and bolts.
after considering public comment,including comment from both the washoe and members of the climbing community,the forest service issued a final environmental impact statement feis.the forest service proposal sought to protect the cave rock heritage resource and regulate uses there in a manner that preserves the historic and cultural characteristics that make the property eligible for listing on the national register.
in formulating a management plan for the area,the forest service explained its priorities in resolving conflicts among competing uses.preservation of significant cultural resources ranked third on the list of goals,subordinate only to protection of lake tahoe water quality and protection of threatened and endangered species.a specific management practice addressed cultural resources management.establishment of outdoor recreation facilities and uses fell much farther down the list of priorities.
the feis articulated a new preferred proposal intended to protect cave rock heritage resources banning all climbing immediately removing all climbing bolts as soon as technically feasible and legally authorized and removing the masonry flooring inside the rock.this option would permit recreation consistent with the historic period,such as hiking,picnicking,stargazing,boating,and fishing.this new alternative incorporated features from many of the previously considered proposals and did not introduce any new features.
the forest service considered the impact of each of the various alternatives on geology,heritage resources,land ownership,climbing,recreation,social practices,and wildlife.none of the options would have significant effects on geology,land ownership,or wildlife.
the forest service found that the presence of rock climbing hardware,the activities of traditional and free climbing,and the presence of graffiti and the masonry floor all represented adverse effects on the site heritage resources.the agency also observed that although objectionable to many washoe,casual hiking,fishing,and sightseeing are consistent with the late historic period at cave rock associated with henry rupert,and therefore do not effect sic the setting and feel of the tcp traditional cultural property as an evolved property.
the feis also noted that cave rock is a core element in the washoe culture.in connection with a discussion of social practices and civil rights,the forest service emphasized that t he fact that traditional history and culture at cave rock are sometimes discussed in religious terms does not diminish the site historical or cultural significance to the washoe people.while recognizing climbers as an important social group that values the rock,the evaluation explained that the elimination of climbing should not be viewed as requiring others to conform their conduct to indian cultural concerns rather,the recommendation served the goal of protecting environmental,historical and cultural resources.
after issuing the feis,the forest service again sought public comment,and over individuals responded.subsequent to considering these comments,the forest service formally adopted the preferred proposal at the final environmental impact stage.a third forest supervisor,maribeth gustafson,emphasized that a lthough the cave rock property is spoken of in religious terms and is associated with spiritual figures,it has significant cultural and historical significance this significance is not based on washoe religious doctrine but rather on the historic and ethnographic record.she further explained,i have chosen the historic period up to and including the life span of henry rupert,the historic washoe shaman,as the time period for management of activities at cave rock.improvement and activities that are consistent with this time period and do not adversely affect the integrity of cave rock will be allowed to continue.following an administrative appeal challenging the prohibition on rock climbing at cave rock,the forest service decision was affirmed.
iii.proceedings in the district court 
the access fund then brought an action in federal district court,naming the united states department of agriculture,the forest service,and ann veneman,who was then the secretary of agriculture,collectively the forest service as defendants.the complaint asserted that the forest service decision to ban rock climbing at cave rock violated the establishment clause and was arbitrary and capricious under the apa.on for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of the government.citing lemon kurtzman,d,the court held that forest service actions did not violate the establishment clause.the district court also concluded that the forest service decision to ban climbing was not arbitrary and capricious.
standard of review 
on for summary judgment,we review the decision of the district court de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see vernon city of los angeles,cir.we may set aside agency action under the apa only if it was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.a.
establishment clause challenge 
the access fund primary contention on appeal is that the forest service decision to ban climbing at cave rock violated the establishment clause.the first amendment of the constitution provides that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,amend.i.the supreme court has counseled that the constitution does not require complete separation of church and state it affirmatively mandates accommodation,not merely tolerance,of all religions,and forbids hostility toward any.lynch donnelly,d.that is,the government may and sometimes must accommodate religious practices and it may do so without violating the establishment clause.hobbie unemployment appeals comm of,d.
the lemon test remains the benchmark to gauge whether a particular government activity violates the establishment clause.community house,city of boise,cir as amended.we recognize that the lemon test has hardly been sanctified by the supreme court.id.at see,van orden perry,d questioning the continued vitality of lemon and declining to apply it santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d rehnquist,dissenting lemon has had a checkered career in the decisional law of this court.nonetheless,the court has invoked lemon in recent opinions and surely has never expressly overruled or discarded the test.see,mccreary county am.civil liberties union of,d reaffirming use of purpose prong of lemon zelman,d,concurring reaffirming that the lemon test is still the central tool of analysis in establishment clause cases.accordingly,we apply lemon here.
under lemon,an action or policy violates the establishment clause if it has no secular purpose its principal effect is to advance religion or it involves excessive entanglement with religion.at.some cases have also characterized the establishment inquiry as answering the question of whether the government,through its actions,impermissibly endorses religion.agostini felton,d adopting endorsement formulation county of allegheny am.civil liberties union,greater pittsburgh chapter,d adopting endorsement and discussing it more generally.
in recent years,the supreme court often has discussed the last two lemon criteria together,asking whether the challenged governmental practice has the effect of endorsing religion.recent ninth circuit cases take different approaches to the continuing vitality of the entanglement prong of lemon,but the supreme court has not discussed entanglement as distinct from effect in any meaningful way in the last ten years.compare community house,at in agostini felton,d,the supreme court refined the lemon test by folding the excessive entanglement inquiry into,and setting out revised criteria for,the effect prong,with cholla ready mix,civish,cir discussing entanglement as a separate inquiry.accordingly,we focus our discussion on purpose and effect,with an eye to potential effects that might result in government becoming impermissibly embroiled in religious affairs.
secular purpose 
the government easily satisfies the first prong of the lemon test,which asks whether the challenged government action has a secular purpose or was taken for the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion.mccreary county,at.here,the forest service acted pursuant to a secular preservation of a historic cultural area.
at every opportunity,the forest service reaffirmed its desire to protect cave rock as a cultural,historical,and archaeological monument.in,more than ten years ago,the forest service determined that cave rock was eligible for inclusion in the national register of historical places as a traditional cultural property.a traditional cultural property is a discretely defined property that has an association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that a re rooted in that community history and a re important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.the forest service simultaneously observed that rock climbing adversely affects the national register eligibility of the site because the climbing hardware undermines the physical integrity of the rock and the presence of climbers and their paraphernalia impairs the communication of the property cultural significance.
the forest service approach during its recent environmental
