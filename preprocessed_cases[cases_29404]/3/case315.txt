plaintiff ali bahrani filed this action under the reverse false claims provision of the false claims act fca,a,alleging that defendants conagra,conagra hide division,conagra beef company,and monfort,collectively conagra or defendants altered thousands of beef and hide export certificates issued by the united states department of agriculture usda,rather than obtaining replacement certificates,in order to avoid paying the fees charged by the usda for replacement certificates.the district court initially granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,but this court,in ex rel.bahrani conagra,cir bahrani i,reversed and remanded for further proceedings.on remand,a jury found that bahrani was not an original source for his meat export certificate claims.a separate jury found in bahrani favor on only five of the hide export certificates at issue and awarded him actual damages of.the district court subsequently trebled the actual damages and imposed statutory penalties of per claim,as required by the fca,resulting in a total judgment of in favor of bahrani.following the entry of judgment,bahrani moved for an award of attorney fees,expenses and costs in the amount of.the district court,pursuant to a magistrate judge recommendation,awarded bahrani in fees,expenses and costs.

the underlying facts of this case were set forth in considerable detail in bahrani accordingly,we will revisit only the background information necessary to an understanding of the instant appeals.
usda export certificates 
in bahrani i,we explained how usda export certificates are utilized by companies,such as conagra,that export animal products 
to facilitate and promote foreign trade and to protect the food supply,the usda provides certificates to companies that export animal products.these export certificates are part of a comprehensive scheme administered by the food safety and inspection service,which regulates meat exports,and the animal plant health inspection safety service aphis,which regulates hide exports.the regulations are authorized by the federal meat inspection act,the poultry products inspection act,and the agricultural marketing act.
under the food inspection service regulations,exporters are required to obtain certificates from usda inspectors for each shipment.each certificate has a unique serial number and states the shipment destination,the exporter,the consignee,and the number and kinds of products it contains.the destination may affect the content of the certificates some countries require more information than the food inspection service does,and,in those instances,the usda provides exporters with certificates that comply with those other countries requirements.
the aphis regulations contain a similar provision addressing certificates for exports of animal hides.in contrast to the food inspection service regulations,the aphis regulations do not require a certificate for every shipment.however,some foreign countries do require certificates,and the aphis regulations provide that exporters shipping hides to those countries may obtain a certificate from an inspector.
the food inspection service and the aphis both charge fees for the certificates.the food inspection service export certificate fee is based upon the time expended by its inspectors for providing information over and above the minimum certification requirements set forth by federal law.see.in contrast,the aphis charges a flat fee t he purpose of which is to reimburse the government for the costs incurred.
occasionally,an exporter may discover inaccuracies in an export certificate after it has been issued by a usda inspector.there may be typographical errors or more substantive deficiencies involving matters such as the grade of beef or the destination of the product.in those instances,the inspectors practice has been to make corrections on the original certificate themselves,authorize those corrections to be made by the exporters,or to issue a new certificate.although there is not a n aphis regulatory provision addressing the payment of fees for these in lieu of and replacement certificates,the parties do not dispute that the regulations authorize the aphis to charge fees for them.
the regulations do not set forth a standard for determining when these in lieu of and replacement certificates are required.
conagra export employment with conagra 
defendants are engaged in the business of exporting meat and animal products,including beef hides.bahrani began working for conagra in as a documentation negotiator at conagra greeley,colorado office.at.in that role,bahrani worked with all documents pertaining to the exports of raw hides,bills of lading,export certificates,insurance forms,slaughter date certificates,and weight sheets.id.at.most of bahrani work involved shipments of hides to korea,some to japan and taiwan,and a few to thailand.later in his employment with conagra,bahrani also worked on shipments to canada and mexico.
bahrani allegedly knew several people that worked in conagra meat documentation division,which was physically housed in the same building and on the same floor as the hide documentation division.according to bahrani,he also,on occasion,visited the meat documentation division,either to speak with friends or to use that division photocopying equipment.
bahrani was terminated from his employment with conagra on april,as part of a reduction in force.on that same date,bahrani spoke with an fbi agent and informed him that con a gra was altering government documents and that he needed to get immunity from prosecution for him self and for his.id.at.the fbi subsequently turned that information over to usda investigators.
procedural background 
bahrani filed this action on may,alleging that defendants violated the fca reverse false claims provision,a,by routinely altering both meat and hide export certificates without obtaining replacement or in lieu of certificates and,in turn,without paying the fee for such replacement or in lieu of certificates to the government.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,concluding that a the statutes and regulations invoked by bahrani did not establish that defendants were obligated to obtain and pay for in lieu of or replacement certificates every time a change was required b even if the regulations required conagra to obtain new certificates when it discovered errors and omissions,the act of altering a certificate was not an actionable reverse false claim because the obligation to obtain an in lieu of or replacement certificate arose only as a result of the alteration and did not exist before and c the fact that usda inspectors could exercise their discretion and permit defendants to forego obtaining in lieu of or replacement certificates indicated that conagra obligation was a contingent one,and thus not covered by a.
bahrani appealed from the entry of summary judgment.this court,in bahrani i,reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and remanded for further proceedings.in doing so,this court concluded a although usda officials possessed some discretion to waive the necessity of a replacement or in lieu of certificate,that did not take the obligation to pay the fees outside the scope of a,at b the evidence presented by both parties indicate d that when export certificates required significant or major changes,the usda required exporters to obtain in lieu of or replacement certificates,c t he fact that a government official may subsequently waive an established fee does not negate the potential effect of a false record or statement,and d that bahrani presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find he was an original source for his meat export certificate claims.id.at.
on remand,the district court bifurcated the proceedings on bahrani meat export certificate and hide export certificate claims.in april of,a trial commenced on the issue of whether bahrani qualified as an original source for his meat export certificate claims the jurisdictional trial at the conclusion of the evidence,the jury found that bahrani was not an original source for any of the meat export certificate claims at issue.
the second phase of the case,which was then limited to bahrani hide export certificate claims,was tried to a jury beginning in march of.after less than a day of deliberations,the jury returned a verdict finding that,of the approximately hide export certificates proffered by bahrani as reverse false claims under a,five had been changed in a major or significant way,and all five had been changed under circumstances where the employee who made the changes did so knowing that,rather than making the changes directly to the certificate,he or she was required to secure and pay the government for a replacement certificate.the jury found that the government sustained actual damages of,five times a fee per certificate.the district court subsequently trebled the actual damages and imposed statutory penalties of per claim,as required by the fca,resulting in a total judgment of in favor of bahrani.
bahrani filed a motion to alter or amend judgment seeking attorney fees pursuant to the fca.the district court denied that motion without prejudice and directed bahrani to file a formal motion for fees.as directed,bahrani filed a timely motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure d and d for an award of expenses,attorney fees and costs in the amount of.defendants objected to bahrani motion and filed a cross motion for expenses,attorney fees and costs related only to the meat export certificates portion of the case in the amount of.the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.the magistrate judge recommended that bahrani motion be granted in part and that,pursuant to d,he be awarded expenses,fees and costs in the amount of.the magistrate judge also recommended that defendants be denied.on august,the district court issued a order overruling bahrani objections to the magistrate judge recommendation and adopting that recommendation in toto as its order.dist.doc.at italics in original.
appeal bahrani main appeal.trial issues 
bahrani first general issue on appeal focuses on the district court decision to bifurcate the jurisdictional inquiry,whether bahrani was an original source of his meat export certificate claims from the merits of his meat and hide export certificates claims.in support,bahrani asserts three specific arguments.first,he contends that bifurcating the jurisdictional inquiry from the merits of his claims constitutes error requiring a new trial.second,he contends the district court improperly instructed the jury in the jurisdictional trial.third,he contends the district court erred during the jurisdictional trial by admitting evidence of his prior litigation history.as discussed below,only one of these three arguments,the instructional challenge,has any merit,and that error does not warrant reversal.thus,we affirm the portion of the district court judgment arising out of the bifurcated original source proceedings.
a the decision to bifurcate 
bahrani contends the district court decision to bifurcate the e original source jurisdictional issue from the merits constitutes reversible error because jurisdiction is not clearly separable from the merits.aplt.br.at quoting angelo armstrong world,cir.
we review a district court decision to bifurcate a trial for abuse of discretion.anaeme diagnostek,cir.district courts have broad discretion in deciding whether to sever issues for trial and the exercise of that discretion will be set aside only if clearly abused.id.quotation omitted.federal rule of civil procedure b authorizes a district court to order a separate trial of one or more separate issues,claims,crossclaims,counterclaims,or claims f or convenience,to avoid prejudice,or to expedite and economize.b.
following our remand in bahrani i,the district court ordered the parties to confer and prepare a joint status report with a framework for getting th e case to trial.at.a status conference was held on august.on august,defendants filed a motion asking the district court to conduct a hearing pursuant to.d or the bifurcation provisions of.b,to determine the jurisdictional issue of whether bahrani wa s an original source as required by e.id.at.in support,defendants asserted that t he claims relating to meat certificates ma d e up the vast majority of bahrani case,and there wa s no reason to wait for trial to determine whether there wa s jurisdiction over those claims.id.at.defendants further argued that the original source issue was clearly separable from the merits because,a lthough bahrani would likely testify in both phases,the focus in the jurisdictional phase would be on his knowledge,while the focus at a trial on the merits would be on defendants conduct.id.at.finally,defendants asserted that bifurcation would promote judicial economy,because an early ruling on the original source issue w ould define what discovery must be completed before trial,and if bahrani was determined not to be an original source for the meat claims,there would be no need to try the issues related to those certificates,which constitute d the vast majority of certificates at issue.id.at.
on january,the district court held a status conference,during which it addressed defendants bifurcation request.notably,bahrani counsel agreed to the bifurcation of the original source issue so my suggestion would be bifurcate it the original source issue but do it starting june,two day trial,then we will be presenting evidence at a second trial one way or another on some certificates either hides alone,or meat and hides,depending on the outcome of the original source trial.id.at.ultimately,the district court agreed with this proposal and scheduled a trial on the original source issue,to be followed at a subsequent date by a trial on the merits of the certificates determined to be at issue.id.at.
as we see it,bahrani effectively invited the district court to bifurcate the original source issue from the merits issues.although bahrani did not formally move to bifurcate,he ultimately agreed with defendants motion and indeed urged the district court to bifurcate.consequently,he is precluded under the invited error doctrine from arguing that the district court erred in bifurcating united states deberry,cir.
b instructional error at jurisdictional trial 
bahrani next contends the district court improperly instructed the jury in the jurisdictional trial regarding the requirements for him to qualify as an original source under the fca.normally,w e review de novo whether the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the applicable law.gonzales duran,cir.if,however,a party did not preserve its challenge by timely objecting to an instruction in the district court,we review only for plain error.therrien target,wl at cir.to obtain reversal on review,the appellant must satisfy a test.id.it must show an error that is plain,meaning clear or obvious under current law,and affecting substantial rights.id.internal quotation marks omitted.if these elements are satisfied,we may exercise discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
before turning to bahrani specific challenges to the district court original source instructions,we find it useful to first review the requirements a relator must satisfy to establish himself as an original source under the fca,the relevant original source rulings in bahrani i,the district court handling of the original source issue on remand,including its instructions to the jury in the jurisdictional trial,and bahrani apparent failure to object to the district court handling of the original source issue.
at all times relevant to this action,t he fca define d an original source as an individual who ha d direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations we re based and ha d voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.in re natural gas royalties,cir natural gas i quoting e b.to establish original source status knowledge under this definition,a qui tam plaintiff was required to allege specific opposed to mere exactly how and when he or she obtained direct and independent knowledge of the fraudulent acts alleged in the complaint and support those allegations with competent proof.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.secondhand information,speculation,background information,or collateral research d id not satisfy a relator burden of establishing the requisite knowledge.id.finally,the term allegations,as used in e b,were not limited to the allegations of the original complaint,and instead include d at a minimum the allegations in the original complaint as amended.rockwell int l united states.
turning to bahrani i,this court reached two related conclusions that significantly affected bahrani burden of establishing that he qualified as an original source.first,this court rejected bahrani assertion that the applicable regulatory framework required a new meat or hide certificate every time a correction was made.at.instead,this court concluded,the evidence in the summary judgment record indicated that only a certain class of changes,major or significant changes,might require such certificates.id.at.ultimately,this court concluded that bahrani had submitted sufficient evidence,in particular an affidavit stating that he personally observed the alteration of export certificates while he worked for con a gra and heard a supervisor authorizing such changes,id.at,to survive summary judgment on the original source issue.
on remand,the district court,as noted,bifurcated and held an initial trial on the issue of whether bahrani qualified as an original source for purposes of his claims.immediately prior to this initial trial,the district court issued a pretrial order that stated,in pertinent part 
in assessing whether bahrani is an original source of the information underlying his claims,the jury does not need to determine bahrani had direct and independent knowledge that con a gra employees were making major as opposed to minor changes to export certificates and not securing replacement certificates,only that employees were making changes to certificates under circumstances where it was reasonable to conclude they should obtain replacement certificates and did not do so.stated otherwise,bahrani can not be deemed an original source of information underlying a false claims act claim based on personal knowledge of activities he had no reason to believe were fraudulent.
we will frame this requirement for the jury in terms of bahrani being the original source of information and activities he reasonably believed constituted an avoidance,on the part of con a gra,of an obligation to obtain and pay for replacement certificates.i am aware this articulates a new standard in the original source inquiry,but the nature of relator reverse false claim in this the fact that only materially altered certificates even fall within the fca scope as potential reverse false the jury to be given some guidance in this area.at this stage of the proceedings,the jury is only making the threshold inquiry as to whether bahrani is an original source of the information underlying his reverse false claim.that information as a threshold matter needs to be information that some wrong was being perpetrated to the detriment of the government.bahrani reasonable belief that some wrong was being committed is sufficient and con a gra request that the jury consider whether the changes he allegedly observed were major as opposed to minor changes is rejected.that said,however,bahrani will not be able to establish he was an original source of information underlying his reverse false claims simply with evidence that he observed employees making changes to meat or hide export certificates.
at underlining added italics in original.
at the conclusion of all the evidence in the jurisdictional trial,the district court,consistent with its statements in the pretrial order,instructed the jury as follows 
the information of which bahrani must have had direct and independent knowledge to qualify as an original source of his meat certificate claims is information that con a gra,through its employees,was defrauding the government out of fees it should have received for issuing replacement export certificates by making changes directly to those certificates rather than obtain corrected replacement certificates for a fee.for purposes of this trial,you do not need to decide whether con a gra actions did,in fact,constitute fraud,only that bahrani is an original source of the information on which he bases his claim that it did or not.
accordingly,bahrani status as an original source is neither proven or disproven by the actual illegality of anything he observed.however,to be an original source of information that con a gra employees were defrauding the government,bahrani must have had direct and independent knowledge of facts he reasonably believed constituted fraud.a reasonable belief is one which a reasonable person in bahrani position would have believed to be true,under the circumstances.it is not enough,in other words,that bahrani had direct and independent knowledge that con a gra employees made changes to meat export certificates.rather,he must have direct and independent knowledge that they were making those changes under circumstances where a reasonable person in bahrani position would have believed they were defrauding the government.
id.at instruction.
although bahrani now objects to this instruction on appeal,he does not identify in his opening appellate brief precisely where in the voluminous record on appeal he presented his objections to the district court.having conducted our own review of that record,we note that prior to trial bahrani submitted proposed original source instructions that differed from those ultimately given by the district court.however,we have found no instance in which bahrani objected to the district court proposed original source instructions during the jury instruction conferences.indeed,it appears from our review of the jury instruction conferences that bahrani expressly agreed with the district court proposed original source instructions.id.at.consequently,we review his appellate objections only for plain error 
turning to the merits of his arguments,bahrani asserts that t his court in bahrani i previously examined his affidavit wherein he reported seeing conagra employees altering export certificates and overheard a supervisor authorizing alterations,and held that such information established him as an original source even though he did not work in the meat documentation department or understand the significance of what he was seeing.aplt.br.at italics in original.however,bahrani complains,u pon remand the district court impermissibly added a new standard to his original source burden of proof by instruct ing the jury that,to qualify as an original source,he must have understood the significance of what he was seeing and hearing as it related to each and every element of his fca allegation.id.in other words,bahrani asserts,t he district court required,for the first time in fca jurisprudence,that a relator must have held a subjective belief that the defendant was intentionally committing fraud on the government to meet the minimum jurisdictional threshold of an original source.id.
we agree with bahrani on this point.neither the fca nor applicable case law indicated that a relator subjective belief was a component or element of the original source test as it existed at the time of the remand proceedings in this case.instead,as the language of the fca made clear,the relator simply had to establish that he had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his fca allegations we re based e b.as applied here,that means,given the rulings in bahrani i,which are the law of the case,that the jury should have been asked to decide whether bahrani had direct and independent knowledge that conagra employees were making major or significant changes to certificates and not whether he reasonably believed that the changes he actually observed were fraudulent.see generally rockwell,at emphasizing that qualification as an original source required the relator to have information upon which the relator allegations,as ultimately amended,were based.in other words,bahrani had to establish he was personally aware of at least one instance of a fraudulent certificate change,a major or significant certificate change glaser wound care consultants,cir.
assuming that bahrani can satisfy the first two prongs of the plain error test,we conclude he can not satisfy the third prong of that test,that the alleged error affected his substantial rights.the heart of bahrani original source evidence was his testimony that,although he worked exclusively in the hide documentation department and had never been trained to complete meat export certificates,he often visited employees he knew who worked in the nearby meat documentation department,and on more than one occasion observed employees in that department altering meat export certificates.at.specifically,bahrani testified he saw the use of,erasers being used,export certificates in the typewriters,id.at,and meat export certificates that had different typewritten face on them.id.at.bahrani also testified that on more than one occasion he heard lotfollah sabzevari,a supervisor in the meat documentation department,give a subordinate permission to change a usda meat export certificate.lastly,bahrani testified that on one occasion a country that was to receive hides from conagra insisted upon getting a meat export certificate.notably,bahrani conceded on that every time he changed a certificate,it was for the purposes of correcting erroneous information.bahrani further conceded that it was impossible to tell just by looking at an export certificate,even if it had a piece of eraser tape on it or a change in typeface or anything else,what precisely had happened with it,and whether or not a replacement certificate may ultimately have been issued for it.in short,bahrani knowledge of what transpired in the meat export certificates department was far too limited to allow a jury to reasonably find that he was an original source for his meat export certificate claims.thus,we conclude bahrani substantial rights were not adversely impacted by the district court instructional error 
c admission of evidence regarding bahrani prior litigation history 
in his third and final challenge to the jurisdictional trial proceedings on remand,bahrani contends the district court erred in allowing conagra to him regarding his participation in prior lawsuits.we review a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion,according deference to a district court familiarity with the details of the case and its greater experience in evidentiary matters.frederick swift transp,wl at cir quoting mgmt.mendelsohn.
prior to the jurisdictional trial,bahrani filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence of his litigation history.the district court granted bahrani motion in part to exclude testimony of bahrani alleging national origin discrimination against three employers filing lawsuits against two different employers alleging national origin discrimination filing discrimination charges against four prospective employers for not hiring him,ultimately suing two of them.at.the district court also granted bahrani motion to exclude evidence of his filing discrimination charges against two newspapers that ran ads for jobs for which he was not hired filing a grievance against a former lawyer and suing a former lawyer.id.at.the district court denied bahrani motion in part and agreed to permit evidence to show bias,prejudice that he has accused three employers of forcing him to falsify records or documents twice in litigation that he brought against those employers.id.the district court advised that its rulings were subject to change at trial and that bahrani should be very careful not to open the door to further inquiry.id.at.
bahrani was the first witness to testify at the jurisdictional trial.during his direct examination,he and his counsel engaged in the following exchange regarding his knowledge of rule disclosures,which pertained to the question of whether bahrani fca claims were based upon information publicly disclosed during the kim litigation in california,see bahrani i,at discussing kim litigation 
q.so may,you filed your false claims act case against the defendants.and i want to ask you in,august of when you went to the fbi,did you know what a false claims act case was 
no,i did not.
had you ever heard of the false claims act 
no,not until later.
q.you were that.also during opening statement waas conagra counsel talked to the jury about disclosures,rule disclosures in this case.do you recall that in his opening statement 
do you know what a rule disclosure is 
do you know what the purpose of a rule disclosure is 
a.it has something to do with disclosure.
q.did you prepare any rule disclosures in this case,you personally 
no,i did not.
do you know what the lawyers are required to disclose in a rule disclosure 
q.did you collect any or obtain any of the documents that are identified in the rule disclosure 
i do even know what they are.
well,you recall waas was relating that all of these documents came from the kim litigation.do you recall that 
q.did you obtain those documents from the kim litigation 
no,i did not.
q.did you review any documents from the kim litigation 
no,i did not.
okay.one other thing here.let see if i can find that.okay.it defendant exhibit k.this is what waas was talking about,the rule disclosure.you see that 
okay.and again,if we go to the back here,if we can get there,do you see the date on those disclosures 
okay.and again,is that before or after you filed this false claims act case 
well,i filed my false claims act case in,so it was almost two years later that this disclosure happened.
during,conagra counsel engaged in the following exchange with bahrani 
q.ulmer bahrani counsel showed those rule disclosures that i used in my opening statement that had all those references to the kim litigation 
q.ulmer asked you a little bit about whether you even knew what rule disclosures were,and i think you said you really do know.
all i know is it about disclosure.
q.bahrani,you have been involved in litigation before,have you 
yes,i have.
you,in fact,served as your own attorney in litigation,have you 
q.many times 
ulmer objection,your honor,relevance.
the court overruled.
i do remember how many times i represented myself.
take a stab.
i think three times,four times.
and how many times with a lawyer that you have worked with 
i do remember the total.
q.more than a dozen 
q.so you have been around the litigation block a few times,bahrani,have you 
q.as a plaintiff 
q.you understand the concept that in a lawsuit a plaintiff has to come forward with information to support their claim at some point,right 
and you may not know exactly which rule whatever sic that required someone to come forward with information in this case,but you are very familiar with that process,that if you make a claim you have to come forward and you have to say what supports your claim,right 
ulmer objection,your honor.i do think that what the testimony is and i think it irrelevant.
the court it not irrelevant.the direct testimony talked about his familiarity or lack there sic with the rules,discovery rules,rules of civil procedure.the objection to the last question,however,is sustained.you can rephrase.
q.bahrani,you are familiar with the disclosure process and how that works in litigation,are you 
i am generally,roughly familiar with it.
and you understand that when you are the plaintiff,when you are the party seeking recovery in a lawsuit,you have obligations to disclose information to the other side,correct 
and you know that because you have been the plaintiff in many cases.can we just say many 
bahrani now contends on appeal that a llowing this line of questioning on was error.aplt.br.at.specifically,bahrani contends the testimony was irrelevant because his prior lawsuits involved different types of cases,such as discrimination,and different defendants,such as former employers,prospective employers,and newspapers.id.at.beyond being irrelevant,bahrani also contends,evidence of his prior lawsuits is unfairly prejudicial,substantially outweighing any probative value.id.the risk,he contends,is that evidence of prior lawsuits persuades a jury to conclude that he simply acted in conformity with his purported character trait,and that his claims lacked merit.id.
bahrani arguments notwithstanding,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing conagra to bahrani regarding his prior litigation history.as noted by defendants,bahrani effectively opened the door to this by attempting to suggest to the jury,by way of his testimony that he was unfamiliar with the fca and knew essentially nothing about rule disclosures,that he was unfamiliar with the litigation process and that his motives in reporting conagra alleged fraud to the fbi were innocent,that he was not motivated by the desire to file suit against conagra 
hide export certificate trial issues 
bahrani contends the district court committed five errors during the hide export certificates trial a it erroneously excluded all evidence of official usda policy b it gave erroneous materiality instructions c it erroneously took judicial notice of the department of justice doj involvement in the case d it allowed a witness,not authorized by federal rule of evidence,to remain present during the trial and e it admitted the hearsay affidavit of a witness that did not fit into any exception to the hearsay rule.as we discuss below,however,none of these challenged rulings constitute reversible error.
a exclusion of usda policy 
bahrani contends t he district court erroneously excluded evidence of usda policy by striking testimony of joyce bowling,an assistant director for the technical trade services department of the usda animal plant health inspection service aphis,and excluding government documents reflecting that policy aplt.br.at.we review for abuse of discretion the district court evidentiary rulings.frederick,wl at.
following this court decision and remand in bahrani i,bahrani located a new witness,bowling,to testify on his behalf regarding the issue of what certificate changes were major or significant and thus violative of the fca under the law of the case.in turn,bahrani filed a pleading with the district court indicating he intended to present bowling as a witness at trial and stating she would testify that,according to a memo she drafted and purportedly distributed to usda area offices and veterinarians,usda memorandum,the making of any changes to hide export certificates was a prohibited practice.in other words,bahrani sought to present testimony from bowling that all certificate changes were significant or major.conagra moved for an order prohibiting bowling from so testifying.in support,conagra argued that this court in bahrani i had already considered and rejected bahrani assertion that all certificate changes were prohibited under the fca,and that bowling proposed testimony was thus in conflict with bahrani 
the district court held a hearing on conagra motion.the district court stated at the outset that it was not going to consider or reconsider the legal standards articulated and applied by the tenth circuit in bahrani i,certainly not before trial.at.bahrani counsel argued that the decision in bahrani i was b ased in sic the limited summary judgment record,the snapshot in,id.at,and that the record developed since was different and should be submitted to the jury.id.at.bahrani counsel further argued that n either the tenth circuit nor the district court ha d made any findings of law on usda policy,and that bowling would testify regarding usda policy specifically that it was contrary to the conclusions reached by this court in bahrani i.id.at.the district court ultimately rejected bahrani position and granted conagra motion.in doing so,the district court stated 
but i can not read the tenth circuit opinion the way that the relator wants me to read in this case.it is totally inadmissible whether bowling thinks there is no such thing as a minor change or not.the court of appeals has spoken,and at in its conclusion under part the court says this,and i quote 
as applied to these circumstances we read section a more narrowly than bahrani,but more broadly than conagra.like the district court,we are not persuaded that every change to a signed export certificate made by a conagra employee creates an obligation under the statute.however,to the extent that conagra employees made major or significant changes without applying for in lieu of or replacement certificates,they avoided an obligation under section a.
we emphasize that the appropriate inquiry is,it not a policy issue.i am interposing that statement.
to continue with the quote,because of their interpretations of the regulatory scheme,both bahrani and conagra have advanced arguments that pertain to all changes to original export certificates no matter how extensive.in our view,however,whether a given change to an original certificate triggers a a obligation depends upon the nature of the change,whether it is major or significant and thus requires a new certificate.although many of the unauthorized changes alleged by bahrani appear to be minor,there is evidence that at least some of them fell within the major or significant class.further development of the record is required to determine the extent to which conagra employees made major or significant changes without obtaining in lieu of or replacement certificates and paying the accompanying fee.
we have to have a trial in which the hide certificates are examined and determine whether they contain major or minor changes and if major,then they are required to apparently get the fee and whatever damage might ensue from that.
but the testimony of bowling,or the proposed testimony,to the effect that all changes require the certificate will not be admitted,and the motion is granted to that extent.
and i have to instruct the jury that as a matter of law decided by the tenth circuit,not policy,which wo go before them,but as a matter of law a legal obligation occurs only when there is a major change,and the jury decision will have to be based upon expert testimony.it can not be and it would be highly prejudicial to have some government official come in at the eleventh hour after all the discovery and say they all major.that is a direct contradiction of what the instructions are to us.
so,as i indicated,she will not be allowed to testify to that at all.
i do know whether you bahrani are going to try to call bowling or not.but i can tell you she going to be on a very short leash,and any attempt on her part to contravene or attempt to contravene the holding as i have read it and as i interpret it will be met with severe response.so i do know if you want to call her or not,that up to you.
id.at.the district court subsequently issued a written order reiterating its conclusions.aplee.at because only the making of a major or significant change to an export certificate triggers a a obligation for purposes of fca liability,bowling testimony that there is no such thing as a minor or authorized change under the usda regulatory scheme does not justify a change in the tenth circuit reasoning or the law of the case.
at trial,bahrani proceeded to present bowling as a witness.bowling testified,among other things,about how export certificates are reissued and the frequency with which certificates are reissued.although bahrani counsel sought to question her about the contents of usda memorandum,the district court prohibited him from doing so.at.the district court also prohibited bahrani counsel from questioning bowling about the specific hide export certificates at issue in the case.id.at.indeed,the district court ruled that bowling could not testify at trial as an expert witness because she did not,prior to trial,file a proper expert report id.at.
on appeal,bahrani contends the district court erred in interpreting bowling proposed testimony as inconsistent with bahrani i.more specifically,he contends that this court in bahrani i clearly did not anticipate that all of the evidence that would be developed had been developed and there would be no further the record in time.aplt.br.at.
we reject bahrani contentions.as the district court correctly noted in precluding bowling proposed testimony,bahrani i expressly rejected bahrani argument that every change necessitated a new certificate.at concluding that bahrani submitted evidence d id not support the theory that new certificates are required every time a correction must be made,we therefore do not agree with bahrani expansive reading of the usda statutes and regulations.further,bahrani i held that only major or significant changes necessitated a new certificate.id.at.although the bahrani i decision employed the phrase we conclude from this record,and also stated that f urther development of the record wa s required,id.at,nothing in bahrani i indicated that bahrani was free to gather additional evidence for the purpose of reasserting that all export certificate changes required replacement certificates.rather,the clear import of bahrani i was that the parties would engage in additional limited discovery regarding only the extent to which con a gra employees made major or significant changes without obtaining in lieu of or replacement certificates and paying the accompanying fee.id.although bahrani and bowling clearly disagreed with bahrani i distinction between major or significant changes and other minor certificate changes,they were bound by that ruling under the law of the case doctrine,as was the district court.see mcilravy coal,cir the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.quotations,alterations,and citations omitted.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding bowling from testifying.
b instruction major or significant change 
bahrani next contends the district court gave what bahrani describes as an erroneous and prejudicial materiality instruction,i,instruction,during the hide export certificates trial.we review de novo whether the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the applicable law.gonzales,at.
instruction,entitled major or significant,stated as follows 
as you have already been told,there is no requirement under usda statutes or regulations that an exporter must obtain a replacement certificate every time a change to an existing certificate is made.it is the law of this case that only the making of major or significant changes triggers an obligation to obtain and pay for a replacement certificate.
that is not to say that the law allows exporters to change certificates at will or that it is not unlawful to do so.there are,in fact,laws that prohibit exporters from making any kind of unauthorized change or alteration to a certificate and which subject exporters to administrative fines and penalties if they do so.these laws say nothing,however,about replacement certificates and say nothing about when an exporter who wishes to make a change to a certificate must get a replacement certificate to do so.for this reason,it is not a con a gra employee making of a correction or change to a certificate that creates an obligation under the law to obtain a replacement certificate and pay the fee at issue in this case.instead,that obligation arises from the discovery,by the employee making the correction,that a major or significant change is necessary.
you will hear considerable testimony from various witnesses about what does and does not constitute a major or significant change to a hide export certificate.all i can tell you about what major or significant means is that it embodies a principle of materiality.something is material if it has the tendency to influence or persuade a person to act in a certain way.as it is contemplated in this case,a major or significant change is one that would have influenced or persuaded the certifying official that a replacement certificate was,in fact,required.
at.bahrani objected to the last sentence of the last paragraph of the instruction,asserting that the word would should be replaced with the word could.id.at.bahrani objection was overruled and the instruction was given as originally worded by the district court.
bahrani argues on appeal that instruction use of the word would instead of could impermissibly increased the standard beyond that required by bahrani i,elevating the standard from one focusing on the potential effect of the change and a tendency to influence,to one requiring certainty.aplt.br.at.bahrani further argues that u se of the word would in reference to the certifying official impermissibly emphasized the importance of an individual official decision rather than keeping the proper focus on agency action.id.italics in original.in sum,bahrani asserts,t his instruction conflicts not only with the decision in bahrani i,but also with the intent of the fca.id.
to date,we have never directly addressed whether civil claims under the fca incorporate a materiality element and,if so,what the proper test is for materiality that said,the decision in bahrani i referred to the concept of materiality by concluding that there is a certain class of certificate changes,major or significant changes,that require replacement certificates.at emphasis added.indeed,bahrani i held that t his agreed description of the circumstances in which the usda requires exporters to obtain new certificates adopts a has been widely employed in various circumstances,including false claims act actions.id.
the instruction now challenged by bahrani clearly tracks bahrani i by informing the jury that the terms major and significant embod y a principle of materiality.as for the instruction use of the phrase would have influenced,instead of the could have influenced language suggested by bahrani,we conclude this language was necessary to properly enforce bahrani i distinction between major or significant changes and other,minor changes that did not require the issuance of a new certificate.as conagra persuasively argues,if the instruction had said could have influenced,it would have effectively allowed bahrani to argue as he persisted in doing below and continues to attempt to do on appeal that literally all certificate changes were major or significant a position clearly foreclosed by bahrani thus,in sum,the challenged instruction was consistent with,and indeed mandated by,bahrani i.
bahrani also complains about instruction use of the phrase certifying official,arguing it should have instead utilized the terms an agency official or an official action on behalf of the agency.aplt.br.at.notably,however,bahrani failed to assert that objection below,and indeed effectively invited the alleged error by proposing that the district court refer to the united states government official who endorsed the original certificate.dist.doc.proposed instr.thus,we decline to address bahrani argument.
c designation of mark gustafson as defendants representative 
bahrani contends the district court erred in allowing mark gustafson to appear as defendants representative and remain present during the testimony of other witnesses at both trials,rather than being sequestered.we review for abuse of discretion a district court sequestration decisions.see united states samuels,cir.
federal rule of evidence authorizes a district court to order witnesses excluded so that they can not hear the testimony of other witnesses.the rule also exempts certain classes of witnesses from sequestration orders.in particular,subsections and of rule provide that a sequestration order does not apply to an officer or employee of a party which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney or a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party cause id.
at the beginning of the jurisdictional trial in this case,bahrani counsel asked that the witnesses be sequestered pursuant to rule.the district court granted that motion.gustafson,who worked at conagra greeley,colorado facility continuously throughout its ownership by conagra,including during the time frame relevant to the claims asserted by bahrani remained in the courtroom,as defendants representative,throughout the jurisdictional trial.gustafson testified at the trial and was asked by defense counsel to respond to various witnesses testimony.
on the first day of the hide export certificates trial,prior to the admission of any evidence,bahrani counsel objected to gustafson appearing as a representative for conagra and sitting at conagra table throughout the trial.in support,bahrani counsel argued that gustafson was no longer an officer or employee of any of the corporate defendants in the case and had not been since.at.the district court denied bahrani request,stating i think each side entitled to have an advisory witness,and the designated witness can be present throughout the trial to assist counsel.it would be grossly unfair,in my view,to require the defendants to have some representative of the company who knew absolutely nothing about the case or was there to try and advise them.id.at.
we conclude the district court acted well within its discretion in allowing gustafson to remain in the courtroom throughout both trials.as noted by defendants,it appears that the current owner of the greeley facility,jbs,even though never named as a party defendant,is financially responsible for this litigation and is therefore the real party in interest.aplee.at.consequently,gustafson effectively qualified as a party representative under the terms of rule.alternatively,gustafson could reasonably be classified as a person whose presence is shown by the defendants to be essential to the presentation of the ir cause,and thus fell within the exception outlined in rule.more specifically,he was,as noted by defendants,the person most knowledgeable about the history and complex factual details of the matters at issue,and with whom counsel needed to confer during trial,the defendants designated representative in the kim case,the employee responsible for coordinating the usda investigation,and the only witness with direct personal knowledge about the scope of that critical issue in the jurisdictional trial because of the requirement,and in the hide export certificates trial because of the government knowledge instruction.aplee.br.at.
d judicial notice of government position on allowing changes 
during the of bowling at the hide export certificates trial,defense counsel asked bowling,are you aware that prior to your testimony today,there not a single instance in the history of this lawsuit where the department of agriculture has ever taken the position that a veterinarian should have declined to make minor changes to hide export certificates.at.bowling responded,i do know what the justice department has done previously.id.at.defense counsel then asked the district court to take judicial notice that in pleadings filed in this case to date,the history of the case,the usda has never taken the position that minor changes can not be made to export certificates,in any pleading they filed.id.the district court responded as follows 
i can take judicial notice of the files.let me explain,ladies and gentlemen of the jury,what that means.
judicial notice,which i explained in the instructions when i read them all to you,relates to certain things that we can take as proved,the simplest one would be a commonly accepted geographic or meteorological fact,such as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.another one is that we can say that the postal service stretching it,but,you know,that they deliver mail.
then one of the things we can do is to take judicial notice of the court files,so rather than bring all the files here,i can say,that the case,and you can accept it as true.how much weight you give to it,what you do with it,is entirely up to you.
but i do take judicial notice of the files and i do take judicial notice of the statement made by defense counsel,that there is nothing in the files that,that relates to the department of justice taking a position on this.
bahrani now contends on appeal that the district court erred in taking judicial notice of this fact.according to bahrani,t he evidence was wholly irrelevant and was presented completely out of context,unfairly and unduly prejudicing him and misleading the jury.aplt.br.at.more specifically,bahrani complains that t aking judicial notice that the doj did not take a position that minor changes were prohibited inferred that the usda had no policy,or at a minimum,the policy was unclear,or that the government was not interested in the outcome.id.relatedly,bahrani argues that w hether the doj intervenes,or actively takes a position in an fca case is irrelevant because it does not make any fact at issue more likely true than not.id.
generally speaking,a district court decision whether to take judicial notice of facts is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states williams,cir.here,however,bahrani counsel did not assert a contemporaneous objection to the district court decision to take judicial notice.accordingly,we review the district court decision only for plain error.united states foust,cir.
after examining the record on appeal,we agree with bahrani that the district court erred,in the course of explaining its action to the jury,by referring to the department of justice rather than the usda.but we in turn conclude that this error was not prejudicial to bahrani,since the jury heard both defense counsel questioning of bowling and defense counsel subsequent and detailed request for the district court to take judicial notice,all of which expressly referred to the usda rather than the doj.
that minor error aside,we conclude the district court did not err in taking judicial notice that the usda had never taken an official position regarding whether minor certificate changes were prohibited.although bahrani suggests the usda did take the position that such changes were prohibited,aplt.br.at,and notes that he proffered bowling testimony to that effect,that testimony was properly excluded by the district court as inconsistent with the holdings in bahrani i.in other words,as we have noted,the district court and parties were bound under the law of the case doctrine by bahrani i legal determination that minor certificate changes were not violative of the fca reverse false claims provision.
e admissibility of brad schmeh affidavit 
lastly,bahrani contends the district court erred in admitting at the hide export certificates trial an affidavit from an individual named brad schmeh.as previously noted,w e review a district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion,according deference to a district court familiarity with the details of the case and its greater experience in evidentiary matters.frederick,wl at internal quotation marks omitted.
at the time of trial,schmeh was the owner and operations manager of interlogistix,a freight forwarder responsible for facilitating the transportation and export of conagra beef company animal hides from its various beef plants,sic to various importing countries.at.schmeh affidavit outlined the export process employed by interlogistix.id.at.the affidavit then discussed the topic of errors in and changes to hide export certificates 
occasionally,it comes to my attention that i have made a typographical error or otherwise included incorrect information on the export certificate,such as a transposition of numbers in the container number,or a consignee name spelled incorrectly.i then contact the usda veterinarian,give him the certificate number,and request permission from conagra to make changes.once i have received permission,i fax a copy of the changed certificate to the veterinarian.an example of this type of request and permission is illustrated in the email attached hereto as exhibit,which was sent to and received from diemer of aphis in lakewood,colorado.
on every occasion that i have requested permission to make corrections on an export certificate,the aphis veterinarian has granted that permission.
in some circumstances,i do obtain a replacement or certificate,rather than making changes directly on the certificate.those circumstances would include situations where the customer needs an entirely different shipment,or if the weights used for the hides are completely wrong as opposed to one digit being incorrect or transposed.
the attached messages referred to in schmeh affidavit were between schmeh and ian stewart,a usda veterinarian,and between schmeh and a conagra employee.id.at.in the first message,schmeh stated to stewart,in pertinent part please note that conagra needs to change a digit on a container number once they have made the change,i will fax a copy for your file.please just respond saying ok.id.the second message,from stewart to schmeh,stated simply ok.id.in the third and final message,schmeh forwarded a copy of the first two messages to a conagra employee and wrote here is the ok from the usda to change the hide certificate.please fax me the revised copy on monday.id.
prior to trial,bahrani moved to exclude both the affidavit and the exhibit on the grounds of relevance and hearsay.the district court denied that motion.bahrani then moved to reconsider,this time agreeing to stipulate to foundation for the exhibit,but continuing to object to admission of the affidavit.the district court denied the motion to reconsider and admitted both the affidavit and accompanying exhibit pursuant to federal rule of evidence 
bahrani contends the district court erred in admitting the affidavit pursuant to rule,arguing that factual recitations of events and the belief as to the cause of the events do not meet the exception.aplt.br.at citing allen sybase,cir.we agree.rule permits the admission of a statement of the declarant then existing state of mind,emotion,sensation,or physical condition such as intent,plan,motive,design,mental feeling,pain,and bodily health.in other words,rule permits an statement regarding a declarant state of mind where the statement serves as evidence of the declarant intent to perform an act.allen,at.schmeh affidavit does not fit within this exception because it does not outline schmeh state of mind,nor was it presented by defendants for the purposes of evidencing schmeh intent to perform a particular act.moreover,although defendants argue on appeal that schmeh affidavit was not used to prove the truth of the matter asserted,aplee.br.at,that is refuted by the record.indeed,the record indicates that schmeh affidavit was offered by defendants precisely to demonstrate,at least in part,that its freight forwarders routinely requested and received permission from usda veterinarians to make changes to hide export certificates.
the question then becomes whether the erroneous admission of schmeh affidavit was harmless.evidentiary errors are not grounds for reversal unless the aggrieved party shows the admission of the evidence was not harmless.aviation underwriters,pilatus bus.aircraft,cir.bahrani only assertion of prejudice is that,b y allowing the affidavit,the district court insulated schmeh from where he would have been forced to admit it was obvious to him no changes were allowed without permission the veterinarian could have denied permission and withholding permission would have required a replacement certificate and payment of a fee.aplt.br.at italics in original.but bahrani counsel was able to argue these points to the jury at the hide export certificates trial,notwithstanding the fact that schmeh did not appear as a witness moreover,as noted by defendants,schmeh description of how he handled certificate changes was echoed by several other witnesses without objection from bahrani.thus,we conclude the district court error was harmless.
appeal defendants 
defendants assert three issues in their,all of which focus on the hide export certificates portion of the remand proceedings.first,defendants contend the district court erred in entering judgment against them in light of the fact that the jury at the hide export certificates trial found,in response to a special interrogatory on the verdict form,that no hide export certificates were changed by defendants employees for the purpose of avoiding an obligation to the government.second,defendants contend that the fines and penalties assessed against them at the hide export certificates trial violate the eighth amendment and the due process clause.third,defendants contend the district court erred in failing to exclude evidence of certificates that were changed by defendants after the period of bahrani employment with conagra.as outlined in greater detail below,we agree with defendants that the jury findings at the hide export certificates trial entitled them to judgment as a matter of law on bahrani hide export certificates claims.consequently,it is unnecessary for us to address the remaining two issues asserted by defendants in their.
allison applicable scienter requirement 
defendants first raised the issue of the proper scienter requirement in a i,pretrial motion for summary judgment based upon the supreme court june,decision in allison engine united states.the district court summarily denied the motion with the admonition that the issue raised w ould need to be addressed in the context of drafting appropriate jury instructions.dist.doc.at.the district court subsequently issued a pretrial order entitled order re scienter standard,aplee.at,that concluded as follows 
to summarize,the scienter requirement will be articulated as the act of making a major or significant change or correction to a hide export certificate without getting a replacement when the actor either knew at the time he discovered a change was necessary that the change required getting a replacement certificate knew major or significant changes required replacement certificates but was deliberately ignorant of whether the particular change made fell into that category or knew major or significant changes required replacement certificates but acted in reckless disregard of whether the change fell into that category.i apply this standard out of an abundance of caution and am aware that allison engine may support the imposition of a higher specific intent level of scienter for reverse false claims under the act.however,it will be for the tenth circuit to hold bahrani to this higher standard,not me.
at trial,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure based upon allison engine.at your honor,our motion relates to the evidence relating to whether the conagra employees making the changes had any purpose or intent to avoid a fee for replacement certificates.i t is absolutely clear that there is no evidence to support any finding that the conagra employees acted with any purpose,or intent to avoid a fee for replacement certificates.consistent with its pretrial rulings,the district court denied those motions,but included on the verdict form a special interrogatory that asked the jury,how many of the hide export certificates containing major or significant changes,for which no replacement certificate was obtained,do you find by a preponderance of the evidence were changed with the intent or purpose of concealing,avoid or decreasing the obligation to secure and pay for a replacement certificate.at.at the conclusion of all the evidence,the jury found that only five out of the certificates at issue contained major or significant changes.the jury also found that none of these five certificates were changed with the intent or purpose of concealing,avoiding,or decreasing the obligation to secure and pay for
