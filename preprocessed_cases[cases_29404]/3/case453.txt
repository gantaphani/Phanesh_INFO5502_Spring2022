plaintiff and appellant drakes bay oyster company company appeals from the lower court denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction and to disqualify certain california coastal commission commission staff members from participating in the litigation below,whether as the commission client representatives or counsel,and from communicating confidentially with the commission regarding the litigation.the company contends that,as a matter of law,these staff members participation in the litigation after they advocated for enforcement orders against the company in commission proceedings violates the company due process rights as articulated in cases such as morongo band of mission indians state water resources control bd.cal th,morongo.we conclude that the cases on which the company relies do not support its position.those cases address a party due process right to a fair and impartial decision maker in administrative proceedings and require separation of prosecutorial functions from advisory functions during such proceedings.the cases do not concern litigation conduct of an administrative agency and its staff when the agency is a party to that litigation.in that context,the agency is not acting as a decision maker,nor can its staff assistance affect the fairness and impartiality of the decision maker,which is the court.the company argument that the commission might in the future take further enforcement actions is too speculative and involves circumstances too uncertain to deprive it now of its staff assistance in the litigation.for these reasons,we conclude that the company has not shown a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its claim and affirm the superior court order.
background 
in the company purchased the assets of the johnson oyster company johnson and took over operation of a mariculture facility in and adjacent to drakes estero,a series of estuarial bays located in point reyes national seashore in marin county,california.drakes bay oyster jewell cir.
the company drakes estero facility is located on a site that is owned by the federal government and within the commission permitting jurisdiction.johnson,and then the company,operated this facility under a agreement with the federal government that expired in.the secretary of the interior decided not to renew the agreement,and the company challenged that decision in court.the district court denied the company request for a preliminary injunction,which the ninth circuit affirmed in drakes bay oyster jewell,supra.according to the commission,in the company and the federal government entered into a consent decree pursuant to which the company closed its facility.regardless,this litigation has continued.
in,before the company began operating the facility,the commission issued an order to johnson requiring that it cease and desist engaging in unpermitted development on the site.after the company took over the facility,it and the commission began addressing development issues.
in,the company submitted an application to the commission seeking a permit for the company operations and improvements to its retail operations.however,the commission repeatedly found the company application to be incomplete.
subsequently,the commission issued a consent order in which the company agreed to stop certain development.however,the parties continued to have unresolved issues.in late,the commission sent the company a notice of intent to commence cease and desist and restoration order proceedings regarding unpermitted development by the company.
in february,the commission held a hearing in these enforcement proceedings.commission staff lisa haage,heather johnston and alex helperin collectively,the enforcement staff advocated that the commission issue certain orders.as stated by helperin in his april declaration filed in the litigation below helperin served as senior staff counsel for the commission,having served as staff counsel since,represented the commission enforcement division since and worked on issues related to the company since.haage was an attorney who was chief of enforcement for the commission.johnston was the commission northern california enforcement supervisor,having previously served as a statewide enforcement analyst.apparently,johnston too is an attorney.
the enforcement staff recommended orders addressed in what was described as unpermitted development undertaken or maintained by the company in violation of the california coastal act of pub.res.code,et,some of which is also a violation of orders previously issued for the facility.this included the operation of offshore aquaculture facilities the processing and sale of the product of aquaculture operations and other related operations construction,installation,and alteration of structures landform alteration and additional unpermitted development undertaken inconsistent with the consent order,including installation of unpermitted development,the presence of boat traffic in the lateral sand bar channel near the mouth of drakes estero during a seasonal restriction established for harbor seal pupping sites and discharge of marine debris in the form of abandoned,discarded,or fugitive aquaculture materials.the recommended orders would require the company to undertake a number of measures,including specifying operating conditions to protect coastal resources and addressing coastal act permitting requirements.they would also require the company to cease and desist from conducting any further unpermitted development remove specified items of u npermitted d evelopment limit their operations while they seek coastal act authorization implement enumerated resource protection measures apply for a coastal development permit to obtain permanent authorization for limited,specified development and operations that may be consistent with the coastal act and if required to vacate the premises under separate requirements,prepare and implement a plan to manage that process consistent with the coastal act.at the conclusion of the hearing,the commission voted unanimously to issue the orders recommended by its enforcement staff enforcement orders.
in april,the company filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief in marin county superior court,challenging the enforcement orders.in nine causes of action,the company alleged the commission had infringed on the jurisdiction of the state department of fish and wildlife and violated the coastal act,the company due process rights,ceqa and commission regulations.the court consolidated the case with another petition filed at the same time by two other parties,phyllis faber and the alliance for local sustainable agriculture alliance,which contained essentially the same claims.
in may,the commission filed a against the company.as subsequently amended,it asserted four causes of action alleging the company had violated the coastal act and sought injunctive relief,civil penalties,exemplary damages and attorney fees.
in january,the company and faber and the alliance filed a against the commission.as subsequently amended on march,it asserted seven causes of action alleging the commission violated the consent order,the coastal act and the company due process rights and sought injunctive and declaratory relief,civil penalties and attorney fees in its due process cause of action,the company alleged that the commission had a policy or de facto policy that allowed staff attorneys who acted as prosecutors in enforcement proceedings against a person to act as advisors to other staff acting as advisors in that matter and in factually related matters,including the person permit application,and that staff attorneys who prosecuted against the company were acting as advisors to other staff and the commission about the company permit application.
the company,on march,the same day that it filed its amended,moved for a preliminary injunction,based apparently on this due process cause of action,to enjoin the enforcement staff from advising other staff or the commission regarding the company permit application and from advising the commission in the litigation,and to disqualify the enforcement staff from representing the commission in the litigation.in its motion,the company contended that the commission purported policy of allowing enforcement staff to also advise the commission on related permit proceedings violated the company due process rights,and that allowing the enforcement staff to continue representing and advising the commission in the litigation appeared ed improper and violate d the rule.in its supporting papers,the company also argued that its due process rights were being violated by the enforcement staff members participation in the litigation after their prosecution of the company before the commission.
the commission opposed the company motion.it argued it was entitled to confer in the litigation with the enforcement staff,two of whom happened to be attorneys and one who was staff counsel,and that the due process rules governing adjudicatory hearings in which the commission is the decision maker did not apply to the subsequent litigation in which the commission was a party and the court was the decision maker.
on june,the superior court denied the company motion because the company had not shown a likelihood of prevailing on the merits.it made the following factual findings the enforcement staff was not acting as the commission legal counsel in the litigation there was no evidence that the enforcement staff was advising the commission or the commission permitting staff on issues involving the company incomplete permit application the company did not show that the commission procedures or policies deprived coastal development permit holders or permit applicants a fair hearing before the commission and the rule was not violated because the enforcement staff members were not advocates in the litigation.
also on june,the court,having conducted a lengthy hearing in april,ruled on the merits of the consolidated petitions but not on the the court ruled on various arguments by the company and the commission that we need not discuss here.the core of its ruling was that the commission had the jurisdiction and authority to issue its enforcement orders,except that it should have conducted a california environmental quality act ceqa review regarding four ordered removal activities because of their potentially significant environmental impact due to unusual circumstances.these activities consisted of removing the invasive didemnum organism,all triploidy manila clams,abandoned cultivation equipment and unpermitted onshore structures,fixtures and equipment.the court held these components of its enforcement orders were severable and stayed enforcement of them unless and until the commission conducted a proper ceqa review.
on august,the company filed a timely notice of appeal from the court denial of its preliminary injunction motion.while this appeal was pending,the company requested that we take judicial notice of four documents a june,memorandum by an assistant attorney general to the commission executive director informally advising about certain legal issues an august,memorandum by the commission chief counsel an august,memorandum prepared for the company counsel about a presentation made by the commission deputy chief counsel,all regarding ex parte communications in administrative enforcement proceedings and meeting agendas from commission meetings occurring from june to december.we took this request,which is unopposed by the commission,under submission.we now deny it because these documents,which in any event are not necessarily judicially noticeable,were not before the court when it considered the company motion and do not constitute legal authority therefore,we disregard the company arguments to the extent they rely on these documents.
discussion 
the company raised a number of issues in its motion below,but on appeal it challenges only the lower court rejection of the company request that the court enjoin and disqualify the enforcement staff from participating in the litigation on due process grounds.regarding this issue,the parties debate a number of subjects.we need not address all of them because the company appeal poses a dispositive question as a matter of law,does the three enforcement staff members participation in the litigation after they had prosecuted the company in commission enforcement proceedings violate the company due process rights we conclude it does not because the staff members participation merely helps the commission act as a party in litigation and not as a decision maker in a administrative proceeding regarding the company interests.

b.the law regarding agency staff acting in prosecutor and advisor roles 
the parties debate the significance of several california supreme court and appellate cases to the present circumstances.all of these cases,including our supreme court decision in morongo,supra,cal th,address a party due process rights in a administrative proceeding to an impartial review and decision by the administrative decision maker and in essence hold that an agency staff may not act so as to create either the unacceptable risk of,or actual,bias by such a decision maker.
in howitt superior court th howitt,an employee in the midst of a grievance proceeding before a administrative tribunal that resolved county employment disputes argued in a writ petition that the county counsel office should be barred from representing his employer and advising the tribunal at the same time.id.at.the appellate court expressed due process concerns about county counsel dual role because b y definition,an advocate is a partisan for a particular client or point of view.the role is inconsistent with true objectivity,a constitutionally necessary characteristic of an adjudicator.id.at.thus,this dual role does violence to the constitutional ideal of a supposedly neutral decision maker.id.at.the court concluded,performance of both roles by the same law office is appropriate only if there are assurances that the adviser for the decision maker is screened from any inappropriate contact with the advocate.ibid.
in nightlife partners,supra,th,operators of an adult entertainment business applied to the city for renewal of a permit,which the city denied.the appellate court affirmed the lower court ruling that the operators due process rights were violated because there was substantial evidence that the assistant city attorney who played an active and significant part in denying the renewal application also advised and assisted the hearing officer in reviewing that denial.id.at.the court rejected the city contention that there can be no due process violation absent actual bias on the part of the decision maker.id at.the attorney presence as the hearing officer advisor was the equivalent of trial counsel acting as an appellate court advisor during the appellate court review of the propriety of a lower court judgment in favor of that counsel client.it requires no citation of authority exactly on all fours with this fact pattern in order to justify the conclusion that the attorney role as advisor to the decision maker violated petitioners right to due process.there was a clear appearance of unfairness and bias.this was sufficient to support the trial court ruling.id.at.
in quintero city of santa ana th quintero,disapproved in morongo,supra,cal th,fn,as later summarized in morongo,a city employee quintero appealed a misconduct discharge to the city personnel board.after a hearing,the personnel board upheld the discharge.quintero then petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate,arguing that the administrative hearing before the personnel board was unfair because the deputy city attorney halford who had acted as prosecutor had concurrently represented the personnel board in civil actions.quintero,at.the superior court denied the petition,but on quintero appeal the court of appeal reversed,finding a clear appearance of bias and unfairness at the administrative hearing.ibid.
after acknowledging there was no evidence that halford had also acted as the city personnel board legal adviser in the quintero discharge matter,the court proceeded to examine halford other interactions with the personnel board.quintero,supra,th at.the court concluded that in litigation over the discharge of two other city employees,cabrera and pollitt,internal separation of advisory and prosecutorial functions had not been maintained because halford had represented the personnel board in superior court mandate proceedings after acting as a prosecutor in administrative proceedings before that board.id.at.the court also noted that halford had played a leading role in advising the personnel board about revision of its procedural rules and had acted as the personnel board legal adviser in other important matters during the years immediately preceding quintero discharge.id.at.
stating that i t appears the lines distinguishing halford roles of advocate and adviser have become blurred,the court of appeal in quintero stated that f or the personnel board to allow its legal adviser to also act as an advocate before it creates a substantial risk that the personnel board s judgment in the case before it will be skewed in favor of the prosecution.quintero,supra,th at.the court explained its holding in these words we do not hold that the frequent contacts between halford and the personnel board are themselves sufficient to demonstrate the probability of actual bias.rather,our decision is based on the totality of circumstances.ibid.morongo,supra,cal th at.
in department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th department of alcoholic beverage control,our supreme court considered a procedure employed by the department of alcoholic beverage control for license enforcement matters.an evidentiary hearing was held before an administrative law judge who made factual findings.after the hearing but before a decision was made,the department prosecutor sent a summary of the hearing and a recommended resolution of the matter ex parte to the ultimate administrative decision maker the department director or delegee or the decision maker advisor.id.at.the court concluded this ex parte communication was improper because,while administrative agencies have considerable leeway in how they structure their adjudicatory functions,they may not disregard certain basic precepts.one fairness principle directs that in adjudicative matters,one adversary should not be permitted to bend the ear of the ultimate decision maker or the decision maker advisers in private.id.at.the court held that the administrative procedure act code,et apa,as overhauled in,adopted this and other precepts of fairness,and barred such ex parte communications.department of alcoholic beverage control,at.
finally,in morongo,supra,cal th,the morongo mission band of indians,appearing in a license revocation proceeding before the state water resources board sought to disqualify the enforcement team of attorneys prosecuting its license revocation because one of the enforcement attorneys was concurrently acting as an adviser to the board in a separate,unrelated matter.id.at,fn.there was no evidence this arrangement caused actual bias.the court rejected the appellate court adoption of a due process standard that called for complete separation of an agency enforcement and advisory functions not only as to each individual case,but also as to all cases,related or unrelated,that are pending before the agency at any given point of time.id.at see id.at.instead,construing the constitutional due process right to an impartial tribunal,we take a more practical and less pessimistic view of human nature in general and of state administrative agency adjudicators in particular.in the absence of financial or other personal interest,and when rules mandating an agency internal separation of functions and prohibiting ex parte communications are observed,the presumption of impartiality can be overcome only by specific evidence demonstrating actual bias or a particular combination of circumstances creating an unacceptable risk of bias.id.at.the court found no such circumstances in the case before it because there was no evidence the attorney acted in both capacities in this or any other single adjudicative proceeding,she had previously advised the board in only one matter and she was just one of a group of staff attorneys who provided advice to the board.id.at.the court distinguished quintero and disapproved of its language suggesting the existence of a per se rule barring agency attorneys from simultaneously exercising advisory and prosecutorial functions,even in unrelated proceedings.morongo,at,fn.
as our discussion of this case law indicates,the due process concern these cases address is whether the impartiality of an administrative decision maker might be affected by a prosecuting attorney who also advises the decision maker in the course of the administrative proceeding or has advised the decision maker so frequently in other proceedings as to create an unacceptable risk of bias or actual bias that affects the result of the administrative proceeding.our supreme court and appellate courts have held the due process right to an impartial administrative decision maker is protected when staff counsel performing a prosecutorial role are distinct from counsel playing an advisory role in the same matter and the two are screened from each other.an exception may occur where staff counsel has advised the decision maker for so long or so frequently as to create an unacceptable risk of,or actual,bias when he or she then performs the role of prosecutor before that same administrative tribunal.the impartiality of the decision maker is further protected when ex parte communications between a prosecutor and the decision maker about substantive issues in the administrative proceeding do not occur before the decision is made.
the company argues the lower court erred as a matter of law by not barring the enforcement staff from participating in the litigation on the commission behalf and from advising the commission confidentially about the litigation subject matter.we disagree and conclude the court did not err in denying the company motion.
before addressing this issue directly,we first for clarity sake discuss a point the company raises and then drops in its appellate papers.that is,it first contends that,contrary to the lower court determination,the enforcement staff acted as the commission legal counsel in the litigation as indicated by appearances noted in the court register of actions.it further contends there was no evidence to the contrary,since the commission counsel merely argued at the motion hearing that the enforcement staff were client representatives rather than legal counsel.however,in its reply brief,the company concedes the point and states there are legal,but not factual,issues between the parties while nonetheless asserting that the commission credibility is suspect given the appearances noted in the register of actions.in any event,the superior court determination that the enforcement staff did not act as commission counsel in the litigation is supported by substantial evidence specifically,a declaration by the commission legal counsel stating that none of the enforcement staff acted as legal
