this is the second time we have heard an appeal in this matter.in our first opinion,we concluded that the food and drug administration fda had failed to adequately explain why it granted philips roxane,new animal drug application for bacitracin zinc see pharma.shalala.in this opinion,we conclude that the explanation the fda offered on remand adequately addressed the questions raised in our first opinion.nonetheless,we agree with appellant alpharma,that the fda explanation raises new problems and apparent contradictions that,unfortunately,require yet another remand.
the tortured story of this case is recounted at length in our previous opinion,pharma,at,and in two district court opinions,pharma,thompson,mem.op,and labs.shalala,dist.lexis.we retell it only briefly here.
under the food,drug,and cosmetic act the act,a manufacturer must apply to the fda for approval to market a new animal drug.to gain approval,a manufacturer must submit a new animal drug application nada demonstrating that the drug is both safe and effective under the conditions prescribed,recommended,or suggested in the proposed labeling.d a e see id.a b.
in the early,the animal health institute,an industry trade association,coordinated a safety study on bacitracin zinc.there is no dispute that the study provided an adequate basis for the fda subsequent conclusion that philips roxane bacitracin zinc product met the act safety requirements.see pharma,at.the study did not,however,address the statute efficacy requirement.
the fda has allowed manufacturers of certain classes of drugs to establish a drug efficacy by using a regulatory shortcut known as bioequivalency.pharma,at.the agency determined that,for those classes,applicants did not need to conduct their own field studies to prove that their products were effective.instead,an applicant could establish a generic drug efficacy by demonstrating that it was bioequivalent to a benchmark drug that the fda had already found to be effective for the same intended uses.see id.at see also,united states,cir.
in july,the fda found that bacitracin zinc products were effective for increased rate of weight gain and improved feed efficiency in poultry.see bacitracin with or without penicillin drugs for veterinary use drug efficacy study implementation.july.based on that finding,the fda permitted applicants submitting nadas for bacitracin zinc intended for those uses to establish the efficacy of their products by showing they were bioequivalent to the benchmark drugs upon which the fda had based its initial finding.see new animal drugs for use in animal feeds bacitracin zinc update,july,codified at.
on may,philips roxane submitted an application to the fda for approval of its generic version of bacitracin zinc.to establish bioequivalence,philips roxane application,which the fda designated as nada,relied on a study conducted by john prescott of the university of guelph in ontario,canada prescott study.prescott tested the philips roxane product alongside a benchmark drug produced by international minerals chemical.the study was designed to determine whether the two were equally effective in treating necrotic enteritis in a population of chickens when administered at a single dosage.see new animal drugs for use in animal feeds bacitracin zinc.august,see also prescott aff.prescott concluded that the two drugs were equally effective for that purpose.see prescott aff.
on august,the fda approved nada.based on the animal health institute study,the agency determined that philips roxane bacitracin zinc product was safe.see pharma,at.based on the prescott study,it found that philips roxane product was bioequivalent to the international minerals benchmark.see.at.and based on the finding of bioequivalence,the agency concluded that philips roxane bacitracin zinc was effective for increasing weight gain and improving feed efficiency in broiler chickens.id.
appellant alpharma manufactures an approved bacitracin zinc product that is similar to the product covered by nada.after philips roxane application was granted,alpharma filed four citizen petitions asking the fda to revoke its approval of nada the agency rejected all four petitions.on june,alpharma brought suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia under the administrative procedure act apa,et,challenging the fda approval of nada.the district court granted the fda motion for summary judgment on december,and alpharma appealed.
alpharma appeal disputed the fda conclusion that the prescott study established bioequivalence between the philips roxane product and the benchmark drug alpharma relied on affidavits and letters submitted by sixteen highly credentialed scientists,all of whom questioned the bioequivalency conclusion.pharma,at see id.at.alpharma asserted that the unanimous views of these experts conclusively establish ed that the fda acted arbitrarily and thus illegally when it refused to rescind its approval of the nada.pharma,at.alpharma offered two principal criticisms of the prescott study.
alpharma first contention was that a comparison of the two products relative effectiveness for the purpose of fighting a disease necrotic enteritis was not a proper measure of bioequivalence for the purpose of promoting growth rates and feed product intended use.the fda responded that it had already determined the benchmark product efficacy for the latter purpose hence,the function of a bioequivalence study was not to determine the new product efficacy for that purpose,but rather to determine whether the drug delivery mechanism operates similarly to that of the benchmark product.id.at.the fda noted that the usual method of establishing bioequivalence,measuring levels of the drug in blood,was not possible for bacitracin zinc.and it further noted that,because the expected differences between the performance of drugs in the necrotic enteritis study are much greater than those for growth experiments,a comparison of the drugs abilities to fight disease was perhaps even a better measure of the similarities of their delivery mechanisms than a direct comparison of their effects on growth promotion.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.concluding that this position reflect ed a scientific determination within the scope of the fda expertise,we deferred to it.id.
we were unwilling,however,to accept the agency response to alpharma second criticism.alpharma experts argued that the prescott study could not prove that the two drugs were equivalent for the purpose of fighting necrotic enteritis,because the two drugs were tested at a single dosage.id.at.to reach the conclusion that the drugs were equivalent,they maintained,different dosages would have to be tested and curves for the two products constructed and compared.id.without the benefit of testing,there was no way to rule out the possibility that one of the drugs barely reached effectiveness at the dosage tested while the other would have been effective against the disease at a fraction of the dose.id.the fda response to this second critique was brief it d id not believe that it was necessary to test different levels of the drugs and compare curves in order to show that the biological activity of the two drugs against a known disease organism was not significantly different.id.citing citizen pet.denial at.
finding this response conclusory,we held that the fda had made no attempt to cogently explain why alpharma was mistaken in claiming that a study can not prove bioequivalency.id.at quoting motor vehicle mfr ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.in light of that failure,we set aside the district court grant of summary judgment but not the fda approval itself,and remanded the case so that the fda may explain what bioequivalency entails in the animal drug context and how the prescott study satisfied that standard.id.
the fda response to our remand came in the form of an october,letter from ronald chesemore,associate commissioner for regulatory affairs,to counsel for alpharma.chesemore letter.the fda advised alpharma that,u pon review,the agency determined the prescott study was an appropriate means for evaluating the bioequivalence of the zinc bacitracin product covered by nada.chesemore letter at.in so doing,the fda reaffirmed its original decision to deny alpharma citizen petitions and to approve nada.the details of the fda explanation are discussed in parts iii and iv below.
on february,the district court held that the chesemore letter complied with the terms of our remand,concluding that the fda provided an adequate justification for its conclusion that the two drugs are bioequivalent.pharma,mem.op.at.this appeal followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as those that govern the district court determination.troy browner.we may set aside the fda approval of nada only if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.that standard requires an agency to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.state farm,at.quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.the agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner,id.at,and that explanation must be sufficient to enable us to conclude that the agency action was the product of reasoned decisionmaking,id.at.
we are met at the outset with alpharma contention that the chesemore letter can not provide a satisfactory explanation because it is a o c rationalization generated thirteen years after the relevant decision.alpharma br.as alpharma notes,in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,the supreme court held that post hoc rationalizations have traditionally been found to be an inadequate basis for review of agency decisions,d.nonetheless,in overton park itself,the court approved the procedure of remanding so that an agency can provide an explanation for an inadequately articulated decision.id.at.needless to say,if it is appropriate for a court to remand for further explanation,it is incumbent upon the court to consider that explanation when it arrives.and also needless to say,a letter produced in response to our remand would have to be post hoc as measured against an agency decision issued in.see id.at.noting,in remanding for an explanation,that s uch an explanation will,to some extent,be a post hoc rationalization.
thirty years ago,we rejected the identical argument that alpharma raises here.in local,int l of teamsters nlrb,we concluded that we had the authority to consider a supplemental explanation that the nlrb provided in response to our remand.we explained the meaning of the post hoc rationalization rule as follows 
the rule is not a time barrier which freezes an agency exercise of its judgment after an initial decision has been made and bars it from further articulation of its reasoning.it is a rule directed at reviewing courts which forbids judges to uphold agency action on the basis of rationales offered by anyone other than the proper decisionmakers.thus the rule applies to rationalizations offered for the first time in litigation affidavits and arguments of counsel.the policy of the post hoc rationalization rule does not prohibit an agency from submitting an amplified articulation of the distinctions it sees moreover,the logic of the rule requires it.if a reviewing court finds the record inadequate to support a finding of reasoned analysis by an agency and the court is barred from considering rationales urged by others,only the agency itself can provide the required clarification.

there is no question that associate commissioner chesemore is a proper decisionmaker,and that his letter represents the considered views of the agency itself.see chesemore letter at upon review,the agency has determined that the prescott study was an appropriate means for evaluating the bioequivalence of the zinc bacitracin product covered by nada.emphasis added.the letter is neither a mere litigation affidavit,nor an argument of counsel.local,at.accordingly,an examination of its contents is perfectly appropriate.in part iii,we consider whether the agency explanation satisfactorily answered the two questions we posed in our remand order.in part iv,we address the new problems that arise out of the explanation that the fda offered.
our remand order instructed the fda to explain what bioequivalency entails in the animal drug context and how the prescott study satisfied that standard.pharma,at.that instruction involved two questions,each of which the fda addressed in the chesemore letter.
to paraphrase another and more famous poultry case the first issue is,what is bioequivalence frigaliment importing int l sales,friendly,the issue is,what is chicken.more precisely,the question we asked on remand was what characteristics two drugs must share in order to be deemed bioequivalent.pharma,at.
the chesemore letter set forth,as representing the meaning of bioequivalence during the period in which nada was considered,the following definition 
a demonstration of bioequivalence involves establishing that two comparable drug formulations,which can not be presumed to be identical based on chemical equivalence,perform in a similar way in a chosen test system.
chesemore letter at.alpharma objects that the fda definition is too vague,because it does not clearly explain what it means for two drugs to perform in a similar way in a chosen test system.alpharma br.in context,however,we understand the chosen test system to mean necrotic enteritis,and we understand perform in a similar way to mean similarly effective in treating that disease.see chesemore letter at t he study demonstrated that the nada product and the innovator zinc bacitracin product perform in a similar way in the chosen test system,in the treatment of necrotic enteritis.performance,in turn,was evaluated under the criteria of mortality,lesions,and weight gain.see memorandum from thomas raines to malcolm thomas and lonnie luther,describing the evaluation parameters of the prescott study raines memorandum.
in our initial opinion,we acknowledged that there may be more than one reasonable definition of bioequivalency,and that the fda was entitled to latitude in its construction of the term.pharma,at.bacitracin zinc is a drug for which conventional blood level study is not appropriate because it does not produce blood levels.raines memorandum at.as we suggested in our initial opinion,where blood levels could not be used to measure bioequivalence,it was not unreasonable for the fda to define bioequivalence in terms of,the treatment of a specific disease.see pharma,at deferring to the fda judgment that a comparison of the drugs abilities to fight disease was perhaps even a better measure of the similarities of their delivery mechanisms than a direct comparison of their effects on growth promotion.
we also did the chesemore the fda description of bioequivalence is consistent with what congress later codified in the generic animal drug and patent restoration act of,stat.chesemore letter at six years after the fda approved nada,congress provided a statutory definition of bioequivalence for situations like this one in which the secretary determines that the measurement of the rate and extent of absorption or excretion of the new animal drug in biological fluids is inappropriate or impractical.c h ii iii.in such circumstances,a new animal drug shall be considered to be bioequivalent to an approved new animal drug,a benchmark drug if 
an appropriate acute pharmacological effects test or other test of the new animal drug and of the approved new animal drug in the species to be tested does not show a significant difference between the new animal drug and such approved new animal drug when administered at the same dose under similar experimental conditions.
id.although congress subsequent enactment of a similar bioequivalency standard does not in itself validate the fda definition,it does suggest that the concern that prompted our first remand question may not recur.
the second issue posed by our remand was how the prescott study satisfied the fda bioequivalency standard.id.at.specifically,we asked why the fda viewed a rather than study as appropriate for establishing bioequivalence.id.
in response,the chesemore letter explained that b ioequivalence testing of generic veterinary drugs has historically been conducted using a single dose level this was the accepted approach at the time nada was approved.chesemore letter at.testing at more than one dosage level,the fda said,is necessary only where the drug at issue is a sustained release product or in the rare instance in which the drug has demonstrated nonlinear kinetics.id because neither circumstance existed with zinc bacitracin,the fda concluded that a single dose bioequivalence study is sufficient.id.
the fda description of its historical practice is entitled to deference in light of the agency experience and expertise in these matters.see fed.power comm.power light,d.to be sure,that description would have been more persuasive had it been accompanied by citations.but the plaintiff has not cited anything to contradict the agency representation,and at oral argument plaintiff counsel conceded that he did not know of any contrary examples.oral arg.tape.
the chesemore letter then went on to explain why studies had not historically been required to establish bioequivalence 
a bioequivalency study is not designed to demonstrate or affirm the efficacy of the product at issue for a given use instead,its purpose is to demonstrate that two comparable formulations perform similarly in a chosen test system.in contrast,a dose response study is conducted in order to isolate from the range of doses being tested the optimally effective dose of a product for a particular condition or use.
chesemore letter at since the purpose of the prescott study was not to determine the optimally effective dose,chesemore letter at,but only to determine whether the two drugs would perform in a similar way with respect to necrotic enteritis,the agency explanation for not employing a study was reasonable.such a judgment as to what is required to ascertain the safety and efficacy of drugs falls squarely within the ambit of the fda expertise and merit s deference from us.pharma,at internal quotation marks omitted see schering fda,cir holding,in the human drug context,that the fda has discretion to determine what tests or studies would provide it with appropriate information from which to determine bioequivalence.
in sum,we conclude that the chesemore letter adequately responded to the questions we raised in our remand order.those responses provide a satisfactory explanation both of what bioequivalency entails in the animal drug context,and of how the prescott study satisfied that standard.pharma,at.
we would like nothing better than to end this tortured story right here.id.at.but the fda has not made that possible.as alpharma correctly argues,in the course of responding to our remand,the fda made new,seemingly contradictory statements that require further clarification before we can conclude that the agency acted reasonably.
the fda insists that alpharma arguments are not properly before us because the company did not raise them on the first appeal.but the arguments that alpharma asserts here all involve statements that the fda made for the first time after that appeal,in the chesemore letter.therefore,because they are not arguments that could have been raised on an initial appeal,it is not inappropriate to consider them on a second appeal following remand.northwestern.fcc.
as discussed in part iii,we are satisfied with the fda explanation for concluding that a single dose bioequivalence study is sufficient for evaluating bacitracin zinc.chesemore letter at.as alpharma points out,however,two additional problems arise out of the agency further declaration that a dose of of feed the single dose used in the prescott study was the appropriate zinc bacitracin dose for control of necrotic enteritis.id.we consider those problems below.
the first problem involves an apparent contradiction between the chesemore letter conclusion that was the appropriate dose,and its statement that h istorically,the fda has recommended that,as a general rule,a bioequivalence study be conducted using the highest approved dose.id.as alpharma notes,was not the highest approved dose in the two sources that the chesemore letter cites in support of the proposition that was the appropriate dose for the prescott study.id.one of those sources listed the approved dose for the water soluble powder form of zinc bacitracin.id.citing certifiable peptide antibiotic drugs for animal use zinc soluble powder,june.that source fixed the highest approved dose for control of necrotic enteritis in chickens at,see.at,which is comparable to of feed double the dose used in the prescott study.the other cited source was for the approved dose of a related form of bacitracin,bacitracin methylene disalicylate,for use in feed to control necrotic enteritis.chesemore letter at citing.the highest approved dose for that drug was,see animal drugs,feeds,and related products bacitracin methylene disalicylate,codified at again double that used by prescott.
there is another inconsistency lurking here as well.the chesemore letter stated that of feed was the appropriate dose for the control of necrotic enteritis.chesemore letter at.but it is not clear from the agency own description whether prescott studied the control or the prevention of necrotic enteritis.as alpharma points out,the fda has described the prescott study at times as studying prevention while at other times studying control.alpharma br.at this is significant because the two sources cited in the chesemore letter listed highest approved doses that were different for prevention than for that were also different from the used in the prescott study.indeed,if the focus of the study was prevention,then the highest approved doses for that purpose were half the that prescott used.see.at listing,comparable to of feed,as the highest approved dose of bacitracin zinc for prevention.at listing of feed as the highest approved dose of bacitracin methylene disalicylate for prevention.
finally,we note that all of these comparisons of highest approved doses are something of a fiction given the fda acknowledgment that,at the time of the prescott study,there was no approved dose of bacitracin zinc for the control of necrotic enteritis.see chesemore letter at the agency acknowledges that at the time of the approval of,zinc bacitracin was not approved for use in feed for the control of necrotic enteritis.the two sources cited by the fda were for approvals issued well after the prescott study was concluded.yet nothing in the chesemore letter explains how prescott could have appropriately relied on approvals that had not yet been made.nor does it explain why it was appropriate for him to use a dose different from either higher or lower than,depending on whether prescott studied prevention or control the highest approved the fda had historically recommended.
the second problem identified by alpharma centers around the chesemore letter declaration that was the appropriate zinc bacitracin dose because it was the optimally effective dose for controlling necrotic enteritis.chesemore letter at.the letter offers no support for the latter proposition,and,this time,alpharma points to contradictory indicators.compare supra part accepting the fda description of its historical practice regarding studies where plaintiff cited nothing to contradict it.
as alpharma points out,and as we noted above,the chesemore letter concedes that at the time of the approval of nada,bacitracin zinc had not been approved for the control of necrotic enteritis at any level,let alone at an optimally effective dose.see chesemore letter at moreover,neither of the two sources discussed in the chesemore letter established an optimally effective dose for the control of necrotic enteritis.while fell within the range of approved doses for both bacitracin zinc and bacitracin methylene disalicylate,neither approval referred to an optimally effective dose.see.at.at.
the chesemore letter flatly declares that the agency had a clear rationale for its determination that would be the optimally effective dose for controlling necrotic
