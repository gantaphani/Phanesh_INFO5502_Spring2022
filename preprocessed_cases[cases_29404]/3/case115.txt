background 
in april,the farm service agency,an agency of the usda,ordered five points to refund certain federal farm program benefits that it had received for the years and.five points appealed that decision to an nad hearing officer.the hearing officer reversed the farm service agency determination in its entirety.the director of the nad then affirmed the hearing officer decision in favor of five points.
following its successful appeal of the merits of its dispute,five points applied to the nad director for attorney fees and costs under the eaja.the nad director denied five points application because,in the director view,the eaja did not apply to nad adjudications.five points request for reconsideration also was denied by the director.five points sought review of that determination in the district court.
in the district court,five points and the government filed for summary judgment.following the decision of the eighth circuit in lane usda,cir,the reasoning of which also was applied by the ninth circuit in aageson grain cattle usda,cir,it held that proceedings before the nad are subject to the eaja.the district court therefore granted five points motion for summary judgment it held that the nad proceedings were under section of the administrative procedure act of,et apa,and that the plaintiffs,as the prevailing party in the agency proceeding,were entitled to attorney fees and costs under the eaja.the director had erred,therefore,in refusing to consider the plaintiffs application.the case was remanded to the agency for appropriate consideration of five points application under the eaja.the government appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.foskett great wolf resorts,cir.on for summary judgment,we construe all facts and inferences therefrom in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration was made.id.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
this case presents a single issue whether the eaja applies to administrative proceedings before the nad.this issue presents a question of statutory interpretation the eaja provides that prevailing parties in certain adversary administrative proceedings may recover attorney fees and costs from the government.ardestani ins,d.in pertinent part,the eaja states 
an agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award,to a prevailing party other than the united states,fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding,unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
a see also ardestani,at.the eaja defines an adversary adjudication as an adjudication under section of this title in which the position of the united states is represented by counsel or otherwise.b c i.here,the government concedes that it was represented by counsel in the appeal before the nad the only question,then,is whether an nad proceeding is an adjudication under section.id.
section of title delineates the scope of proceedings governed by the formal adjudication requirements of the apa.see ardestani,at.by its terms,section applies in every case of an adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.a.an adjudication is defined as an agency process for the formulation of an order.section therefore will apply if the proceeding meets three requirements there must be an adjudication,an agency process for the formulation of an order,that is required by statute it must be on the record and there must be an opportunity for an agency hearing.id.aageson,at.
the review of agency determinations by the nad clearly meets the definition of an adjudication,the first criterion.the governing statute provides for a hearing to determine disputed facts and requires that,after that hearing,the hearing officer must issue a determination.the nad statutes also meet the third section requirement that there be an opportunity for a hearing.such a hearing is mandatory once requested by a participant.b smedberg mach.tool,donovan,cir holding that section is inapplicable to a proceeding that gives the administrative law judge the discretion rather than the obligation to conduct a review hearing.
the only remaining requirement for a proceeding to be under section is that it must be on the record.the nad statutes do not require expressly the hearing to be on the record nonetheless,congress intent is clear.although section specifies that the governing statute must satisfy the on the record requirement,those three magic words need not appear for a court to determine that formal hearings are required.city of chicago,nuclear regulatory comm n,cir.congress need only clearly indicate its intent to trigger the formal,hearing provisions of the apa.id.
here,congress has indicated clearly its intent to trigger the formal hearing provisions of the apa.see id.the nad statutes provide that a participant who appeals an adverse decision shall be given an evidentiary hearing.a.the evidentiary hearing consists of a procedure in which the hearing officer has the power to administer oaths and to subpoena witnesses and evidence.id.a.the hearing officer and interested parties are prohibited from ex parte communications.id.a a b.the hearing officer is not bound by prior factual findings.id.c.the appellant carries the burden of proving that the agency decision was erroneous,id.c,and the hearing officer must leave the record open for additional information in response to new facts and evidence presented at the hearing,id.c.the appellant or the agency may request that the director review the hearing officer determination.id.a.the director review is based on the case record all material related to the adverse decision,id,the record from the evidentiary hearing under and any other arguments or evidence that the director chooses to accept.id.b.judicial review is available upon issuance of a final determination.id.
the language of the text,especially the repeated references to the record and the provision for procedures,as well as the structure of the nad statutes,makes clear that congress intended for nad proceedings to be governed by section of the apa.lane,at.indeed,the government concedes that nad proceedings are on the record.appellants br.at required the hearing officer decision to be on the record.
the government nevertheless contends that,despite meeting the statutory definition for proceedings to which the eaja applies,an administrative appeal proceeding before the nad is not one to which the eaja applies because it is a comprehensive,freestanding scheme that supersedes.appellants br.at comparing a a with d.in essence,the government argues that the nad statutes have amended by implication section of the apa,despite the language in section that makes it applicable to all adjudications required by statute to be determined on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing.
as our colleagues in the eighth circuit have pointed out,t he primary flaw in the agency argument is that the apa sp
