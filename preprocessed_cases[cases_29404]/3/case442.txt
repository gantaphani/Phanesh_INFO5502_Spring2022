versa corporation versa sued international in the united states district court for the district of oregon for infringement of united states patent the patent,the patent,and the patent.the district court construed the claims,and versa admitted that it could not prove infringement under the district court claim construction.the district court entered a judgment of pursuant to.b.versa int l.may.we conclude that the district court erred in its claim construction of the means for creating air channels element and,accordingly,we reverse.
background 
versa and are competitors in the agricultural bagging machine market.they manufacture and sell similar machines.versa is the assignee of the,and patents,which pertain to compost bagging machines.the patented machines fill large bags with compost material in such a way that air required for decomposition may enter the bag.the patents are directed to various features of the bagging machines,including the structures that introduce air.two such structures are disclosed in the three patents one or more perforated pipes that extend through the compost material and a multiplicity of flutes on the walls of the tunnel against which the compost is compacted.
versa filed suit against alleging that infringed claims and of the patent,and the sole claims of the and patents.counterclaimed for infringement of its united states patent the patent and raised a number of defenses and counterclaims including invalidity and.
the three patents asserted by versa share very similar specifications.claim of the patent,the only patent with multiple claims,is representative of the claims at issue.this claim is identical in pertinent part to claim of the patent,and the claims of the and patents.claim provides 
a compost bagging machine for bagging compost material into an elongated flexible bag having a fixed end and an open mouth,
a wheeled frame means having rearward and forward ends,
a tunnel means on said wheeled frame means and having an intake end for receiving compost material and an output end adapted to receive the mouth of the bag,
a hopper means on said wheeled frame means for receiving compost material,
means at the intake end of said tunnel means for forcing the compost material into said tunnel means,into said bag,and to move said wheeled frame means away from said fixed end of said bag,
means associated with the bagging machine for creating air channels in the compost material in said bag to enhance the composting of the compost material,
said means for creating air channels comprising positioning means which positions at least one elongated,perforated pipe extending substantially the entire length of the compost material in the bag as said bagging machine bags the compost material in said bag,said perforated pipe having openings formed therein for substantially the entire length thereof,
and a pipe support on said wheeled frame means for supporting said perforated pipe thereon prior to said perforated pipe being positioned in said compost material by said positioning means as said bagging machine bags the compost material in said bag.
patent emphasis on pertinent part.
among other things,the district court held,and the parties agree,that the clause referring to a means associated with the bagging machine for creating air channels is a limitation governed by,based upon its analysis of the claim language,specification,and prosecution history,the district court ruled that the means for creating air channels requires the presence of both perforated pipe and flutes.after the district court construed the claims,versa moved for judgment of on the,and patents.versa agreed that it was unable to prove infringement under the district court claim construction,apparently because the accused machine does not contain flutes,and it therefore requested that judgment be entered so that it could appeal to this court.the district court entered judgment of of the,and patents in favor of pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
after the filing of appeals the parties entered into a settlement agreement which resolved all issues on appeal other than the proper construction of the means for creating air channels limitation the parties have also agreed that,if we conclude the flutes are required,will pay versa an agreed royalty thus,the sole question before us is whether under a proper claim construction the claimed bagging machines must include flutes.
this court reviews the claim construction of the district court without deference.mars,heinz.we have previously held that c laim construction of a,limitation includes identifying the claimed function and determining the corresponding structure or act disclosed in the specification.ims,haas automation.in this case,the claim makes clear that the function is creating air channels in the compost material in said bag to enhance the composting of the compost material.patent,ll.the dispute is over what corresponding structure is disclosed in the specification.in particular,the issue is whether flutes must be included in the structures that perform this function.
in most places the specification describes the invention as including both flutes and perforated pipe,and the drawings show both flutes and perforated pipe.specifically,the abstract states that t he presence of air in the channels created by the flutes and the air present in the perforated pipe ensures that sufficient air will be present in the mass to achieve complete decomposition of the material.id.the specification further states that t he air present in the grooves in the material,the flutes and the air present in the perforated pipe causes the material to properly decompose.id.at,ll.however,the specification also points out that both structures are not required,stating i t is believed that sufficient air will be present to achieve decomposition with either the channels or the perforated pipe although it is preferred that both the flutes and the pipe be utilized.id.at,ll.we conclude that,in light of this disclosure,flutes are not essential.
in micro chemical great plains chemical,we held that w hen multiple embodiments in the specification correspond to the claimed function,proper application of,generally reads the claim element to embrace each of those embodiments.in serrano telular,we addressed a question similar to that presented here.serrano involved a patent on an apparatus for interfacing standard telephone devices with a cellular radio transceiver.id.at.the claim required determination means to determine when the last digit of a telephone number was dialed.id.at.serrano argued that the determination means corresponded only to a logic circuit and did not disclose systems wherein software made the logical decisions.id.at.to support his contention,he noted that the embodiment shown in the specification and drawings disclosed only logic circuitry.id.we rejected this argument because the written description also included a passage which stated that a system could also be used wherein the logical decisions are configured in software.id.we held that d isclosed structure includes that which is described in the patent specification,including any alternative structures identified,even when the most frequently described structure and embodiment are different.id.the same is true here 
moreover,here the language of the claim itself also suggests that the means for creating air channels does not have to include flutes.after setting forth the means for creating air channels limitation,that limitation is further defined by the next clause of the claim,which reads said means for creating air channels comprising positioning means which positions at least one elongated,perforated pipe patent,ll.although comprising language is not limiting and may include features not recited in the claim,such language can not be read to require other structure.thus the claim language itself shows that flutes are not required structure for the means for creating air channels.
furthermore,the doctrine of claim differentiation supports the conclusion that flutes are not necessary
