the plaintiffs,six people who own various interests in nebraska farm and ranch land operations,filed this action against nebraska secretary of state and attorney general in their official capacities state officials.the plaintiffs claimed that initiative,which voters adopted as part of the state constitution in,see.const.art.xii,violates the commerce clause,privileges and immunities clause,and equal protection clause of the united states constitution and the americans with disabilities act ada.all parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their commerce clause and ada claims,and granted summary judgment to the state officials on the remaining claims.the state officials appeal,and we affirm the district court judgment that the amendment based on initiative is unconstitutional because it violates the dormant commerce clause.
initiative prohibits corporations or syndicates limited partnerships from acquiring an interest in real estate used for farming or ranching in nebraska or engag ing in farming or ranching,with certain exceptions.see.const.art.xii.the initiative originated as a constitutional amendment proposed through the initiative process and appeared as a ballot question on nebraska general election ballot.the nebraska attorney general prepared a ballot title and explanatory statement for initiative.see.stat.the title read shall a constitutional prohibition be created prohibiting ownership of nebraska farm or ranch land by any corporation,domestic or foreign,which is not a nebraska family farm corporation an explanatory statement defines the effect of a vote for and against a measure.id.the explanatory statement presented to nebraska voters for initiative read a vote for will create a constitutional prohibition against further purchase of nebraska farm and ranch lands by any corporation or syndicate other than a nebraska family farm corporation.a vote against will reject such a constitutional restriction on ownership of nebraska farm and ranch land.the voters adopted initiative,and it became part of the nebraska constitution upon the issuance of a proclamation by the governor in.
the initiative defines a family farm or ranch corporation,which is specifically excepted from the initiative restrictions,as a corporation engaged in farming or ranching or the ownership of agricultural land,in which the majority of the voting stock is held by members of a family at least one of whom is a person residing on or actively engaged in the day to day labor and management of the farm or ranch.const.art.xii.in addition,an exemption from the corporate farming ban is provided,inter alia,to former family farm corporations for a period of fifty years after they cease to meet the criteria for that designation,provided that majority ownership of the corporation remains within the family.id.
the state officials contend that none of the plaintiffs had standing to bring the commerce clause claim and therefore the district court erred in concluding that it had jurisdiction.a plaintiff has the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction,hoekel plumbing planning,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d,for which standing is a prerequisite,faibisch university of,cir.to establish standing,a plaintiff is required to show that he or she had suffered an injury in fact,meaning that the injury is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,the injury must be traceable to the defendant challenged action.third,it must be likely rather than speculative that a favorable decision will redress the injury.south dakota farm bureau,hazeltine,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d,cert.denied,d.

plaintiff terrence schumacher,a resident of boulder,colorado,has an ownership interest in nebraska farmland in five counties.neither he nor any of his relatives reside on his farmland and he does not live close enough to the land to perform the labor and manage it.schumacher would like to transfer his farmland to a limited liability entity,which would,inter alia,allow for improved fiscal planning and operational management of the farmland as an operating unit and provide more favorable options for estate planning.initiative precludes schumacher from creating a limited liability farm operation because he does not meet the conditions of the family farm exemption,and as a result he has suffered and continues to suffer economic loss based on reduced fiscal and operational management efficiencies,marketing opportunities,and borrowing power,as well as increased administration expenses and federal estate taxes.because schumacher can not qualify for the family farm exemption,he is exposed to personal liability for the debts,obligations,contracts,and torts related to his nebraska farmland.
the state officials acknowledge that schumacher may not purchase farmland on a limited liability basis unless he or a member of his family resides on the farmland or is engaged in the farm labor and management.but they argue that he nevertheless lacks standing because the requirements apply to everyone and thus do not unduly burden schumacher interests.we think,however,that the question of interstate commerce burdens pertains to the merits of schumacher claim and is analytically distinct from the determination that is central to standing.adams watson,cir.
robert beck iii,another plaintiff,resides in rural kearney,nebraska,where he owns a cattle feedlot that provides for the daily care and feeding of cattle owned by his customers,many of whom live outside of nebraska.beck can not contract with corporate entities for the purpose of raising and feeding livestock for slaughter.beck alleges that as a result,he has lost business,income,and borrowing power.he further alleges that initiative has prevented him from gaining unfettered access to the national cattle market,and thereby reduced his competitiveness and ability to gain new customers resulting in economic loss.in addition,beck access to working capital from corporations is restricted because initiative prohibits entities that provide equity in the form of ownership of cattle from feeding cattle at beck feedlot.the initiative prohibits him from freely changing ownership of his commercial cattle feeding operations and limits his ability to pool assets and resources with other unrelated nebraska farmers and corporations to acquire more land and personal assets for future development of his cattle operation.finally,initiative prevents beck from establishing succession plans that would allow him to transfer ownership gradually to employees who provide the labor while he continues to manage the operation.
the state officials acknowledge that under hazeltine,at,a plaintiff who does substantial business with corporations and would suffer imminent business losses as a result of the challenged law has standing to bring a commerce clause claim.they argue,however,that beck lacks standing because he does not have actual contracts with corporations and therefore did not suffer an injury in fact.
but we agree with the district court that the predicaments of schumacher and beck are comparable to those of the plaintiffs in hazeltine,who we concluded had standing to challenge an amendment to the south dakota constitution that prohibited corporations and syndicates from holding land in the state.see hazeltine,at.we also think that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a law that has a direct negative effect on their borrowing power,financial strength,and fiscal planning,see hazeltine,at quoting clinton city of new york,d.we do not believe that beck was r
