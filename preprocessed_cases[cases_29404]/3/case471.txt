christopher whitcomb cox,castle nicholson and kenneth bley for national association of home builders as amicus curiae on behalf of plaintiff and respondent.
in december,appellants,the stanislaus county board of supervisors board and the county of stanislaus county,adopted an update to the agricultural element of the county general plan.at issue in this appeal is one component of this update,the farmland mitigation program fmp.
the fmp is designed to aid in mitigating the loss of farmland resulting from residential development by requiring the permanent protection of farmland through agricultural conservation easements granted in perpetuity.the fmp implementation guidelines provide that farmland mitigation shall be satisfied by the acquisition of an agricultural conservation easement over an equivalent area of comparable farmland.it is the sole responsibility of the developer to obtain the required easement.
respondent,building industry association of central california bia,challenged the facial validity of the fmp requirement that a developer dedicate permanent easements as a condition of obtaining development approvals or permits from the county.appellants,california farm bureau federation and stanislaus county farm bureau farm bureau,intervened in support of the county and the board.
the trial court ruled in bia favor finding that the fmp was invalid on several grounds.the court concluded that the fmp conflicts with state law that prohibits a local governmental entity from conditioning the issuance of land use approvals on the granting of conservation easements the appellants failed to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the mitigation requirement and any adverse public impacts attributable to new residential development and the fmp requirements are in excess of the county police power.
appellants argue the trial court erred in invalidating the fmp.appellants dispute the applicability of section.appellants first contend that the fmp conservation easements are not conservation easements within the meaning of section et.appellants alternatively assert that the section prohibition is inapplicable because an applicant is not compelled to grant an easement but,rather,may satisfy the conservation easement option by arranging for the creation of an easement in the property of a willing third party.appellants further note that even if section does apply,the fmp permits the applicant to mitigate the farmland loss without a conservation easement.appellants additionally contend that there exists an inherent reasonable relationship between the fmp requirements and the loss of farmland to residential development.finally appellants argue that the fmp is within the scope of the county constitutional police power.
as discussed below,the trial court erroneously concluded that the fmp was facially invalid.accordingly,the judgment will be reversed.
background 
in,the county adopted its first agricultural element.recognizing both the importance of agriculture to the county economy and the county attractiveness to urban development,the county sought to promote and protect local agriculture by the adoption of policies aimed at strengthening the agricultural sector of the economy,preserving agricultural lands for agricultural uses,and protecting the natural resources that sustain agriculture in the county.noting that g ood agricultural land is a finite,irreplaceable resource,the county included a policy of requiring mitigation of the impacts of farmland conversion t o the greatest extent feasible.however,the agricultural element did not include any specific mitigation measures.
in,the county began the process of updating the agricultural element through an advisory board and an agricultural element update subcommittee.in,the subcommittee presented the first draft of the updated agricultural element for approval.this draft reaffirmed the county commitment to mitigating farmland conversion but went a step further by specifying that,b ased on a ratio,one acre of farmland shall be permanently protected for every one acre of farmland converted to use.the viable option for permanent protection is purchase of a conservation easement on farmland.the draft further provided that the county would be required to adopt guidelines for mitigating the loss of agricultural land.
the board held a public hearing on this draft in april,at which time bia submitted comments criticizing the mitigation requirement.the board did not approve the proposed update but,rather,directed the advisory board to address specific issues that arose during the meeting,including the development of farmland mitigation guidelines.
before further hearings were held,the subcommittee revised draft update was made available for public review.this draft included the following proposed mitigation policy 
in order to mitigate the conversion of agricultural land resulting from a discretionary project requiring an amendment to land use designation,the county shall require the replacement of agricultural land at a ratio with agricultural land of equal quality located in stanislaus county.
mitigation was to be applied consistent with farmland mitigation program guidelines.the proposed fmp guidelines were also presented.those guidelines provide that,for or greater parcels,farmland mitigation shall be satisfied by direct acquisition of a farmland conservation easement as allowed by these guidelines and the land trust program.it shall be the development interest s sole responsibility to obtain the required easement.for parcels less than acres in size,the board may alternatively authorize payment of an mitigation fee.
a hearing on the revised update was held before the planning commission on december.the planning commission considered written comments and oral testimony.bia objected to the fmp on several grounds including the county failure to identify legal authority for mandating dedication of permanent conservation easements as a condition of general plan administration.bia noted that while voluntary agricultural conservation easements are recognized and serve a valuable purpose in california,such easements typically arise out of freedom of contract situations,unlike the current proposal to exact such easements.after the hearing,the planning commission voted unanimously to recommend that the board approve the update as revised.
on december,the board held a noticed public hearing to consider the planning commission recommendation.following deliberations,the board approved the update by a vote with the limitation that the mitigation requirement only apply to conversions of farmland for residential use.
bia sought judicial review of the validity of the fmp through a complaint and petition for writ of mandate.bia did not question the county underlying assumption that preservation of a viable local agricultural economy may be a worthy subject for public policy interest,but did challenge the legal validity,rationality,and equity of the new fmp mandates.
following a bench trial,the court ruled that the fmp was invalid.this decision rested on several legal conclusions.the court first held that,because the county required mitigation to be provided by a conservation easement as defined in section,the fmp was subject to the limitation contained in section,subdivision b,that no local governmental entity may condition the issuance of an entitlement for use on the applicant granting of a conservation easement pursuant to this chapter.finding that the fmp violated section,subdivision b,the court concluded the fmp conflicted with controlling state law and was therefore invalid.
the court further held that the county and the intervening farm bureau failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the exactions required under the fmp and any adverse public impacts resulting from new applications to change agricultural land use to residential use.the court additionally found the evidence failed to show that the exactions mandated by the fmp would or could achieve its ostensible purpose of mitigating farmland conversion.the court also pointed out that the fmp requirement that the protected farmland have an adequate water supply,without further definition,was vague and arbitrary.
finally,the court concluded that the county failed to demonstrate that it had any particular source of legal authority for the fmp.based on its finding that the fmp requirements were not reasonably related to the impact of farmland conversion,the court found that the fmp was beyond the scope of the county police power.

here,the county made a legislative decision to condition approval of the conversion of land from agricultural to residential use on the project developer providing permanent protection of other agricultural land.such a generally applicable requirement imposed as a condition of development is subject to a reasonable relationship level of judicial scrutiny,as opposed to the heightened scrutiny applied to the imposition of conditions in individual cases as outlined in nollan california coastal comm and dolan city of tigard.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cal th.thus,to be valid,this mitigation requirement must bear a reasonable relationship to the deleterious public impact of the development project.id.at.

mitigating the future loss of farmland through conservation easements bears a reasonable relationship to the burden caused by residential development.
the trial court ruled that the county and the farm bureau failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the exactions required under the fmp and any adverse public impacts resulting from new applications to change the general plan or community plan designation of lands from agricultural land uses to residential uses.the court further determined that the county police power did not authorize the fmp because,to be valid,the exactions or dedications must be reasonably related to the purported impacts of new residential development.
regarding its conclusion that a reasonable relationship did not exist,the court explained that the record failed to demonstrate that the exactions mandated by the fmp would or could achieve its ostensible purpose,or would provide effective mitigation for the county of lands currently designated for agricultural uses on a general plan or community plan to residential uses.the court relied on a statement in the county staff report that it is not the purpose or intent of the fmp to fully mitigate farmland conversion,since a ratio is only adequate to protect half of the existing farmland base in stanislaus county the court further noted that productive farmland is irreplaceable and that the fmp policies would not create any new agricultural land.in other words,the loss of farmland is considered permanent and results in unavoidable impacts.the court also expressed concern that the fmp mandated the exaction of comparable land whether or not the land for which a change of designation is sought is actually used for farming or would even be suitable for productive agricultural use.the court summarized its position as follows in the absence of evidence demonstrating a substantial relationship between the burden of the exactions and the ostensible purpose for the enactment of the fmp,such fmp mandates appear arbitrary and invalid.
the trial court analysis is incorrect in several respects.first,the court improperly placed the burden on the county and the farm bureau to demonstrate the validity of the fmp.a local entity land use determination is accorded substantial judicial deference.unified school dist.city of corona th.bia,as the party challenging the facial validity of a land use decision,the fmp,was required to demonstrate that the fmp mandates bear no reasonable relationship to farmland loss in the generality or great majority of cases.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at.
moreover,contrary to the trial court conclusion,the fmp mandates bear a reasonable relationship to the loss of farmland to residential development.as outlined in the county updated agricultural element,agriculture is the leading industry in the county generating an annual gross agricultural value in excess of a billion dollars into the local economy.further,the elements that make the county so well suited for agriculture,favorable climate,flat land,available water and power,also make the county attractive for urban development,including affordable housing within commuting distance of major employment centers.
noting that agricultural land is a finite and irreplaceable resource,one of the agricultural element stated goals is to conserve the county agricultural lands for agricultural uses.once it is urbanized,productive agricultural land is permanently lost.however,acknowledging that not all agricultural land in the county can be conserved,the agricultural element seeks to balance the need to create housing for an expanding population with the need to protect the county agricultural lands.to promote this goal,the fmp was adopted.
under the fmp and its implementation guidelines,the county will not give final approval to a residential development project until the developer provides permanent protection of one acre of farmland for every acre of farmland converted to residential use.agricultural conservation easements granted in perpetuity are the primary means of accomplishing this permanent protection requirement.thus,for every acre of farmland lost to residential development in the county,a loss that is permanent,a comparable acre of farmland located in the county is protected from being lost to development in perpetuity.
bia does not question the importance of agriculture,or the legitimacy of the professed public interest in attempting to conserve lands suitable for agricultural uses.however,bia opines that the fmp requirements are arbitrary and without evidentiary support.as discussed above,this was the position taken by the trial court.
we conclude,to the contrary,that the fmp requirements bear a reasonable relationship to the loss of farmland to residential development.agriculture is the county leading industry.real estate development that requires agricultural land to be converted to residential use has a deleterious impact on this valuable resource.although the developed farmland is not replaced,an equivalent area of comparable farmland is permanently protected from a similar fate.to meet the reasonable relationship standard it is not necessary to fully offset the loss.the additional protection of farmland that could otherwise soon be lost to residential development promotes the county stated objective to conserve agricultural land for agricultural uses.further,the requirement of rough proportionality between the mitigation measure and the impact of the development project is met.environmental council of sacramento city of sacramento th.for every acre of farmland permanently lost to residential development another acre of farmland is permanently protected from residential development.again,bia challenge is to the fmp facial validity.thus,we are not considering the application of the fmp to specific circumstances.rather,the issue is whether this ratio concept is reasonably related to the county farmland conservation goal.as discussed above,the validity of this concept has evidentiary support.
accordingly,on its face,the fmp is reasonably related to the county legitimate goal of conserving farmland to protect the county agricultural economy.bia has failed to demonstrate from the face of the fmp that the mitigation requirements bear no reasonable relationship to farmland loss in the generality or great majority of cases.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at.
since a reasonable relationship exists between the fmp requirements and the impacts of converting farmland to residential development,the trial court also erred in concluding that the fmp was not authorized by the county police power.land use regulation,such as the fmp,is a function of local government under the constitutional grant of police power.big creek lumber county of santa cruz,supra,cal th at.
finally,the trial court expressed concern that the fmp was vague and arbitrary because it required preservation of comparable land,whether or not the land to be converted was actually used for farming,and required such comparable land to have an adequate water supply without defining adequate.in other words,these mitigation requirements may not be reasonable.however,such concerns do not invalidate the fmp on its face.a claim of facial invalidity is not supported by suggestions that in some future hypothetical situation problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the fmp.rather,the fmp provisions must inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.action apartment city of santa monica,supra,th at.since there has been no showing that these alleged deficiencies will unavoidably result in an unconstitutional application of the fmp,they do not invalidate the fmp on its face.
the section,subdivision b,provision that prohibits a local governmental entity from conditioning the issuance of land use approvals on the applicant granting of conservation easements does not invalidate the fmp.
conservation easements.
the legislature,upon finding and declaring that the preservation of land in its natural,scenic,agricultural,historical,forested,or condition is among the most important environmental assets of california,enacted chapter of title of part of division of the civil code,et to further the public policy of encouraging the voluntary conveyance of conservation easements to qualified nonprofit organizations.under this chapter,conservation easement means any written limitation in the form of an easement,restriction,covenant,or condition,executed by or on behalf of the landowner that is binding on successive owners.the purpose of such a conservation easement is to retain land predominantly in its natural,scenic,historical,agricultural,forested,or condition.
a conservation easement is a voluntarily created interest in real property that is freely transferable in whole or in part and is perpetual in duration,subd.a and b.it is not personal in nature,but rather constitutes an interest in real property,subd.c.the particular characteristics of a conservation easement shall be those granted or specified in the instrument creating or transferring the easement,subd.d.
under section,the provisions of this chapter must be liberally construed in order to effectuate the policy and purpose of section.
section,et applies to the fmp conservation easements.
the county and the farm bureau contend that the fmp agricultural conservation easements are not conservation easements within the meaning of section et.therefore,they argue,the fmp is not subject to the provision in section,subdivision b,that prohibits the county from conditioning land use approval on the granting of a conservation easement.the county and the farm bureau point out that the fmp does not refer to section and that there exist other categories of easements that are unaffected by the conservation easement chapter.
the county and the farm bureau rely on san mateo county coastal landowners county of san mateo,supra,to support their position.there,the court was faced with a measure that amended the san mateo county local coastal program.two of the newly adopted policies required an applicant for land division to grant the county space or agricultural easements as a condition of approval.these easements limited the use of the land covered to specified uses consistent with open space or agricultural use.other requirements for these easements,if any,were not recited by the court.th at.
the san mateo county coastal landowners court determined that the subject easements were not conservation easements as defined in section.the court noted that section,subdivision b,does not restrict the ability of a local governmental entity to require the dedication of an easement under other provisions of law and that the appellants had not denied that there are other,existing laws that authorize a local agency to require dedications of easements as a condition of development.the court then concluded that c learly,the county has ample authority to require dedication of agricultural and open space easements under several provisions of law.citations.san mateo county coastal landowners county of san mateo,supra,th at.
in contrast here,although section is not specifically referred to in the fmp,the conservation easement requirements listed in the fmp guidelines squarely meet the definition of a conservation easement under sections and.section defines a conservation easement as any limitation in a deed,will,or other instrument in the form of an easement,restriction,covenant,or condition,which is or has been executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land subject to such easement and is binding upon successive owners of such land,and the purpose of which is to retain land predominantly in its natural,scenic,historical,agricultural,forested,or condition.under section,a conservation easement shall be perpetual in duration and shall constitute an interest in real property.
the fmp guidelines define an agriculture conservation easement underscoring omitted as a n easement over agricultural land for the purpose of restricting its use to agriculture.the interest granted is an interest in land which is less than fee simple.the agriculture conservation easements shall be established in perpetuity or shall be permanently protected from future development via enforceable deed restriction.a qualifying instrument encumbering the land must be executed by all owners of the land and must be in recordable form.thus,the section and requirements are met.
further,under the fmp guidelines the interest shall be held in trust by the land trust the county in perpetuity.a land trust is defined as a nonprofit public benefit c corporation or other appropriate legal entity operating in stanislaus county for the purpose of conserving and protecting land in agriculture,and approved for this purpose by the board of supervisors.the county may be designated as a land trust.this land trust qualifies as one of the limited entities or organizations that m
