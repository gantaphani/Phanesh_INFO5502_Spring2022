this appeal of a united states department of agriculture usda administrative decision asks us to interpret and pass on the constitutionality of a food product reserve program authorized by the agricultural marketing agreement act of,as amended,u.et amaa,and implemented by the marketing order regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in california,part raisin marketing order or the order,first adopted in.farmers marvin and laura horne the hornes protest the usda judicial officer jo imposition of civil penalties and assessments for their failure to comply with the reserve requirements,among other regulatory infractions,contending they are producers not subject to the raisin marketing order provisions even if subject to those provisions,the requirement that they contribute a specified percentage of their annual raisin crop to the reserve pool constitutes an uncompensated per se taking in violation of the fifth amendment and the penalties imposed for their noncompliance with the raisin marketing order violate the eighth amendment excessive fines clause.we affirm.
background 
regulatory framework 
raisins and other agricultural commodities are heavily regulated under federal marketing orders adopted pursuant to the amaa,a statute enacted in response to plummeting commodity prices,market disequilibrium,and the accompanying threat to the nation credit system.et see zuber allen,see generally daniel bensing,the promulgation and implementation of federal marketing orders regulating fruit and vegetable crops under the agricultural marketing agreement act of,san joaquin agric.the declared purposes of the amaa are,inter alia,to help farmers achieve and maintain price parity for their agricultural goods and to protect producers and consumers alike from unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices by establishing orderly marketing conditions.see.lime avocado growers,paul,pescosolido block,cir.
to achieve these goals,the amaa delegates authority to the secretary of agriculture secretary to issue marketing regulating the sale and delivery of agricultural goods,principally by imposing production quotas or by restricting the supply of a commodity for sale on the open market,either through marketing allotments or reserve pools,see id.the secretary,in turn,is authorized to delegate to industry committees the power to administer marketing orders.c see.marketing orders under the amaa apply only to handlers,those who process and pack agricultural goods for distribution and do not apply to any producer in his capacity as a producer,b any handler who fails to comply with the terms of a marketing order is subject to civil forfeiture,as well as possible civil and criminal penalties,authorizing civil penalties up to for each violation,with each day constituting a separate violation.
the raisin marketing order was originally enacted in,see,codified,as amended,at part,in an effort to stabilize raisin prices by controlling production surpluses,which since had consistently been thirty to fifty percent of each year crop.see parker,at like many other fruit and vegetable orders issued under the amaa the order provides for the establishment of annual reserve pools,as determined by each year crop yield,thereby removing surplus raisins from sale on the open domestic market and indirectly controlling prices.see e d.by february of each year,the raisin administrative committee rac an industry committee charged with administration of the raisin marketing order see,recommends the and percentages for that year,which the secretary then promulgates.see id.d.the requirement varies from year to year for example,in the and crop years at issue here,the reserve percentages were set at percent and thirty percent of a producer crop,respectively.
as a result of the order reserve program requirements,a producer receives payment at a field market price upon delivery of raisins to a handler only for the raisins,which the handler is then free to sell on the domestic market without restrictions.see id.the raisins,on the other hand,must be held by the handler in segregated bins for the account of the rac until the rac sells them to handlers for resale in export markets or directs that they be sold or disposed of in secondary,markets,such as school lunch programs,either by direct sale or gift to agencies or foreign governments.id.the reserve pool sales are used to finance the rac administration,and any remaining net proceeds must then be equitably distributed to the producers on a pro rata basis.see e providing for the equitable distribution of the net return derived from the sale of raisins among the persons beneficially interested therein h.thus,although producers do not receive payment for raisins at the time of delivery to a handler,they retain a limited equity interest in the net proceeds of the rac disposition of the reserve,to be paid at a later time.
the rac is tasked with selling the reserve raisins in a manner intended to maxim ize producer returns and achieve maximum disposition of such raisins by the time reserve tonnage raisins from the subsequent crop year are available,d,but the hornes complain that they have not received any reserve sale proceeds since the mid.for example the rac designated percent of the crop as reserve tonnage,which it then sold for per ton,but none of the money the rac received was paid back to the raisin producers.
in addition to the reserve pool requirement,the raisin marketing order obliges handlers to,inter alia file reports with the rac,pay assessments to the rac,and grant the rac access to records for auditing purposes.see id.
ii.the hornes raisin enterprises 
marvin and laura horne have been producing raisins in fresno and madera counties in california since and in registered as a california general partnership under the name raisin valley farms.they also own and operate lassen vineyards,another registered california general partnership,in partnership with laura parents,don and rena durbahn.disillusioned with a regulatory scheme they deemed outdated and exploitive of farmers,the hornes looked for ways to avoid the raisin marketing order requirements,particularly its mandatory raisin reserve program.because those requirements apply only to handlers,the hornes implemented a plan to bring their raisins to market without going through a traditional packer.as part of their plan,the hornes purchased their own equipment and facilities to clean,stem,sort,and package raisins,which they installed on lassen vineyards property in.not only did this facility handle the raisins from raisin valley farms and lassen vineyards,it also contracted with more than sixty other raisin growers to clean,stem,sort,and in some cases box and stack their raisins for a fee,typically twelve cents per pound usda records reflect that lassen vineyards packed out more than million pounds of raisins during the crop year and more than million pounds during the crop year.
meanwhile,the hornes also organized these growers into the raisin valley marketing association,an unincorporated association that marketed and sold raisins to wholesale customers on its members behalf,while the growers maintained ownership over their own raisins.raisin valley marketing then held the sales funds on the growers behalf in a trust account,from which it paid lassen vineyards its packing fees,paid a broker fee,and distributed the net proceeds to the growers.
iii.proceedings below 
the administrator of the agricultural marketing service initiated an enforcement action against the hornes,alleging violations of the amaa and failure to comply with the raisin marketing order various requirements.on appeal from an administrative law judge decision following an hearing,the usda jo found both raisin valley farms and lassen vineyards liable for twenty violations of filing of inaccurate reports violations of d failing to obtain incoming inspections violations of and failing to hold reserve raisins for the and crop years two violations of failing to pay assessments to the rac and one violation of failing to allow the agricultural marketing service access to records.the jo accordingly ordered the hornes to pay in unpaid assessments for the and crop years,pursuant to a,the alleged dollar equivalent of the withheld raisin reserve contributions for the pounds and crop years,pursuant to c and in civil penalties,pursuant to b.
the hornes filed this action in district court seeking judicial review of a final agency decision pursuant to b on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for the usda,and the hornes timely appealed.

discussion 
application of the raisin marketing order to the hornes 
for the reasons discussed in the district court opinion below,we conclude that the hornes,who admit that their business stems,sorts,cleans,and packages raisins for market as raisins,satisfy the regulatory definition of a packer and are thus handlers subject to the raisin marketing order provisions,see.see horne dep t of,dist.lexis,at.the usda interpretation of its own regulation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation and thus must be given controlling weight.see bowles seminole rock sand,accord auer robbins,miller cal.speedway,cir.furthermore,its findings regarding the hornes handler operations are supported by substantial evidence and are neither arbitrary nor capricious.see a,e.
the hornes argue they are statutorily exempt from regulation because they also satisfy the regulatory definition of a producer,and the amaa provides that n o order issued under this chapter shall be applicable to any producer in his capacity as a producer.b.however,by expressly limiting the exemption from regulation only to a producer in his capacity as a producer,the amaa contemplates that an individual who performs both producer and handler functions may still be regulated in his capacity as a handler.even if the amaa is considered silent or ambiguous on the regulation of individuals who perform both producer and handler functions,we must give chevron deference to the permissible interpretation of the secretary of agriculture,who is charged with administering the statute.chevron,usa,natural res.def.council,see see also morales izquierdo dep t of homeland,cir midway farms dep t of,cir.other courts have similarly rejected the hornes argument that a producer who handles his own product for market is statutorily exempt from regulation under the amaa.see,freeman vance,cir per curiam ideal farms,benson,cir,cert.denied,evans,fed.cl.at.deferring to the agency permissible interpretation of the statute,as we must,we conclude that applying the raisin marketing order to the hornes in their capacity as handlers was not contrary to the amaa.
ii.takings claim 
does the raisin marketing order reserve requirement program constitute a physical,per se taking of the hornes personal property without just compensation,in violation of the fifth amendment see const.amend.v n or shall private property be taken for public use,without just compensation.we join the court of federal claims,which not long ago decided this exact question,in holding it does not.see evans,fed.cl.at cal almond,united states,fed.cl,rejecting a takings claim against a similar reserve program under the almond marketing order.
the fifth amendment takings clause does not itself authorize the taking of private property,nor does it prohibit the government from doing so.instead,it imposes conditions on the government authority to act,providing that when government takes private property,pursuant to the lawful exercise of its constitutional powers,it must take for public rather than private use,and it must provide owners with just compensation,as measured by the property owner loss.see brown legal found.of,u,first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale cnty.of.the former condition ensures that government does not abuse its powers by taking private property for another private gain,see.coal mahon,the latter ensures that even when government acts in the public interest,it does not forc e some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole,armstrong united states.
in its earliest days,the takings clause was thought to apply only to direct appropriation of property,or the functional equivalent of a practical ouster of the owner possession,lingle chevron,internal quotation marks and brackets omitted,physical takings.see lucas coastal council.over the years,its reach has extended to accommodate the modern reality that government regulation of private property may,in some instances,be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.lingle,at see also loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,surveying evolution of the takings doctrine.most takings challenges to governmental regulations must undergo an ad hoc,inquiry focusing on the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable expectations and the character of the governmental action.penn cent.transp.only in two situations does the supreme court recognize that regulatory action per se goes too far in frustrating property rights,mahon,at first,where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property,however minor,lingle,at see,loretto,at compensation required where state law forced landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities occupying one and square feet of rooftops kaiser aetna united states,same for imposition of navigational servitude upon private marina united states causby,same for physical invasions of airspace and second,where government regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land,lucas,at emphasis added compensation required where state law barring construction of any permanent habitable structures on beachfront property rendered land parcels valueless.when government action results in such a total regulatory taking,id.at,as opposed to a mere partial regulatory taking,tahoe sierra council tahoe reg l planning agency,u,a property owner is categorically entitled to compensation,without resort to the usual inquiry.
the hornes,however,do not claim that the raisin marketing order effects a regulatory taking,partial or total.instead,they insist we need look no further than the rac annual direct appropriation of their raisins to conclude this is a classic physical taking.though the simplicity of their logic has some understandable appeal their raisins are personal property,personal property is protected by the fifth amendment,and each year the rac takes some of their raisins,at least in the colloquial sense their argument rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of property rights and instead clings to a phrase divorced from context.
it is undisputed that the fifth amendment guarantees compensation for the taking not only of real property but also of personal property and even intangible property.see phillips.legal,interest earned on lawyers trust account is a protected private property brown,at same ruckelshaus monsanto,same for trade secrets.no one suggests the government could come onto the hornes farm uninvited and walk off with percent of their crops without offering just compensation,even if the seizure itself were justified for example,as a wartime measure.see dolan city of tigard,nollan cal.coastal comm n,united states pewee coal,government wartime seizure and operation of a coal mine to prevent a national coal miners strike constituted a compensable taking.certainly,that government action is authorized does not immunize it from a takings claim indeed,the takings clause presupposes that the government has taken lawfully.lingle,at see kaiser aetna,at no blanket exception to the takings clause simply because congress has acted under lawful authority.if the raisin marketing order authorized an uninvited,forcible taking of the hornes crops,there is no question that the government would have a categorical duty to compensate the hornes,regardless of whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel,all their crops,or merely a part thereof.tahoe sierra,at internal citation omitted.
but a forcible taking is not what the raisin marketing order accomplishes.far from compelling a physical taking of the hornes tangible property,the raisin marketing order applies to the hornes only insofar as they voluntarily choose to send their raisins into the stream of interstate commerce.simply put,it is a use restriction,not a direct appropriation.the secretary of agriculture did not authorize a forced seizure of percent of the hornes crops and thirty percent of their crops,but rather imposed a condition on the hornes use of their crops by regulating their sale.as we explained in a similar context over seventy years ago,the raisin marketing order contains no absolute requirement of the delivery of raisins to the rac but rather only a conditional one.wallace hudson duncan,cir rejecting a takings challenge to a reserve requirement under the walnut marketing order.
in rejecting a claim that a local mobile home rent control ordinance amounted to a physical taking of park owners property interest,the supreme court similarly explained that t he government effects a physical taking only where it requires the landowner to submit to the physical occupation of his land.yee city of escondido,emphasis in original.emphasizing that the element of required acquiescence is at the heart of the concept of occupation,id.quoting fcc.power,the court explained that the mobile park owners had no physical takings claim because they voluntarily rented their land to mobile home owners and thus acquiesced in the regulation not under government compulsion but of their own accord,id.at.this same logic was used to defeat a takings challenge to a statute authorizing the public disclosure of private data submitted by applicants as a condition on registering their pesticides.see ruckelshaus,at.even though the applicants had a recognized interest in their intellectual property,the supreme court reasoned that a voluntary submission of data by an applicant in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking,so long as the disclosure condition was rationally related to a legitimate government interest and the applicant was made aware of the condition in advance.id.
there are,of course,limits to what conditions the government can constitutionally impose.the government may not require a person to give up a constitutional right for example,the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the benefit has little or no relationship to the property.dolan,at.thus,where the government conditioned the grant of a coastal development permit on the granting of a public easement bearing no nexus to the original purpose of the building restriction,the supreme court held that the government could not avoid paying compensation simply by shoehorning a taking into an unrelated exercise of its police powers.nollan,at see also dolan,at holding that city could not require development permit applicant to grant a public pathway easement where there was no reasonable relationship between the proposed development and the condition imposed.here,however,the condition imposed is rationally related to the government legitimate interest in controlling the supply of raisins on the domestic market so as to prevent price destabilization and corollary effects on the economy,and the hornes had ample prior notice of the condition before they voluntarily decided to enter the raisin market.
nevertheless,the hornes insist their voluntary subjection to the raisin marketing order is in fact the product of a hobson choice,for they have no economically viable alternative to selling their raisins and therefore must suffer the complete and total taking of a designated percentage of their raisins under compulsion.their argument is founded on an erroneous belief that they have a property right to market their raisins free of regulatory controls,cal almond,fed.cl.at,and is unavailing.
admittedly,the raisin marketing order expansive definition of handler,which includes anyone who packs raisins for sale even if the raisins are sold exclusively within the state of california,renders its regulatory reach less escapable than the marketing order at issue in wallace,which did not apply to walnuts sold within the state of production.see wallace,at.nonetheless,we noted in wallace a distinction between the direct appropriation of property and the destruction of property values in the exercise of governmental power,observing that the regulation would remain valid e ven if the c ompany were able to show that the only alternative to making delivery to the government of surplus walnuts or their credit value would be to go out of business,id.at.
this seemingly draconian result flows from the notion that some property values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the government regulatory powers.mahon,at.the implied restrictions on our property rights are the burdens we all must bear in exchange for the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community,ruckelshaus,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.our takings jurisprudence is guided by the understandings of our citizens regarding the content of,and the state power over,the bundle of rights that they acquire when they obtain title to property,lucas,at,and not every restriction on our use of property amounts to a compensable taking.
although the fifth amendment,as previously discussed,protects real and personal property alike,the personal property bundle of rights is not coextensive with the bundle comprising real property,as they are informed by different background principles.see id.at.consequently,the same government action may effect a taking when applied to one type of property but not the other.whereas a regulation depriving a landowner of all economically beneficial uses of his land effects a categorical taking,see lucas,at emphasis in original,the same may not necessarily be true of a regulation banning the sale of a commercial product,see,andrus allard,holding that prohibition on sale of eagle feathers was not a taking ruppert caffey,upholding sales ban on nonintoxicating alcoholic beverages against takings challenge james everard breweries day,upholding ban on sale of all liquor,including liquor lawfully manufactured before passage of the statute.while the total deprivation of beneficial use of land carries a heightened risk that private property is being pressed into some form of public service under the guise of mitigating serious public harm,lucas,at,when it comes to personal property,the state traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings ought to put a property owner on notice of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless at least if the property only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale,id.at.thus,although the right to sell their raisins is a significant one,it is but one strand in the hornes bundle,and even the destruction of that single strand would not amount to a taking without penn central ad hoc review.see andrus,at significant restriction imposed on one means of disposing of the artifacts does not amount to a taking see also rock royal,at as the congress would have,clearly,the right to permit only limited amounts of milk to move in interstate commerce,it might permit the movement on terms of pool settlement.
in any event,the raisin marketing order does not destroy that strand and does not deny raisin farmers all economically beneficial use of their raisins,for the regulation does not ban the sale of raisins altogethe
