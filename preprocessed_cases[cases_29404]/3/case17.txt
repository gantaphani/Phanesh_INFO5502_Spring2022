factual and procedural history 
overview of ofpa and implementing regulations 
congress enacted ofpa in to establish national standards governing the marketing of organically produced agricultural products,to assure consumers that organically produced products meet a consistent standard,and to facilitate interstate commerce in organically produced food.the act furthers these purposes by establishing a national certification program for producers and handlers of organic products and by regulating the labeling of organic products.id.a,a a.in order to be labeled or sold as organic,an agricultural product must be produced and handled without the use of synthetic substances,such as pesticides,and in accordance with an organic plan agreed to by an accredited certifying agent and the producer and handler of the product.id.see also id.listing ofpa requirements for certification.products meeting these standards may be labeled as such and may bear the usda seal.id.a.

ii.history of the present action 
harvey is a producer and handler of organic blueberries and other crops,an organic inspector employed by certifiers,and a consumer of organic foods.in october harvey filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief under the administrative procedure act,b,and under ofpa,alleging that nine provisions of the final rule are inconsistent with the act and dilute its organic standards.
on for summary judgment,magistrate judge margaret kravchuk issued a recommended decision finding that harvey lacked standing to bring his seventh claim,granting harvey summary judgment on his ninth claim,and granting the secretary summary judgment on the remaining claims.harvey veneman,wl.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommended decision with respect to harvey first eight claims,but granted summary judgment to the secretary,rather than harvey,on his ninth claim.harvey veneman,d.harvey timely appealed the district court judgment on the following seven of his nine original claims 
count harvey contends that the rule provides for the blanket exemption of nonorganic products not commercially available in organic form from the review and recommendation process ofpa requires for inclusion of substances on the national list,in contravention of the purposes of ofpa and the national list.
count harvey contends that the rule provisions allowing use of a private certifier seal on products containing less than organic ingredients,even though such products may not,according to ofpa,bear a usda organic seal,are contrary to the purposes of ofpa.
count harvey contends that the rule provisions permitting the use of synthetic substances in processing contravene ofpa,which prohibits the use of synthetic substances generally and specifically forbids the addition of synthetic ingredients in processing.
count harvey contends that the rule exclusion of certain wholesalers and distributors from its coverage contravenes ofpa,which includes such entities among the handlers and handling operations to which it applies.
count harvey contends that the rule prohibition on certifying agents provision of uncompensated advice regarding certification standards contravenes ofpa,which prohibits only advice for compensation,and also violates the rights of such agents and their clients under the first amendment to the united states constitution.
count harvey contends that the rule provisions allowing dairy animals being converted to organic production to be fed organic feed for the first nine months of the year prior to sale of their products as organic contravenes ofpa,which requires dairy animals to be fed organic feed for twelve full months prior to the sale of their products as organic.
count harvey contends that the rule imposition of uniform standards on private certifiers contravenes the purposes of ofpa.

ii.harvey standing 
a plaintiff bringing legal claims in federal court must establish standing to prosecute the action.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.this is partly a constitutional requirement to meet the requirements of article iii,a plaintiff must point to an injury in fact that a favorable judgment will redress.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.it is also a prudential requirement.to establish prudential standing,harvey must show that his complaint fall s within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.newdow,at.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
harvey alleges that he has suffered an injury in fact because the challenged regulations weaken the integrity of the organic program and the standards it sets forth.this weakening harms harvey as a consumer of organic foods because it degrades the quality of organically labeled foods.the magistrate judge properly held that this claimed harm represents concrete,redressable injury sufficient to confer article iii standing with respect to most of the counts in harvey complaint.it is well established that consumers injured by impermissible regulations satisfy article iii standing requirements.see gmc tracy,d consumers who suffer higher costs from regulation forbidden under the commerce clause satisfy the standing requirements of article iii.baur veneman,cir finding cognizable injury in fact where consumer alleged that usda regulations permitting use of downed livestock for human consumption caused him increased risk of contracting illness ctr.for auto safety highway traffic safety,finding that consumers suffered sufficient injury in fact to challenge regulations reducing fuel economy standards because the vehicles available for purchase will likely be less fuel efficient than if the fuel economy standards were more demanding.
the magistrate judge concluded that harvey lacked article iii standing with respect to his seventh count because harvey failed to allege specifically that he was a consumer of organic milk or inspector of organic dairy operations.recommended decision on for summary judgment,civ,at.but harvey has continuously alleged,as the magistrate judge acknowledged,that he purchases and consumes organic products.moreover,the record clearly contains harvey specific allegations that he has regular commercial dealings with organic dairy farmers and has purchased products containing dairy ingredients identified as organic.the magistrate judge erred in requiring more.harvey has established that this particular regulation threatens sufficient injury to him as a consumer.
harvey also clearly satisfies the requirements of prudential standing.the zone of interests test excludes only those whose interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.congress enacted ofpa to establish national standards governing the marketing of organic products,to assure consumers that organic products meet these standards,and to facilitate interstate commerce in organic products.see.harvey alleges that the final rule creates loopholes in the statutory standards,undermines consumer confidence,and fails to protect producers of true organic products.harvey alleged injuries fall precisely within the zone of interests that the statutes at issue were meant to protect.
iii.the merits 
first count alleged exemption for nonorganic products not commercially available 
harvey alleges that permits the introduction of a wide variety of nonorganic ingredients into organic or products in contravention of ofpa general prohibition of such ingredients.the portion of the rule at issue provides 
the following nonorganically produced agricultural products may be used as ingredients in or on processed products labeled as organic or made with organic specified ingredients or food group s only in accordance with any restrictions specified in this section.
any nonorganically produced agricultural product may be used in accordance with the restrictions specified in this section and when the product is not commercially available in organic form.
a cornstarch native 
b extracted only arabic,guar,locust bean,carob bean 
c use only as a thickener and dietary supplement 
emphasis added.harvey maintains that the emphasized portion of the rule allows the introduction of any nonorganic ingredient into processed products whenever an individual certifier determines that the ingredient is not commercially available in organic form.harvey correctly points out that and of ofpa require all specific exemptions to the act ban on nonorganic substances to be placed on the national list following notice and comment and subject to periodic review.see a,d,e k,l,m.harvey argues that the challenged provision allows ad hoc decisions regarding the use of synthetic substances,in contravention of these statutory procedural requirements.
in the district court and before this court,the secretary has taken the position that does not create a blanket exemption,as harvey contends,but rather permits use only of the ingredients specifically listed in that section.in other words,the secretary maintains that the list of five products in is a part of the national list and that the provision emphasized above and challenged by harvey should be interpreted simply as a further limitation on the addition of new nonorganic ingredients to the national list.
we agree with the district court that the interpretation advanced by the secretary is a plausible interpretation of the language of that eliminates any conflict with ofpa requirements.the district court was correct to conclude that,under the secretary interpretation,is not in contravention of ofpa.
however,the district court did not clarify that it is necessary to interpret the rule in this manner in order to find this portion of the rule valid.under other interpretations,might exceed the secretary authority under ofpa.in particular,the interpretation suggested by harvey,although it is at odds with ofpa evident requirements,is not an implausible construction of the language of considered alone.indeed,the secretary herself appears to have espoused exactly this interpretation in the past.see.in the regulation,a nonsynthetic and nonorganic agricultural product used as a processing aid does not have to appear on the national list.such products are included in the provision in that nonorganically produced agricultural products may be used in accordance with any applicable restrictions when the substance is not commercially available in organic form.
in light of this possibility,it is insufficient for this court simply to affirm the district court judgment that is,as it stands,consistent with ofpa.instead,to clarify that this portion of the rule may not be interpreted in a way that contravenes the national list requirements of ofpa,we remand to the district court for entry of a declaratory judgment that does not establish a blanket exemption to the national list requirements for nonorganic agricultural products that are not commercially available.
second count use of private certifiers seals on products containing less than organic ingredients 
harvey also challenges a part of the final rule permitting use of private certification notices and private certifiers seals on products containing between and organic ingredients.a,b.harvey acknowledges that the act allows such products to be labeled as containing organic ingredients but contends that ofpa implicitly prohibits the certification of such ingredients or the use of seals on these products.in his view,such certification runs afoul of a b of the act,which forbids labeling that implies,directly or indirectly,that a product is produced and handled using organic methods when it was not produced or handled in such a way.id.we conclude that the act does not prohibit,either implicitly or explicitly,the certification of organic ingredients or the use of private certifiers seals and that the challenged portion of the rule was a permissible exercise of the secretary discretion in this area.
the provision to which harvey objects is one aspect of a comprehensive labeling and certification scheme set forth in the rule.see.this scheme provides for four different types of product labels and for two different types of certification,all depending on the percentage of organic ingredients in the labeled product.the labeling scheme distinguishes products containing organic ingredients,which may be labeled percent organic,see id.a products containing to organic ingredients,which may be labeled organic,see id.b products containing to organic ingredients,which may be labeled made with organic specified ingredients or food group s,see id.c,and products containing less than percent organic ingredients,which may identify each such ingredient on the label or ingredient statement with the word organic,see id.d,a.harvey does not contest these portions of the rule,which are plainly consistent with the act requirements.see a c,forbidding labeling of products as organically produced unless produced in accordance with the act and providing that no more than nonorganic ingredients may be added to processed foods handled in accordance with the act,but also permitting labeling of ingredients as organic in processed foods containing less than organic ingredients.
harvey challenge is to a portion of the rule parallel certification scheme.this scheme allows products in the first two labeling categories,containing or more organic ingredients,to bear both a usda seal and the seal of a private certifying agent,see b,a products containing to organic ingredients to bear a notice of private certification and the seal of a private certifying agent,see id.a,b and products containing less than organic ingredients to bear neither a usda seal nor that of a private certifier,see id.b.harvey specifically objects to the second of these categories.he maintains that the act limited exemption for identifying organic ingredients does not authorize the certification of products which do not meet the requirements of the act and that allowing certification of such products misleads consumers,in contravention of a b.
we note again that harvey does not challenge the third tier of the rule labeling scheme,which allows products containing to organic ingredients to be labeled made with organic specified ingredients or food group s.c.rather,harvey challenge is to the use of private certification notices and seals on such products.his argument that use of private certifiers seals to designate the presence of organic ingredients in a product contravenes ofpa depends on two related premises that the act allows for only one kind or level of certification,namely,usda certification,which can not be uncoupled from private certification,and that the act does not contemplate the certification of ingredients or the use of private,seals to indicate their certification.
neither premise is supported by the act itself.first,the act does expressly restrict use of the usda seal,see a,and contemplates an extensive role for private certifying agents in implementing the act requirements however,it is silent on the use of private certifiers seals and on the standards for inclusion of private certification information on product packaging.since the act does not address private certification at all,it necessarily can not address whether private certification may be uncoupled from usda certification.
second,the act does provide for the identification of ingredients as organic when a product contains less than organic ingredients,id.c,but it is silent on whether such identification may or may not include certification of such ingredients as organic a private certifier mark.in other words,with respect to products containing less than organic ingredients,the act speaks only to the labeling portion of the tiered scheme described above.with respect to certification of products in this category,the act is silent.
since the act is silent on these issues,we must conclude that congress committed the questions to the secretary discretion and assess the challenged portions of the rule for their reasonableness in light of ofpa overall scheme.penobscot air,at see also united states haggar apparel,d if the agency statutory interpretation fills a gap or defines a term in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design,we give that judgment controlling weight.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the challenged regulations are reasonable in light of ofpa overall scheme.the act clearly authorizes the use of the word organic on the packaging of products made with to organic ingredients.c.under the act,certifying agents play a crucial role in determining whether an ingredient derives from an organic operation.id.d.given these statutory directives,the secretary requirement that labels on products containing to organic ingredients identify the agent responsible for certifying such ingredients is not unreasonable.this information allows the secretary to identify and track certifiers on a basis,creates consumer confidence that the specified ingredients are indeed organic,and provides the name of the certifier,which may be useful to some consumers.far from contravening the act,the certification requirement furthers its purpose of assuring consistency.see id.stating purposes of ofpa.
nor is it unreasonable for the secretary to permit inclusion of private certifiers seals on such products.such seals will tend to increase consumer confidence and to facilitate interstate commerce in organic products,furthering two of ofpa three goals.see id.harvey and the amici argue that the presence of a seal on some products will confuse consumers.consumers might be confused by the presence of usda seals on products containing to organic ingredients.see id.a b,a,a.but it is difficult to see how a seal applied in compliance with the challenged provisions could create similar confusion,particularly since the seal will be accompanied by labeling stating not that the product is organic or organic but merely that it is made with organic ingredients.under these circumstances,a private certifier seal appearing alone on a label serves simply to reiterate the identification of the agent certifying the ingredient.harvey points to no support,statutory or otherwise,for his contention that the identification of an ingredient as organic is somehow less confusing to consumers than identification of a private certifier or use of such a certifier seal,yet such a distinction is crucial to his argument.because we can see no basis for the distinction,we reject the inference.
we conclude that the district court did not err in upholding the challenged portions of the final rule as permissible exercises of the secretary authority.we therefore affirm the district court judgment on this count of harvey complaint.
third count use of synthetic substances in processing 
harvey next challenges two parts of the rule permitting synthetic substances to be used in processed organic foods.b,b.section b provides that synthetic substances may be used as a processing aid or adjuvant if they meet six criteria b lists synthetic substances specifically allowed in or on processed products labeled as organic.these provisions,harvey contends,contravene the plain language of ofpa,which provides that certified handling operations shall not,with respect to any agricultural product covered by this title add any synthetic ingredient during the processing or any postharvest handling of this product.a harvey is correct the challenged regulations lie outside of the scope of authority granted the secretary by ofpa.
the secretary conceded before the district court that a constitutes a general prohibition against adding synthetic ingredients in handling operations.the secretary argues,however,that of the act,which directs the establishment of the national list and governs the creation of exemptions from the act general prohibitions,allows the listing of synthetics for use in the handling of products labeled organic.we reject this argument.this section provides that 
the national list may provide for the use of substances in an organic farming or handling operation that are otherwise prohibited under this title only if 
b the substance 
i is used in production and contains an active synthetic ingredient in the following categories 
ii is used in production and contains synthetic inert ingredients that are not classified by the administrator of the environmental protection agency as inerts of toxicological concern or 
iii is used in handling and i s but is not organically produced 
emphases added.this section contemplates use of certain synthetic substances during the production,or growing,of organic products,but not during the handling or processing stages section c b iii simply does not say what the secretary needs it to say.
the secretary notes that some subsections of refer to farming or handling activities together,and the secretary claims that this language renders the act ambiguous or inconsistent,permitting the secretary to draft a reasonable reconciliation.we reject this characterization of the act.section c clearly establishes a test for exemption of otherwise prohibited substances and their inclusion on the national list.prong a,not quoted above,sets forth requirements that any otherwise prohibited substance,whether used in production or handling,must meet to be exempted prong b,quoted above,specifically requires that the otherwise prohibited substances exempted for use in handling be nonsynthetic.prong b is not inconsistent with prong a it merely sets forth more specific requirements with regard to the types of substances that may be exempted for use in production and handling,respectively.
the challenged regulations are contrary to the plain language of ofpa and therefore exceed the secretary statutory authority.see chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the secretary on this count 
fifth count exemption of wholesalers and distributors from certification requirements 
harvey next challenges b,a portion of the final rule that excludes from the act coverage and requirements handling operations selling products that are packaged or otherwise enclosed in a container prior to being received or acquired by the operation and that r emain in the same package or container and are not otherwise processed while in the control of the handling operation.id.b i ii.according to harvey,this provision impermissibly excludes wholesalers and distributors,a subset of those engaged in handling operations,from certification and other ofpa requirements.but,harvey argues,ofpa expressly exempts from its certification requirements only one subset of those engaged in handling operations,namely,retailers who do not process the foods they sell.according to harvey,the act can not be read to permit the additional blanket exemption of wholesalers and distributors.
ofpa exclusion of final retailers from its coverage shows that congress knew how to exclude operations otherwise subject to the act and must be presumed to have acted deliberately when it did not specifically exclude those that handle only packaged products.see id.that,however,is not the end of the story.section of the act specifies the requirements for certification of handling operations.id.each of the seven subsections of prohibits either the addition of contaminants or exposure to contaminating materials.id.a.the evident purpose of this section is to ensure that operations handling organic products will not contaminate or expose to contamination those products.but operations handling only packaged products as defined in the regulation do not present the contamination hazards at which this hence the certification aimed.thus,certification is irrelevant to those operations that handle only packaged products.
the statutory definition of handling operations in,on its face,appears to include operations handling only sealed packaged products.but the requirements for certification of handling operations in appear to have no application to operations handling only sealed packaged products,which by their nature could not engage in any of the proscribed activities.this portion of the statute therefore lacks coherence and consistency,creating ambiguity concerning congress intent.see,barnhart sigmon coal,d holding that inquiry as to statutory ambiguity ceases if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent internal quotation marks and citation omitted salinas united states,d noting that in order for a statute to be considered unambiguous,i t need only be plain to anyone reading the act that the statute encompasses the conduct at issue internal quotation marks and citations omitted brown gardner,d ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.citation omitted.because the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the court must defer to the secretary reasonable interpretation of the statute.chevron,at.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the secretary on this count.
sixth count prohibition on uncompensated advice from private certifiers 
harvey also challenges a iv,which prohibits certifying agents from giving advice or providing consultancy services,to certification applicants or certified operations,for overcoming identified barriers to certification.harvey contends,first,that this regulation clearly conflicts with h,which bars certifying agents only from mixing advice with financial interest 
any certifying agent shall not 
carry out any inspections of any operation in which such certifying agent has,or has had,a commercial interest,including the provision of consultancy services 
accept payment,gifts,or favors of any kind from the business inspected other than prescribed fees or 
provide advice concerning organic practices or techniques for a fee,other than fees established under such program.
id.harvey argues further that even if the relevant portion of ofpa is ambiguous,deference to the secretary interpretation as embodied in the portion of the rule at issue is not warranted,because this regulation raises serious constitutional questions in that it conditions receipt of a public the relinquishment of free speech rights.see legal servs.velazquez,d.
in connection with the first of these arguments,harvey specifically contends that h,titled conflicts of interest,constitutes the complete list of certifier activities banned by congress and may not be interpreted to bar activities not involving financial benefit to the advice giver.but as the secretary points out,the statute is not quite so narrowly focused it also bars inspections when the certifier has had a commercial interest in an operation and prohibits inspectors from accepting favors of any kind.h.as its title suggests,the subsection regulates conflicts of interest and certifier integrity generally.it neither addresses nor excludes the question of whether the provision of free advice may risk a conflict of interest.
since the statute is ambiguous on this point,we reach step two of chevron and must defer to the secretary interpretation if it is reasonable.chevron,at.we conclude that this interpretation is reasonable.it is easy to imagine situations in which providing free advice might create a conflict of interest for a certifier the secretary outlines a scenario in which a certifier provides but erroneous advice on compliance with the act to a producer,then later is faced with a choice between reporting the producer violation and recanting the erroneous advice,a step that could injure the certifier own reputation and credibility.section h is concerned with ensuring certifiers integrity and avoiding conflicts of interest.it does not preclude the secretary from imposing additional requirements tending to achieve these ends.the challenged regulation is therefore neither inconsistent with the act nor an unreasonable interpretation of the secretary authority.
harvey argues that if we find the statute ambiguous on this point,any chevron deference due the secretary interpretation is offset by the requirement that we construe statutes,where possible,to avoid conflict with the constitution.see rust sullivan,d see also west,fcc,cir d eference to an agency interpretation is inappropriate not only when it is conclusively unconstitutional,but also when it raises serious constitutional questions.according to harvey,the challenged regulation raises a substantial constitutional question,since it conditions receipt of a government benefit on speech restrictions.
in making this argument,harvey relies primarily on legal services velazquez,d in legal services,the supreme court invalidated restrictions on the speech of attorneys representing welfare claimants in a legal services program.the court noted that the challenged program was designed to facilitate private speech,not to promote a governmental message,and contrasted it in this regard with the program in rust sullivan,d,in which the government used private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program,a program of federal funding for family planning clinics.legal servs,at citation and quotation omitted.the court in legal services emphasized that when the government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message,as in
