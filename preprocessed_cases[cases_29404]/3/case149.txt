a jury found combine manufacturer cnh america,llc cnh,liable under theories of breach of express warranty and strict liability after a fire in a combine engine compartment caused extensive damage to the combine and to corn that was onboard the combine.cnh moved before trial to exclude the plaintiffs fire causation expert and mechanical expert.cnh also moved before trial for summary judgment and after trial for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the district court denied summary judgment and admitted the plaintiffs experts but later agreed with the defendant that one of the plaintiffs experts testified as to matters that exceeded the scope of his report.the district court did not strike the challenged testimony but advised the jury that the expert testified to matters that exceeded the scope of his written opinion.finally,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law as to claims for negligence and breach of implied warranty,but submitted to the jury claims of breach of warranty and strict liability.cnh now appeals,and we affirm.
background 
a.the combine and the fire 
the combine at issue in this case is a case international harvester model combine manufactured by cnh the combine.material to the present discussion,the combine has a diesel engine and holds twenty quarts of oil.in each cylinder,a piston connected to a rod travels up and down throughout the sequential stages of a combustion cycle.through each piston,combustion generates working motion that is transferred through a rod and wrist pin to a crankshaft that,ultimately,provides power for the combine various moving parts.we will refer to the area between each piston and the walls of its accompanying cylinder as the bore clearance.this area requires lubrication to minimize friction and heat that may cause damage to the piston and cylinder and that may cause the piston to seize within the cylinder.
in september,the plaintiffs purchased the used combine from fairbanks international,a farm equipment dealer in hastings,nebraska.fairbanks international had sold the combine new to david burr in.the combine was covered by a hour written warranty that expired on september,the warranty and transferred to the plaintiffs with the combine.the warranty covered parts and labor for defects caused by material or workmanship if discovered and reported during the term of the warranty and if the repair was performed at an authorized cnh location.
when the plaintiffs purchased the combine it had been used for approximately hours.plaintiff greg shuck greg changed the oil at that time.he changed the oil a second time,on october,when the combine had about hours of use.the recommended period of time between oil changes on the combine is hours of use,depending on the oil,so this oil change was timely.
on october,after harvesting corn with the combine for approximately two hours,greg measured the oil using the dipstick,observed that it was a slight amount underneath full,and added a quart of oil.greg also greased various points on the combine,and in the process,he accessed the engine compartment and observed no indication of an oil leak.greg continued to harvest with the combine throughout october.
on the morning of october,greg again checked the oil,observed that the oil was up to the mark,and resumed harvesting.by on october,greg had been harvesting with the combine for approximately thirteen to fifteen hours since the october oil change.at that time,greg turned off the combine for about thirty to minutes to tend to other matters.he then restarted the combine,let it warm up for a couple of minutes,and resumed harvesting.before he had traveled a quarter of a mile,he heard a loud squealing noise.he checked the monitors and saw no warning or indicator lights or buzzers suggesting that anything was wrong.he then looked in his mirror and saw flames.greg was able to raise the grain head,and he attempted to back the combine out of the field to avoid burning the standing corn.the engine quickly lost power,however,and he was only able to back out about fifteen feet.he used an onboard fire extinguisher to put out flames on standing corn near the combine.the fire department eventually arrived and extinguished the onboard fire,which had damaged the combine and burned approximately bushels of corn held within the combine.
b.the experts and the trial 
prior to trial,the plaintiffs identified ken ward as a fire causation expert and steven mikesell as a mechanical expert.cnh identified john mertens as a fire causation and origin expert.ward inspected the combine in the week following the fire,examined the location in the field where the fire had occurred,and later attended a dismantling of the engine,where he was again able to inspect the combine.mikesell inspected the combine and engine when the engine was dismantled.mertens inspected the combine near the time of the fire and again at the time the engine was dismantled.
ward concluded that the fire started in the engine compartment and was caused when the number six piston disengaged from the main crankshaft causing a connecting rod to flail about and punch holes through the forward and rearward sides of the engine block and through the oil pan.ward concluded that these holes permitted the uncontrolled blending of oxygen and combustibles in the presence of multiple ignition sources,thus causing the fire.ward did not offer an opinion as to the cause of the piston failure,but he ruled out the possibility that the fire was caused by oil starvation.ward observed that only the piston and cylinder in the number six position displayed damage,whereas oil starvation would have caused friction,overheating,and damage in multiple cylinders.ward observed that he saw no evidence of a massive oil leak,as one would expect if enough of the combine twenty quarts of oil had drained away to cause overheating related to general oil starvation.greg shuck statements and his description of his actions and his observation of the combine around the time of the fire were consistent with ward opinion that the combine had not suffered oil starvation.greg operated the combine for thirteen to fifteen hours after he changed the oil and replaced the filter.he observed no oil spray or leak in the engine compartment on the two days following the oil change,and he observed no indication by way of warning lights,buzzers,or signals suggesting a problem while operating the combine.further,no witness claimed to observe a large quantity of oil on the ground.
mikesell,like ward,concluded that the engine did not display evidence of oil starvation.mikesell stated that piston failure led to the fire,and he offered three explanations of how the piston may have failed.first,he suggested that the bore clearance at the number six position may have been insufficient,leading to friction,overheating,and failure at only this position.second,he suggested that a wrist pin connecting the number six piston to the crankshaft may have failed.third,and in mikesell opinion,most likely,there may have been a defect in the fuel delivery system.like ward,mikesell explained in detail his observations and his reasons for rejecting oil starvation as a cause of the fire.
mertens concluded that greg shuck improperly installed the oil filter at the time of the october oil change such that enough of the twenty quarts of oil leaked from the engine to cause the engine to run dry.as a result,friction caused overheating and user error could be deemed the cause of the fire.mertens testified that he observed no indication that oil had sprayed from the holes that were punched in the engine block,as had been stated by the plaintiffs experts.he also testified that the oil filter had burned and that the burn patterns,in his opinion,suggested that the fire was centered around the oil filter.
the experts testimony was largely consistent with and commensurate in scope with their respective written opinions.one exception was mikesell,who testified as to the three suggest defects listed above insufficient bore clearance,clearance,or fuel delivery problems but did not address these three possible defects in his written report.mikesell did address the issue of a fuel delivery system defect months prior to trial in a deposition.the district court advised the jurors of the discrepancy between mikesell pretrial opinions and his opinion at trial,but did not strike the additional opinion testimony.
the competing experts opinions presented two contradictory and competing theories of how the number six piston failed and how the fire started.under cnh theory,user error in the installation of an oil filter caused the number six piston to run dry,overheat,and seize,leading to engine failure and the ignition of leaked oil.the plaintiffs,on the other hand,presented testimony from greg shuck,who explained in detail his use and maintenance of the combine and his observations of the engine compartment and warning indicators,none of which suggested an oil leak.also,plaintiffs experts ward and mikesell explained how the physical evidence disproved cnh theory,thus eliminating user error or misuse as a possible cause of the fire.the district court submitted the case to the jury based on these competing theories and the jury found for the plaintiffs.the parties had stipulated for the jury that the plaintiffs loss amount as to the breach of warranty claim was and the loss amount as to the strict liability claim was the jury returned verdicts for the plaintiffs on both counts,and cnh appeals.
ii.discussion 
a.the admission of experts 
cnh argues that the district court should have excluded the testimony and opinions of ward and mikesell prior to trial or,alternatively,should have excluded their opinions after the fact based on testimony they presented at trial.as to mikesell,cnh further argues that his testimony exceeded the scope of his opinion as disclosed by the plaintiffs under federal rule of civil procedure a b and that the district court should have instructed the jury not to consider certain aspects of his testimony.we review the admission of expert testimony and the denial of a motion in limine for abuse of discretion.united states triplett,cir united states littrell,cir.similarly,we review for abuse of discretion a district court election regarding how to treat evidence that was not disclosed in accordance with rule a b.davis bancorp,cir applying an abuse of discretion standard to a district court handling of a failure to disclose under rule a.finally,we note that,under federal rule of civil procedure c,evidence not disclosed under rule a is admissible if harmless.
federal rule of evidence reflects an attempt to liberalize the rules governing the admission of expert testimony.lauzon senco,cir quoting weisgram marley,cir,aff,d.the rule clearly is one of admissibility rather than exclusion.id.quoting arcoren united states,cir.under rule and daubert merrell dow,d,the court serves as gatekeeper to ensure that a witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,that the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,and is the product of reliable principles and methods,and that the witness applies the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.when evaluating the methodology that an expert witness applies,it may be important to consider whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication the known or potential rate of error and whether the theory has been generally accepted.peitzmeier hennessy,cir quoting daubert,at.these factors are not exclusive,however,and they need not be considered in every case because,o f course,the daubert reliability factors should only be relied upon to the extent that they are relevant and the district court must customize its inquiry to fit the facts of each particular case.jaurequi carter,cir internal citations omitted see daubert,at.the inquiry envisioned by rule is,we emphasize,a flexible one.
cnh does not argue that ward or mikesell were unqualified due to a lack of education or experience cnh argues only that these two experts failed to follow established,reliable methodology in formulating their opinions and failed to limit their opinions to matters that were disclosed prior to trial.the challenge to the experts methodology seems particularly misplaced given that mertens,cnh own expert,based his opinion on observations rather than like ward and mikesell.all three experts studied the combine,engine,statements by greg shuck,and product literature.none of the experts tested damaged and burned combine parts,conducted destructive testing of exemplar combines,or tested oil or soil from the combine or the field.when a litigant clearly believes a certain methodology is acceptable as shown by his or her own expert reliance on that methodology,it is disingenuous to challenge an opponent use of that methodology.
further,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court admission of the challenged testimony.the failure to test components that were damaged or destroyed by fire did not necessarily render the experts methodology flawed nor opinions inadmissible.here,ward and mikesell testified that certain components could not be tested due to the destruction or alteration of the components in the fire or due to the arrangement of the components in the damaged engine.for example,mikesell explained that the fuel injectors,the liner of the cylinder in the number six position,and the oil filter were damaged to the point where they either could not be extracted from the engine or they could not be tested in a manner that would yield meaningful results.
in such a situation,observations coupled with expertise generally may form the basis of an admissible expert opinion.see kumho tire carmichael,d engineering testimony rests upon scientific foundations,the reliability of which will be at issue in some cases.in other cases,the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal knowledge or experience.internal citations omitted id.at.n o one denies that an expert might draw a conclusion from a set of observations based on extensive and specialized experience.hickerson pride mobility prods,cir holding that a fire causation expert opinion was admissible where the methodology involved no testing but the application of specialized knowledge to observations of a fire scene.like the expert in hickerson,and like cnh own expert in this case,ward and mikesell observed the relevant evidence,applied their specialized knowledge,and systematically included and excluded possible theories of causation.cnh complaints about the plaintiffs experts are more properly directed to the jury and to the weight to be accorded the experts opinions rather than to the question of admissibility.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged testimony 
scope of mikesell testimony 
cnh argues that the district court erred by permitting mikesell to testify as to matters not contained in his written report that the plaintiffs disclosed prior to trial.in the written march and disclosed pursuant to rule a b mikesell presented a brief summary of his observations and his opinion.it was his observation that conditions at the number six piston were different than at the other piston positions,suggesting that the fire was caused by something other than oil starvation.it was his opinion that the fire started when the number six connecting rod pushed through the engine wall and the oil pan allowing air and fuel to mix in the presence of multiple ignition sources.in a deposition dated may,mikesell further elaborated on his opinion and explained that he believed a fuel mixture problem caused by a defect in the fuel delivery system could have caused the piston to begin to seize in the cylinder.at trial,he repeated these opinions and also testified that,although he believed a fuel delivery defect was the most likely cause of the piston seizure,an improper bore clearance or improper wrist pin clearance could have caused the seizure as well.
based on the written report and deposition testimony,we believe the only additional opinion mikesell presented in his trial testimony was the suggestion of possible bore clearance or wrist pin clearance defects.mikesell
