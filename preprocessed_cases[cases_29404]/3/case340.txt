henry lee pickett is the owner of a farm located miles south of montgomery,alabama.in this class action lawsuit he is the lead plaintiff representing a national class of cattle producers who sell their fed raised specifically for plants exclusively on the cash market.
tyson fresh meats,formerly iowa beef processors,ibp,is the largest company in the united states.it processes to forty percent of the steaks,hamburgers,and other consumer beef products sold in restaurants and supermarkets nationwide.tyson purchases some cattle on the cash market from producers like pickett.since tyson has also purchased a significant portion of its cattle through marketing agreements with cattle producers instead of from the cash market.
pickett contends that tyson has used marketing agreements to deflate the price of fed cattle on the cash market and the market as a whole in order to reap the benefits of lower prices.to stop tyson from using marketing agreements and to recover for losses incurred from the lower prices that resulted on the cash market,pickett sued tyson.he brought the lawsuit on behalf of all cash market sellers claiming that tyson had engaged in unfair practices and manipulated prices in violation of the packers and stockyards act of,et.
the issues this case raises,and its procedural history,are best understood after a discussion of the cattle and industries and the market where they meet.
fed cattle are born,raised,and marketed exclusively for slaughter.the process begins with the birth of a calf on a farm which exists solely to breed and raise cattle,feed them,and then sell them to plants for processing into beef products.the first days of a calf life are spent feeding from her mother.after that,the calf is weaned and spends the next days eating feed,grass,or wheat.
after the calf has been fed for days,the producer sends it along with all the other calves being raised at the same time to a feed yard.the feed yard is a farm specifically designed to feed the calves intensively so they are in peak condition when sold to the meat packers.some producers have feed yards on their farms,while others send their calves to third party feed yards which not only finish feeding them but also broker the cattle to the meat packers on the producer behalf.
at the feed yards,each calf is put into a pen with fifty to other calves for the intensive feeding program,which usually lasts days.when the feeding program is finished,each animal ideally weighs pounds,the industry target weight.
once the cattle in a pen have been fed intensively for days,and have hopefully reached the target weight,they must be sold to a plant within two weeks.if the fed cattle are not sold within that time period,they become too expensive for the feed yard to maintain and also become less desirable to the meat packers.they become too expensive because cattle gain usable weight more slowly after reaching pounds and eventually stop gaining it at all,but they still must be fed.they become less desirable to meat packers because the cattle start to gain more fat and the market is for meat not fat.the point is that the window for selling fed cattle after they have been at a feed yard for days is critical to the producers,the feed yards,and the meat packers.for ease of reference,from this point on we will refer to fed cattle as simply cattle,except where quoting.
once a meat packer purchases a pen of cattle,it has those cattle hauled to its factory and slaughters them.the packer then processes the carcasses into different cuts of meat,hamburger,new york strip,and filet mignon,packages the different cuts,and sells them to meat wholesalers,restaurants,and grocery stores.
the process we have described has been used to prepare cattle for the market since packers began buying pens of cattle directly from producers on the cash market about sixty years ago.before that,the buying and selling of cattle was done through agents at stockyards in major cities in the midwest with chicago being the largest.during all but the last decade or so,packers purchased cattle almost exclusively through the cash market.
this is how the cash market works.buyers from the companies spread out around the country to the different feed yards and inspect the pens of cattle that are ready to be sold.if the buyer likes the cattle in a pen,he makes an offer to the producer or feed yard operator.the producer or operator is free to accept or reject the packer offer in deciding whether to do so,he often considers offers being made for other pens of cattle around the country.much of this information is relayed over the telephone from one producer or operator to another.often,the producer or feed yard operator and the buyer from the packing plant haggle over the price.if they eventually agree on a price,the cattle in the pen are delivered to the packing plant seven days from the date of the agreement on price.the price the packer paid for the pen of cattle is reported to a central office and average prices are published each week.
in the a number of cattle producers began looking for a new method of marketing their cattle to packers,one that did not require as much time and hassle as negotiating every pen of cattle on the cash market.they came up with marketing agreements and eventually persuaded the packers,including tyson,to begin using those agreements for some of their purchases.the use of marketing agreements spread slowly throughout the industry at first but began to pick up steam in the.by tyson,among others,was using marketing agreements to procure a substantial part of the cattle it needed 
under the typical marketing agreement,a feed yard operator will call and tell the meat packer buyer that he has a pen of cattle at its peak and ready to be sold.the feed yard operator promises to have the cattle delivered to the factory for slaughter within two weeks,with the packer getting to pick the exact date of delivery within that period.the price paid for the cattle under the marketing agreement is pegged at the publicly released average price for the week prior to when the agreement is made.the agreement commonly provides that after the cattle are processed the price will be adjusted up or down based on the quality or the yield of the carcasses.the adjustment is quickly and easily calculated by tyson as a matter of course in processing the cattle.
to summarize,the difference is that with marketing agreements,unlike purchases,the price is set not through bidding but automatically at the price the week before the agreement is made,the price is usually adjusted based on quality or yield,and the packer picks the actual delivery date within the period that begins when the agreement is made.
pickett,and the class members he represents,sell their cattle exclusively on the cash market they claim that through marketing agreements tyson has been able to manipulate the price of cattle on the cash market tyson is the largest meat packer in the country.it processes forty percent of all hamburgers and steaks on american dinner tables.tyson slaughters million cattle each year,nearly of the million cattle that are purchased and slaughtered by plants in this country.
pickett theory is that tyson has used marketing agreements and its large market share to artificially reduce prices on the cash market.prices for cattle on the cash market are responsive to supply and demand.pickett claims that by using marketing agreements tyson has withdrawn a large amount of demand from the cash market,thereby substantially decreasing price pressure there.the result,in pickett view,is that producers selling on the cash market have gotten a lower price for their cattle.a reduced price benefits tyson in two ways.first,tyson is able to obtain the cattle that it still purchases on the cash market millions of head each year at a lower price.second,because the price tyson pays for cattle is pegged to the average price,it pays less for those cattle too.
according to pickett,the lower prices that tyson pays for cattle are not an unintended consequence of its heavy use of marketing agreements to purchase much of its needs.to the contrary,pickett alleges that those lower prices are the primary,intended consequence of marketing agreements.he claims that achieving lower prices in that manner constitutes an unfair practice and the manipulation of prices in violation of the packers and stockyards act.
the case was tried for four weeks.before the case was submitted to the jury,tyson moved the district court for judgment as a matter of law under.a.the motion asserted,among other grounds,that tyson had proven a number of competitive justifications for using marketing agreements,the factual existence of which were not disputed by any evidence.the district court almost granted tyson rule a motion,observing that pickett had presented a very thin case,but it decided to reserve ruling on the motion to see what the jury would do.the district court explained that granting the motion before the jury verdict risked having to the whole trial if the appellate court disagreed,and a retrial would be long and costly.
the jury verdict consisted of answers to a number of interrogatories.specifically,the jury was asked yes or no whether it found,by a preponderance of the evidence 
that there is a nationwide market for fed cattle 
that the defendant use of marketing agreements had an effect on the cash market for fed cattle 
that the defendant lacked a legitimate business reason or competitive justification for using marketing agreements 
that the defendant use of marketing agreements proximately caused the cash market price to be lower than it otherwise would have been 
that the defendant use of marketing agreements injured each and every member of the plaintiffs class 
the jury answered yes to each of those five questions.
the verdict form instructed the jury that,if it did answer yes to all of those questions,it should answer these additional questions 
what amount,if any,do you find that defendant use of marketing agreements damaged the cash market price of fed cattle sold to the defendant during the period from february,through october,
did the defendant use of marketing agreements depress the cash market price for fed cattle purchased by the defendant by an equal percentage for each year of the class period if your answer is yes,by what percent 
the jury wrote in the question number blank it answered question number no.
following the verdict the district court granted tyson rule b renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,ruling that pickett evidence is insufficient to support a finding that tyson lacked a legitimate business justification for its use of marketing agreements.pickett tyson fresh meats,d.it entered final judgment for tyson.this is pickett appeal from that judgment 
we review de novo a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law,applying the same standard as the district court.cleveland home shopping network,cir.a district court should grant judgment as a matter of law when the plaintiff presents no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for him on a material element of his cause of action.id.the court should deny it if the plaintiff presents enough evidence to create a substantial conflict in the evidence on an essential element of the plaintiff case.watkins sverdrup,cir bogle orange county bd.of county comm rs,cir i n order to survive a defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law the plaintiff must present evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find in the plaintiff favor on each and every element of the claim.
pickett and his fellow class members contend that tyson marketing agreements violated the packers and stockyards act.the relevant sections of the psa make it 
unlawful for any packer or swine contractor with respect to livestock,meats,meat food products,or livestock products in unmanufactured form,or for any live poultry dealer with respect to live poultry,to 
a engage in or use any unfair,unjustly discriminatory,or deceptive practice or device or 
e engage in any course of business or do any act for the purpose or with the effect of manipulating or controlling prices,or of creating a monopoly in the acquisition of,buying,selling,or dealing in,any article,or of restraining commerce 
packers and stockyards act a,e,a,e.
it is undisputed that tyson is a meat packer and that the psa applies to its business.the dispute is over what is an unfair practice and what constitutes any act for the purpose or with the effect of manipulating or controlling prices.pickett contends he has established unfairness and price control or manipulation under the psa by proving that tyson marketing agreements caused the price,and the overall market price,for cattle to be lower than it otherwise would be.if that were all pickett were required to prove he might win,because there was evidence at trial to support the jury finding that the use of marketing agreements has resulted in lower prices for cattle both on the cash market and the market as a whole 
tyson,of course,urges a contrary reading of the psa.it takes the position that because the psa was meant as a protection against practices by meat packers,pickett must establish more than that the use of marketing agreements have decreased the price for cattle.he must establish that their use has adversely affected competition,which requires showing that marketing agreements have no justifications.
the district court resolved this issue in tyson favor.after it did so,this court resolved the meaning of unfair practice in psa a in the same way.in london fieldale farms,cir,we held that in order to succeed on a claim under the psa,a plaintiff must show that the defendant unfair,discriminatory or deceptive practice adversely affects or is likely to adversely affect competition.id.at.this,we explained,is consistent with the purpose and intent behind the psa.at the time of enactment,the chief evil congress feared was the monopoly of the packers.id.at citing stafford wallace.the primary purpose of the psa was to assure fair competition and fair trade practices in livestock marketing and in the meatpacking industry.id.quoting,at,cong.it was aimed at halting practices whose purpose was to destroy competition.id.the london decision settles in this circuit that by unfair practice,psa a means a practice that does or is likely to adversely affect competition.id.at see also adkins cagle foods jv,llc,cir.
in the london case there was no psa e price manipulation or control claim,as there is in this case,but the principles and purposes behind these two closely related provisions of the act are the same.section e is aimed at preventing a particular type of unfairness in the industry,namely,price manipulation and control and the creation of monopolies.with section e,as with section a,the chief evil congress feared was the monopoly of the packers,and the primary purpose was to assure fair competition and fair trade practices.london,at.for the same reasons a section a unfairness claim requires a plaintiff to show an adverse effect on competition,so does a section e price manipulation or control claim.
it was not congress intent in enacting the psa to interfere with a meat packer business practices where those practices did not interfere with competition.see ibp,glickman,cir w e are mindful that the purpose behind the act was not to so upset the traditional principles of freedom of contract,as to require an entirely level playing field for all.quotation omitted.if a packer course of business promotes efficiency and aids competition in the cattle market,the challenged practice can not,by definition,adversely affect competition.see london,at we note that elimination of a competitive impact requirement would subvert the policy justifications for the psa adoption.see also jackson swift eckrich,cir we are convinced that the purpose behind of the psa,was not to so upset the traditional principles of freedom of contract.the psa was designed to promote efficiency,not frustrate it.glickman,at same griffin smithfield foods,d,same.
in this case,the jury found that tyson use of marketing agreements had an effect on the cash market for fed cattle and that tyson lacked a legitimate business reason or competitive justification for using marketing agreements.the district court,in granting tyson rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law,concluded that pickett had failed to present any evidence to call into question tyson evidence establishing that marketing agreements allow the company to keep up with competitors in the industry who also were reaping the cost benefits of marketing agreements provide the company with a reliable and consistent supply of cattle to keep its factories at full capacity reduce the transaction costs of having to negotiate individually for pens of cattle a year to meet its needs and permit the company to match its cattle purchases with the needs of its customers.see pickett,d at.in the district court view,the trial record is barren of any evidence which would permit the jury to conclude that tyson lacked a legitimate business justification for its use of marketing agreements.id.at.
pickett contends that the district court got it wrong.he argues that there was evidence to support a finding that all of tyson competitive justifications for using marketing agreements were pretextual,thus rendering reasonable the jury finding that tyson had no competitive justification for doing so.the pretext issue applied to the justifications tyson asserted is what this case turns on.if there is evidence from which a jury reasonably could find that none of tyson asserted justifications are real,that each one is pretextual,pickett wins.otherwise,tyson wins.
we mentioned earlier in this opinion that marketing agreements were originated by cattle producers,not meat packers.some cattle producers insist on selling their cattle through those agreements and will not use the cash market.others prefer to use marketing agreements for some or all of their cattle.tyson first competitive justification for using the marketing agreements is that it must use them in order to have access to the cattle of those producers.otherwise,it will lose all of that supply,which constitutes a significant share of the market,to its competitors who do use the agreements.as the district court found,restricting its own use of marketing agreements would pose problems for tyson,as it would have fewer cattle to choose from,and the quality and reliability of its cattle supply would likely suffer.id.at.in other words,tyson needs to use marketing agreements to meet the competition.
tyson presented a number of witnesses who testified to the factual premise of this justification tyson competitors use marketing agreements and tyson would suffer a serious competitive disadvantage if it did not use them.some of pickett own witnesses testified to the same thing.no one disputed this justification as a factual matter.instead,pickett position is that this justification is legally insufficient.he insists that a practice of purchasers that is unfair to sellers should not be allowed on the ground that all purchasers do it.in other words,there ought not be a meet the competition defense to conduct that the psa otherwise prohibits.
the law does recognize a meet the competition defense in another context.the act,which amended the clayton antitrust act,generally proscribes price discrimination between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality.act a,a.that is,a commodities dealer can not charge its favored purchasers a lower price while selling at a higher price to others.the act,however,recognizes an exception and provides for an absolute defense if a merchant lower price to a purchaser was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor.id.b.that defense has been roundly criticized.see hoover color bayer,cir collecting critiques of the act by justice frankfurter and judges bork and posner.
in any event,the psa is not the act.unlike the latter,the psa does not expressly provide a meet the competition defense.congress could have written that defense into the psa just as it did in the act.we would be most reluctant to do congress writing for it,especially when the wisdom of the provision we are asked to write into the statute is debatable.but we need not go so far as to reject the meet the competition defense in psa cases,because in this case that defense would not matter.it would not matter because tyson has offered other justifications for its use of marketing agreements,and those justifications are legally permissible and factually uncontradicted in the record.
tyson second proffered competitive justification for marketing agreements is that their use provides the company with a reliable and stable supply of cattle for its packing plants.this is an unquestionably legitimate justification.see glickman,at the record demonstrates that the business practice is an effort by ibp to have a more reliable and efficient method of obtaining a supply of cattle.the psa was designed to promote efficiency,not frustrate it.quotation omitted.
tyson contends that,because there are not enough cattle in the market to meet the demands of the entire packing industry from week to week,and because it must purchase head of cattle each week to keep its processing plants running at full productive capacity,the company has to struggle to keep a constant supply of cattle coming into its plants.before tyson had to negotiate individually for each pen of cattle it purchased.its competitors were also negotiating on the same pens of cattle,and the producers were free to accept or reject tyson offered price for a pen.if tyson offers were rejected for enough pens,the company could not fill its factory for the next week and it would not have enough product to meet its customers demands.
marketing agreements make the inventory crunch much less crunchy for tyson.they are negotiated two weeks in advance of delivery of the cattle,and tyson picks the exact date of delivery within that period.these features provide tyson with greater ability to plan its purchases and to keep a steady flow of cattle coming into its plants.by contrast,the cash market provides tyson with no leeway about the delivery date,because cattle purchased on it are always delivered seven days after purchase.on the cash market there is a greater risk that tyson buyers will purchase too little cattle for its needs,or too much for its plants to process within the constrictions of the delivery dates.the economic effect of these differences between the two procurement methods is critically important for a large meat packer whose profit depends on keeping its plants operating at full capacity without interruptions.
the underlying facts relating to this justification were not disputed at trial.both tyson and pickett witnesses testified to them.james herring,president of friona industries,a collection of feed yards in the texas panhandle,testified that buying cattle through marketing agreements guarantees for tyson a certain number of cattle per week.lee borck,the president and principal negotiator for the beef marketing group,a consortium of thirteen feed yards in the midwest,testified that marketing agreements ensure that tyson will have a percentage of their cattle that are going to be procured for a plant that difficult to procure cattle for.jerry hausman,an economics professor from the massachusetts institute of technology,testified that what marketing agreements do is it helps tyson to better schedule its plants.and by cutting down the variability,they going to get greater capacity utilization and higher profits.and bruce bass,tyson head buyer,stated that marketing agreements ensure a consistent supply of cattle for the company processing plants.
professor catherine durham,one of pickett expert economists,agreed with this assessment when she was asked about the use of marketing agreements on 
q.you would agree with me,professor durham,that marketing agreements also help tyson guarantee a minimum supply of cattle at the plants that get marketing agreement cattle,right 
and tyson has a valid business interest in having a steady supply of cattle at its packing plants,right 
the economics of this are simple.as professor hausman explained,being able to keep its processing plants operating at capacity has increased tyson efficiency.keeping the doors to its plants open and the machinery running is a fixed cost for tyson.no matter how many cattle the plant processes on a given day,tyson has fixed costs for the facility and equipment,the electricity used to run the plant,and the salaries of a minimum number of employees needed to run the plant.whether the plant slaughters head or head of cattle on a given day,the fixed cost will be the same.
if tyson slaughters head of cattle,the fixed costs of operating the plant are divided by a factor that is ten times larger than when it slaughters only head.the more cattle tyson processes on a given day,the less the fixed cost per head.by ensuring that the processing plants are consistently filled and operate at or near capacity,the use of marketing agreements provides tyson with a more operation.this result,which is entirely in harmony with the goals of the psa,see jackson,at the psa was designed to promote efficiency,not frustrate it,is a legitimate,justification.
pickett offered no evidence to dispute the existence of this justification.instead,through examination of tyson witnesses,pickett simply brought out the unremarkable fact that if tyson were willing to pay a high enough price or throw our billfold out the window it could get from the cash market as many cattle as it wanted for its processing plants and even then it would be difficult.of course,in hypotheticals where economic constraints are assumed away,economic problems are not problems.but this is not a hypothetical case.tyson is an actual business that operates in the real world through real markets where there are real economic limits.tyson has competitors who stand ready,willing,and able to undercut the price of its product if it pays too much for the raw materials used to produce that product.
tyson third proffered competitive justification for purchasing some of its cattle through marketing agreements is that doing so reduces its transaction costs by eliminating the need to negotiate for each individual pen of cattle,as it must on the cash market.with the cash market,buyers for tyson are constantly on the road inspecting pens of cattle in a effort to see if the cattle in each pen match the quality the company needs to fill its customers orders.once the buyer finds a pen that appears to fit the needs,he places a bid with the producer.the producer usually is conducting simultaneous negotiations with one or more of tyson competitors for the same pen.after days of going back and forth,the producer chooses the highest bid,which may or may not be tyson.this process is costly for both the producers and tyson because it takes so much time.tyson has to successfully outbid other packers for more than pens every week the pens each consisting of between fifty and cattle in order to meet its need for head per week.
as a number of tyson witnesses testified,marketing agreements eliminate the time and energy spent by packers and producers negotiating for individual pens.under the agreements the price of the cattle is set at the average price plus a yield adjustment that is determined after processing.borck,the principal negotiator for bmg feed yards,testified that when using the cash market he was spending three or four days a week on the phone with meat packers negotiating the price for his peak cattle.this was not very productive time.with the marketing agreement system,borck estimated that it now takes half a day a week to sell the peak cattle to the packer.he spends the rest of this management time to try and be more efficient in our operations and in the caretaking of the cattle.
other cattle producers and feed yard operators agreed with borck.jim keller,a feed yard operator in kansas,testified that he preferred marketing agreements because he did have to waste time talking about prices.some people like that.they like haggling over price.i do.i do.i always think i could probably be doing something different.professor hausman testified that because the price in marketing agreements is set,marketing agreements are going to decrease transactions costs and therefore decrease the costs for tyson and also likewise for the feedlot operator as well.this was a valid business justification,he continued,because it economically efficient to decrease your transactions costs.anything that decreases costs like that increases economic efficiency,both for tyson,for the feedlot operator,and also for the economy.bass,tyson head buyer,confirmed this.he said that from to,tyson has been able to decrease the number of buyers it employs by about fifteen percent,partly because of the increasing popularity of marketing agreements among cattle producers and feed yards.
pickett did not dispute any of this.in fact,many of his witnesses agreed with tyson witnesses that marketing agreements relieve producers and packers from the burden of spending their time on negotiating prices,instead of on raising and processing cattle.brett gottsch,a cattle producer from nebraska who testified for pickett,conceded that with marketing agreements buyers and feed yard operators do not need to go through the process of bidding and negotiating prices.robert rothwell,a cattle producer and feed yard operator in nebraska,testified that purchasing cattle through marketing agreements requires less time and energy than purchasing cattle through the system.and jeff biegert,another producer from the midwest,joked that with marketing agreements,the buyers for packing companies could be playing golf if they wanted to,and the cattle will still get marketed.
in sum,it was undisputed at the trial that marketing agreements are a more efficient means for both meat packers and cattle producers to operate in the market.it was undisputed that use of the agreements has lowered the transaction costs of producers and meat packers,including tyson.witnesses for both parties recognized that these are benefits for the industry.those benefits are entirely consistent with the goals of the psa.see glickman,at.
tyson final competitive justification for using marketing agreements is that they allow the company to pay for each head of cattle in a pen individually based on the quality of the meat,rather than paying for the entire pen on the average.among other benefits,this gives producers an incentive to provide packers with the quality and yield of meat they need to satisfy their customers demands.
in the system,buyers for the packing companies pay a single price for an entire pen of cattle which results in an average price per head in the pen.with this on the average system,producers can put some of their less desirable with less quality meat or lower usable meat the same pen as,cattle.the packer who buys that pen gets some cattle that match its customers needs and some that do not.the other side of the problem is that producers with a large share of or cattle do not always get rewarded for it.this disparity between the quality and yield of the cattle and the price paid for them on the cash market,which is a disparity that can go either way,is the result of buyers not being able to closely inspect and assess the quality and yield of fifty to head of cattle in each of the many pens that they must haggle over in the cash market.
with marketing agreements,meat packers also buy an entire pen of cattle but with an important difference the price paid for the cattle is adjusted up or down after slaughter to reflect the actual quality and yield of the meat.the final price depends not on the buyer estimate of the meat that a pen of cattle will produce,but on the actual meat that does result after slaughter.this feature of marketing agreements takes away the incentive for producers to mix and cattle in with better ones,and it gives them an incentive to increase the overall quality and yield of their cattle.both results are good for the industry and for competition.
the factual premise for this justification was not disputed at trial.a number of witnesses,both for tyson and for pickett,testified to it.gottsch,who testified for pickett,stated that one advantage of marketing agreements is that the packer pays the producer for each cow in the pen based on the quality.rothwell,another of pickett witnesses,agre
