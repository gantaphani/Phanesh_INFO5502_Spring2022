introduction 
the california department of forestry fire protection cdf approved timber harvest plan thp.joy road area forest and watershed association the association filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to reverse approval of thp.the superior court granted the association petition.we modify the lower court judgment in two respects,but otherwise affirm.
ii.statement of facts 
thp pertains to a heavily forested,area located approximately two and miles southwest of occidental in sonoma county,on a ridge top adjacent to joy road the thp area.percent of the trees in the thp area are redwoods,which are approximately years old.the thp area is owned by real party in interest,harmony forest land company,llc harmony.the thp was prepared for harmony by scott butler,a registered professional forester rpf,and was submitted to cdf on june.
on or about june,cdf returned thp to butler for the stated reason that it was incomplete and failed to comply with relevant regulations governing preparation of a thp.cdf identified items that butler needed to address in the thp before it would be accepted for filing on july,butler a new thp.
after thp was resubmitted,a notice of intent to harvest timber was issued to interested agencies and members of the public.the notice stated that members of the public could review or purchase a copy of the thp at cdf santa rosa office and could submit comments regarding its content.the notice also stated that the earliest date thp could be approved was july,but that it was unlikely that the thp would be approved that soon and that a much longer period of time would likely be available for public comment.cdf received more than letters from members of the public and public officials who expressed concern about the thp.
the administrative record contains an official notice of filing of a timber harvesting plan dated july,which,apparently,was posted by or on behalf of cdf.the thp itself reflects a formal filing date of july.over the next several months,cdf modified or replaced pages in the thp.then,on march,cdf approved thp.the approved plan authorizes the cutting of of the redwood trees in the thp area.
on april,the association filed a petition for writ of mandate.a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction prevented harmony from implementing thp during the pendency of the lower court proceedings.then,on november,the honorable lawrence antolini of the sonoma county superior court granted the association petition on three grounds significant new information was added to thp without notice to the public cdf conclusion that implementing the thp would not significantly impact fog drip in the affected area was not supported by substantial evidence and there was no substantial evidence to support cdf conclusion that future residential development was not a consideration when evaluating the potential impact of the thp.however,the court rejected the association contention that cdf violated requirements for the protection of the northern spotted owl.
both parties have appealed.cdf maintains that thp was properly approved while the association contends that cdf violated requirements for the protection of the northern spotted owl.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
cdf approval of a thp is properly reviewed pursuant to administrative mandamus.friends of the old trees department of forestry and fire protection th,d friends of the old trees code civ,the issue on appeal is whether cdf prejudicially abused its discretion by either making a determination which is not supported by substantial evidence or failing to proceed as required by law.laupheimer state of california d.ebbetts pass forest watch department of forestry fire protection,th,d ebbetts pass.as noted above,the superior court found that cdf committed both types of error in this case.
b.the statutory framework 
two statutes govern cdf evaluation of a thp,the nejedly forest practice act of,pub,et the forest practice act,and the california environmental quality act,pub,et.ceqa 
timber harvesting operations in this state must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the forest practice act.the forest practice act was intended to create and maintain a comprehensive system for regulating timber harvesting in order to achieve two goals to ensure that w here feasible,the productivity of timberlands is restored,enhanced,and maintained and to ensure that t he goal of maximum sustained production of timber products is achieved while giving consideration to values relating to recreation,watershed,wildlife,range and forage,fisheries,and aesthetic enjoyment.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d,sierra club.
the forest practice act provides,among other things,that a specific logging operation on privately owned timberlands can not begin until the logger prepares and submits a thp and obtains cdf approval thereof.
the timber harvesting industry is also subject to regulation under ceqa.sierra club,supra,cal th at,d,schoen department of forestry fire protection th,d schoen environmental protection information center,johnson d.johnson californians for native salmon.association department of forestry d.californians for native salmon.
ceqa is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide protection to the environment.citation.in enacting ceqa,the legislature declared its intention that all public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment give prime consideration to preventing environmental damage when carrying out their duties.citations.ceqa is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.citation.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d,mountain lion foundation.
as a general rule,ceqa requires the preparation of an environmental impact report eir for any project which has a potential significant effect on the environment.et however,section of ceqa provides that a state agency can implement a regulatory program which is certified as exempt from the eir preparation requirement when the program satisfies several criteria,including the requirement of a written plan which is deemed to constitute the functional equivalent of an eir.
the forest practice act and its implementing regulations,tit,et.forestry rules is a regulatory program which has been certified as exempt from eir preparation under section.johnson,supra,d at.the thp is an informational document designed to serve as an abbreviated eir,setting forth proposed measures to mitigate the logging operation potential adverse impact on the environment.cdf and public review of the thp prior to approval is intended to ensure that the adverse environmental effects are substantially lessened,particularly by the exploration of feasible less damaging alternatives to the proposed harvesting project.id.at.
the timber industry exemption from eir preparation is not a blanket exemption to ceqa provisions it grants only a limited exemption to the applicability from ceqa by allowing a timber harvester to prepare a thp in lieu of a complete eir.johnson,supra,d at.in approving a thp,cdf must comply not only with the provisions of the forest practices act but also with those provisions of ceqa from which it has not been specifically exempted by the legislature.sierra club,supra,cal th at,d,see also schoen,supra,th at,d.
ceqa notice and recirculation requirements 
the association contends cdf abused its discretion by approving thp without complying with the notice and recirculation requirements of ceqa.and regs,tit.
section of ceqa requires an agency to give public notice that it is preparing an eir or negative declaration.section further provides when significant new information is added to an eir after notice has been given pursuant to section and consultation has occurred pursuant to sections and,but prior to certification,the public agency shall give notice again pursuant to section,and consult again pursuant to sections and before certifying the eir.
as noted in our factual summary,after notice was given that thp had been submitted and filed,cdf made numerous changes to its content.for example,a section of the thp entitled statement of alternatives was added on november.we agree with the trial court that this discussion of alternatives was significant new information that was added to the thp.indeed,all regulatory programs that are exempt from the eir preparation requirement must require that the plan or other written documentation required by their program include a description of the proposed activity with alternatives to the activity,subd.d a.furthermore,public review and comment regarding such alternatives is a crucial component of ceqa.see friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,wildlife alive chickering cal d.
in its opening brief,cdf does not dispute that it added significant new information to the thp without notice or recirculation instead,it takes the position that the ceqa provisions requiring notice and recirculation do not apply to the timber industry.the thrust of cdf argument is that its regulatory program exemption from the requirement of eir preparation pursuant to section of ceqa necessarily exempts the timber industry from complying with all provisions of ceqa which,by their terms,relate to the eir process.
under the maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,if exemptions are specified in a statute,we may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary.citation.ceqa is a legislative act,and the legislature both had and retains the authority to limit the projects to which ceqa applies.sierra club,supra,cal th at,d.the legislature has not included timber harvesting operations within any of the classes of projects that are exempt from ceqa id.at,d.
as noted above,cdf has obtained a partial exemption from ceqa compliance pursuant to section,the statute pursuant to which cdf regulatory program was certified.however,contrary to cdf arguments on appeal,this limited exemption does not extend to the notice and recirculation provisions at issue here.
subdivision c of section states a regulatory program certified pursuant to this section is exempt from chapter commencing with section,chapter commencing with section,and section,except as provided in article commencing with section of chapter.our supreme court has expressly found that this exemption must be strictly construed and that timber harvesting in this state is exempt only from chapters and of ceqa and from section sierra club,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.since sections and are not part of chapters or or of section of ceqa,certification of cdf regulatory program does not exempt the timber industry from compliance with these important provisions.ibid.
cdf points out that,in order to obtain certification for its regulatory program,it was required to promulgate guidelines for the orderly evaluation of proposed activities.quoting,subd.d.in cdf view,the guidelines for evaluating thp are simply inconsistent with guidelines applicable to the eir process.in this regard,cdf characterizes the thp as a dynamic document that should not and can not be treated as a static document like a draft eir.
cdf we ca comply with ceqa argument has three permutations.first,cdf claims it can not comply with provisions which reference either the eir or any other document generated in conjunction with an eir because a proposed timber harvest is evaluated by reviewing a thp rather than an eir.this perceived barrier to compliance with ceqa is easily overcome by simply construing statutory references to eir as also referring to thp.
second,cdf highlights differences regarding the method of giving public notice required by ceqa with the notice method tailored to suit the timber industry which is set forth in the forest practice act.for example,ceqa requires that notice of the filing of an eir be published,subd.b a or posted for thirty days.the forest practice act,by contrast,requires mailed notice to interested parties but does not require publication.forestry rules.cdf does not explain,however,how these distinctions between the two statutes prevent cdf from complying with the substantive ceqa requirement at issue in this case,that when significant new information is added to an environmental report,the public and interested parties are entitled to notice of that new information and the opportunity to comment thereon.
finally,cdf suggests that,because public inspection and review of a proposed thp are specifically addressed in sections and of the forest practice act,these statutes take precedence over what cdf characterizes as the generic and general requirements for draft environmental impact report comments found in public resources code sections and again,though,cdf fails to articulate how complying with these forest practice act provisions precludes it from also complying with ceqa notice and requirements 
as this court has held in the past,ceqa and the forest practice act are not in conflict,but rather supplement each other and,therefore,must be harmonized.natural resources defense council,arcata nat.d.nrdc.indeed,courts have long recognized the relationship between the forest practice act and ceqa.friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d.ceqa and its substantive criteria for the evaluation of a proposed project environmental impact apply to the timber harvesting industry,and are deemed part of the forest practice act and the forestry rules.johnson,supra,d at.thus,the process by which thp are approved must conform not only to the detailed and exhaustive provisions of the forest practice act,but also to those provisions of ceqa from which it has not been specifically exempted by the legislature.sierra club,supra,cal th at,d.
cdf contends that,because the thp is routinely amended during the review process,ceqa notice and requirements are simply too burdensome.initially,we note that cdf is in the best position to manage this burden as it controls the procedure pursuant to which amendments are made.in any event,the perceived burden of complying with ceqa under these circumstances is outweighed by the important policy goals advanced by these statutory provisions.public review is essential to ceqa.the purpose of requiring public review is to demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has,in fact,analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action.citation.citation.public review permits accountability and informed.citation.schoen,supra,th at,d.p ublic review and comment ensures that appropriate alternatives and mitigation measures are considered,and permits input from agencies with expertise in timber resources and conservation.hewlett squaw valley ski th,d,superseded on other grounds as stated in united farm workers of america dutra farms th,d.ceqa broadly invokes the policy of permitting full public participation throughout the environmental review process it commands.citations.plaggmier city of san jose d.
cdf contends that forest practice act procedures ensure meaningful public review.it emphasizes that,during the period that a thp is being amended,it is subject to public review and inspection in the public file in accordance with the requirements of the forest practices act and forestry rules.see forestry rules.further,during this review period,cdf invites the public and public agencies to comment on the thp.see,subd.b.
we are not persuaded that the procedure cdf describes ensures meaningful public review and comment.if an interested party reviews obtains a copy of the thp before cdf substantively alters it,and that party is thereafter not notified of the change,then he or she has been denied a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the thp.absent notice that cdf has made a substantive change or even that it has the right to make such a change,we question why a member of the public should be expected to anticipate such a change.further,if the thp is routinely significantly altered by cdf during the review period,then the thp that cdf ultimately approves is essentially a different plan than that which the property owner submitted.the notice and recirculation provisions of ceqa ensure that the public has notice and an opportunity to comment on the actual plan that cdf intends to approve.
even if cdf were to notify the public that it could and likely would substantively amend a thp during the review process,we would question cdf claim that meaningful public participation could be assured simply by placing a copy of the thp in a public file.in our view,placing the onus on members of the public to repeatedly review a lengthy thp and determine for themselves what changes cdf has made to it is simply inconsistent with the fundamental policy goals of ceqa.
although we find no case directly on point,our conclusion is consistent with ultramar,south coast air quality management dist.th,d ultramar,a case holding that a certified regulatory program must comply with section,ceqa public comment requirement at issue in ultramar was the validity of a rule adopted by the south coast air quality management district aqmd requiring that the use of hydrogen fluoride hf be phased out over a period.ultramar,supra,th at,d.the ultramar court found aqmd had authority to issue the hf rule but held the regulation was invalid because aqmd failed to comply with ceqa notice provision.
like cdf,aqmd regulatory program was certified.therefore,aqmd prepared an ea,an abbreviated environmental report,in lieu of an eir,as part of its procedure for adopting the hf rule.ultramar,supra,th at,d.the draft ea was circulated to industrial users of hf and other interested members of the public and a deadline for submitting comments on the draft was set for march.shortly thereafter,aqmd discovered that a chapter of the ea addressing the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed hf rule was not sent to all interested parties.aqmd then mailed the relevant chapter to everyone on the mailing list but it did not extend the deadline for submitting comments,thereby effectively making the comment period less than days.id.at,d.
the ultramar court affirmed a trial court ruling that aqmd violated ceqa by failing to comply with the public comment period requirement set forth in section.ultramar,supra,th at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the court rejected aqmd argument that it was exempt from complying with section pursuant to section.like other courts that have addressed the section exemption,the ultramar court concluded that a certified regulatory program is exempt from only chapters and and section of ceqa.noting that section is part of chapter,the ultramar court concluded that aqmd was not exempt from complying with this public comment requirement.indeed,the court recognized that an interpretation of section which contracts the public comment period would thwart the legislative intent underlying ceqa.id.at,d.
the ultramar court was guided in part by a recent pronouncement by our supreme court that t he foremost principle under ceqa is that the legislature intended the act to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.citations.ultramar,supra,th at,d,quoting laurel heights,supra,cal d at.this principle applies equally in the case before us and supports our conclusion that cdf is not exempt from the notice and recirculation provisions of ceqa.
finally we note that,although the argument cdf presents to us in this case is novel,it is premised on a legal theory which has been soundly rejected.the appellate courts of this state have repeatedly advised cdf that ceqa applies to the timber harvesting industry and that the process cdf uses to evaluate and approve thp must comport with all provisions of ceqa except for chapters and and section.see gallegos state bd.of forestry d.johnson,supra,d.friends of the old trees,supra,th,d.indeed,this court has so held on more than one occasion.see nrdc,supra,d at.schoen,supra,th at,d.our supreme court has also expressly agreed with this position.sierra club,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,cdf has continued to resist complying with ceqa by advancing increasingly contorted interpretations of settled law.we urge cdf to heed the law as consistently interpreted by the courts of this state,and to commit its time and resources toward the more productive end of conforming its process to comply with ceqa.
we affirm the trial court finding that cdf abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law when it approved thp.we also find that the error was prejudicial.when cdf fails to comply with mandatory procedures,prejudice is presumed.ebbetts pass,supra,th at,d.furthermore,although cdf fails to squarely address this issue,we reject its suggestion that the volume of public comment generated by thp is evidence,in and of itself,that the public had an adequate opportunity to review this thp.in our view,the significant public interest in this case is a strong indication that the failure to comply with ceqa notice and recirculation requirements was prejudicial 
fog drip is a process in which trees capture moisture from fog,which then drips to the forest floor.friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d.the trial court found there was insufficient evidence to support cdf conclusion that the proposed timber harvest will not have a significant adverse effect on the water supply by reducing fog drip in the thp area cdf disagrees.
background 
thp addresses the effect of the proposed harvest on fog drip in section iv of the thp,which contains a cumulative impacts assessment.there,the thp states while there may be a slight reduction in fog drip water input as a result of this operation,it is not expected to be significant.no significant decrease in water yield is expected from a decrease in fog drip.decreases in evapotranspiration water output through the removal of trees and the associated increase in water availability,will significantly offset any decrease in fog drip.it is estimated that less than of the shade canopy of the harvest area will be removed.
fog drip is also addressed in a report prepared by the division of mines geology,which participated in a preharvest inspection relating to thp.that report states,in part the proposed timber harvesting will somewhat reduce interception,evaporation and transpiration of precipitation,and may reduce fog drip,but because the larger trees on the upper slopes are retained,reduction in fog drip is anticipated to be very minor.based on studies by the usda forest service at caspar creek in mendocino county,selective harvesting will probably result in a minor increase in summer flows and total water yield keppeler,and moisture savings due to reduced evapotranspiration will override any fog precipitation losses.
the fog drip issue also generated significant public comment.in this court,the association highlights two comments as particularly significant.
first,carl wahl,who resides near the thp area,wrote a long letter,which was supplemented with references and exhibits,about the contribution of fog drip to the water supply in the thp area.wahl expressly challenged the conclusion expressed in thp that any reduction in fog drip would be offset by moisture savings due to decreased evapotranspiration and he cited various reports and studies to support his contrary conclusion.wahl maintained that fog drip was a significant source of water and that the proposed removal of of the total basal area of redwood trees would have a severe deleterious effect on the water supply in the thp area.
wahl conclusions were echoed in a letter by daniel wickham wickham estimated that the proposed logging of redwoods in the thp area would result in the loss of million gallons of water from fog drip during a typical summer.according to wickham,f og precipitation is the only water source available during the summer,and there can be no doubt that a reduction in ground water recharge of this scale is significant and warrants an immediate rejection of this thp.
cdf expressed its views regarding fog drip in its official response to significant environmental points raised during the timber harvesting plan evaluation process official response.an official response is a written response to significant environmental objections that have been raised by the public during the review process which cdf must prepare in connection with its approval of a thp.see johnson,supra,d at.forestry rules.
in its official response,cdf acknowledged that the thp area is a water poor area,but concluded that the impact of the proposed harvest on fog drip would not adversely affect the water supply for several reasons.for one,cdf questioned whether fog drip significantly recharges groundwater.in this regard,it identified two studies supporting a conclusion that most of the water captured by fog drip is reabsorbed by the trees themselves as well as vegetation in the surrounding area.cdf also reasoned that the effect on fog drip in the general area would not be significant because,among other things,the thp area was small in size and a significant portion of the canopy would be retained including big trees on the upper slope.furthermore,even within the thp area,there would not be a significant reduction of fog drip because the proposed harvest did not involve,a method which has been identified as adversely affecting fog drip.here,a significant number of remaining trees and vegetation would be available to provide fog drip within the thp area.
initially,we note there is no dispute between the parties that both ceqa and the forest practice act require that a thp include a cumulative impact analysis.see johnson,supra,d at,subd.b schoen,supra,th at,d forestry rules.nor is there any dispute that the cumulative impact analysis for thp needed to address the potential impact of the proposed plan on the water supply generally and on fog drip in particular.
in any event,we find that,in addressing the fog drip issue,the parties and the trial court have conflated two distinct issues,first,whether thp contains a sufficient cumulative impact analysis of the fog drip issue and,second,whether cdf ultimate conclusion,set forth in its official response,that there will be no significant adverse impact on fog drip is supported by substantial evidence.we will separately consider these two issues.
t he substantive ceqa requirement of assessing cumulative environmental impact must be included in the evaluation of each thp by cdf.citation.c umulative damage is as a whole greater than the sum of its parts.citation.the cumulative impact of past,present and future logging activities is a substantive criterion for the evaluation of the environmental impact of a proposed timber harvest.citation.californians for native salmon,supra,d at.
furthermore,the cumulative impact analysis must be substantively meaningful.a cumulative impact analysis which understates information concerning the severity and significance of cumulative impacts impedes meaningful public discussion and skews the decisionmaker perspective concerning the environmental consequences of the project,the necessity for mitigation measures,and the appropriateness of project approval.citation.citation.while technical perfection in a cumulative impact analysis is not required,courts have looked for adequacy,completeness,and a good faith effort at full disclosure.citation.mountain lion coalition fish game com.d.mountain lion coalition.
in the present case,the trial court expressed the view that the thp cumulative impact analysis regarding fog drip was a mere opinion utterly lacking in facts or even a brief explanation as to why there will be only a de minimis loss in fog drip and water supplies.we agree.in light of the overwhelming concern about this issue expressed in the public comments and the significant evidence produced by interested citizens to support their contention that fog drip significantly contributes to the groundwater supply in the thp area,we find that the cumulative impact analysis regarding this issue was woefully inadequate.no facts,statistics,reports or studies are identified to support the contention that the decrease in fog drip will not result in a decrease in the water supply.
by approving a thp that contained an inadequate cumulative impact analysis regarding an admittedly important environmental issue,cdf failed to proceed in a manner required by law and prejudicially abused its discretion.only by requiring the sponsoring agency to fully comply with the letter of the law can a subversion of the important public purposes of ceqa be avoided,and only by this process will the public be able to determine the environmental and economic values of their elected and appointed officials,thus allowing for appropriate action come election day should a majority of the voters disagree.citation.mountain lion coalition,supra,d at.
however,the question of whether cdf ultimate conclusion regarding fog drip is supported by substantial evidence is an entirely different issue.substantial evidence means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.citations.substantial evidence includes facts,reasonable assumptions based on fact,and expert opinion supported by facts.on the other hand,arguments,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous is not substantial evidence.citation.friends of the old trees,supra,th at,fn,d.
in this case,cdf official response contains a lengthy substantive discussion of the fog drip issue,which addresses the arguments and concerns voiced by members of the public and sets forth the reasoning behind cdf conclusion that the impact on fog drip will not significantly adversely affect the water supply in or around the thp area.that discussion references relevant reports and studies,including those relied on by concerned citizens who commented on this subject.in addition,cdf relies on the report by the division of mines and its conclusion that the effect on fog drip would not be significant whether or not we agree with cdf interpretation of the cited reports or with the conclusions its draws therefrom,substantial evidence support cdf ultimate determination that the potential adverse impact of the plan on fog drip will not be significant.
the association resists this conclusion by arguing that we must disregard evidence set forth for the first time in cdf official response.to support this contention,it relies on friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d.in friends of the old trees,a panel of division five of this court affirmed a trial court finding that cdf abused its discretion by approving a thp that did not contain necessary information regarding cumulative impacts.cdf argued,among other things,that the general topic of cumulative impacts and the specific topic of water supply and fog drip were adequately addressed in cdf official written response to public comments.id.at,d.the court rejected this contention and found that cdf could not rely on information which appeared in the official response as opposed to the thp itself.the court reasoned that the official response was not prepared as part of the thp that was available for public comment but was only issued after the thp had been approved.see forestry rules.id.at,d.it further reasoned that,i n pursuing an approach that releas es a report for public consumption that hedges on important environmental considerations while deferring a more detailed analysis to a report that is insulated from public review cdf pursued a path condemned as inconsistent with the purpose of ceqa citation.certainly,the department can not expect the public access to information after the fact to substitute for the opportunity to influence the department decisions before they are made.ibid.
contrary to the association contention on appeal,friends of the old trees does not preclude us from considering cdf official response when evaluating whether there is substantial evidence to support cdf conclusion in this case regarding the impact of the proposed harvest on fog drip and water supply in the thp area.in contrast to the case before us,the thp at issue in friends of the old trees did not contain any cumulative impact analysis and the court declined to fill that unacceptable gap in the plan with information contained in the official response.here,by contrast,we have already addressed the inadequacy of the thp as an informational document and are now considering the separate and different question of whether cdf conclusion about fog drip is supported by substantial evidence.
the official response is a keystone to the public participation in the approval process,and an important element in the public right to prepare and file a challenge to an approval of a thp.johnson,supra,d at fn.this response will obviously be of crucial assistance in the evaluation of any potential lawsuit,and in the structuring of arguments,pleading allegations and prayers for relief.the sufficiency of the response may itself be a ground on which to challenge the decision of approval.id.at.see gallegos state bd.of forestry,supra,d at.society for california archaeology county of butte d.in other words,the function of the official response is to set forth cdf evidence in support of its conclusions.see,ebbetts pass,supra,th,d.in light of this purpose,it is inappropriate for us to ignore the official response when called upon to determine whether a particular conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.
to summarize and clarify,we hold that the error regarding the fog drip issue in this case was not that cdf ultimate decision lacks substantial evidence but,rather,that thp contains an inadequate cumulative impact analysis with regard to the issue of fog drip.
future development 
the cumulative impact section of thp does not address the impact of potential future housing development in the thp area for the stated reason that future housing development is speculative.the parties disagree as to whether cdf abused its discretion by approving this thp notwithstanding its failure to consider the cumulative impact of future housing development.
background 
the thp states that t he landowner purchased this property for the purpose of harvesting and building a residence and reiterates that the landowner intent is to harvest trees and build a residence.the thp also discloses that t he property is presently divided into lots.by definition of county ordinances these lots may have a residence built on them if they meet county requirements.the previous landowner applied for lot line adjustment to meet some of the county requirements in order to apply for building permits.this application by the previous landowner is on hold with the county.the thp also acknowledges that the present owner has expressed the desire to build a residence on the property and that he or she may or may not request a lot line adjustment.
as noted above,thp does not evaluate the cumulative impact of future building development.however,the cumulative impact section of the thp does include two brief comments regarding this issue the property covered by this thp contains separate parcels.it is the desire of the landowner to build a home on two of the parcels.if the landowner can meet zoning ordinance criteria,and desires at some future time to build on these permitted locations,he may this section of the thp also states that the propose d landing locations planned for this thp could be used as future building sites.
in order to comply with ceqa,a thp must consider all significant environmental impacts regardless whether those impacts may be expected to fall on or off the logging site,and regardless whether those impacts would be attributable solely to activities described in the timber harvesting plan or to those activities in combination with other circumstances including but not necessarily limited to other past,present,and reasonably expectable future activities in the relevant area.friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.a future activity must be addressed as part of a cumulative impact analysis if it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project and the future expansion or action will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.
the record before us demonstrates that future housing development is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of this proposed timber harvest.any objective reading of the evidence disclosed in this thp establishes that future development of housing in the thp area is not only a reasonable possibility,it is a primary impetus for the proposed harvest.in light of this evidence,we reject cdf unreasonable characterization of future housing development as a speculative future proposal and its contention that the environmental effects of future housing development were too speculative to require consideration in the thp itself.
we also reject cdf contention that it adequately addressed the potential cumulative impact of future housing development in its official response.as discussed above,the official response,which is not subject to public review or comment until after an approval decision has been made,can not be utilized to fill gaps in the thp itself.friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d.
cdf abused its discretion by approving thp notwithstanding the absence of a cumulative impact analysis addressing the impact of future housing development in the thp area.
protection of northern spotted owls 
the final issue presented to us is whether cdf complied with provisions for the protection of the northern spotted owl nso.the association has filed its own appeal pursuant to which it argues that information about the nso that was added to the thp during the review process constituted significant new information and cdf failed to proceed in a manner required by law by approving the thp notwithstanding that a crucial study regarding the effect on nso had not been completed.
background 
the nso is a threatened specie under the federal endangered species act.prevent ing the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man activities is an important policy of goal of ceqa.see,subd.c.the forest practice act also seeks to ensure the protection of wildlife during timber harvesting activity.see.consistent with this goal,cdf implemented rules designed to minimize the chances that timber harvesting activities would result in a taking of the nso in violation of the federal endangered species act.public resources protection department of forestry fire protection cal th,d.in fact,cdf is required to disapprove a thp if i mplementation of the plan as proposed would result in the taking of an individual northern spotted owl prohibited by the federal endangered species act.forestry rules,subd f.
the forestry rules provide that if a proposed timber harvest is located in the range of the nso,a thp must contain certain information which shall be used by the director to evaluate whether or not the proposed activity would result in the take of an individual northern spotted owl.forestry rules,rule.rule sets forth several alternative procedures a plan submitter may elect from in order to provide the requisite information for evaluating the potential effect of the thp on the nso.rule,subds.a g.
in the present case,harmony and scott butler elected to follow the procedure set forth in subdivision e of rule which states if the submitter proposes to proceed pursuant to the outcome of a discussion with the fish and wildlife service,the submitter shall submit a letter prepared by the rpf that the described or proposed management prescription is acceptable to the usfws.
thp states spotted owl habitat exists within this thp,efforts taken to protect the spotted owl are covered under the spotted owl consultation with the usf ws united states fish and wildlife services,see attached consultation package in section vi of the thp.spotted owls have been called for the past three years,no evidence has been found.a consultation with the usf ws is attached.
the consultation with the usf ws that appears in this record reflects that usf ws was consulted several times regarding the potential impact of the proposed harvest on the nso.as cdf concedes on appeal,the information regarding the nso that was originally provided in thp was erroneous,and had to be altered.rb at.
in a letter dated june,usf ws stated there were no known nso activity centers located within fe
