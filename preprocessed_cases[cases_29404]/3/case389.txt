the question in this appeal is whether the secretary of agriculture implementation of a subsidy program for milk producers was inconsistent with the statutory requirement that payments be made for economic losses incurred during.agriculture,rural development,food and drug administration,and related agencies appropriations act,stat,hereinafter appropriations act.the secretary regulations defined eligible production for purposes of determining how much money a producer could receive as milk produced by cows in the united states and marketed commercially in the united states anytime during the and or calendar year,subject to a maximum of hundredweight cwt per dairy operation.milk train,and others representing large milk producers in several states,appeal the grant of summary judgment upholding the secretary regulations.milk train contends that the regulations are contrary to a clear statutory mandate and that the secretary arbitrarily denied assistance for losses attributable to production in excess of cwt.insofar as milk train challenges the cwt cap,we vacate the district court opinion on that issue for lack of jurisdiction otherwise we reverse and remand the case to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the secretary.
in the last three fiscal years fy,congress has appropriated money to be distributed by the secretary of agriculture to compensate dairy producers for losses they have sustained.we refer to the moneys appropriated as a milk producers subsidy in the appropriations act as the program we refer to the moneys appropriated in the appropriations act as the program.
in the first year,congress provided over billion for assistance to owners and producers on a farm to partially compensate them for the loss of markets for the crop of a commodity.omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act,division a,a,tit.xi,a,stat,hereinafter appropriations act.in particular,congress directed that million of the moneys shall be available to provide assistance to dairy producers in a manner determined by the secretary.id.d.for the program,the secretary promulgated regulations whereby the amount of each farm payment would be based on or milk production,with a cap on the maximum eligible production level,approximately equivalent to a herd of cows or cwt,which represents pounds of milk.see.a cost benefit analysis prepared by the farm service agency fsa on december,indicated that milk producers that were in production at some time during the period october,through december,were sent checks in june based on a payment rate of cents per cwt,with a maximum single payment of.
in the second year,at issue here,congress appropriated million more to benefit livestock and dairy producers,again directing that the funds be disbursed in a manner determined appropriate by the secretary.appropriations act.congress directed that no less than million minus administrative expenses of million be in the form of assistance to dairy producers to compensate producers for economic losses incurred during.id.waiving the notice and comment requirement for implementing regulations,congress directed that the payments be made as soon as practicable.id.a.for the program,the secretary extended the regulations for the program she specifically extended for the subsidy program through february,with the proviso that d airy operations that applied for and received payments under the program do not need to reapply.additional payments will be issued based upon the original application.crop and market loss assistance.according to the fsa analysis,the was extended to permit the eligible commercial operations that did not enroll in the program to enroll in the program.payments under the program for producers who had signed up for the program or were eligible for that program were based on the or production figures used for the program.at.thus,producers who had signed up or were otherwise eligible for the program could receive funds,even if they did not produce in.the final payment per cwt under the program was approximately,with a maximum single payment of about.
milk train filed suit challenging the regulations for the program as arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act apa,a,and violative of the,takings,and equal protection clauses of the constitution.the district court,addressing for summary judgment,viewed t he essence of this controversy to be whether the secretary exceeded her statutory authority by capping at cwt the amount of milk production that would be eligible for financial assistance,the consequence of which was to bestow the bulk of the funding on smaller dairy farmers.the court granted judgment for the secretary.as relevant here,the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the appropriations act appropriating moneys for the program was not within the appropriations exception to apa jurisdiction under lincoln vigil,d,and contained intelligible principles,including congress general policy to compensate dairy farmers suffering from declining milk prices.the court rejected milk train argument that the secretary cwt cap was arbitrary and capricious.the court did not expressly address milk train argument that the secretary use of data from an earlier year to allocate payment of moneys was arbitrary and capricious.
on appeal,milk train contends that the secretary regulations are invalid because they ignore the clear statutory mandate to compensate dairy producers for economic losses incurred during and arbitrarily denied assistance for losses attributable to production in excess of cwt.pointing to the different statutory language that congress used in appropriating funds for the program referring to producers rather than owners and producers and to economic losses rather than market losses,and to a different year,milk train contends that while congress did not reinstate the program the secretary did,by extending the regulations for the program,with the result that payments for economic losses were based on the same production data and paid to the same producers who qualified for the program rather than to those who operated in.as to the cwt cap,milk train contends that the phrase in the manner authorized by the secretary was not an expression in the alternative to compensation for the producers economic losses and did not authorize the secretary to deny compensation on substantial portions of the economic losses incurred in by some producers in order to increase the amounts received by others.
we first address the district court jurisdiction to review the secretary regulations.steel citizens for a better env t,d.according to the secretary,her determination of the manner of providing the moneys to dairy producers is not qualified in any way,appellee br.at,and reflects a congressional judgment that the agriculture department,as the expert agency charged with implementing the nation farm policy,is best suited to determine how the moneys should be used to provide assistance to the nation dairy farmers.whether viewed as agency action committed to agency discretion by law under the apa,a,or as an express delegation to make all decisions necessary to carry out congress broad purpose,the secretary contends that judicial review of the secretary implementation decision is extremely circumscribed.
section a of the apa exempts agency action from judicial review to the extent that it is committed to agency discretion by law.the supreme court in heckler chaney,d,held that an agency decision not to institute enforcement proceedings was unreviewable.id.at.at.such a decision,the court explained,involved a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within an agency expertise.id.drawing on heckler,the court held in lincoln vigil that an agency decision to cease allocating funds from a appropriation,which contained no restrictions on use of the funds,for a program not mentioned in a statute or the agency regulations,was committed to agency discretion and likewise unreviewable.at.at.the court defined the scope of review precluded under a as turning on whether the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.id.at.at quoting heckler,at.at.the secretary maintains that the principle set forth in lincoln vigil is not limited to appropriations and would apply if the express conferral of discretion on the secretary,as well as other characteristics of the administrative decision at issue,bring the funding for the program within a.
insofar as congress has left to the secretary sole judgment the determination of the manner for providing assistance to dairy farmers,we hold that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review milk train challenge to the cwt cap on eligible production.congress provided that the moneys for economic losses were to be used to provide assistance directly to dairy producers,in a manner determined appropriate by the secretary.appropriations act.milk train relies on whitman amer.trucking ass n,d,to support its contention that the absence of express statutory authority for the secretary to impose payment limitations makes the cwt cap unlawful.but unlike the clean air act provisions analyzed in whitman that expressly limited the discretion of the administrator by mandating the imposition of pollution regulations requisite to protect the public health,b,the plain language in the appropriations act indicates that congress left to the secretary the decision about how the moneys for economic losses could best be distributed consistent with its general policy to provide emergency assistance to dairy farmers a s soon as practicable,id.a.the statute thus provides no relevant statutory reference point for the court other than the decisionmaker own views of what is an appropriate manner of distribution to compensate for losses.drake faa,webster doe,d.a decision memorandum prepared for the secretary in connection with the program described five options for allocating the moneys,each containing a listing of the pros and cons of each option.choosing between those options clearly requires a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within the secretary expertise.lincoln,at.at quoting heckler,at.at.milk train does not dispute that the secretary used the program funds to provide assistance to compensate dairy producers for their losses it challenges the cwt cap based on the distribution of those funds among eligible producers.accordingly,we vacate the district court opinion on the issue of the cwt cap for lack of jurisdiction.foodservice lodging,regan,per curiam.
we reach a different conclusion with regard to milk train challenge to the secretary regulations.by providing in the appropriations act that the moneys are for economic losses incurred during,appropriations act,congress limited the secretary authority to disburse funds.this limitation affords a statutory reference point by which the court is able to review the secretary determination of which producers are eligible to receive funds under the program.drake,at.hence,we hold that the district court had jurisdiction of milk train challenge.
milk train challenge to the secretary regulations has two prongs,both of which are founded on the premise that there is no statutory basis for the use of and production data for calculating losses and on the dilution of moneys.the appropriations act requires that the moneys are to be used to reimburse dairy producers for economic losses incurred during.appropriations act.milk train contends that the secretary did not compensate producers for their economic losses but,instead,used the same time period and formula used to compensate for market for which producers had already been paid once.consequently,the moneys available to producers such as appellants who were eligible were diluted.there are two prongs to milk train challenge,for the funds were diluted,it maintains,either because some producers who received program moneys were not in business in and thus suffered no losses or because some producers were paid at a higher rate per cwt on or production based on the earlier program.
even though presented as a part of its challenge to the cwt cap,milk train argument appears throughout this case and is not the type of asserted but unanalyzed contention that the court should not address the secretary received fair notice of the argument and had an opportunity to respond.see sec banner fund int l,quoting carducci regan,singleton wulff,d.during the hearing on the for summary judgment the district court sought the secretary response to milk train argument,and the secretary responded that 
w hen the payments were made for the program the most recent figures that were available for production were the and years.when payments were made under the program,the easiest and quickest thing to do administratively was to use the same production figures for existing farmers and allow new farmers to file new applications 
again on appeal,the secretary presents an administrative efficiency response but also explains that the use of or production quantity information as the basis for calculating payment amounts does not constitute a payment based on losses incurred during those years.rather,the secretary merely used those figures to allocate a limited pool of money appellee br.at.accordingly,we proceed to address the merits of milk train challenge.
our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.milk indus.found.glickman.in addressing milk train challenge to the secretary choice of a base year as contrary to law under the apa,the court accords special deference to the secretary interpretation of a statute that congress has authorized the secretary to implement.see abf freight,nlrb,d schweiker gray panthers,d.so long as the regulations reflect a permissible interpretation of the statute,the court owes deference to the secretary.see transitional hosps.of shalala,citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.the court likewise owes deference to the secretary interpretation of her regulations.udall tallman,d.it remains incumbent upon the secretary to explain as part of the regulatory proceedings how the chosen manner of distributing the moneys extends only to the losses covered by the statute or risk vacation of the rule.see int l union,united mine workers fed.mine safety health,see also checkosky sec,separate opinion of silberman.
we begin with the shared assumption of the parties,as stated in milk train brief,that t he simple and logical approach to compensating for economic losses incurred in would be to pay producers a fixed amount per hundredweight on all of their same production impacted by lower bfp basic formula price prices.appellant br.at see appellee br.at.because the economic losses to producers in were due primarily to the collapse of milk prices in,tying the level of payments to a dairy operation level of production seems a reasonable conclusion by the secretary,and milk train does not challenge it.indeed fsa analysis indicates that in october manufacturing milk prices suffered the second largest drop,that the november basic formula price was the lowest in years,and that prices were expected to remain low throughout fy at over less than the record high level of fy.anticipating that the assistance provided by the program will offset only a modest portion of the expected decline in dairy producers incomes as prices decline,the assessment added that the number of commercial dairy operations declined about between july and july.
the record indicates that the secretary did consider requiring producers who had received payments under the program to reapply for compensation from the program.a decision memorandum prepared for the secretary agreed that such a system would target production,but concluded that such a system would significantly delay payments to producers,place additional workload on agency field offices,and require additional resources to develop new computer software to handle the new program.the decision memorandum also discussed using only the lists of producers who had participated in the program including the data for their or levels of production to determine eligibility and payment levels for the program.such an approach would greatly reduce administrative c
