elaine brong,oregon state director of the bureau of land management blm,and other parties appeal the district court decision invalidating the timbered rock fire salvage and elk creek watershed restoration project timbered rock project or project,a plan developed by the blm to log nearly a thousand acres of protected land in southwest oregon after a major forest fire.the district court held that the timbered rock project violated both the federal land policy and management act flpma and the national environmental policy act nepa.we affirm.
factual procedural background 
following a series of lightning strikes,on july,the medford district of the blm was devastated by the timbered rock fire.this fire burned approximately acres of land in the district,all within an area known as the elk creek watershed under federal law,elk creek is a reserve,which entitles the area to heightened environmental protection.
following the timbered rock fire,the blm began considering a range of options of how to revitalize the elk creek area the blm considered the environmental impacts of various alternatives,ultimately devising the timbered rock project.on august,the blm announced the availability of a draft environmental impact statement for the timbered rock project,and indicated that it would accept public comment until october.on january,the blm made public the project final environmental impact statement timbered rock feis,and on march,the blm issued its record of decision for the timbered rock project timbered rock rod.
pursuant to the project,the blm proposes to log more than acres of land affected by the fire.timbered rock rod at.of the acres,are designated as research units for investigating the influence of salvage and salvage intensity on wildfire response,while the remaining acreage is designated for area salvage.id.as a whole,the project would allow salvage of approximately million board feet of timber to be sold to private companies.id.
the oregon natural resources council and other parties collectively onrc challenged the timbered rock project via an administrative protest filed on april.on may,the blm responded to onrc protest and affirmed its decision to proceed with the project.onrc challenged the agency decision in district court.onrc argued that the blm violated the medford district bureau of resource management plan,as amended by the northwest forest plan,which the blm is required to follow pursuant to flpma.a.specifically,onrc alleged that the project violated the plan because it proposed the excessive removal of large diameter dead or dying trees,impermissible research logging,and timber removal in woodlands.onrc also alleged that the blm failed to designate properly certain areas as riparian reserves.
onrc also alleged the project violated nepa because the blm failed to analyze the cumulative effects of fire suppression activities,private salvage logging,and salvage logging in deferred watersheds,and the blm employed a flawed methodology by using an unreliable tool,known as the decayed wood advisor decaid,to calculate the effect of the project on certain species 
on june,the district court granted onrc motion for a temporary restraining order.on november,the district court entered an opinion and order in favor of onrc,and on november,it entered a judgment granting onrc a permanent injunction.see or.natural res.council fund brong,no.civ,wl.the blm timely appealed.

iii.the flpma claims 
the federal land policy management act,establishes requirements for land use planning on public land.flpma requires that the blm,under the secretary of the interior,develop,maintain,and when appropriate,revise land use plans to ensure that land management be conducted on the basis of multiple use and sustained yield.a,a see also kern bureau of land,cir holding that flpma requires the blm to prepare resource management plans for the various districts under its control.the process for developing,maintaining,and revising resource management plans is controlled by federal regulations at.once a land use plan is developed,a ll future resource management authorizations and actions shall conform to the approved plan.a.
the land use plan governing the timbered rock project is the medford district resource management plan medford rmp,as amended significantly by the northwest forest plan nfp or plan the blm interpreted the nfp as permitting the timbered rock project.for the following reasons,however,we disagree.
a.the blm interpretation of the northwest forest plan is inconsistent with the plan mandate to prioritize the maintenance and preservation of ecosystems.
because the nfp embodies the substantive management directives with which the blm must comply under flpma,our review must start with,and remain anchored in,an understanding of the nfp.a careful reading shows that while the nfp as a whole seeks to strike a balance between environmental protection and resource extraction,its management directives for specified reserve areas give priority to environmental concerns.the blm interpretation of the plan is plainly inconsistent with these directives.
consider the nfp history.the plan is a comprehensive response to a long and bitter legal battle over the scope of logging in forests,home to the endangered northern spotted owl.see seattle audubon soc y lyons,aff,seattle audubon soc y moseley,cir per curiam.indeed,i t should be borne in mind that the nfp is not an ordinary government strategy instead,the history and care in its creation bespeak the massive effort that led to its birth.gifford pinchot task force fish and wildlife,cir.
to ensure that national forest timber sales would comply with legal conservation requirements,the nfp divided the approximately million acres of federal land within the northern spotted owl range into several hierarchical allocations designated by the type of land use in each allocation.see northwest forest plan standards and guidelines nfp s g at.this hierarchy is the fundamental means by which the nfp achieves its primary goal of protecting and enhancing habitat for and species.see seattle audubon soc y.at nfp s g at.six of the allocations are reserve areas in which logging and other activities are generally prohibited.seattle audubon soc y.at see also nfp s g at summarizing what activities are permitted within each classification.the plan designates the remaining unreserved areas as matrix,in which timber harvest may go forward subject to environmental requirements.seattle audubon soc y.at.
as explained in section i,supra,the timbered rock project would permit logging in the elk creek watershed elk creek.elk creek is designated as a reserve lsr a protected the nfp.lsrs lie at the heart of the nfp conservation strategy for the northern spotted owl and other endangered species.the objective of reserves is to protect and enhance conditions of and forest ecosystems,which serve as habitat for and related species including the northern spotted owl.nfp s g at.the nfp plainly states that lsrs are to be managed to protect and enhance conditions of and forest ecosystems.nfp s g at see also northwest forest plan record of decision nfp rod at reserves are to be managed to protect and enhance forest conditions.
pursuant to these goals,the nfp makes programmed stand management activities,such as logging,impermissible in lsrs.see nfp rod at no programmed timber harvest is allowed inside the reserves.the nfp recognizes a narrow exception,however,following a event,such as a massive fire.in these specific circumstances,the plan contains guidelines for salvage that prescribe the extent to which limited logging within the lsrs is permitted.nfp s g at.we must determine whether the timbered rock project salvage plan is consistent with these guidelines.
of crucial importance,however,is that the nfp does not in any way relax its lsr management goals for salvage operations.instead,the lsr salvage guidelines reiterate that b ecause reserves have been established to provide high quality habitat for species associated with forest conditions,management following a event should be designed to accelerate or not impede the development of those conditions.id.at see also nfp rod at salvage guidelines are intended to prevent negative effects on habitat.moreover,the guidelines state that w hile priority should be given to salvage in areas where it will have a positive effect on forest habitat,salvage operations should not diminish habitat suitability now or in the future.id.at.thus,while it permits salvage logging in limited circumstances,the nfp clearly prioritizes the preservation of lsr ecosystems over commercial benefits.
the blm interpretation of the lsr salvage guidelines is inconsistent with the nfp clear direction.the blm construes the guidelines as balancing environmental concerns and economic factors equally.to be sure,the forest service may consider economic interests in choosing how it will conduct lsr salvage operations that it may do so is not only a matter of common sense,but it is also something explicitly contemplated by the plan.see nfp s g at m anagement planning for reserves must acknowledge the considerable value of retaining dead and dying trees in the forest as well as the benefits from salvage activities.however,the nfp does not permit a salvage project in an lsr for the purpose of recovering the economic value of timber without at least the administrative such action is compatible with the nfp direction to protect and enhance ecosystems.not only would doing so run afoul of the nfp clear priority of protecting lsr ecosystems,but it would contradict the plan directive 
in all cases,planning for salvage should focus on objectives,which are based on desired future condition of the forest.because reserves have been established to provide high quality habitat for species associated with forest conditions,management following a event should be designed to accelerate or not impede the development of those conditions.
in sum,s alvage activities must be intended to prevent negative effects on habitat,nfp rod at,and the blm interpretation is inconsistent with this directive.therefore,it is not entitled to deference,native ecosystems,at,and we must independently evaluate the project to determine whether its specific elements comply with the nfp.
b.the timbered rock project violates the nfp.
onrc challenges four components of the timbered rock project,two of which warrant attention here snag retention and research logging because the blm relied on an erroneous interpretation of the nfp managing directives for lsrs when developing the project,it is not surprising that both of these components are inconsistent with the plan and,consequently,violate flpma.
snag retention 
as we explained in section i,supra,the timbered rock project proposes substantial salvage logging in the acreage affected by the fire in an effort to recover economic value from the timber therein.the salvage would remove from the elk creek lsr a significant number of large,standing dead or dying trees,known as snags.this is significant because snags play an integral role in the ecology of forests.indeed,the nfp expressly states 
tree mortality is an important and natural process within a forest ecosystem.diseased and damaged trees and logs are key structural components of and forests.salvage of dead trees affects the development of future stands and habitat quality for a number of organisms.snag removal may result in influences on forest stands because large snags are not produced in natural stands until trees become large and begin to die from natural mortality.snags are used extensively by birds and mammals such as woodpeckers,nuthatches,chickadees,squirrels,red tree voles,and american marten.removal of snags following disturbance can reduce the carrying capacity for these species for many years.
nfp s g at see also id.at t rees injured by disturbance may develop cavities,deformed crowns,and limbs which are habitat components for a variety of wildlife species.
given the importance of snags in ecosystems,it is not surprising the nfp restricts removal of snags in lsrs.in fact,the nfp salvage guideline expressly limits the removal of such snags 
snags provide a variety of habitat benefits for a variety of wildlife species associated with forests.accordingly,following disturbance,management should focus on retaining snags that are likely to persist until conditions have developed and the new stand is again producing large snags.conditions are not associated with stands less than years old.
id.at emphasis added.despite this clear directive against removing large snags,those likely to persist until conditions have developed,the blm asserts that the project,which entails the removal of a significant number of large snags in areas,is nonetheless consistent with the nfp.we disagree,and find the blm reasoning lacking in multiple respects.
the blm asserts that removing a significant number of large snags is consistent with the nfp because leaving some large eight and twelve per acre in the nonresearch provide sufficient habitat for species that rely upon large snags for survival,a standard.the blm supports this conclusion with data produced by the decaid wood advisor.decaid is a model designed to help managers evaluate effects of forest conditions and existing or proposed management activities on organisms that use snags and down wood.timbered rock feis at.however,decaid does not specifically address effects of fire,id.at,and it is not intended to predict occurrence of wildlife species at the scale of individual forest stands or specific locations,id.at.
onrc argues that the blm use of decaid is arbitrary and capricious yet even if we assume,arguendo,that using decaid is permissible,the blm argument that the project,in employing the model recommended levels,complies with the nfp still fails for two principal reasons.first,the blm can point to no part of the nfp to support its argument that using the standard satisfies the plan.in light of the plan clear directive against removing snags that will remain until the forest regenerates,this is not surprising.indeed,the salvage guidelines expressly state that snags likely to persist until conditions have developed and the new stand is again producing large snags should not be removed.nfp s g at 
moreover,the importance of developing and retaining snags is emphasized in other parts of the nfp.for example,when discussing the role of silviculture in preserving lsrs,the plan states that the development of forest characteristics including snags is a principal objective.nfp s g at.the plan similarly states that d esired and characteristics that will be created as younger stands change through successional development include accumulations of large logs and snags.id.again,the nfp emphasis on retaining snags in lsrs is not surprising given the plan clear prioritization of preserving lsr ecosystems,see section,supra,and the key role snags play in that process.
second,the amount of large snag retention the blm claims to be enough to satisfy the nfp is only achieved by averaging salvaged and areas together across all the acres included in the logging.the timbered rock feis states 
the snags would be concentrated in portions of the units that receive no harvest.approximately acres would be included as harvest units,with acres receiving harvest of all trees and the remaining acres retaining all trees,accounting for the snags per acre.
timbered rock feis at.thus,the blm representation that between eight and twelve large snags per acre will still be standing after the logging occurs is grossly misleading,as over of the affected acreage will be completely stripped of all salvageable trees.
the blm attempt to dilute the effects of its proposed activities by averaging the snag retention over such a wide area is inconsistent with the nfp and improper under our precedent.see pac.coast fed of fishermen ass ns marine fisheries,cir holding that an agency can not try to minimize the environmental impact of an activity by simply adopting a scale of analysis so broad that it marginalizes the impact of the activity on ecosystem health.in fact,if using such an approach was permitted,the project could all acres and still claim to be retaining eight to twelve snags per acre by merely expanding the project to include more land clearly,this would be unreasonable,as any adverse environmental effect could be diluted to insignificance.id.at.
furthermore,even if the decaid recommendations for snag density happen to approximate the density actually required to sustain forests,the blm offers no evidence that a averaging approach is compatible with these recommendations.the blm notes it relied on two studies that recommended leaving snags in clumps rather than scattered across the landscape.the blm does not explain,however,how it achieves the desired distribution of clumps by leaving roughly thirty large snags per acre in less than of the land covered by the project while the remaining lion share.
the blm cites a specific passage in the nfp to support its argument that salvaging large snags at the level proposed in the project is consistent with the plan.the passage states 
salvage is not required to be beneficial,but is designed to permit the recovery of timber volume in those instances where catastrophic events clearly kill more trees resulting in more snags and down logs in the short and long term than are needed to maintain conditions.for example,if a major blowdown event leaves dead trees feet deep over the landscape,a determination could be made that only a portion of those logs are needed to meet the objectives of the reserve.the rest might be available for salvage.
nfp rod at.thus,under certain limited circumstances,salvage can occur in lsrs indeed,we noted this in section,supra.however,the blm does not claim or offer evidence to demonstrate that the timbered rock fire clearly kill ed more trees than are needed to maintain conditions,or that only a portion of dead trees are needed to meet the objectives of the reserve.instead,the blm relies on its argument without making the threshold findings required by the nfp.
the blm also cites the nfp statement that some commercial wood volume removal is permitted in lsrs.see nfp s g at.but again,the nfp clearly states that salvaging should be minimal,that environmental concerns ought to take priority over potential commercial benefits,and that large snags should be retained so as to ensure the development and preservation of habitat.despite these numerous mandates emphasizing that logging snags should not harm lsrs,the blm neglects to explain how the timbered rock project avoids doing just that.
in sum,we require an agency to present a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made.native ecosystems,at internal quotation marks omitted.the blm decision to preserve a baseline number of snags is insufficient in a fundamental way it neglects to explain why the snag removal it does authorize,which undisputably harms habitat in the short term,will somehow maintain overall habitat suitability now or in the future,as expressly required by the nfp.see nfp s g at.consequently,the timbered rock project violates flpma.
research logging 
onrc also challenges the project proposed research logging,which would occur on acres of land affected by the fire within the elk creek lsr the nfp establishes narrow guidelines identifying the circumstances in which research is permissible in lsrs,similar to the guidelines regarding salvage logging.specifically,the plan states 
a variety of wildlife and other research activities may be ongoing and proposed in habitat.these activities must be assessed to determine if they are consistent with reserve objectives.some activities including those with experimental forests not otherwise consistent with the objectives may be appropriate,particularly if the activities will test critical assumptions of these standards and guidelines,will produce results important for habitat development,or if the activities represent continuation of research.these activities should only be considered if there are no equivalent opportunities outside reserves.
nfp s g.thus,the nfp creates a inquiry for assessing whether research activities are permitted in an lsr.
first,the research activity is examined to determine whether it is consistent with reserve objectives.one of the nfp stated goals for lsrs is the development of forest characteristics including snags.nfp s g at.however,the research logging proposed in the project would itself result in the removal of hundreds if not thousands of snags,a fundamental component of lsrs.moreover,the blm states it is attempting to ensure that of the dead trees in all size classes greater than twenty inches dbh would be maintained,but the blm presents no evidence to support a claim that removing the remaining would in fact assist with the development of forest characteristics.thus,for the same reasons the project falls short with regard to snag retention,it is also lacking with regard to its proposed research activities.
under the second step of the inquiry,even if the proposed activities are inconsistent with these objectives,they might still be permitted if they test critical assumptions,produce results important for habitat development,or represent continuation of research and there are no equivalent opportunities outside reserves.the nfp mandates that while a n important component of the plan is the facilitation of research activities to gather information and test hypotheses in a range of environmental conditions,every effort should be made to locate research activities in land allocations where they will have the least adverse effect upon the objectives of the applicable standards and guidelines.nfp rod at.the blm has failed to satisfy this requirement.
even if the blm is correct that the project would test various assumptions in the nfp it has provided no evidence that equivalent opportunities are unavailable in areas.what is more,although the project research proposals are related to conditions and must be conducted in a recently burned area,the blm concedes a number of these areas exist within southwest oregon,and the blm makes little more than the conclusory statement that conducting this research in an lsr is appropriate in supporting its proposed research projects.timbered rock feis at.thus,the research proposed under the project fails to comply with the nfp guidelines.
in sum,the blm interpretation of the plan is plainly inconsistent with the nfp directives regarding reserves.as a result,the snag removal and research activities proposed in the timbered rock project are at odds with the plan and,consequently,violate flpma.
iv.the nepa claims 
in addition to its claims under flpma,onrc also alleges the timbered rock project violates the national environmental policy act.nepa requires agencies considering major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment to prepare and issue an environmental impact statement.c nw.envtl.advocates marine fisheries,cir.the statement shall provide full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.nw.envtl.advocates,at.thus,it is more than a mere disclosure document.our job in reviewing an eis is to ensure that the agency has taken a hard look at the potential environmental consequences of the proposed action.wildlands ctr.bureau of land,cir citing churchill county norton,cir.by focusing agency and public attention on the environmental effects of proposed agency action,nepa ensures that the agency will not act on incomplete information,only to regret its decision after it is too late to correct.marsh or.natural res.council,d.
one of the specific requirements under nepa is that an agency must consider the effects of the proposed action in the context of all relevant circumstances,such that where several actions have a cumulative environmental effect,this consequence must be considered in an eis.neighbors of cuddy mountain forest,cir quoting city of tenakee springs clough,cir.a cumulative effect is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.
onrc asserts that the blm failed to analyze in the feis the cumulative impact of the timbered rock project and three other categories of suppression efforts,salvage logging on interspersed private lands,and salvage logging on deferred watersheds.our cases firmly establish that a cumulative effects analysis must be more than perfunctory it must provide a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of past,present,and future projects,at emphasis added quoting ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir.to this end,we have recently noted two critical features of a cumulative effects analysis.first,it must not only describe related projects but also enumerate the environmental effects of those projects.see lands council powell,cir holding a cumulative effects analysis violated nepa because it failed to provide adequate data of the time,place,and scale and did not explain in detail how different project plans and harvest methods affected the environment.second,it must consider the interaction of multiple activities and can not focus exclusively on the environmental impacts of an individual project.see,at finding a cumulative effects analysis inadequate when it only considers the effects of the very project at issue and does not take into account the combined effects that can be expected as a result of undertaking multiple projects.
we are not persuaded that the timbered rock feis includes an adequate discussion of the direct effects of fire suppression activities or salvage logging on private lands.the feis mentions that fire suppression efforts increased erosion and sedimentation,that they might have increased fish mortality,and that private logging has had an impact on fish,aquatic insects,and the accumulation of woody this is not enough.the blm must do more than merely state that past projects contributed to environmental harms.see lands council,at.in lands council,we found a cumulative effects analysis inadequate because it should have provided adequate data of the time,type,place,and scale of past timber harvest and should have explained in sufficient detail how different project plans and harvest methods affected the environment.id.at.
the efforts to suppress the timbered rock fire involved the construction of nearly miles of new firelines and the aerial application of nearly gallons of chemical retardant.after the fire,boise corporation logged nearly acres of private land interspersed with the elk creek lsr,requiring new roads to be constructed to reach the private holdings.although the timbered rock feis recites these facts,it does not contain the level of detailed explanation required by lands council the feis contains a table summarizing cumulative effects in broad terms,but it does not offer quantified or detailed data about these effects.as we have observed on multiple occasions,general statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided,at quoting ocean advocates,at.even if the blm was unable to indicate with any great degree of certainty the results of the project,because the cumulative effects analysis requires an agency to predict future conditions,uncertainty is an inherent part of the process.therefore,a general statement about uncertainty does not satisfy the procedural requirement that an agency take a hard look at the environmental effects of an action.the blm can certainly explain specific projections with reference to uncertainty however,it may not rely on a statement of uncertainty to avoid even attempting the requisite analysis.
finally,the blm analysis of cumulative effects in deferred watersheds presents a distinct problem.deferred watersheds are areas identified in the medford rmp as already sustaining significant cumulative effects.in light of these effects,the rmp defers further management activities in these areas for a period of time,although it notes that salvage and other limited activities could be permitted if the effects will not increase the cumulative effects.medford rmp record of decision at.by virtue of this specific direction,the blm is required to analyze the cumulative effects of additional logging in the five deferred watersheds in the timbered rock project area.this analysis appears nowhere in the feis.while the feis does mention background facts about deferred watersheds,it fails to consider what the likely impact on the watersheds will be when the environmental impacts of the timbered rock project are added to the deteriorated state of the watersheds,which led to the initial deferred designation.thus,as in lands council,the feis is inadequate because there is no discussion of the connection between individual harvests and the prior environmental harms from those harvests that the agency now acknowledges.lands council,at.
in sum,the blm failed to analyze the impact of the timbered rock project when combined with previous fire suppression efforts,salvage logging on interspersed private lands,and salvage logging on deferred watersheds.because the blm is required to consider these effects,neighbors of cuddy mountain,at,by failing to do so it did not take the requisite hard look at the impact the project would have on the environment,at.consequently,the blm violated nepa.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that in developing the timbered rock project,the blm violated the nfp and,consequently,flpma,and nepa.because the apa dictates that we should hold unlawful and set aside agency action not in accordance with law,natural res.def.council,at quoting a,we affirm the district court decision to enjoin the project from going forward.
both the district court and our court have now ruled that the bureau of land management blm violated the federal land policy and management act flpma and the national environmental policy act nepa in proposing the timbered rock fire salvage and elk creek watershed restoration project timbered rock project or project to salvage the remains of a disastrous fire in the elk creek watershed.
with respect,i am unpersuaded that blm violated either act when the question is viewed under the proper standard of review.because it appears that both courts have inappropriately substituted their own policy views for the blm,i can not concur.the majority opinion recognizes that we must not invalidate agency action where the agency can present a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made.ante,at.unfortunately,because i can discern no rational connection between this extremely deferential standard of review and the majority conclusions in this case,i must respectfully dissent.
flpma authorizes the blm to develop,maintain,and,when appropriate,revise land use plans which provide by tracts or areas for the use of the public lands.a.once such plans are in place,flpma mandates that the blm act in accordance with them.a.in the instant case,the governing land use plans are the medford district bureau of resource management plan medford rmp or rmp,as amended by the northwest forest plan nfp.our task is to determine whether the timbered rock project is consistent with the medford rmp and the nfp.
our review must be deferential,because the blm was interpreting its own guidelines.forest guardians forest service,cir f ederal courts are required to defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of its own guidelines.furthermore,we owe heightened deference where,as here,the agency interpretation involves its own technical expertise and complex scientific methodologies.see,envtl.def,epa,cir we treat epa decision with great deference because we are reviewing the agency technical analysis and judgments,based on an evaluation of complex scientific data within the agency technical expertise.
the majority mistakenly reads the nfp requirement that the forest service service focus on snag retention as one that expressly limits the removal of snags.ante,at.one searches in vain for any such express limitation a requirement to focus on retention,i suggest,more naturally reflects a presumption that snags will indeed need to be removed.the insistence upon its own best vision for silviculture,rather than upon the language of congress or the professional expertise of the service,pervades today majority opinion,which far exceeds our limited role in reviewing agency action.
i concede that if the nfp posed an absolute bar to any and all snag removal,then the forest service has not made a showing that would overcome such a prohibition.but of course the nfp contains no such requirement,not by its plain language nor by any reasonable inference therefrom.the majority maintains that the blm can point to no part of the nfp to support its argument that using the standard satisfies the plan.ante,at.on the contrary,the some is enough standard is implicit in the language the majority relies upon.it is the majority,rather,that can point to no language in the nfp stating that some is never enough rather,it simply quotes focus on to divine an express limitation.
perhaps the majority has a better idea than the blm about how many large snags to retain our task,however,only only to review whether the blm determination is arbitrary and capricious,and this the majority utterly fails to demonstrate.the majority derides the blm use of averaging in analyzing snag retention levels,ante,at,though it acknowledges,ante,at,that the blm cites to two scientific studies supporting the practice.rather than demonstrating,as it must but can not,that the blm has failed to establish a rational connection between the facts in the record and its conclusions,the majority constructs its own straw man example of an egregious abuse of averaging and quotes a justice brandeis aphorism to boot.ante,at.yet,the record demonstrates that of snags on blm land would still be present after the timbered rock project,and that no salvage logging would occur on roughly of the forest areas affected by the fires.justice brandeis was a wise man,but application of his aphorism to silviculture is surely inapposite.
the folly of the majority analysis is also apparent in its discussion of the nfp explicit allowance for recovery of timber volume after catastrophic events.see ante at.though the majority opinion repeatedly derides the principle that some is enough,it does not seem to recognize that the only alternative to that truism is an absolute prohibition on snag removal.yet it acknowledges that such a reading is untenable and that salvage can occur in lsrs.ante,at.therefore,it too believes that some,but not all,large snags must be maintained.
further,the majority chides the blm for purportedly failing to claim or offer evidence that the timbered rock fire killed more trees than are needed to maintain late successional conditions.ante,at.on the contrary,the final environmental impact study feis provides multiple scientific references supporting its proposed level of snag relying upon the decaid wood advisor,as well as upon separate studies by rose,et,and ohmann 
it follows,therefore,that the blm has indeed argued,and to my mind demonstrated,that the timberland rock fire killed more trees than are needed to maintain late sucessional conditions.it is baffling,and in any event demonstrably false,to contend that the blm does not claim or offer evidence to this end.the majority,so eager to lampoon the blm position as some is enough,is apparently unwilling to concede that enough is enough.
because the blm has easily demonstrated its compliance with the nfp general requirement to focus on snag retention,and because it has shown the requisite rational connection between the facts in the record and its conclusions about how many snags to retain,i can not join the court naked imposition of its own preference under the guise of a review for arbitrariness and capriciousness.with respect,i would reverse the district court.
the majority undertakes to reject the research logging proposed by the blm under either of two tests permitting logging first,that the activity is consistent with reserve lsr objectives,or second,if the proposal meets any of a series of alternate criteria and no equivalent opportunities outside of the lsr exist.the majority contends that the blm proposal fails the first test for the same reasons the project falls short with regard to snag retention.ante,at.as i have already shown,only by ignoring the studies relied upon by the blm and by distorting the instruction to focus upon snag retention into an express limitation upon snag removal does the majority reach its erroneous conclusion concerning snag retention.thus,i can not agree that the proposed research logging is inconsistent with lsr objectives.
although it is not necessary to my dissent on this score,let me add that the blm has also demonstrated that the research logging would be permissible under the nfp even if inconsistent with lsr objectives.this is so first because the research logging would test critical assumptions concerning salvage of trees and second because the blm demonstrated that there were no equivalent opportunities outside reserves.specifically,the blm stated that while there are other recently burned areas in southwest oregon,the medford district was the only recently burned lsr.the blm stated that research in an lsr is critical because of the manner in which lsr land is treated.these types of scientific and technical decisions are owed our deference.see envtl.def,epa,cir we treat this decision with great deference because we are reviewing the agency technical analysis and judgments,based on an evaluation of complex scientific data within the agency technical expertise.
because the majority agrees with the district court finding of flpma violations with respect to snag removal and research logging,it does not reach the district court further finding of a violation in the blm decision not to designate acres as riparian reserves.i would reverse the district court decision here as well,as the blm persuasively argues that the district court erroneously assumed that all unstable or potentially unstable areas must be designated as riparian reserves,whereas the nfp indicates that the blm should decide if an area is a riparian reserve by focusing on when watershed analysis determines that present and future coarse woody debris needs are met.the nfp also discusses riparian reserves in terms of their proximity to streams and rivers,not simply their stability.because the blm determined that the acres in question were not adjacent to or related to streams or rivers,i would hold that the blm was not in error in deciding not to designate them as riparian reserves.
finally,the district court agreed with onrc contention that the project violates the medford rmp by providing for salvage logging on lands that might be designated nonsuitable woodlands.although the rmp does state that nonsuitable woodlands are not suitable for timber harvest,elsewhere it permits such logging for various purposes,including reduc ing road construction,improving the safety of forest users,and for
