plaintiff rudy stanko,proceeding pro se,appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment to defendant jim maher on stanko complaint alleging violations of his constitutional rights we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of maher 
stanko is a resident of gordon,nebraska who operates as a stock owner and drover in fremont,natrona,and teton counties,wyoming.maher is a brand inspector employed by the state of wyoming livestock board board.
stanko complaint 
in his complaint,stanko alleges that on or about november,maher went on land leased by stanko south of jackson,wyoming,without stanko consent or a warrant,and seized five head of livestock,consisting of two pairs and one yearling.he further asserts that maher,possibly acting in concert with others then transported the cattle to fremont county and instructed that they be sold at the riverton livestock exchange.
stanko asserts that he is the owner of the cattle and has not been compensated for them.he contends that maher violated the united states and wyoming constitutions by infringing on his rights to due process and just compensation and by conducting an impermissible warrantless seizure.he further asserts that maher abused his office in violation of the wyoming constitution.
maher motion for summary judgment 
in his motion for summary judgment,maher states that stanko does business as fish creek cattle company fish creek.three separate brands are registered with the board for use by fish creek.maher supplies a copy of the brand registrations for these brands.maher further recites that fish creek leases the ranch in teton county,wyoming for its cattle operation.
in the fall of,fish creek wanted to move its cattle to a location outside teton county.under the wyoming statutes,the cattle had to be brand inspected before they could be moved across county lines.maher contends that stanko arranged for the required inspection of the cattle he intended to remove from teton county.
maher further contends that on november,he and another brand inspector went to the ranch to inspect brands on the cattle stanko wanted to remove from teton county.five of the animals cows,two calves and one not bear brands registered to fish creek.to be certain of the brands,maher shaved the animals on their right shoulder and right hip,but still did not find any fish creek brands.he did detect two brands on each of the cows the double t brand belonging to the mary mead revocable trust,on each of their left shoulders,and the brand registered to leland and karen turner,on each of their left ribs.the calves were not branded.the steer bore a mottled brand that maher believes may have been the turner,the triangle brand registered to the estate of marvin taylor lawrence,or some similar brand.maher removed all five animals as estrays and completed an estray livestock report.
maher states that stanko telephoned him on november,and demanded return of the five cattle.he told stanko that he must produce proof of ownership of the animals maher contends that stanko refused to do this.because stanko did not produce proof of ownership,maher consigned the cattle to the riverton livestock auction for sale.the animals were sold and the proceeds were deposited with the board.maher further contends that stanko failed to petition the board for a hearing concerning the board actions.
stanko response 
in stanko response to maher motion for summary judgment,he disagrees with some of the aforementioned facts.he contends that he was the owner of the livestock,that he did not request that the animals be removed from teton county,and that he did present his grievance before the board at its meeting on december.he attaches a number of documents that he contends show his ownership of the cattle,and a wyoming livestock board attendance roster.as will be seen,none of these allegedly contested facts precludes the entry of summary judgment on stanko complaint.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.in determining whether the evidence presents a genuine issue of material fact,we view it in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered.

alleged seventh amendment violation 
stanko contends that the district court deprived him of a right to trial by jury in violation of the seventh amendment by entering summary judgment against him.as we have stated on many occasions,however,t he seventh amendment is not violated by proper entry of summary judgment because such a ruling means that no triable issue exists to be submitted to a jury.shannon graves,cir.nor did the district court engage in impermissible,as he contends its entry of summary judgment was dependent on a determination that no genuine issue of material fact existed for a jury to decide.see.c stanko seventh amendment assertion is valid only if summary judgment was improperly entered in this case,an issue that we consider with regard to his other claims.
alleged fourth amendment violation 
stanko contends that maher the state of wyoming needed an oath,affirmation a warrant before they seized cattle belonging to him.maher responds that he seized the cattle as estrays,as he was permitted to do by the wyoming statutes.
