these consolidated cases ask the question whether tennessee laws governing the wine industry violate the dormant commerce clause of the constitution.this is one of several lawsuits filed across the country after the supreme court invalidated laws in michigan and new york which allowed only wineries to sell and ship wine directly to consumers.granholm heald,d.
the include tennessee residents frederick jelovsek and martin reddish,individual oenophiles who would like better access to wine produced outside of tennessee,and a winery based in the state of indiana,thomas family winery,which would like to sell directly to tennessee residents.plaintiffs sued the governor,attorney general,and executive director of the tennessee alcoholic beverage commission,in their official capacities.in addition,the wine and spirits wholesalers of tennessee wswt successfully intervened as a defendant.for convenience sake,as the court did in granholm,the appellants will collectively be referred to as the wineries,unless distinguishing them is appropriate,and the appellees will be referred to as the state.
the district court granted defendants.c motion for judgment on the pleadings.jelovsek bresden,d,the district court concluded that since both in and wineries are prohibited from selling and shipping wine directly to tennessee consumers,this case is distinguishable from granholm.the invalidated laws in granholm denied only wineries the ability to ship to consumers,a disparate treatment that the supreme court ruled unconstitutional.
we agree with the district court that the tennessee shipping restrictions are distinguishable from those struck down in granholm and affirm the district court judgment as to the tennessee ban on the direct shipment of alcohol to consumers,including wine.however,the wineries make a broader challenge to the tennessee regulatory scheme for alcohol,specifically wine.as discussed below,we conclude that certain other challenged laws are discriminatory on their face,and thus vacate the district court judgment as to those laws,and remand for further proceedings.
tennessee employs what is commonly referred to as a system of alcohol regulation.the tennessee alcoholic beverage commission tabc issues separate classes of licenses to manufacturers and distillers,wholesalers,and liquor retailers.ann.unlicensed sales of alcohol are not permitted.id.a.manufacturers are limited to selling to wholesalers wholesalers may sell to retailers,or in some cases other wholesalers consumers are required to buy only from retailers.id.b d.
statutes curtail the importation of alcoholic beverages,including wine,into the state,as well as the transportation of alcoholic beverages by individuals who are not licensees.these statutes seem to contradict each other,which creates a confusing web of seemingly applicable laws,and in its briefing and argument to the court the state did little to unravel the mystery the district court found,and the state concedes,that a tennessee resident may transport a greater quantity of wine purchased from a tennessee winery as compared to wine purchased in another state.
tennessee wineries are also subject to the system,and have their own class of license.id.however,wineries are subject to further regulation,as well as being afforded some exceptions from the general liquor control statutes,through tennessee grape and wine law.id.the grape and wine law,inter alia,restricts winery licenses to individuals who have been tennessee residents for at least two years,or to corporations whose stock is wholly owned by tennessee residents of at least two years and permits tennessee wineries which use a sufficient percentage of grapes in their wine production to serve complimentary samples to patrons,and to sell at retail directly to customers without any additional license.id.d,f.the grape and wine law also provides that,notwithstanding the transportation restrictions in other statutes,wine purchased at a tennessee winery may be transported within the state of tennessee.id.i.

plaintiffs allege that the challenged statutes impermissibly discriminate against wineries,and favor wineries,in violation of the commerce clause.the scope of the commerce clause,which grants the exclusive power to congress to regulate interstate commerce,recently has been summarized by the supreme court 
the commerce clause empowers congress t o regulate commerce among the several states,art.i,cl,and although its terms do not expressly restrain the several states in any way,we have sensed a negative implication in the provision since the early days,see,cooley board of wardens of port of philadelphia ex rel.soc.for relief of distressed pilots,how.gibbons ogden,wheat.marshall,dictum.the modern law of what has come to be called the dormant commerce clause is driven by concern about economic is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.new energy of limbach,d.the point is to effectuat e the framers purpose to prevent a state from retreating into the economic isolation,fulton faulkner,d quoting oklahoma tax comm jefferson lines,d brackets omitted,that had plagued relations among the colonies and later among the states under the articles of confederation,hughes oklahoma,d.
under the resulting protocol for dormant commerce clause analysis,we ask whether a challenged law discriminates against interstate commerce.see oregon waste systems,department of environmental quality of,d.a discriminatory law is virtually per se invalid,see also philadelphia new jersey,d,and will survive only if it advances a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives,oregon waste systems,supra,at,d internal quotation marks omitted see also maine taylor,d.
dep t of revenue davis,d.
applying this constitutional principle to the regulation of alcohol at times has been problematic for courts,due in part to the existence of the amendment to the constitution,which repealed prohibition and grants broad authority to the states to regulate alcohol importation and distribution.there was a period following ratification of the amendment when the states power to regulate alcohol was thought to be virtually limitless however,more recent case law has concluded that t he aim of the amendment was to allow states to maintain an effective and uniform system for controlling liquor by regulating its transportation,importation,and use.the amendment did not give states the authority to pass nonuniform laws in order to discriminate against goods,a privilege they had not enjoyed at any earlier time.granholm,at.similarly,the amendment does not displace the rule that states may not give a discriminatory preference to their own producers.id.at.accord bacchus imports,dias,d.a statute may be shown to violate the commerce clause based either upon its discriminatory purpose,or discriminatory effect.bacchus,at.
