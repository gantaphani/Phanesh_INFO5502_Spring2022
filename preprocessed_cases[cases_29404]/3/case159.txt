melford olson honey,a minnesota honey wholesaler,sued richard adee richard doing business as adee honey farms adee honey,a south dakota honey farmer,in minnesota state court for breach of contract and specific performance,alleging adee honey failed to provide the requisite quantity of honey set forth in a june contract.adee honey removed the case to federal court on diversity jurisdiction and counterclaimed for money owed under the same contract.the district court denied both parties motions for partial summary judgment,and the case proceeded to a jury trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of in the amount of on the initial claim and a verdict in favor of adee honey in the amount of on the counterclaim.the district court denied the parties motions,and both parties timely appealed.we affirm.
adee honey,formed by richard in,operates honey farms in california,nebraska,mississippi,and south dakota.adee honey principal place of business is in south dakota.is owned by william sill,and curt and darcy riess.they bought the company in and were referred to richard by prior owners.
in march,adee honey and entered into an oral agreement for the sale of honey.at the time,adee honey possessed a sufficient inventory of honey and agreed to sell approximately thirty loads,or million pounds to for cents per pound.shortly thereafter,sent a purchase order to adee honey memorializing the sale of million pounds of honey for cents per pound.the purchase order noted it was a contract with a good thru date of april.it was sent to adee honey south dakota office although allegedly knew richard was working at the mississippi facility until.
at approximately the same time,adee honey called to discuss the possibility of selling up to twelve loads of its inventoried honey to a competitor.according to adee honey,agreed,thereby altering the quantity term of the march contract.according to,it permitted adee honey to sell twelve loads of inventoried honey to another distributor,provided the terms of the march contract were fulfilled with other honey.between the months of may and september,adee honey sent eighteen loads of honey at cents per pound.
in may,honey prices began to rise due to a contamination in major chinese honey supplies.in june,contacted adee honey about purchasing an additional million pounds,and the parties agreed on a per pound purchase price for the additional quantity.sent a contract to adee honey detailing the new arrangement,and richard added a handwritten force majeure clause,specifically excusing performance in the event of an act of god such as a drought or flood.
later in the summer of,south dakota was experiencing conditions,and adee honey unilaterally stopped performing its obligations under the june contract.according to,richard contacted it to discuss the possibility of increasing the price of honey by cents per pound to cover losses adee honey would suffer due to the production shortage.by the time grudgingly decided to accept the terms,adee honey instead stated the new price would be per pound instead of to per pound.
in the early fall of,adee honey began delivering honey to at an invoice price of per pound,however,refused to pay for this honey.by november,its account was roughly million in arrears.in november and december,paid adee honey cents per pound for approximately pounds received claiming this honey fulfilled the terms of the march contract did not pay anything for an additional pounds received.admits owing per pound on this quantity,subject to some adjustments 
initiated this lawsuit claiming a breach of the june agreement requesting specific performance and damages.adee honey counterclaimed for the balance due on account.both parties unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment,and the case proceeded to a jury trial.at trial,submitted the following evidence of damages owed its owner curt reiss stated it would cost an average of per pound to replace the honey a former employee,james jackson,computed diminished profits based on a comparison of yearly sales figures and the increased price of honey and jackson testified as to potential accounts lost by due to the price insisted upon by adee honey.
the district court instructed the jury on the statute of frauds.the instruction stated oral contracts for the sale of goods over are generally unenforceable.however,if the parties agree the contract exists,minnesota law provides that the march oral contract is enforceable,but not beyond the quantity of goods admitted by the party against whom enforcement is sought which,in this case,is adee honey.did not object to this instruction or request any other instructions on the statute of frauds.on the special verdict,the jury determined adee honey breached the june agreement and the breach was not excused by force majeure or commercial impracticability.because of this breach,the jury determined was entitled to for expenses and for lost profits.with respect to adee honey counterclaim,the jury determined breached the june contract by paying only cents per pound for honey invoiced at per pound.for this breach,the jury awarded adee honey additionally,the jury determined owed for the pounds of honey for which it had never paid.
both parties unsuccessfully moved for judgment as a matter of law and new trial.in ruling on the motions,the district court found had waived any argument concerning the merchant exception to the statute of frauds by failing to request a jury instruction on it.additionally,the court determined could not satisfy the statutory standard.with respect to damages,the court upheld the jury determinations as reasonable,despite being imprecise.the court rejected adee honey arguments with respect to anticipatory repudiation,force majeure,and commercial impracticability,determining the jury determinations were supported by the evidence submitted at trial.both parties timely appealed.
a.the statute of frauds 
the district court refused to grant either party motion for summary judgment,a directed verdict,or other relief on the basis of the statute of frauds.we review the district court determination as to the applicability of the statute of frauds de novo.simmons foods,hill pet nutrition,cir.additionally,we review de novo the district court denial of the motions for summary judgment,directed verdict,and for judgment as a matter of law.top of iowa.schewe,cir.
generally,the minnesota statute of frauds provides oral contracts for the sale of goods for or more are unenforceable unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.the statute is applicable because the march contract for the sale of honey,goods priced over,was not reduced to writing and signed by adee honey,the party against whom enforcement was sought.
adee honey,however,admitted it contracted with for eighteen loads of honey,and this admission constitutes an exception to the statute.b noting a contract otherwise within the statute may be enforced against a person who admits in pleading,testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made,but not beyond the quantity of goods admitted.the jury thus was entitled to determine the march contract was enforceable for up to eighteen loads of honey.
claims the entire quantity of million pounds noted in its purchase order should be outside of the statute of frauds pursuant to the merchant exception.because did not object to the jury instructions regarding the statute of frauds,it has not preserved this issue for appeal.daggitt united food com.workers int l union,local,cir.we therefore limit our review of this issue to determine if the district court plainly erred.id.noting reversal is only warranted in the exceptional case in which the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings quoting figge auto taylor,cir.
under the merchant exception,minnesota law provides 
between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents,it satisfies the requirements of subsection regarding the general applicability of the statute of frauds against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.
whether the parties have satisfied the statute of frauds is a question of law,mylan,to submit the claim to a jury,the district court must determine if a writing indicates an actual transaction.ufe,methode,citing bazak int l mast,see also.at noting all that is required is that the writing afford a basis for believing that the offered oral evidence rests on a real transaction.once the court has made this preliminary determination,a jury determines whether the parties actually entered into the contract.ufe.at.
no specific form is required to meet the merchant exception.a writing referring to a phone call between the parties and evidencing the type of products involved and their quantity will satisfy the statute.see labs.at.however,the writing must be sufficient to indicate a contract.barber,at noting a bare list of projects was insufficient to establish a term indicating the parties agreed a price protection clause.
we hold the purchase order sent by to adee satisfies the requirements of the merchant exception to statute of frauds.the purchase order was sent to adee principal place of business in a timely manner,adee had reason to know why it was sent,and adee did not object to the terms set forth in the document.see bazak intern,at we conclude the annotated purchase order forms signed by the buyer,sent to the seller and retained without objection,fall within the merchant exception,satisfying the statutory requirement of a writing even without the buyer signature.see also thomson printing mach.goodrich,cir determining a party principal place of business is an adequate place to send a confirmation under the uniform commercial code.under the exception,adee was not required to sign the document,and the presence of an ambiguous good thru date does not alter the analysis.
once the merchant exception has been satisfied,the district court may submit the evidence of the contract to the jury so the jury can determine its existence and the terms.at stating the party who asserts the validity of the contract maintains the burden of persuading the a contract actually exists,as well as establishing the actual terms and conditions of that contract.despite contention otherwise,meeting the statute of frauds does not prove the terms of the contract meeting the statute of frauds allows a jury to determine the issue.the court below allowed to present the confirmation order associated with the march contract to the jury.based on the jury answers on the special verdict,the jury rejected claim the march contract involved more than eighteen loads of honey.thus,the district court did not plainly err in allowing the jury to make these determinations,and we refuse to disturb the jury quantity determinations on appeal.
force majeure 
adee honey next argues the district court erred in not granting its motions for summary judgment,directed verdict,and judgment as a matter of law on its force majeure defense.we review de novo.top of iowa,at.factual disputes,however,are resolved in favor of the party,and we will affirm the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law if a reasonable jury could differ as to the conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.manning,life ins,cir.
the june contract contains a handwritten force majeure clause.next to the quantity,richard added provided production of said pounds is not impeded by an act of god such as by drought or flood.neither party disputes whether the clause is enforceable or whether drought conditions occurred in the summer of,potentially triggering the clause.instead,the parties dispute the legal effect of the clause and the parties continuing obligations under the contract.
the effect of a force majeure clause is to excuse performance in the event an unforseen circumstance occurs.see suburban newspapers of greater louis,kroger,cir.the performance to be excused is determined by the language of the clause.see id.according to adee honey,as soon as the drought occurred,it had the right to cease performance under the existing contract and to enter into new agreements at higher prices.argues the force majeure clause does not give adee honey the unilateral right to raise the price of honey from per pound to per pound because of the weather conditions.
the district court determined the contract language was ambiguous because questions existed as to the severity of the drought,adee honey ability to meet its contractual obligations,and adee honey right to request additional money for honey under the june contract.because the force majeure clause does not include language explicitly resolving any of these issues,the district court did not err in submitting these issues to the jury.the jury determined adee honey was not excused from performing the june contract,and we do not disturb these factual findings supported by the record 
commercial impracticability 
adee honey alternatively argues the district court should have granted its summary judgment and motions on the grounds of commercial impracticability.we review de novo,top of iowa,at,resolving factual discrepancies in favor of the party and in support of the jury verdict.manning,at.
the minnesota supreme court recognized the uniform commercial code provision governing excuse of performance has replaced the requirement of impossibility of performance by a less stringent standard of commercial impracticability.barbarossa sons,iten chevrolet.minnesota law provides 
except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance 
a delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs b and c is not a breach of duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.
b where the causes mentioned in paragraph a affect only a part of the seller capacity to perform,the seller must allocate production and deliveries among the seller customers but may include regular customers not then under contract as well as the seller own requirements for further manufacture.the seller may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.
c the seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and,when allocation is required under paragraph b,of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.
under this doctrine,commercial impracticability excuses performance of both parties to the contract.barbarossa sons,at.this defense is available if adee honey can show the following four factors a contingency has occurred which has made performance impracticable the nonoccurrence of that contingency was a basic assumption the seller has not assumed a greater obligation and the seller has seasonably notified the buyer that there will be a delay or nondelivery.id.additionally,adee honey must also show it made a fair and reasonable allocation of its inventory once the unforseen event occurred.at.
although the availability of the commercial impracticability defense is a legal issue,a jury must determine whether the facts involved in the case sufficiently support such a defense.see selland,king,noting the minnesota commercial impracticability statute involves issues of fact see also barbarossa sons,at treating the test as four factual questions.after considering evidence of the drought,adee honey contractual obligations,and its ability to perform,the jury determined it was not excused from delivering all the honey due under the june contract.as with the force majeure defense,the jury rejected the claim it had the right to cancel the existing contract and replace it with another contract at a higher price.we find the jury factual findings to be supp
