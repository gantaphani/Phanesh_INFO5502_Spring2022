prunes are harvested from trees and must be dried to be marketed.two administrative rules set forth different overtime pay rates for agricultural workers who harvest fruit and for those who process fruit for market generally speaking,the latter receive more generous overtime pay.this case plumbs the line dividing the workers subject to each respective rule,as applicable to the agricultural practices described herein.
plaintiffs jaswant bains and piara gosal,farmers,appeal from an adverse judgment after a court trial in which they sought a declaration that certain of their workers were not subject to the more generous of two wage orders issued by the department of industrial relations,division of labor standards enforcement department or dlse,as context indicates.
plaintiffs first contend the trial court lacked jurisdiction because they themselves failed to exhaust administrative remedies.however,we conclude that by submitting the matter for decision by the trial court,plaintiffs invited any such error.
plaintiffs next challenge the trial court conclusion on the merits.as we will explain,we find the trial court correctly interpreted the relevant wage orders.some workers harvest the prunes from the trees,whence they are transported to fixed structures where other workers process them for marketing by drying them.neither the fact the fixed structures abut the orchards nor the fact that the fruit must be dried in order to be marketed alters this distinction in function between the workers,a distinction the department has determined merits a difference in providing overtime wages.
accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment.
background 
the industrial welfare commission has issued a number of wage orders that in part prescribe the overtime rates due to various classes of workers,and the dlse enforces these orders.see generally,brinker restaurant superior court cal th,brinker tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th.the two wage orders at issue in this case,wage orders and,are formal administrative regulations.see,tit.the parties do not dispute in this case that wage order would provide more generous overtime rates than would wage order.more details about each of these wage orders will be provided,post.
pretrial procedure 
on april,plaintiffs sued for declaratory relief seeking an adjudication of which of the two wage orders applied to certain workers.to demonstrate the existence of a justiciable controversy,the complaint attached a letter dated november,from the department to plaintiffs counsel,contending that wage order applied to certain of plaintiffs workers.plaintiffs sought a declaration resolving the interpretive dispute so that they would know how to compensate those workers during the upcoming agricultural season without threat of penalty.
the department answer admitted the gist of the dispute,but in part asserted plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.the department trial brief also raised the issue of failure to exhaust administrative remedies,and contended the complaint was premature for this reason.plaintiffs replied that requiring them to risk citation for underpayment of appropriate overtime wages would be onerous and would in any event ultimately lead to a superior court action to resolve what they characterized as a legal,not factual,dispute.
at the court trial,the parties stipulated that various exhibits would be admitted into evidence,and they are included in the clerk transcript.
wage order in part covers workers engaged in t he harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodity,including but not limited to,picking,field packing,and placing in field containers or in the vehicle in which the commodity will be hauled,and transportation on the farm or to a place of first processing or distribution,tit,subd.d,italics added.thus,this wage order,generally speaking,covers employees engaged in a variety of planting,watering,tending,and gathering activities,but not in activities changing the nature of the crops.

the only trial witness was a department employee called by plaintiffs.
facundo rosas has been a detective with the labor commissioner bureau of field enforcement since,and inspects farmers in the sacramento valley.bains and gosal dry their prunes from fruit harvested in their own orchards.prunes are harvested by shaking trees to dislodge fruit french prunes or fruit still on the tree,which is then collected in bins that are moved to a prune dryer.prunes are dehydrated in a fixed structure.rosas disagreed when asked if drying was part of the harvesting process.
detective rosas believed that workers in the drying facility were not harvesters and therefore were entitled to the more generous overtime benefits set forth in wage order.when rosas spoke to bains,bains asserted those workers were to be treated the same as those working in the orchards who were subject to wage order and who therefore received less generous overtime benefits.
detective rosas was shown a document exhibit at trial that was a guide prepared by the department for classifying activities pertaining to the two wage orders.the portion of the guide relevant to wage order listed activities including sorting,grading,moisturizing,packaging,and shipping.rosas testified that exhibit was only a guide and further testified that in the past m aybe back in the orchardists may have dried prunes in the field,but nobody uses that method now,and he had never seen that done in his lifetime.rosas agreed that one part of the guide pertaining to prunes said growing,spraying,thinning,picking and drying applies under wage order,but testified that was just a guideline.rosas testified that fumigation can be done in a prune dryer,as can moisturization,and some places do sort them,and they grade them by the size of the dried prune.rosas agreed the term drying as used in both parts of the guide was used in the same sense but added that in the case of the workers at issue here wage order would apply because those are the specific functions that occur in a prune dryer.
bains has a separate company sacramento packing that processes fruit,and had conceded to rosas that workers there were subject to wage order.however,both he and gosal have drying facilities next to their own orchards in which their own prunes are dried.if either bains or gosal left their prunes in bins,they would rot prunes must be dehydrated to be marketable.
statement of decision and judgment 
after considering posttrial briefing and issuing a tentative decision,the trial court issued a statement of decision as follows plaintiffs dry their own prunes in their own fixed structures.prunes are harvested by shaking the prunes off the tree,collecting them in bins,and moving them to be dried.prunes have not been dried in the orchards since the,and must be dried to be marketed.wage order refers to operations performed in fixed structures to prepare products for market.wage order refers to harvesting products and placing them in containers where they will be taken to the place of first processing.wage order applies to workers in the drying facility because it is a fixed structure and the work occurs after harvesting,which ends when the prunes are placed in bins to be taken for first processing.
the judgment in part declares that wage order applies to the drying of the farmers own prunes after the prunes have been delivered to the drying facility during the upcoming prune harvest season in.
after the trial court denied their motion for a new trial,plaintiffs timely filed this appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
iexhaustion of remedies 
plaintiffs assert the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue a judgment because no administrative hearing had been conducted to consider the applicability of the wage orders in question to the work done by their workers,and contend the issue of lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any time in the proceedings.we conclude that any error was invited.
where a party by his or her conduct induces the commission of error,the party is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal.this application of the estoppel principle is generally known as the doctrine of invited error.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.the appellant can not submit a matter for determination by the lower court and contend on appeal that the matter was beyond the scope of the issues,d.
that is what happened here plaintiffs submitted the key interpretive question to the trial court for decision.in their complaint,pretrial brief,posttrial brief,and motion for a new trial,they sought an interpretation of the wage orders in their favor,and they opposed the department assertion that administrative remedies had to be exhausted.they can not now complain that the trial court should not have decided the issue they themselves pressed the trial court to decide 
in an earlier case we held that where a declaratory relief action was filed before an administrative action,and it appeared a party only procedure for relief was through the court but the parties agreed to an administrative hearing,the losing party could not raise exhaustion of remedies.state of california superior court d,although this is a declaratory relief action and possibly could have been tried without an administrative hearing being provided,the parties stipulated that an administrative hearing be had to hold that real party in interest is not so estopped means that the six days of administrative hearing was a nullity and waste of time.although the parties here did not stipulate to an administrative hearing in this case,plaintiffs argued in the trial court that exhaustion was not required.thus,whether or not that contention was legally correct see fn,post,to allow them to change course now would mean the trial was a nullity and a waste of time.as we said in an analogous context,it is inappropriate to allow any party to trifle with the courts by standing silently by,thus permitting the proceedings to reach a conclusion in which the party could acquiesce if favorable and avoid if unfavorable.in re th,see in re griffin cal d,a litigant who has stipulated to a procedure in excess of jurisdiction may be estopped to question it when to hold otherwise would permit the parties to trifle with the courts,people national automobile casualty ins.th,where a court has jurisdiction,a party who consents to acts beyond the court powers is estopped to complain.
it is true that subject matter jurisdiction the power of the court to act in a certain way can not be conferred by the actions of the parties and the lack thereof can be raised at any time.see saffer jp morgan chase bank,th,saffer barnick longs drug stores,d.but the term jurisdiction has many meanings.see abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira witkin,jurisdiction,supra.some kinds of jurisdiction can be conferred by the actions of the parties.see,summers superior court cal d,estoppel may operate to confer jurisdiction over the parties but can not confer jurisdiction.
the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction but rather is a procedural prerequisite originally devised for convenience and efficiency and now followed under the doctrine of stare decisis citation.it is jurisdictional only in the sense that a courts failure to apply the rule in a situation where the issue has been properly raised can be corrected by the issuance of a writ of prohibition.green city of oceanside d,whether exhaustion is required is not the sort of issue which should fall outside the general rule of civil litigation that arguments and objections not raised and preserved in the trial court are waived on appeal see abelleira,supra,cal d at a fundamental rule of procedure designed to avoid completely destroying the effectiveness of the administrative body saffer,supra,th at other courts have concluded the failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction,and the defense may be waived under exhaustion schemes that were neither mandatory nor part of a statute that explicitly stripped courts of jurisdiction in the absence of administrative exhaustion.
in sacramento county deputy sheriff county of sacramento d,on which plaintiffs rely,we assumed the failure to exhaust administrative remedies did not deprive a court of jurisdiction,but the issue of exhaustion had been raised in the trial court in that case by the party raising the exhaustion rule on appeal.id.at.that is unlike the case at hand,where the parties raising the exhaustion rule on appeal plaintiffs here actively resisted application of that rule in the trial court 
plaintiffs do not point to any statutory provision that compels adjudicating disputes about wage orders via an administrative action before resorting to court action.
nor have they provided any persuasive reason why we should not apply the invited error doctrine and allow them to disavow their tactical choice by insisting on a trial to resolve the interpretive controversy between the parties 
accordingly,we find any error to have been invited and decline to consider the claim on its merits.
application of the relevant wage orders 
plaintiffs contend the trial court misinterpreted the relevant wage orders,both on the facts at trial and also in light of administrative interpretations not presented to the trial court during the course of the litigation below regarding agricultural products other than prunes.as we shall explain,we disagree with each of these two contentions,which we address separately.
factual determinations 
plaintiffs assert that the trial court was wrong to consider the testimony they presented at trial because their claim addresses a purely legal issue about the interpretation of the relevant wage orders.this is not entirely correct.
we agree that wage regulations are interpreted in the same manner as statutes,a task which generally presents a legal question subject to de novo review.see,brewer patel th,aguilar association for retarded citizens d.
however,legal issues arise out of facts,and a party can not ignore the facts in order to raise an academic legal argument.western aggregates,county of yuba th.the meaning of language hinges on its application to a given set of facts.see,in re th,the meaning of words is always contextual california state auto.inter ins.bureau superior court d,fn.there can not be an ambiguity unrelated to an application.i n addressing a party issues we will not be drawn onto inaccurate factual ground.western aggregates,at.we presume the trial court findings are supported by the evidence,and it is plaintiffs burden,as the appellants,to show that they are not.foreman clark fallon cal d.
we therefore agree with plaintiffs that where the facts are undisputed,whether a particular wage order applies to these undisputed facts presents a purely legal question.when a wage order validity and application are conceded and the question is only one of interpretation,the usual rules of statutory interpretation apply.brinker,supra,cal th at,italics added.but here,plaintiffs contest some of the factual findings made by the trial court,therefore the case does not present a purely legal question.
as we have explained,wage order covers workers engaged in harvesting including but not limited to picking,field packing,and placing in field containers or in the vehicle in which the commodity will be hauled,and transportation on the farm or to a place of first processing,tit,subd.d,italics added.clearly,shaking fruit off the trees and collecting them in bins where they will be moved to the drying sheds the place of first processing falls within this wage order.
wage order covers workers engaged in any operation performed in a permanently fixed structure on the farm for the purpose of
