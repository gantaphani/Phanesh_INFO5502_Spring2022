this appeal concerns the united states department of agriculture usda denial of three freedom of information act foia requests of appellant lion raisins lion.lion,a large independent handler of california raisins,is the subject of a criminal investigation because the government suspects that lion falsified documents related to usda inspections of its raisins.in preparation of its defense,lion submitted foia requests seeking documents related to usda raisin inspections conducted at lion packing facility and the facilities of its competitors,and two internal reports related to the usda investigation of lion.usda denied lion requests pursuant to the trade secrets and law enforcement exemptions of foia.see b,a.after exhausting its administrative appeals,lion brought this action to compel production of the documents pursuant to a b.the district court granted summary judgment to usda.on appeal,lion contends that the district court misapplied both the trade secrets and law enforcement exemptions.lion also objects to the district court reliance on in camera review of the government sealed declaration as the sole factual basis for its law enforcement decision.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
the california raisin industry is highly competitive.at the time this action was commenced,raisin prices were at a low and the success or failure of contract bids hinged on price differentials of a fraction of a cent per pound.lion is the largest independent handler of california raisins in the state.like its competitors,lion is governed by the agricultural marketing agreement act of,and a marketing order promulgated thereunder,that regulate the sale of raisins.the marketing order requires that raisin handlers have their products inspected by usda once when they are received from producers,and again before they are sold to the consumer.when conducting the required inspections,usda inspectors periodically take samples from handlers processing lines and assess the quality of the raisins in various categories,including weight,color,size,sugar content,and moisture.see.the inspectors note their observations on line check sheets and assign grades to the observed raisins.the original of the line check sheet is retained by usda and a carbonless copy is left with the handler information from the line check sheets is summarized on usda inspection certificates,which raisin handlers can send to their consumers as an assurance of quality.
on february,the usda received an anonymous tip that lion was falsifying its inspection certificates.acting on that tip,agricultural marketing services of usda ams initiated an investigation.the ams investigation revealed that,on at least three occasions between march and december of,lion representatives forged the signatures of usda inspectors or recorded false moisture readings on inspection certificates.on at least one occasion,lion allegedly altered the grade assigned to its raisins on an inspection certificate from c to on may,ams prepared a report of its findings.on october,the usda office of the inspector general oig served and executed a search warrant at lion packing plant.in the course of that search,agents seized the copies of line check sheets of inspections performed at lion packing plant between and oig prepared a report of its findings.based on the ams investigation and the fruits of the oig raid,usda suspected that lion falsified the copies of line check sheets in addition to inspection certificates.
on january,usda suspended lion from eligibility for government contracts and filed an administrative complaint seeking to debar further inspections of lion facilities.lion successfully challenged usda suspension order in the district court,and later,in the court of federal claims.the debarment complaint was still pending at the time this appeal was argued.meanwhile,the united states attorney for the eastern district of california initiated a criminal investigation.
on august,lion submitted foia requests seeking copies of all original line check sheets for inspections at its packing plant from to the present.although its foia request did not so specify,lion made clear in its briefs and at oral argument that it sought copies of the originals of line check sheets for inspections at its own plants,not the copies that were seized from lion packing plant lion suspected that any discrepancies between the copies of the line check sheets and the originals were the result of usda intentional or negligent alteration of the originals.in a separate request,submitted on august,lion sought the reports prepared by ams and oig related to usda investigation of lion both of lion requests for the check sheets and for the investigative reports were denied pursuant to the law enforcement exemption to foia,on the basis that releasing the documents would interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation.see b a.
in a third request,submitted on august,lion sought copies of the originals of line check sheets,from to the present,for six of its competitors in the california raisin packing industry sunmaid raisins,national raisin,enoch packing,chooljian,del rey packing,and victor packing.lion sought the line check sheets of its competitors because it believed that usda inspectors routinely committed fraud when filling out line check sheets,and it wanted to compare the way its competitors raisins were graded to the way its own raisins were graded.usda withheld these line check sheets pursuant to the trade secrets exemption of foia,on the basis that producing them would cause substantial competitive harm by allowing lion to deduce the volume,market share,and marketing strategy of its main competitors.see b.
lion administratively appealed the denials of each of its foia requests within usda.two of lion appeals were denied.the third appeal received no response lion then brought this action.both parties moved for summary judgment.in support of its trade secrets withholding,usda submitted two declarations from david trykowski,an ams senior compliance officer.trykowski declarations stated that lion could use the information contained in its competitors line check sheets to undercut its competitors bids for raisin contracts,and they discounted the possibility that confidential information from the line check sheets could be redacted to eliminate the competitive harm.in support of usda law enforcement claim,an assistant united states attorney filed a declaration under seal with the district court.based on the information in the three declarations,including its in camera review of the sealed declaration,the district court granted summary judgment for usda.
standard of review 
in reviewing summary judgment in a foia case,we employ a test.the first step is to determine whether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its decision.doyle fbi,cir church of scientology united states dep t of the army,cir.whether a particular set of documents gives the court an adequate factual basis for its decision is a question of law that the court reviews de novo.see wiener fbi,cir binion united states dep t of justice,cir.
the second step is to review the district court decision itself.we have reviewed district court determinations as to whether a foia exemption applies using both the clearly erroneous and de novo standards of review.see tps,united states dep t of,cir if an adequate factual basis exists,we variously use de novo review or clear error review.where the district court decision turns mainly on its findings of fact,we apply the clearly erroneous standard.see assembly of cal.united states dep t of commerce,cir t he case hinges on whether disclosure of the requested information would reveal anything about the agency decisional process.this is a inquiry where deference to the district court finding is appropriate.church of scientology,at.where the parties do not dispute that the district court had an adequate factual basis for its decision,and the decision turns on the district court interpretation of the law,we review the district court decision de novo.see schiffer fbi,cir although any factual conclusions that place a document within a stated exemption of foia are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard,the question of whether a document fits within one of foia prescribed exemptions is one of law,upon which the district court is entitled to no deference.quoting ethyl united states epa,cir.
the district court application of the claimed foia exemptions in this case was grounded in its findings of fact.with respect to the trade secrets exemption,the district court determined that withholding was proper based on its factual finding that lion could use the information in its competitors line check sheets to gain an unfair competitive advantage in the raisin market.see b.with respect to the law enforcement exemption,the district court found that withholding lion line check sheets and the investigative reports was proper because revealing the information in the withheld documents could reasonably be expected to interfere with the government criminal investigation.see b a.accordingly,we review the district court decisions for clear error.see assembly of,at.under clear error review,we reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court has erred.frazee united states forest,cir quoting wildlife fed united states forest,cir.
foia gives individuals a right of access to government agency documents.the supreme court has interpreted the disclosure provisions of foia broadly,noting that the act was animated by a philosophy of full agency disclosure.john doe agency john doe,d see also dep t of the air force rose,d disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of the act.in order to prevent disclosure of a limited class of sensitive government documents,foia lists nine statutory exemptions.b.unlike the disclosure provisions of foia,its statutory exemptions must be narrowly construed.john doe agency,at.where the government withholds documents pursuant to one of the enumerated exemptions of foia,the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.a b.
a.the trade secrets exemption 
usda withheld the line check sheets of lion competitors pursuant to the trade secrets exemption.see b.the trade secrets exemption allows government agencies to withhold documents that contain commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.id.information is confidential for the purposes of the trade secrets exemption where disclosure of that information could cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.micro defense logistics agency,cir citing parks conservation ass morton.the government need not show that releasing the documents would cause actual competitive harm.micro,at.rather,the government need only show that there is actual competition in the relevant market,and a likelihood of substantial competitive injury if the information were released.id.
we must first determine whether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its decision.courts can rely solely on government affidavits so long as the affiants are knowledgeable about the information sought and the affidavits are detailed enough to allow the court to make an independent assessment of the government claim.church of scientology,at if the agency supplies a reasonably detailed affidavit describing the document and facts sufficient to establish an exemption,then the district court need look no further in determining whether an exemption applies.district courts have discretion to order in camera inspection of the actual documents the government wishes to withhold.a b.in camera inspection of documents is disfavored,however,where the government sustains its burden of proof by way of its testimony or affidavits.lewis irs,cir.
in support of its claim to the trade secrets exemption,usda submitted blank line check sheet forms and two declarations from trykowski.lion disputes trykowski expertise in the area of raisin marketing and competition and contends that his declaration consists of utter legal conclusions.but according to his declaration,trykowski position as senior compliance officer for ams,a position that he has held for over eight years,has made him very familiar with the raisin marketing order that governs lion,and put him in almost daily contact with raisin graders and supervisors.trykowski experience lends considerable weight to his testimony.more importantly,trykowski conclusions are supported by detailed and specific descriptions of each category of information included on the line check sheets and the ways in which each category of information could be turned to lion competitive advantage.see bowen food drug,cir holding that affidavits that described documents withheld,the statutory exemptions claimed,and the specific reasons for the agency withholding provided adequate factual basis for application of trade secrets exemption.lion does not advocate in camera review of the withheld line check sheets indeed,nothing could have been gained by reviewing the withheld line check sheets in camera because there is no dispute as to the type of information contained in the line check sheets.harvey wagon wheel,nlrb,cir holding that in camera inspection is not required where no factual dispute exists as to the nature of the statements sought.because trykowski declarations identify the documents sought and the exemptions claimed,and they specify the competitive harm that usda fears would be caused by release of the requested documents,the district court had an adequate factual basis to decide whether the trade secrets exemption applied.
next we must decide whether the district court clearly erred in determining that lion competitors line check sheets fell within the trade secrets exemption to foia.the parties agree that there is actual competition in the relevant market.as trykowski points out,prices for raisins are at a low and bids for raisin contracts can succeed or fail on margins of less than one cent per pound.the parties disagree,however,as to whether releasing the line check sheets would cause substantial competitive harm to lion competitors.
in micro,the plaintiff sought information from a government agency regarding several large defense contractors compliance with the minority contracting provisions of the small business act at.the documents sought for each contractor included forms showing the total dollar value of all subcontracts and the percentage of those amounts that went to businesses.id.the documents did not show the subject matter of any of the contracts,nor did they show how many subcontracts each contractor had,how the subcontracts were distributed,or to whom they were awarded.id.nonetheless,the government argued that disclosing the documents would cause competitive harm because they would provide competitors with a roadmap of the corporations subcontracting plans and strategies.id.at.we held that the trade secrets exemption did not apply and compelled disclosure of the documents because t he data were made up of too many fluctuating variables for competitors to gain any advantage id.at.
as in micro,lion contends that the information it seeks from the line check sheets would not allow it to infer confidential information about its competitors because significant variables would be redacted usda contends,however,that revealing even the limited information lion seeks would allow lion to infer critical information about its competitors volume,market share,and marketing strategy.the district court gave credence to usda position and held that releasing the documents would cause substantial competitive harm.
we can not conclude that the district court decision was clearly erroneous.at minimum,producing the line check sheets of lion competitors would reveal the type of raisins lion competitors produced at the time of the inspection at issue because the format for line check sheets is distinct depending on the type of raisin inspected.thus,unlike the documents sought in micro,in which the subject matter of the government contracts was obscured,see at,the line check sheets identify the exact type of raisins sold.moreover,revealing the sampling time information from the line check sheets would allow lion to infer the volume of its competitors raisin sales because raisin packers work irregular hours when they have a high volume of business.with knowledge of the hours its competitors worked,lion could deduce whether its competitors were producing a high volume of a particular type of raisin at the time of a given inspection.finally,the remarks column of the line check sheets typically includes information,such as container size and inspection certificate numbers,from which the identity of the packer being inspected could be inferred.lion could use information from the line check sheets to its advantage by cutting its prices for the types of raisins its competitors pack in large volumes in order to underbid them.see id.at gulf indus.united states,holding that information that would permit competitors to estimate and undercut bids causes substantial competitive harm.therefore,the district court application of the trade secrets exemption to lion competitors line check sheets was not clearly erroneous.
b.the law enforcement exemption 
the district court determined that the originals of lion line check sheets and the ams and oig investigative reports fell within the law enforcement exemption to foia.see b a.the law enforcement exemption allows the government to withhold records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.id.in order to withhold documents pursuant to the law enforcement exemption,usda must establish that it is a law enforcement agency,that the withheld documents were investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,and that disclosure of those documents would interfere with pending enforcement proceedings.lewis,at.information need not have been originally compiled for law enforcement purposes in order to qualify for the law enforcement exemption,so long as it was compiled for law enforcement purposes at the time the foia request was made.john doe agency,at.
the sole evidence submitted in support of usda claim under the law enforcement exemption was a declaration filed under seal by an assistant united states attorney.after reviewing the sealed declaration in camera,the district court ruled in favor of usda.the district court did not elucidate its reasoning it stated only that b ased on the information disclosed in the declaration filed under seal the law enforcement exemption was properly invoked in this case.usda did not brief the law enforcement exemption issue on appeal,nor was it prepared to discuss it at oral argument,because its counsel had never seen the sealed document and did not know the reasons for withholding the documents lion vehemently opposed the court reliance on in camera review of the sealed declaration as the sole basis for its decision.although lion frames its opposition as a due process challenge,its arguments are cognizable as an attack on the factual basis for the court decision.see wiener,at.
courts are permitted to rule on summary judgment in foia cases solely on the basis of government affidavits describing the documents sought.church of scientology,at.ordinarily,the government must submit detailed public affidavits identifying the documents withheld,the foia exemptions claimed,and a particularized explanation of why each document falls within the claimed exemption.wiener,at.this submission is commonly referred to as a vaughn index.see vaughn rosen.because the court and the plaintiff do not have the opportunity to view the documents themselves,the submission must be detailed enough for the district court to make a de novo assessment of the government claim of exemption.maricopa audubon soc y united states forest,cir.
under certain limited circumstances,we have endorsed the use of in camera review of government affidavits as the basis for foia decisions.in doyle,the plaintiff requested all fbi documents that pertained to him,but the fbi withheld the documents pursuant to several foia exemptions.at.the district court ordered the fbi to submit public affidavits justifying,itemizing,and indexing the withheld documents.id.upon reviewing the documents,the district court determined that the submitted affidavits were too vague.the fbi then submitted more detailed affidavits for in camera review.id.based on its in camera review of the new affidavits,the district court granted summary judgment for the fbi.id.we affirmed,holding that in camera review is justified where the government public description of a document and the reasons for exemption may reveal the very information that the government claims is exempt from disclosure.id.at.we noted,however,that a district court may rely solely on ex parte affidavits only in the exceptional case and only after the government has submitted as detailed public affidavits and testimony as possible.id.
likewise,in wiener,the fbi submitted affidavits supporting its withholding of documents pursuant to various foia exemptions but the affidavits justified withholding only in general terms.at.the district court ordered that a vaughn index be composed,but that it be submitted for in camera review.id.pursuant to the court order,the fbi submitted two additional affidavits and copies of the documents withheld.id.based on the materials submitted for in camera review the district court granted summary judgment for the fbi.id.we reversed,holding that the court lacked an adequate factual basis for its decision because it failed to require that the fbi submit more detailed information in the form of public affidavits before resorting to in camera review.id.at.we reasoned that the district court was deprived of the benefit of informed advocacy to draw its attention to the weaknesses in the withholding agency arguments.without notice of the facts and arguments supporting the government position,the plaintiff had little or no opportunity to argue for release of particular documents.id.therefore,as in doyle,we held that resort to in camera review is appropriate only after the government has submitted as much detail in the form of public affidavits and testimony as possible.id.at.
in this case,usda submitted no public affidavits justifying the application of the b a exemption to either the line check sheets or the investigative reports.rather,the united states attorney submitted its declaration to the court directly,under seal,in lieu of a public affidavit.usda cites four cases in support of its approach,but none supports its position.ray turner,deals only with the presumption of validity that applies when the government withholds documents under the national security exemption it has no significance to this case.id.at.murphy fbi,permitted the use of in camera affidavits in order to supplement prior public affidavits that were too general.id.at.john doe agency mentioned the district court use of in camera materials,but it does not condone the use of in camera affidavits as the sole factual basis for a district court decision.at.lewis concerned in camera inspection of the withheld documents themselves,not the government affidavit in support of withholding.at.
none of the cases cited by the government justifies the district court reliance on in camera review of a sealed declaration as a substitute for docketed public declarations,and we decline to endorse the approach here.requiring as detailed public disclosure as possible of the government reasons for withholding documents under a foia exemption is necessary to restore,to the extent possible,a traditional adversarial proceeding by giving the party seeking the documents a meaningful opportunity to oppose the government claim of exemption.wiener,at.the district court reliance on in camera review as a substitute for public affidavits deprived both the district court and this court of the informed advocacy upon which the fairness of adversary proceedings depends because the district court failed to require that the government submit as much information as possible in the form of public declarations before relying on in camera rev
