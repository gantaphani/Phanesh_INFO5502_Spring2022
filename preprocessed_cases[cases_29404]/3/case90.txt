rodalton hart rodalton appeals his conviction by a jury for violations of and b b b b.we conclude that the united states the government summary witness did far more than summarize evidence,and that,when the summary witness testimony and accompanying documentary evidence is redacted,the remaining evidence is insufficient to prove the government case against rodalton beyond a reasonable doubt.we therefore reverse rodalton conviction,vacate his sentence,and remand the case for a new trial.
facts and proceedings 
rodalton has been a resident and family farmer in holmes county,mississippi for most of his life.after his graduation from jacksonville state university in,he returned to holmes county to help his father run the family farm.in addition to helping his father,rodalton started his own farm,gradually expanding his operation from thirteen row crops and raising several thousand acres by the.his success in farming was among the factors that led mike espy,who was secretary of agriculture at the time,to appoint rodalton as one of espy advisors.
in,rodalton and his brothers,who were also involved in farming,formed five separate partnerships,hoping to run their farming operations more efficiently by sharing labor,land,and equipment,and thereby maximize their income.among the partnerships were r c farms rodalton and his wife,carmella,and c d farms cleveland hart and chester hart,with cleveland and rodalton serving as the local business contacts for the partnership.another hart brother,larry,farmed individually,but he and rodalton served together as the business contacts for larry hart farming operation.
after problems in and,rodalton and carmella were declared eligible for federal disaster relief and an emergency loan.rodalton applied to the united states department of agriculture,farm service agency fsa or the agency for such assistance but the application was denied.when he looked into this matter,rodalton discovered that his fsa file had been transferred to the office of the inspector general of the department of agriculture,in connection with that office investigation of secretary espy.without the file,the fsa could not process hart application.rodalton traveled to washington,to meet with federal officials,congressmen,and senate staff members in an effort to have his loan processed,but by the time anything could be done to remedy the situation,the crop year had passed.
without the loans,the hart brothers partnerships needed financial assistance in and.accordingly,they submitted applications to the fsa in both years,including disclosure to the fsa of the partnerships debts,liabilities,and projections of income,operations,and expenses.for the applications in question,the process of disclosing and assessing the financial data required several months of work between the harts and the local fsa agent who worked closely with them,orlando kilcrease.rodalton signed the applications on behalf of r c farms,c d farms,and larry hart,certifying the following 
the above information is furnished for the sole purpose of securing and maintaining credits sic and is certified to be complete and correct.the undersigned authorizes the fmha to make all inquiries deemed necessary to verify the accuracy of the information contained above to determine my creditworthiness and to answer questions about their credit experience with me.i agree to notify fmha promptly to sic any material changes to the above.i recognize that making any false statement on this farm and home plan or any other loan document may constitute a violation of criminal law.
from the information disclosed,kilcrease finally created a farm and home plan fhp for each of the various partnerships.a fhp is a computer generated projection that accurately reflects the borrower plan of operation for the production or marketing cycle.its essential purpose is to demonstrate that the farmer applying for the loan expects a positive cash flow for the projected crop year rodalton and his brothers signed the fhps that kilcrease had created,certifying the following 
i agree to follow this plan and to discuss with the county supervisor any important changes that may become necessary.this is a prospective plan and does not release the security interest of the government in any security referred to in this plan.i recognize that making any false statement on this famr sic and home plan or any other loan document may constitute a violation of federal criminal law.
after the and fhps had been submitted,the government began to investigate the hart brothers farming operations.rodalton contends that the government commenced this investigation as retaliation for his failure to provide any useful information to the government in its investigation of mike espy.whatever the government incentive might have been,the investigation into the hart brothers farming operations culminated in a grand jury indictment,in which rodalton and two of his brothers,cleveland and larry,were charged with engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the government and making false statements to the government in the and fhps.the indictment also charged cleveland hart with disposing of property that had been pledged to the fsa,and charged rodalton with bribing an fsa official 
after a trial,a jury found the three brothers not guilty of the conspiracy charge,and also found larry and cleveland hart not guilty of all other charges against them.the jury found rodalton guilty,however,of knowingly making material false statements to the fsa in and for the purpose of influencing the grant of loans,in violation of and of corruptly giving to a public official neal with the intent to influence the official to commit fraud on the united the form of approving operating loans to the hart brothers violation of b b.rodalton timely appealed his conviction and sentence.

discussion 
rodalton contends that the district court abused its discretion when it allowed a government witness,shelly davis,to testify as a summary witness pursuant to federal rule of evidence fre,and to present,as a summary,some fhps that she had prepared.we agree with hart,and therefore reverse the judgment against him.
fre provides 
rule.summaries 
the contents of voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs which can not conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart,summary,or calculation.the originals,or duplicates,shall be made available for examination or copying,or both,by other parties at reasonable time and place.the court may order that they be produced in court.
recognizing the powerful impression which charts can make upon a jury,vesting the charts with an air of credibility independent of the evidence purported to be summarized,we have repeatedly cautioned that trial judges must carefully handle their preparation and use.not only must such writings,recordings,or photographs be so voluminous that they can not be conveniently examined in court,as the rule specifies,but there must be supporting evidence that has been presented previously to the jury to establish any assumptions reflected in the summary 
in its case against the harts,the government presented davis,an employee of the fsa,to introduce revised fhps that she had prepared,and to offer testimony about the revised plans.according to the government,davis revised fhps did nothing more than illustrate what the result would have been if all of the debts testified to by the government witnesses had been included on the harts actual fhps.
hart objected to the government strategy from the outset,pointing out that the government had failed to designate davis or anyone else as an expert witness,and that the government was attempting to prove essential elements of its case against him through the improper use of fre.in particular,hart complained that the government had only presented evidence through its previous witnesses to show the hart brothers liability for debts that were not included on the original fhps.as rodalton argues in his appellate brief,
prior to the testimony of shelly davis,the government failed to present any evidence whatsoever that the debts davis included in her five separate summaries which were five farm and home plan forms should actually have been reported in the categories she selected,should even have been reported in the five farm and home plans at all,or even the proper amounts of such debts that should or should not have been reported on the farm and home plans.emphasis added.
rodalton advanced this argument prior to davis testimony,in an in camera conference,as well 
the government has to put proof in.your honor,if i may just go through the trial at this point.they called witnesses to say,i did the farm and home plan.this is the farm and home plan.one witness says,i did something wrong.then they called witnesses to put in debts that they say that they owed.
they have not called any witnesses to establish that those debts are debts that should have been put on the farm and home plan.they have not established the underlying proof that that is the case.
they have not established can show debts out the kazoo.the issue is should they be on the farm and home plan.they have not established that.
if they had established that a debt should be on a farm and home plan,allowed that testimony through a witness to which we could sic,then,your honor,a summary witness to put it on a farm and home plan or to do whatever,i would object.but they have have they want to summarize all the debts they put in on a chart,that fine but they going beyond that,your honor.
they have not established that these are debts that should have been reported on a farm and home plan through any witness,through the witnesses who did the farm and home plan,through the fsa officers who worked there,through expert testimony as in the tannehill case.
by not requiring them to prove that the debts themselves are debts that should be reported,allowing them to simply call a witness to put them into a category without knowledge,not an expert prejudices us,and it goes beyond a summary witness,your honor.
this they trying to prove through these summary charts is this is where they belong without offering any proof that they belong there.
our meticulous review of the record convinces us that there is merit to rodalton contentions on the issue of improper use of the purported summary witness.reading davis testimony under direct and cross examination,it becomes abundantly clear that the proper preparation of a fhp is anything but a simple and straightforward exercise.surveying the government case as a whole,moreover,the total absence of any independent testimony to support davis assumptions in preparing the fhps becomes palpable.in short,it is apparent to us that davis functioned as the government sole expert witness regarding the proper preparation of fhps generally,and the hart brothers fhps in particular,thereby unquestionably exceeding the scope of fre.
davis testimony reveals the extreme complexity of the fhp preparation process.with respect to plan preparation,there were two separate sources of confusion with which the jury had to grapple,and for which the jury was forced to rely solely on davis summary presentation to resolve.the first was the somewhat mechanical issue of determining what debts,and what percentage of those debts,should be included on the fhp according to the relevant regulations.
the second source of potential jury confusion derived from the fact that the harts original fhps were drawn up by local county fsa agents with the objective of assisting farmers,based not only on all of the submitted paperwork,but on the particular local agents interactions with the harts and their creditors,and real time judgment calls.in stark contrast,davis summary fhps were created specifically in preparation for government prosecution of the harts,relying solely on the contents of the paper files which she construed in a light most favorable to the prosecution and thus least favorable to the harts.this latter source of confusion would have been acceptable being a question of bias and credibility,which the jury is well equipped to address,had the government properly eliminated the the jury about the mechanics of preparing fhps under the relevant independent proof prior to davis testimony,as required by fre.this the government failed to do,and therein lies the genesis of reversible error in this case.
the government insists repeatedly in its appellate brief that the fsa agent who originally prepared the hart brothers fhps testified that all debts of an applicant belong on such a plan.therefore,argues the government,davis inclusion of all of the debts testified to by the government witnesses was based on an assumption that was proved prior to the presentation of her summary.we disagree.the blanket statement that all debts must be included on the fhp was a woefully inadequate guideline for answering the particular questions that confronted the jury concerning the proper preparation of a fhp.instead,the jurors were forced to rely solely on davis interpretation of the scope of all debts and on her proffered expertise in drawing up fhps when the jury was deliberating about myriad bewildering problems,including,without limitation if four brothers in partnership relation to one another are liable for a debt,the annual debt service payment on which totals,must each brother include the full on his fhp in a column headed,amount due this year should current crop year expenses incurred before signing a fhp into effect in july,in the middle of the crop year be recorded as a projected expense,a current operating expense,or a current farm liability and if a fhp lists a credit card bill in the farmer wife name,and the farmer list of living expenses accounts for his expenses and those of his family,is it proper also to include the income of the farmer wife we are constrained to explain that these few examples scarcely convey the overarching and pervasive confusion and complexity that emanate from those extensive portions of the trial transcript touching on questions of proper fhp preparation.
the point we make is not whether davis interpretation and application of the regulations were correct or whether her reconstructed fhps for the harts were correctly prepared.rather,our point is to address the core problem of the government failure to adduce any lay the necessary predicate prior to davis presentation of the summary support of the many assumptions and conclusions that davis drew when preparing her versions of the proper fhps.under the guise of a summary presentation,the government introduced its sole witness who could explain to the jury the proper preparation of fhps.even the district court appears to have developed a reliance on davis interpretation as the trial wore on.prior to her testimony,in the same in camera conference from which hart argument is above excerpted,the district court correctly observed,
here i am concerned about the issue that is raised that,apparently,she would testify that this is the proper way to prepare this farm and home plan from these.and i do know that that a summary witness.that sounds more like an expert witness.
it does bother this is related to a discussion we had earlier in an argument that sweet just made that we do know whether this information is material.we do know what a proper way to put together a farm and home plan is.we do we 
i know you got a materiality issue that court sic has reached,but it seems to me that the government has got t
