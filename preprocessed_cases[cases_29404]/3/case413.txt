kyle fellhoelter petitions for review of a decision of the merit systems protection board affirming his removal from a supervisory position with the united states department of agriculture usda.we affirm.
fellhoelter was an audit manager in a usda office in knoxville,tennessee.he worked in the federal milk marketing program,a usda program designed to stabilize conditions in the market for dairy products and to prevent regional shortages in the supply of milk.fellhoelter was charged with supervising a small staff of field auditors who periodically examined the sales,production,and inventory of milk handlers in a region encompassing tennessee and seven nearby states.
in,fellhoelter grew concerned that two regulated milk products llc valley milk and maryland virginia milk producers cooperative association,milk were misrepresenting the grade of milk they had processed,paying less than the regulated purchase price for raw milk,and claiming credit for milk supplied by other companies.fellhoelter reported his suspicions to harold friedly,market administrator for the appalachian region,and william newell,chief of the order operations branch in the dairy programs division of the usda.friedly and newell acknowledged that little was wrong with most of the basic facts alleged by fellhoelter,but they drew a different conclusion from those facts.they determined that the practices identified by fellhoelter were consistent with federal milk marketing regulations and that any remedial action,if appropriate,was outside the scope of the usda limited regulatory authority in the area.friedly urged fellhoelter not to take any further action,particularly since many of the documents that formed the basis for fellhoelter allegations contained confidential and proprietary information protected by statute.
dissatisfied with management response,fellhoelter began pursuing other avenues to address what he perceived to be fraudulent conduct.in may,fellhoelter filed a report with the usda office of inspector general.in that report,he described the allegedly fraudulent practices of valley milk and milk,and he also alleged fraud and mismanagement by friedly.the office of inspector general subsequently declined to initiate an enforcement proceeding,finding that newell had adequately addressed fellhoelter allegations.on july,fellhoelter brought a qui tam action against valley milk,milk,and the usda in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee.the complaint incorporated much of the substance of fellhoelter earlier report to the office of inspector general.in addition,it included a claim of unlawful retaliation under the whistleblower protection act wpa.the qui tam action was later dismissed for violations of the sealing provisions of the false claims act and for failure to allege a claim involving the payment of government funds.
in,while the qui tam action was pending before the district court,friedly recommended closing the knoxville office and consolidating the regional auditing group in the regional headquarters in louisville,kentucky.friedly explained to his superiors that the dairy industry was in the process of eliminating regional production facilities and that t he work performed by the audit group in the knoxville field office had changed with the work moving away from knoxville.on december,the secretary of agriculture approved the recommendation to close the knoxville office.rather than implementing a reduction in force,friedly offered many of the knoxville employees,including fellhoelter,reassignment to the louisville office on the same terms and conditions as their current employment.fellhoelter declined the reassignment and was therefore removed from his position as of april.
fellhoelter appealed the removal action to the merit systems protection board,claiming that the usda had closed the knoxville office in retaliation for his whistleblowing activities.the administrative judge who was assigned to the case directed the parties to conduct discovery in accordance with the procedures set forth at.two weeks after receiving the government responses to his initial discovery requests,fellhoelter moved for an order compelling the production of documents that pertained to his supervisors alleged threats of reprisal against him.the administrative judge denied that motion as untimely and,in the alternative,as lacking merit.following discovery,the administrative judge decided to reverse the normal order of proof in whistleblowing cases by holding a hearing on the usda affirmative defense that the knoxville office would have been closed and fellhoelter reassigned even in the absence of any protected disclosures.
at the conclusion of that hearing,the administrative judge found that the knoxville office would have been closed regardless of fellhoelter whistleblowing activity and therefore upheld the usda removal decision.the administrative judge found that the agency had a strong basis for its decision to close the knoxville office.the evidence,the administrative judge concluded,showed that office closures in the dairy program were relatively frequent and dependent to a great extent on the financial resources and expenditures available in a given location.the administrative judge found that the agency had shown the existence of a deteriorating financial situation that was solved by a reduction in expenditures through the consolidation of offices,and that at the centralized location in louisville the agency had access to more support facilities and better office space,which would facilitate more efficient audit work.
the full board denied review of the administrative judge decision.fellhoelter now petitions for review by this court.
fellhoelter does not disagree that substantial evidence in the record supports the administrative judge ultimate conclusion that the usda would have directed his reassignment from knoxville to louisville even in the absence of his whistleblowing activity.rather,fellhoelter principal contention is that the record for decision was incomplete because the administrative judge erroneously precluded the admission of evidence pertaining to friedly motive to retaliate against him because of his protected disclosures.fellhoelter challenges approximately evidentiary rulings,all of which he characterizes as precluding evidence of friedly motive to retaliate.the collective effect of those evidentiary rulings,fellhoelter argues,was to deprive him of a meaningful opportunity to present his claim that the knoxville office was closed in retaliation for his disclosures.fellhoelter therefore seeks a new hearing at which he can complete the record with evidence excluded by the administrative judge.
the wpa prohibits any federal agency from taking,failing to take,or threatening to take or fail to take,any personnel action because of the disclosure of information by an employee or applicant for employment that the employee or applicant reasonably believes to be evidence of a violation of law,rule,or regulation,gross mismanagement or a waste of funds,or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.b.in order to make out a prima facie case under the wpa,the employee or applicant must establish that he made a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in an adverse action against him.e.if the employee or applicant makes out a prima facie whistleblower claim,the agency is given an opportunity to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure.e see also marano dep t of justice.
in determining whether the agency would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure,the board considers the following three factors the strength of the agency evidence in support of its personnel action the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision and any evidence that the agency takes or has taken similar actions against similarly situated employees who are not whistleblowers.see geyer dep t of justice,aff,see also carr soc.sec,approving the geyer factors.because the wpa does not mandate any particular sequence for trying the elements of a whistleblower case,we have tacitly approved of the board practice,in appropriate cases,of first addressing the agency affirmative defense and then,if necessary,turning to the question whether the petitioner has made out a prima facie whistleblower claim.see clark dep t of the army,see also kalil dep t of,greenspan dep t of veterans affairs.
in this case,the administrative judge decided it would be most efficient to hear evidence as to the agency affirmative defense first and then,if necessary,to hear evidence as to the other elements of the claim.because the administrative judge limited the hearing to the agency affirmative defense,he repeatedly sustained the government objections to the introduction of evidence going to whether there was a prima facie case of whistleblowing.
the factual dispute between the parties centered on whether fellhoelter supervisors would have closed the knoxville office despite his whistleblowing activity.one of the factors for the administrative judge to consider in ruling on the government affirmative defense is the strength of any retaliatory motive on the part of the officials who were involved in the decision in question.see carr,at.because direct evidence of a deciding official retaliatory motive is rare,petitioners are entitled to rely on circumstantial evidence giving rise to an inference of impermissible intent.see webster dep t of army,see also sheehan dep t of navy.in some cases,evidence of retaliatory motive is also relevant to the petitioner prima facie case for example,evidence of an employee assertions of misconduct by a supervisor can be relevant to whether the employee has made a protected disclosure and also whether the supervisor has a strong motivation to retaliate.
fellhoelter argues that the administrative judge improperly rejected all evidence going to the reasonableness of his belief in the mismanagement of the milk order in his view,even though that evidence was relevant to his prima facie case,it also tended to undermine the government affirmative defense and therefore should have been admitted.we agree with fellhoelter that the administrative judge was not free to disregard particular evidence that was relevant to a material issue merely because it was also relevant to a separate issue that was not contested at the hearing.thus,it would have been improper for the administrative judge to exclude evidence solely on the ground that it related to the reasonableness of fellhoelter belief in the mismanagement of the milk order.however,fellhoelter has not identified any exclusion of evidence that was predicated on that rationale.as we discuss in detail below,with respect to many of the evidentiary rulings at issue in this case the administrative judge exercised sound discretion by excluding evidence on the grounds that it was nonprobative,cumulative,or likely to unduly delay the proceedings.with respect to other rulings,we conclude that the exclusion of evidence,even if erroneous,was not prejudicial and thus does not warrant a remand for a new hearing.
fellhoelter contends that the administrative judge erroneously excluded evidence of friedly knowledge that valley milk practices were fraudulent.during the hearing,the government objected to the introduction of testimony about how fellhoelter first learned of the alleged fraud.counsel for fellhoelter argued that her questioning would be directed to the documentation that fellhoelter provided to friedly and when he provided it,and how it was obtained.fellhoelter characterizes the administrative judge rejection of that rationale as a refusal to hear evidence of friedly knowledge that the law had been violated.
while fellhoelter investigation into the alleged fraud may have been relevant to the reasonableness of his disclosure,we agree with the administrative judge that the evidence was not relevant to the government affirmative defense.in particular,we disagree with counsel suggestion that friedly general awareness of the regulated entities conduct necessarily gave rise to an inference that he knew the conduct was unlawful.friedly and the usda never disavowed knowledge of fellhoelter reports instead,they maintained throughout that the reported activities either were not unlawful or were outside the jurisdiction of the usda.because fellhoelter did not purport to introduce evidence that friedly stated position was contrary to his subjective beliefs,we sustain the administrative judge ruling on the ground that the testimony in question was not probative of the factual issues to be resolved at the hearing.
fellhoelter next complains that the administrative judge denied him the opportunity to submit documentation of friedly involvement in the fraud.at the hearing,the administrative judge declined to hear testimony concerning fellhoelter efforts to collect certain documents from valley milk that were later used to support his allegations of fraud.on appeal,fellhoelter characterizes that decision as an exclusion of documents inculpating friedly in the fraud.
the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling that the documentation of valley milk practices was not particularly relevant to whether the knoxville office would have been closed in the absence of fellhoelter protected disclosures.while any documents that evidenced friedly involvement in the alleged fraud would have been highly material to that issue,fellhoelter has never suggested that any of the proffered materials would have revealed friedly complicity or that the testifying witness had personal knowledge of the incriminating nature of the documents.we therefore uphold the administrative judge ruling excluding evidence of fellhoelter investigation into the alleged fraud.
fellhoelter also challenges the exclusion of testimony that friedly personally authorized the practices adopted by valley milk and milk.rick holt,an audit manager with the usda,was asked at the hearing whether the president of valley milk had admitted paying less than the regulatory price for received milk.that question drew a relevance objection from the government.counsel for fellhoelter responded that she would establish friedly approval of valley milk practices through an affidavit filed by valley milk president in the qui tam action before the district court.fellhoelter argues that the administrative judge decision to sustain the objection should be understood as precluding holt from testifying that friedly had personally approved the illegal practices of valley milk.
proof that valley milk engaged in practices that fellhoelter considered illegal would have been probative of the reasonableness of fellhoelter belief in the existence of a fraud.however,that evidence was only tangentially related to the question whether the consolidation of the knoxville and louisville office was inevitable.moreover,there was no evidence that holt had personal knowledge of either the existence of the affidavit or the conversation in which friedly allegedly assured valley milk executives that their practices were legal.thus,we find no error in the administrative judge decision with respect to the question posed to holt.
fellhoelter next argues that the administrative judge improperly excluded evidence that friedly had retaliated against michael baker,another knoxville office employee who had made similar allegations against valley milk and milk.according to fellhoelter,friedly reaction to the disclosures by another employee would have provided invaluable insight into his motivation for closing the knoxville office.
the relevance of that evidence,however,turned on the nature of baker disclosures,which was not apparent from the record,as the administrative judge noted.moreover,baker failed to appear at the hearing.although the administrative judge issued a subpoena to compel his appearance,the record does not reflect that fellhoelter effected service of that subpoena.given the unavailability of baker,the administrative judge did not err in concluding that developing a full picture of baker experience in the knoxvil
