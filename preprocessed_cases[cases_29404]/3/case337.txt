background 
plight of the small farmer in america 
every branch of the federal government has recognized how difficult it is for small farmers to make a living by farming see william clinton,state of the union address of january,reprinted in,wl,d roughts,floods,and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the family farmers.res,cong.joint proclamation of small family farm week stating the plight of the small family farmer has been in jeopardy in recent times and many small family farms continue to operate in the face of financial and credit difficulties mulroy block,i n a time when this nation is experiencing the decline and threatened extinction of the individual farmer,it is particularly disturbing to see legislation such as this which will undoubtedly have a devastating effect on the small scale dairy farmers of this nation.in re moeller,wl,at cir,appellants made spirited arguments before this court regarding the plight of family farmers who have successfully farmed the same land for generations.we sympathize with their concerns.in a similar case from,we acknowledged our awareness of the serious plight of the family farmer in america.we sympathize with farmers struggling to secure their livelihoods and,more fundamentally perhaps,maintain their way of life.schroder volcker,cir a report from the united states department of agriculture demonstrates that,more than a decade after schroder,times are still hard for small farmers in america today,we have fewer farmers than in,and farmers are receiving percent less for every consumer dollar.four firms now control over percent of the beef market.about percent of the nation farms are small farms,but they receive only percent of all farm receipts.nat.comm on small farms,dep t of,a time to act a report of the usda national commission on small farms,at.
we remain sympathetic to the plight of the small farmer,but we also remain in agreement with the judgment of both the district court in this case and the schroder court thirteen years ago w e believe the issues raised by plaintiffs in this suit are basically political questions which must be resolved in the legislative arena.schroder,at 
relief sought by appellants 
schroder from campo,colorado edwin petrowsky from pratt,kansas russell grider from clovis,new mexico and wesley myers from clovis,new a moratorium on farm foreclosures and an order requiring the president,secretary of the treasury,secretary of agriculture,and their agents to control united states currency and to maintain market conditions so as to be favorable to american farmers.they admitted that controlling currency and maintaining favorable market conditions would require congressional or judicial review of agricultural product and marketing controls,bilateral trade agreements that affect agriculture,the activities of the exchange stabilization fund,and enforcement of the laws by the department of justice with respect to corporate competitors of family farmers they sought a permanent injunction requiring the secretary of the treasury and the trade representative of the president to work together and cooperate in negotiating and implementing foreign trade agreements that would benefit small farmers.
appellants alleged that a national emergency in agriculture was declared on may,and has yet to be terminated years later,and requested a declaratory judgment that the state of national emergency declared by congressional statute in still exists.they also demanded declaratory judgments that agricultural commodity prices shall be allowed as an affirmative defense in any action for debt and that the event of the commonly quoted dollar index rising above shall be allowed as an affirmative defense or as a basis for a stay of proceedings for foreclosure against any individual,u.farmer.
last,they contended the federal government has effected a taking without paying just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment.
discussion 
a.the political question doctrine 
after reviewing appellants prayer for relief,we are convinced that the district court was correct to dismiss appellants claims as nonjusticiable political questions.since it is a legal question,we review de novo the application of the political question doctrine.see stuart united states,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states stuart,d.
prudence,as well as concerns,counsels courts to decline to hear political questions.see baker carr,d nixon united states,d souter,concurring in the judgment alexander bickel,the least dangerous branch,ed when deciding whether issues present political questions,courts must make a discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case,for it resists resolution by any semantic cataloguing.baker,at.as there is no blanket rule,id.at,application of the doctrine must be made on a basis,id.at.
the tangled roots of the political question doctrine stretch back to marbury madison,cranch.see id.at questions,in their nature political,or which are,by the constitution and laws,submitted to the executive,can never be made in this court.see also generally id.at.the most thorough explication of the doctrine was provided in baker carr,in which the supreme court gathered the doctrine analytical threads.at.it wrote,in this passage,
prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
we have no doubt that this case presents textbook examples of political questions and thus that it was properly dismissed by the district court.the constitution commits to congress the regulation of domestic and foreign commerce,see const.art.i,cl,the establishment of bankruptcy law,see id.cl,and the regulation of currency,see id.cl.to the president,the constitution commits the power,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to make treaties.const.art.ii,cl.the constitution confers a vast amount of power upon the political branches of the federal government in the area of foreign foreign commerce.made in the usa foundation united states,cir gathering constitutional provisions and supreme court cases.the supreme court has recognized that the president alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation.he makes treaties with the advice and consent of the senate but he alone negotiates.united states export.while the treaty power of the executive expressly involves the participation of the legislature,nowhere does the constitution contemplate the participation by the thir
