ii.plaintiff case 
a.the private road 
the road upon which the accident occurred is a private road that crosses pasture owned by defendants,as well as land owned by other parties.the road provides ingress and egress to a cluster of landlocked houses,including a house belonging to jackly bentley plaintiff aunt and her husband.about eight family dwellings are serviced by the road,which is classified as an easement where it passes through defendants property.the easement itself is owned by the bentley family and the dolcini family.the private road lies off chileno valley road,which is a public road.there is a cattle guard that marks where the public road meets the private road.
the distance from chileno valley road to the start of defendants property along the private road is about a.the road initially crosses the pasture owned by the dolcini family.here,the road is comprised of dirt and gravel.the dolcini property is also used as cow pasture and there has never been a fence on either side of the private road.at this point,the surrounding land is mostly open pasture.as the road continues,it meets another cattle guard marking the entrance to defendants property.the distance between this cattle guard and the bentley home is about a.the road through defendants portion of the land is paved.as the road passes through defendants property,trees become more prevalent.
plaintiff testimony 
plaintiff was years old at the time of trial and had been acquainted with the entire ranch land since the age of five.alex bentley is his uncle.the bentleys own about acres of land in this ranch property.plaintiff has traveled down the private road thousands of times and had driven a motorcycle down the road at various times over the past years.
on the date of the accident,plaintiff was riding his triumph tiger motorcycle on his way to visit the bentleys at their home.upon turning off chileno valley road onto the private road,he maintained a speed of to miles per hour over the gravel and dirt portion of the road.the dolcini have posted a speed limit sign here of miles per hour.plaintiff testified that on the day of the accident he might have accelerated up to to miles per hour upon reaching the paved portion of the road that runs through defendants land.initially,he observed several cows about yards in front of him standing off to his right.at some point,the road passes through an area having a barbed wire fence that goes down to a creek.there is also a telephone pole in the vicinity.just past this point he saw a black cow off in the shadows about yards to his left.
as he approached,plaintiff noticed the cow starting to move towards him.he began slowing down as she started running towards the road.he thought she was probably just going to try to run across the road.as he got closer,he saw that she was coming right at him and he applied his brakes.she put her head down and crashed into his gas tank and his shoulder.he was thrown over the handle bars and landed on his left shoulder.the bike was lifted in the air and dropped on its left side,after which it slid sideways down the road.the motorcycle was a total loss.plaintiff suffered injury to his shoulder,which eventually required surgery.
erland stenberg 
erland stenberg testified that his petaluma ranch consists of approximately acres.he breeds cows on the ranch and sells about to calves a year.stenberg was born and grew up on a ranch in north dakota.he lived on the ranch until he left home to go to college.his family raised hereford cattle and farmed grain.his wife maryann also grew up on a ranch.at the time of the accident,he had around angus cows and one bull.most of the cows were ones he had raised from calves.he started his herd from nine cows that he bought in the fall of.he and his wife operate the ranch themselves.stenberg testified that angus cattle are not considered to be the most aggressive breed of beef cattle.
the cow named annie was born in.stenberg testified that his cows were gentle,such that his wife could walk up to almost any of them to pet them and give them apples.however,his wife did state in her deposition that she did not let her young grandchildren walk down the easement road unsupervised because cows can mistake small children for predators such as coyotes or dogs.stenberg testified that there had never been an occasion where his cows had attacked anyone.
when cows are close to calving,the stenbergs move them to the portion of the pasture that is bisected by the private road.at the time of the accident there were probably to cows that had been left to calve on that portion of the pasture.the stenbergs had placed annie in that area as she appeared to be about a week or two away from giving birth.stenberg wife would check the cows at least once a day to see if they had given birth or were just about to do so.
stenberg testified that the bentleys have rights to the private road where it runs through his ranch pursuant to an easement.the bentleys are the dominant tenement of the easement.while the stenbergs own the underlying property,they are the subservient tenement with respect to the easement,therefore,according to stenberg,the bentleys have as much obligation for maintenance of the road as he does.at one point,stenberg did offer to allow the bentleys to construct a fence along the easement provided they contributed money to do so.when he first acquired the property,the entire length of the easement road was dirt and gravel.stenberg spent about to widen the road,put in culverts,and build the grade for the portion of the road that passes through his property.sometime later,alex bentley contributed towards paving the road and another neighbor contributed.stenberg paid the rest.the pasture that this private road goes through is fenced all the way around,including cattle guards placed at the entrance to the property.the cows will cross this road to get from one side to the other to graze.
on the day after the accident stenberg and his wife were moving their cattle and trying to find annie.that night,he had a heart attack and was hospitalized.while he was recuperating,his wife found annie and noted that she had either lost or aborted her calf.his wife also noticed that annie had a limp.late in may,he received telephone calls from plaintiff insurance company telling him that an accident had occurred on chileno valley road involving a vehicle and one of his cows.he informed the caller that he did not live on chileno valley road and that all of his cattle were properly fenced in,a mile back off that road.he turned the matter over to his attorney and hired a private investigator.
marc horrell 
marc horrell is a veterinarian who testified for plaintiff on the issue of the temperament and behavior of cattle.he testified that beef cattle tend to be less docile than dairy cattle.with respect to beef cattle,herefords are generally more docile than angus,and red angus tend to be more docile than the black angus.in contrast,brahman cattle are very high strung.as a veterinarian,horrell does not use any special technique to handle angus cows.he stated that cows who have recently had a calf tend to be much more aggressive than cows without calves,as the mothers tend to be especially protective of newborn calves.he also testified that a pound cow is capable of using its head to butt up against a motorcycle and lift it or knock it over.
on,horrell stated that even within the various breeds,cattle behavior varies from cow to cow and one can see the whole range of behavior from aggressive to mellow in cows of the same breed.angus cow behavior could include running away from the sound of a motorcycle or from a motor vehicle traveling at them at about miles per hour.he also testified that he had never seen the cow that was involved in this accident and therefore did not know whether this particular cow was gentle or not.when cows are behaving aggressively,they will typically use their heads to knock someone over.if a person is standing behind them,they may try to kick him or her with their hind legs.however,they do not typically turn around to kick at a person with their hind legs.
jackly bentley 
jackly bentley,plaintiff aunt,testified that when her adult son was seven years old there were several occasions when he and his friends were accosted by aggressive cows while walking on the easement,to the extent that they would have to either climb a tree,jump over a fence,or use the creek to avoid being confronted by the cows.on the day of the accident,plaintiff arrived at the bentley home and she realized he was injured.later,she went to the scene and photographed the road where the accident had occurred.she also took a photo of the motorcycle.bentley admitted that she and the stenbergs do not like each other.
on,bentley stated that in the year before the accident,members of all the families living on the property had regularly driven motorcycles on the private road across the stenberg land.she conceded it is common knowledge that one might have to avoid cows on the easement,as the road passes through ranch land where cows graze.as far as she was aware,during the past years there had never been any vehicular accident on the private road easement across the stenberg property,apart from the one involving her nephew.on,bentley admitted that she has never offered to pay for the construction of a fence on either side of the easement.
arthur koenig 
arthur koenig testified for plaintiff as an expert regarding accident reconstruction.in his opinion,the accident was caused by a cow colliding with the left side of the motorcycle,hitting the motorcycle and plaintiff body.he had reviewed a report prepared by another expert who opined the motorcycle was traveling at least miles per hour at the time of the collision with the cow.
iii.the motion for nonsuit 
at the close of plaintiff case,defendants moved for nonsuit.the trial court noted that it had been unable to find any legal duty on the part of a landowner to construct a fence in this context,particularly in the absence of any prior event that would have alerted the property owner to the need to undertake such a measure.in arriving at its decision,the court stated the following one can conjure up all manner of extreme measures which might have prevented this particular injury,but that is not the issue in defining duty.the fundamental inquiry is whether the duty of a property owner to exercise reasonable care in preventing injury to persons required such measures.the duty here is one of ordinary care,one of reasonable care.this standard is necessarily incompatible with extreme preventive measures borne of an unbounded imagination.agreeing with plaintiff that the case came down to whether there was a duty to put a fence up,the court stated it could not find legal obligation for defendants to have done so.the court observed that while there is a duty to prevent livestock from entering a public road,there is no commensurate duty to prevent them from accessing a private driveway that other people have the right to use.
iv.negligence and duty of care 
to succeed in a negligence action,the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty,the defendant breached the duty,and the breach proximately or legally caused the plaintiff damages or injuries.ann pacific plaza shopping center cal th,d,disapproved on another point in reid google,cal th,fn.d.regarding duty,under general negligence principles,a person ordinarily is obligated to exercise due care in his or her own actions so as not to create an unreasonable risk of injury to others,and this legal duty generally is owed to the class of persons who it is reasonably foreseeable may be injured as the result of the actor conduct.lugtu california highway patrol cal th,d.whether a given case falls within an exception to this general rule,or whether a duty of care exists in a given circumstance,is a question of law to be determined on a basis.citation.parsons crown disposal co.cal th,d,parsons.
d uty is not an immutable fact of nature but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.citation.citation.some of the considerations that courts have employed in various contexts to determine the existence and scope of duty are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.citations.parsons,supra,cal th,quoting ballard uribe cal d,fn.rptr,and rowland christian cal d.
whether defendants owed plaintiff a duty of care 
plaintiff does not directly address the duty of care analysis as set forth in parsons.instead,he raises three disparate arguments,which we consider below.preliminarily,we observe he has distorted the appellate record in his opening brief.for example,he states horrell testified to the effect that angus cattle as a breed are particularly prone to aggressive,belligerent and combative behavior,more so when calves are present.in actuality,as noted above,horrell testified that angus cattle are generally less docile than herefords but more docile than brahman cattle.thus,there was no testimony that angus cattle are particularly prone to aggressive behavior.horrell also testified that within a particular breed,individual cows have their own temperaments,with some being more docile than others.
plaintiff also misstates the record when he asserts his aunt testified that after the accident she had a conversation with maryann stenberg in which the latter admitted that their angus do have aggressive behavioral characteristics rendering them dangerous instrumentalities.in fact,the conversation plaintiff refers to actually took place approximately years before the
