background 
defendant ufw is a labor organization within the meaning of the agricultural labor relations act alra,labor code sections,et.ufw has been the union representative of agricultural employees in the salinas valley since the union was certified over opposition in.since that time the parties have had repeated disputes over collective bargaining obligations and ufw allegations of unfair labor practices ulps 
on october,ufw filed a charge of ulps with the agricultural labor relations board alrb,which was designated alrb case number ce sal.in that charge ufw alleged that had initiated a de c ertification campaign against the ufw.
on november,ufw filed a second ulp charge ce sal alleging that had promised its employees benefits and improved working conditions if they voted out ufw as its union representative.after the election on november,ufw filed objections on nine grounds and asked the alrb to set aside the election case rd sal objection accused management of promising that it would maintain existing benefits to workers and would not replace them with labor contractor employees,although it had resisted ufw proposals to improve wages and other benefits and had proposed eliminating certain employment protections.ufw protested that promises to existing workers constituted an unlawful promise designed to undermine the union majority support and bargaining status and to thereby cause disaffection among the workforce.
on february,however,ufw counsel requested dismissal of both objection and the second ulp charge.the latter request was granted on february.shortly thereafter,the parties reached an understanding with respect to both the objection and the dismissed charge.on february,ufw attorney sent counsel a letter purporting to memorialize the ufw agreement.in the letter ufw acknowledged that it had obtained dismissal of the second ulp,and it promised not to refile this charge the substantive allegations at a later date.
the letter also noted that ufw had requested dismissal of objection regarding the unlawful promise of benefits.as of that time,however,the executive secretary has not yet ruled on this request.ufw therefore agrees that said objection five will in fact be dismissed in its entirety or that,in the event the executive secretary for any reason declines to dismiss all or any of it prior to a hearing,ufw will timely act to withdraw its declarations and argument regarding objection five and will not present any evidence thereon in the objection process and will continue to advise in writing,on the record the executive secretary,general counsel,assigned administrative law judge that ufw wants objection five entirely dismissed and that ufw will not pursue,nor assist in pursuing,objection five in any fashion whatsoever.
on february,the general counsel for the alrb,having investigated the first october,ulp charge ce sal,issued a complaint describing the following conduct.on october,a worker asked crew members to sign a petition to decertify ufw as its union representative,in full view of and listening distance of forelady alma cordoba who allowed this activity to take place and to continue.the worker stated that he was there on behalf of management representatives because they did not want the union,an assertion that was not denied by forelady cordoba.after reviewing the signatures and requesting some workers to make corrections,cordoba allowed the worker to gather more signatures on the petition.between october and november,several other supervisors allowed workers to solicit signatures in their presence and with management approval.thus,through its supervisory employees,had initiated,participated in,aided,given support to a decertification campaign against the union,the certified bargaining representative of its employees.
in the course of the ensuing hearing on the decertification challenge rd sal and ce sal the parties stipulated that ufw had withdrawn objection.they continued,however,to debate the question of whether the promise of benefits evidence should be admitted.contended that to bring in such evidence in this proceeding would be tantamount to permitting the general counsel to litigate an unfair labor practice that is barred,both by the stipulation and by the statute of limitations for the dismissed ulp charge ce sal.the deputy general counsel,marvin brenner,maintained,however,that he was not bound by the stipulation between and ufw,and therefore he should be permitted to introduce evidence that promised workers that if they kicked out the union,their wages and benefits would stay the same.
mark soble,the administrative law judge alj,ruled that the stipulation between and ufw did not bar the general counsel from presenting the evidence.judge soble declined to ignore something that significant in trying to assess whether there was an environment which could have caused employees to think that the company had a particular position or other circumstances related to the petition sic or the election itself t hat would be just for lack of a better way to put it,bizarre to ignore something that crucial in trying to analyze the totality of the circumstances.a contrary ruling,judge soble opined,would be inconsistent with the purpose of the alra.
requested permission from the alrb to appeal the promise of benefits evidentiary ruling.the board denied the application,noting,no where sic in the transcript excerpts provided by does the alj indicate that he intends to allow the general counsel to seek to establish any violation not contained in the complaint.nor does the alj state that he intends to allow the ufw to violate the stipulation noted above.rather,the transcript reflects only that the alj declined to preclude the general counsel from introducing evidence of the promise of benefits to the extent it is relevant to the allegations that are contained in the complaint.in other words,we do not view the alj ruling as allowing the introduction of evidence of the promise of benefits to establish an independent unfair labor practice not alleged in the complaint or to establish an independent basis for setting aside the election.
on june,before receiving the alrb rejection of its appeal,brought this suit against ufw,alleging one cause of action for breach of contract.in the complaint alleged that ufw had breached its promises in the parties agreement by pursuing,and assisting the alrb general counsel in pursuing,allegations that had unlawfully promised benefits to employees.attached a true copy of the agreement.
ufw moved to strike the complaint under section.ufw asserted that claim arose from its constitutionally protected petitioning activities before the alrb and that would not be able to establish a probability of prevailing.after hearing argument on the motion,the superior court denied the motion in a minute order.this appeal followed.
discussion 
scope and standard of review 
both parties appear to understand the nature of section and the legislative intent underlying its enactment.a slapp is a civil lawsuit that is aimed at preventing citizens from exercising their political rights or punishing those who have done so.while slapp suits masquerade as ordinary lawsuits such as defamation and interference with prospective economic advantage,they are generally meritless suits brought primarily to chill the exercise of free speech or petition rights by the threat of severe economic sanctions against the defendant,and not to vindicate a legally cognizable right.simpson strong tie company,gore cal th,briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th.section was enacted in to address the disturbing increase in the frequency of these meritless harassing lawsuits,subd.a see navellier sletten cal th,fn.simpson strong tie company,gore,supra,cal th at.it was the legislature finding that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly,subd.a.the statute was thus designed to deter meritless actions that deplete the defendant energy and drain his or her resources,citation,by ending them early and without great cost to the slapp target citation.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,chabak monroy th.the challenged cause of action may appear in a complaint,in a,or in other pleadings,subd.h city of cotati cashman cal th,cotati.
in evaluating a motion under the statute the trial court engages in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then must consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.cotati,supra,cal th at oasis west realty,llc goldman cal th.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the statute,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit is a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at.we review an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section de novo.soukup law offices of herbert hafif,supra,cal th at,fn.oasis west realty,llc goldman,supra,cal th at.
the arising from prong 
the first step of the section analysis is to determine whether the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.it is the burden of the party seeking the protection of the statute,ufw in this case,to show that the challenged cause of action falls within the statute.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,equilon accord,jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th.accordingly,the conduct at issue must fall within one of the four categories set forth in subdivision e of section any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
the superior court expressed uncertainty as to whether ufw had satisfied the first prong of the statutory test.we bear no such uncertainty.we recognize that the arising from requirement is not always easily met.equilon,supra,cal th at.t he mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the statute.citation.moreover,that a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity does not entail sic that it is one arising from such.citation.in the context,the critical consideration is whether the cause of action is based on the defendant protected free speech or petitioning activity.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at in re episcopal church cases cal th.moreover,a defendant in an ordinary private dispute can not take advantage of the statute simply because the complaint contains some references to speech or petitioning activity by the defendant w hen the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.martinez metabolife,th.
notably,however,in navellier,supra,cal th,the supreme court made it clear that the arising from prong of the statute may encompass a cause of action for breach of contract arising from the moving party claim for relief filed in federal district court such a claim indisputably is a statement or writing made before a judicial proceeding,subd.e.id.at.here it is clear that at a minimum,claim arises from is based on ufw acts of pursuing,and assisting the alrb general counsel in pursuing,allegations that had unlawfully promised benefits to its employees.this alleged conduct unquestionably constituted statements made in connection with an issue under consideration by the alrb in an official adjudicatory proceeding authorized by the alra.ufw thus met its burden to show that cause of action is one arising from protected activity.
probability of prevailing 
to satisfy the second prong of the slapp analysis,a plaintiff responding to an motion must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.however,we neither weigh credibility,nor compare the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.citation.if the plaintiff can show a probability of prevailing on any part of its claim,the cause of action is not meritless and will not be stricken once a plaintiff shows a probability of prevailing on any part of its claim,the plaintiff has established that its cause of action has some merit and the entire cause of action stands.citation.oasis west realty,llc goldman,supra,cal th at.
here the sole cause of action was for breach of contract.establishing that claim requires a showing of the existence of the contract,plaintiff performance or excuse for nonperformance,defendant breach,and the resulting damages to the plaintiff.id.at,citing reichert general ins.cal d.
in its complaint asserted that the breach occurred by pursuing,and assisting the alrb general counsel in pursuing,allegations that had unlawfully promised benefits to employees.on appeal,adds that ufw failed to withdraw declarations supporting the objection,voluntarily met with and submitted declarations to the deputy general counsel in preparation for the hearing,and allowed its own attorneys to witnesses on the allegations 
in its motion ufw advanced several points ufw never promised not to help the general counsel pursue an independent action,but only agreed to withdraw the second ulp charge and not refile it and not to pursue objection the promise not to assist in pursuing objection was to come into play only if the executive secretary declines to dismiss all or any of it,and that dismissal in effect did occur when ufw refrained from pursuing it at the hearing before the alj even if ufw obligated itself not to assist the general counsel,any such promise would be unenforceable as against public policy and the claim was preempted by the alrb primary jurisdiction.
toward the end of the hearing on its motion ufw also asserted that had not proffered evidence for every element namely,damages and consideration for the agreement,the so called agreement other than that brief mention of consideration,ufw did not pursue the absence of this element as a bar to recovery for breach of contract and proceeded as if a contract actually existed.however,the document represented to be the parties contract contains no provision indicating that ufw received any consideration for its promises.inexplicably,on appeal ufw does not argue or even suggest this basic point,which would defeat any claim.for purposes of this appeal,however,we will assume
