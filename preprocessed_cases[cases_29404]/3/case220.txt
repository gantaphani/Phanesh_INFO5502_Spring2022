in this trademark infringement action,hokto kinoko hokto usa,a wholly owned subsidiary of hokuto,hokuto japan,sued concord farms,concord farms for violating its rights to marks under which it markets its certified organic mushrooms,which are produced in the united states.hokto usa claimed that concord farms wrongly imported and marketed mushrooms under its marks for certified organic mushrooms,but which were cultivated in japan by hokuto japan under nonorganic standards.concord farms counterclaimed against hokto usa and hokuto japan,challenging the validity of the marks.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hokto usa and hokuto japan on all claims and entered a permanent injunction against concord farms.we must decide whether the nonorganic mushrooms concord farms imported from japan were genuine so as to preclude any liability for infringement whether concord farms marketing in the united states of the nonorganic mushrooms under hokto usa marks created a likelihood of consumer confusion and whether hokuto japan trademarks are subject to cancellation for fraud or were abandoned because it entered into a naked licensing agreement with hokto usa for their use in connection with its organic mushrooms.
background 
hokuto japan and hokto usa 
hokuto japan is a japanese corporation that produces mushrooms in japan.these mushrooms include maitake,white beech marketed as bunapi,and brown beech marketed as bunashimeji mushrooms,and are sold in ounce packages.hokuto japan mushrooms are grown in nonorganic conditions throughout japan and sold in packaging.
in,hokuto japan incorporated hokto usa,also a japanese corporation,to produce and market mushrooms in the united states.hokto usa is a wholly owned subsidiary of hokuto japan.like hokuto japan,hokto usa produces white beech,brown beech,and maitake mushrooms.unlike hokuto japan mushrooms,however,hokto usa mushrooms are certified organic and produced in a facility in san marcos,california.hokto usa mushrooms are robotically transported within the facility in plastic bottles,and its entire process is computer controlled.while most techniques involve manure and compost,hokto usa uses a sterilized culture medium made of sawdust,corn cob pellets,vegetable protein,and other nutrients.hokto usa also enforces strict temperature controls and other quality control standards,both in its san marcos facility and during the transportation and storage of its mushrooms,to ensure that the mushrooms stay fresh for as long as possible.
the production of mushrooms in the united states did not start off quite as smoothly as planned.although hokto usa was incorporated in,its san marcos growing facility was not completed until.while the facility was under construction,hokto usa resorted to importing mushrooms from hokuto japan.because consumers have different preferences than japanese consumers,hokuto japan grew mushrooms for hokto usa in special conditions.most significantly,hokuto japan used a special growing medium that met certified organic standards.hokuto japan also worked with hokto usa to develop packaging for the market.the packaging identified the mushrooms as certified organic and provided nutritional information geared toward consumers.
when the san marcos facility finally opened in,hokto usa began producing its own mushrooms and stopped importing hokuto japan mushrooms.but in,there was a shortfall of white beech mushrooms.to meet its customers demand,hokto usa imported two shipments of hokuto japan inferior white beech mushrooms,which were produced in japan and sold in hokuto japan usual packaging.before selling these mushrooms to consumers,hokto usa affixed a white sticker to every package,which clearly identified the mushrooms as a product of japan and identified the product as white beech mushrooms.the white stickers also identified the distributor as hokto usa and provided customer service information.
b.the trademarks 
in,hokuto japan acquired japanese trademark registrations for a series of marks hokto marks,including variations on its logo and several cartoon characters with faces,arms,and legs.these registrations protected hokuto japan rights to use the marks to market a wide variety of goods,ranging from mushrooms to live fish to bonsai trees.
hokuto japan also sought trademark registrations on the same marks and hired a trademark attorney,donald hanson,to apply for them.believing that hokuto japan intended to use the marks for the same wide range of nonmushroom products listed in the japanese registrations,hanson applied for registrations covering those same goods and signed a form for each mark affirming that hokuto japan had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the identified goods services.hokuto japan concedes that it never had a bona fide intention to use the marks in connection with most of the listed goods.
the united states patent and trademark office uspto issued registrations for the marks reg,and in december and for the hokto logo reg.on february,for use in connection with all of the listed goods,including those for which hokuto japan had no bona fide intent to use the marks 
in august,hokuto japan granted hokto usa a license for the exclusive use of the marks in the united states.in,hokuto japan assigned all of its rights under the american trademark registrations to hokto usa.both the mushrooms sold by hokuto japan in japan and those sold by hokto usa in the united states are marketed in packaging that prominently features the hokto marks.after this lawsuit was filed,hokto usa amended the list of covered goods to include only vegetables,namely,fresh mushrooms.
concord farms 
meanwhile,concord farms,a corporation that grows and imports mushrooms,has been importing hokuto japan mushrooms from japan since.from to,concord farms imported hokuto japan maitake,brown beech,and white beech mushrooms.since,it has imported only the maitake mushrooms.because concord farms purchases these products through a series of wholesalers,hokuto japan was initially unaware that concord farms was importing its mushrooms.the mushrooms concord farms imports into the united states are the nonorganic mushrooms that hokuto japan produces in japan for japanese consumption and are packaged in the japanese packaging,which features the hokto marks.concord farms warehouse is not temperature controlled,and concord farms does not impose formal limits on how long mushrooms are kept in the warehouse.
in july,hokto usa learned that concord farms imports hokuto japan mushrooms when hokto usa representative saw packages of hokuto japan,nonorganic maitake mushrooms mixed with packages of hokto usa maitake mushrooms in a grocery store display.all of the mushrooms were under a sign that said organic and made in usa,but the japanese products under the sign were neither.there was too much moisture in the hokuto japan packages,and the mushrooms were going bad.the store manager told hokto usa representative that he had purchased the hokuto japan mushrooms from concord farms.at a produce exposition three months later,hokto usa representative requested that concord farms refrain from importing,selling,or distributing hokuto japan mushrooms.concord farms refused.
hokto usa filed this trademark action in the united states district court for the central district of california.all three parties filed for summary judgment.the district court entered judgment in favor of hokto usa and hokuto japan,and permanently enjoined concord farms from selling the hokuto japan mushrooms in the united states.concord farms timely appeals.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.v iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.wendt host int l,cir.
iii.discussion 
gray market goods 
the crux of hokto usa claim is that when concord farms imported mushrooms bearing the hokto marks from hokuto japan and sold those mushrooms in the united states,it infringed hokto usa rights to those marks.this case thus implicates the set of trademark principles governing goods goods that are legitimately produced and sold abroad under a particular trademark,and then imported and sold in the united states in competition with the trademark holder products.
the supreme court has explained that a good is a good,bearing a valid united states trademark,that is imported without the consent of the united states trademark holder.k mart cartier.the mushrooms at issue here fit comfortably within the supreme court definition.some commentators apply the term gray market only where both the trademark owner and the alleged infringer import their product from foreign countries,see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed,or only where the trademark owner also owns foreign rights in the disputed mark,see jerome gilson,trademark protection and practice.regardless of whether we categorize the mushrooms here as goods,however,the fundamental nature of the infringement claim is the same as that in cases hokto usa alleges that concord farms violated its trademarks by importing legitimately produced goods sold under those same marks.see am.circuit breaker or.breakers,cir discussing ambiguity in definitions of goods and concluding that whether this is technically classified as a case or not does not drive the solution.
genuine goods 
in general,the sale of goods may infringe on the trademark holder rights,subject to the consumer confusion analysis that generally governs trademark infringement claims.an exception to this rule,however,is that trademark law does not extend to the sale of genuine goods.if the hokuto japan mushrooms that concord farms imported were genuine hokto usa goods,then concord farms would not be liable for trademark infringement.the district court correctly concluded that the mushrooms were not genuine goods.
we have approached the genuine good inquiry both as a threshold question for the applicability of trademark law,and as part of the test for consumer confusion.compare nec elecs.cal circuit abco,cir trademark law generally does not reach the sale of genuine goods emphasis added,with am.circuit breaker,at analyzing genuineness within discussion of the absence of the likelihood of confusion.see also john paul mitchell pete n larry,describing different courts approaches to the genuineness inquiry.here,because we confront a classic case,we must analyze the genuine goods question as a threshold matter,for if concord farms mushrooms are genuine,it is not subject to liability for trademark infringement.
the no material difference requirement 
genuine,in the trademark context,is a term of art a good is genuine only if it does not materially differ from the trademark owner product.see,mccarthy,supra,i f there are material differences between the gray market imports and the authorized imports,then the gray market imports are not genuine goods and can create a likelihood of confusion.see also iberia foods romeo,cir explaining that where goods are marketed under identical marks but are materially different the alleged infringer goods are considered and the sale of the goods constitutes infringement citations omitted societe des produits nestle,casa helvetia,cir it follows that the venezuelan chocolates purveyed by casa helvetia were not genuine if they a were not authorized for sale in the united states and b differed materially from the authorized version.
we first established that trademark law does not extend to the sale of genuine goods in nec electronics.there,the question before us was whether a subsidiary of a foreign manufacturer may sue for trademark infringement where another company buys the parent identical goods abroad and then sells them here using the parent true mark.at emphasis added.in american circuit breakers,applying the nec electronics rule,we explained that a exception makes good sense and comports with the consumer protection rationale of trademark law because a consumer who purchases a genuine good receives essentially the product he expected.at.in both nec electronics and american circuit breakers,exemption from trademark law turned on whether the allegedly infringing product differed materially from the trademark holder product.
because the likelihood of confusion increases as the differences between products become more subtle,the threshold for determining a material difference is low.the key question is whether a consumer is likely to consider a difference relevant when purchasing a product.courts have found a wide range of differences material in this context.the second circuit,for instance,held that cabbage patch dolls were not genuine when accompanied with fictitious birth certificates and adoption papers written in a foreign language.original appalachian artworks,granada,cir.the circuit held that there were material differences between the british and american versions of dishwasher detergent where the chemical composition of the detergents differed slightly,and the british detergent was labeled washing up liquid rather than dishwashing liquid and included a royal emblem.lever united states.along the same lines,a district court in the central district of california,comparing the mexican and versions of pepsi,held that differences in quality control and the use of spanish,rather than english,on the soda cans were material differences.pepsico,reyes,d.we agree that differences in language,quality control,and packaging may each be sufficiently material to render imported goods not genuine.
concord farms mushrooms 
whether the mushrooms that concord farms imports from hokuto japan are genuine goods thus turns on whether they materially differ from hokto usa mushrooms.concord farms mushrooms are not organic,are grown under hokuto japan less extensive quality control standards,and are sold in packaging designed for domestic japanese consumers.the hokuto japan packaging is in japanese,and the packages weights are measured in grams,not ounces.the hokuto japan packaging identifies the mushrooms as the product of the specific japanese prefecture in which they were produced.it also displays hokuto japan website and telephone number.to determine whether these concord farms mushrooms are genuine hokto usa goods,we must compare them to the three categories of hokto usa mushrooms the mushrooms that hokto usa imported from hokuto japan prior to the opening of hokto usa san marcos,california plant the mushrooms that hokto usa produces at its california plant and the white beech mushrooms that hokto usa imported from hokuto japan in may and november to supplement its supply.
the mushrooms that hokto usa imported from hokuto japan prior to the opening of the san marcos facility materially differed from concord farms mushrooms both in their production and in their packaging.hokto usa submitted uncontradicted evidence that certified organic status is more important to american consumers than to japanese consumers,and that hokuto japan used a special growing medium to ensure that the mushrooms intended for sale by hokto usa in the united states met certified organic standards.in contrast,hokuto japan does not use this special growing medium to produce mushrooms intended for japanese consumption so,when concord farms imported hokuto japan mushrooms for sale in the united states,they did not meet certified organic standards.hokuto japan and hokto usa also developed packaging in both english and japanese,in contrast to the packaging developed for japanese consumers.the packaging described in english the mushrooms recommended serving size,calorie count,and other nutritional information.we agree with the district court that these differences in production and packaging are material,rendering these imports not genuine.
concord farms mushrooms materially differ even more from the mushrooms that hokto usa produces in its san marcos facility.like the pre imports,hokto usa mushrooms are certified organic and sold in packaging.at its san marcos facility,hokto usa uses a hygienic,cultivation process,which includes the robotic transport of mushrooms in plastic bottles a sterile culture medium composed of sawdust,corn cob pell
