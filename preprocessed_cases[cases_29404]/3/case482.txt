appellants appeal from the denial of their petition for writ of administrative mandamus.after a hearing by a hearing officer,the county agricultural commissioner imposed a fine on patterson flying service for failing to follow the label directions when it made an aerial application of pesticides,in violation of food and agriculture code section.an appeal to the director of the department of pesticide regulation upheld the penalty.appellants petition to the trial court for an administrative writ of mandamus was denied.appellants appeal that denial,contending the administrative proceedings failed to follow the proper procedures,and the commissioner findings were not supported by substantial evidence.we will affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the county agricultural commissioner commissioner issued a notice of proposed action,which notified patterson flying service patterson that the commissioner proposed to fine it for violation of food and agriculture code section,which provides the use of any pesticide shall not conflict with labeling registered pursuant to this chapter which is delivered with the pesticide or with any additional limitations applicable to the conditions of any permit issued by the director or commissioner.the notice asserted that,on september,patterson,operating as a pest control business,made a pesticide application of dimethoate,which drifted onto elena ruiz while on adjacent property.the notice asserted patterson failure to prevent off site movement of the pesticide onto ruiz property and person resulted in an actual health hazard,warranting a class a penalty under california code of regulations,section a.the notice also asserted patterson was liable to the individual harmed or the medical provider for the immediate costs of medical care for acute injuries or illnesses of the exposed individual.the notice stated patterson was entitled to a hearing on request.
at appellants request,a hearing was held before a hearing officer.the evidence indicated appellants applied both dimethoate and a second pesticide,warrior,to the field adjacent to ruiz property.the hearing officer made findings of fact and concluded the label of the dimethoate and warrior pesticides stated do not apply this product in a way that will contact workers or other persons,either directly or through drift.he also found substantial amounts of dimethoate and warrior drifted from the target site onto ruiz and her property,and the violation of section created an actual health or environmental hazard,so that a fine was appropriate.the commissioner adopted the hearing officer decision,and ordered patterson to pay the fine and reimburse ruiz for her medical costs.
appellants appealed to the director of the department of pesticide regulation,who affirmed,concluding that the commissioner decision was supported by substantial evidence and the penalty was within his discretion.appellants petitioned the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus.after hearing,the court denied the petition,finding substantial evidence supported the commissioner decision.
discussion 
in administrative mandate proceedings,the inquiry is whether the respondent has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.in cases not involving a fundamental vested right where appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,the appellate court must determine from a review of the administrative record whether substantial evidence supports the agency findings.ryan california interscholastic diego section th,d.the deferential substantial evidence standard requires the appellate court to presume the correctness of the administrative ruling.ibid.appellants contend respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it failed to follow the procedures set out in the administrative procedures act,et.they also contend the evidence does not support the findings.
application of the administrative procedures 
the administrative adjudicative provisions of the administrative procedures act apa are found in chapters,et and,et of the apa.the formal hearing procedures of chapter apply when by statute they are made applicable to an agency or proceeding,cockshott department of forestry fire protection th,d.except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,the general provisions of chapter apply to all agencies of the state they apply to any decision by an agency if an evidentiary hearing for determination of facts is required for formulation and issuance of the decision.chapter does not apply to a local agency,unless it is made applicable by statute,subd.b.chapter does apply,however,to an agency created or appointed by joint or concerted action of the state and one or more local agencies,subd.c.appellants contend the provisions of the apa apply to the decision of the county agricultural commissioner,because it is an agency created or appointed by joint or concerted action of the state and one or more local agencies.respondent contends the commissioner is a local agency to which the apa does not apply.
the parties have not cited,and we have not found,any case interpreting the phrase an agency created or appointed by joint or concerted action of the state and one or more local agencies,as that phrase is used in government code section.the law revision commission comments to section,however,state local agencies are excluded because of the very different circumstances of local government units when compared to state agencies.the section explicitly includes joint state and local bodies,so as to effect the broadest possible coverage.cal.law revision com,west ann,ed.foll.
the apa defines a gency as a board,bureau,commission,department,division,office,officer,or other administrative unit,including the agency head.a local agency is a county,city,district,public authority,public agency,or other political subdivision or public corporation in the state other than the state,subd.a.each county has a county department of agriculture,which is under the control of the county agricultural commissioner.food.generally,the commissioner is appointed by the county board of supervisors.food.with some exceptions,a person can not be appointed to the office of commissioner unless he or she is licensed by the state secretary of food and agriculture.food.
in any county in which no commissioner has served,the secretary of food and agriculture performs the duties of commissioner in the same manner,to the same extent,and with the same authority as if he had been the duly appointed commissioner in such county,except that the pesticide regulatory duties of the commissioner are performed by the director of the department of pesticide regulation,as if he were the appointed commissioner.food.when the secretary learns of a vacancy in the office of commissioner,he or she must immediately transmit to the board of supervisors a list of persons who are licensed by him or her to be eligible for the position.food.if the board of supervisors fails to appoint a commissioner,the secretary must appoint a commissioner from the list.food.if there is no qualified person available for the office of commissioner,the board of supervisors may temporarily appoint a person recommended by the secretary.food.the secretary of food and agriculture and the director of the department of pesticide regulation are also involved in removing commissioners for neglect of duty,incompetence,or misconduct in office.food.
the commissioner must make annual reports to the director and attend any meeting the secretary and director require.food.commissioners may adopt regulations applicable in their counties governing the conduct of pest control operations,but each regulation must be approved by the director before it becomes operative.food.the director,and the commissioner of each county under the direction and supervision of the director,shall enforce this division division,governing pest control operations and the regulations which are issued pursuant to it.food.
except as otherwise specifically provided,in all cases where provisions of this code place joint responsibility for the enforcement of laws and regulations on the director and the commissioner,the commissioner shall be responsible for local administration of the enforcement program.the director shall be responsible for overall statewide enforcement and shall issue instructions and make recommendations to the commissioner.such instructions and recommendations shall govern the procedure to be followed by the commissioner in the discharge of his duties.the director shall furnish assistance in planning and otherwise developing an adequate county enforcement program,including uniformity,coordination,training,special services,special equipment,and forms,statewide publicity,statewide planning,and emergency assistance.food.
agency includes an agency head,such as the county agricultural commissioner,who controls the county department of agriculture,food.the statutes cited above illustrate that the secretary of food and agriculture and the director of the department of pesticide regulation are jointly involved with the board of supervisors in the appointment of the county agricultural commissioner.the secretary licenses eligible persons and provides a list of those eligible when a vacancy in the office occurs if the board fails to fill the vacancy,the secretary makes the appointment from the list.the secretary and director are involved in removing incompetent commissioners they must approve regulations adopted by the commissioners,and they direct and supervise the commissioners enforcement of statutes and regulations relating to pest control operations.under these statutes,the county agricultural commissioner is not an independent local agency,whose very different circumstances justify its exclusion from the procedural requirements of the apa.rather,it is closely connected with state agencies that direct,supervise,and cooperate in the performance of its duties.we conclude the office of county agricultural commissioner is a local agency created or appointed by joint or concerted action of the state and one or more local agencies for purposes of government code section,subdivision c.consequently,the provisions of chapter of the apa apply to hearings conducted under the authority of the county agricultural commissioner.
the formal hearing procedures of chapter of the apa apply only when the statutes relating to the agency so provide,cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.the statute governing the hearing by the county agricultural commission in this case did not require compliance with chapter of the apa.see food.consequently,a formal hearing pursuant to chapter of the apa was not required.
the statute under which the hearing was held set out the procedures to be followed by the commissioner and the procedures for appeal to the director of pesticide regulation 
c before a civil penalty is levied,the person charged with the violation shall be given a written notice of the proposed action including the nature of the violation and the amount of the proposed penalty,and shall have the right to request a hearing within days after receiving notice of the proposed action if a hearing is requested,notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given at least days before the date set for the hearing.at the hearing,the person shall be given an opportunity to review the commissioner evidence and to present evidence on his or her own behalf.if a hearing is not timely requested,the commissioner may take the action proposed without a hearing.
d if the person upon whom the commissioner levied a civil penalty requested and appeared at a hearing,the person may appeal the commissioner decision to the director within days of the date of receiving a copy of the commissioner decision food,subds.c,d.
under chapter of the apa 
a the governing procedure by which an agency conducts an adjudicative proceeding is determined by the statutes and regulations applicable to that proceeding 
b this chapter supplements the governing procedure by which an agency conducts an adjudicative proceeding,subds.a,b.
some provisions of chapter,such as its informal hearing procedures,are optional they do not replace other agency procedures that serve the same purpose.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.other provisions,such as the administrative adjudication bill of rights,are mandatory and govern any adjudicative proceeding to which chapter applies.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.
government code section lists the requirements for an adjudicative proceeding under chapter.these requirements include giving the person subject to agency action notice and an opportunity to be heard,including the opportunity to present and rebut evidence,subd.a.section is it applies to the governing procedure by which an agency conducts an adjudicative proceeding without further action by the agency,although the agency procedure may include provisions equivalent to,or more protective of the rights of the person to which the agency action is directed than,the requirements of section,subd.b cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.section specifies the minimum due process requirements for an adjudicative hearing subject to chapter of the apa.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.
accordingly,the procedures governing the hearing before the hearing officer concerning the commissioner proposed penalty were those found in food and agriculture code section,subdivision c,which were specifically applicable to that proceeding,supplemented by the mandatory provisions of chapter of the apa.the procedure set out in food and agriculture code section,subdivision c,and followed at the hearing provided appellants notice and an opportunity to be heard,including the opportunity to present and rebut evidence,subd.a.appellants do not clearly identify any procedure,required by food and agriculture code section,subdivision c,or chapter of the apa,that they contend they were denied in the hearing before the hearing officer,nor do they explain how they were adversely affected by its absence.in their reply brief,they contend the hearing was conducted pursuant to no judicially,statutory or regulatory recognizable procedures and a primary concern is the selection of the hearing officer or administrative law judge pursuant to c ode a b for the conduct of the hearing.
as discussed previously,chapter of the apa did not apply to the hearing.the provision in government code section requiring that hearings be conducted by administrative law judges on the staff of the office of administrative hearings applies only to formal hearings pursuant to chapter of the apa,and thus was not applicable to the hearing in issue.consequently,appointment of an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing was not required.
neither food and agriculture code section nor chapter of the apa prescribes the method by which the hearing officer is to be selected or appointed or the minimum qualifications the hearing officer must meet.chapter requires that the hearing officer be disinterested it provides that the hearing officer may not be a person who served as investigator,prosecutor,or advocate earlier in the proceeding and that the hearing officer is subject to disqualification for bias,prejudice,or interest,subds.a.
appellants do not contend the hearing officer should have been disqualified on any of these grounds.appellants contend that,if the apa did not apply,then the government code sections relating to county hearing officers applied to the subject hearing,and their requirements were not met.government code section authorizes any county to establish the office of county hearing officer,whose duties are to conduct hearings for the county or any board,agency,commission,or committee of the county.when a state law provides that a hearing be held or that findings of fact or conclusions of law be made by any county board,agency,commission,or committee,the county hearing officer may be authorized by ordinance or resolution to conduct the hearing.a county hearing officer must be an attorney who was admitted to practice at least five years before appointment to that office.these provisions provide an alternative to,and do not supersede,any other provision of law providing for any matter to be heard or determined by a hearing officer.
appellants have not demonstrated that the county hearing officer provisions applied to their hearing,or that there was any failure to comply with them.the county may establish the office of county hearing officer,and that officer may be authorized to conduct certain hearings.appellants have not demonstrated that stanislaus county has established such an office,or that the county hearing officer was authorized or required by ordinance or resolution to conduct the hearing in issue.appellants assert t here is no evidence in the record that indicates the hearing officer either an attorney or had five years experience as an attorney.appellants,however,bear the burden of proving that the procedure was improper.t he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair,in excess of jurisdiction,or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.alford pierno d.they have cited no evidence showing that the hearing officer was not a county hearing officer,was not an attorney,or was unqualified in any way.appellants have not shown that respondent did not proceed in the manner required by law in the selection of a hearing officer or in any other respect.
ii.substantial evidence supporting the commissioner decision 
w hen the underlying administrative decision does not involve or affect a fundamental vested right,the trial court reviews the entire administrative record to determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the agency committed any errors of law.citations.when considering all relevant evidence within the administrative record,the trial court can not lose sight that it is for the administrative agency to weigh the preponderance of conflicting evidence,as the court may reverse an administrative decision only if,based on the evidence before the administrative entity,a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion reached by that agency.ryan california interscholastic diego section,supra,th at,d.on appeal,the appellate court also must determine whether substantial evidence supports the administrative decision.ibid.where a factual finding is challenged on the ground there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of the reviewing court begins and ends with the determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,that will support the administrative agency determination.citation.id.at,fn,d.the court must consider all the evidence,including that which fairly detracts from the evidence supporting the agency decision.california youth authority state personnel bd.th,d.
appellants were charged with violation of food and agriculture code section,which provides 
the use of any pesticide shall not conflict with labeling registered pursuant to this chapter which is delivered with the pesticide or with any additional limitations applicable to the conditions of any permit issued by the director or commissioner.
the pesticide labels stated do not apply this product in a way that will contact workers or other persons,either directly or through drift.the fine was imposed pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section,which provides,in part 
a when taking civil penalty action pursuant to section of the food and agricultural code,county agricultural commissioners shall use the provisions of this section to determine the violation class and the fine amount.
for purposes of this article,violations shall be designated as class a,class b,and class 
a class a violations which created an actual health or environmental hazard,the fine range for class a violations is 
appellants contend the violation was not proven because there was no evidence that the label on the pesticide as opposed to the pesticide itself was registered pursuant to this chapter and a substantial drift of pesticide was required in order to establish the violation,but there was no credible evidence of a substantial drift.they also assert the fine amount was not supported by the evidence,because there was no substantial,credible evidence that the spray or drift of the pesticide created an actual health or environmental hazard.
label registration 
in arguing that the labeling was not registered,as that term is used in food and agriculture code section,appellants do not cite any state statutes or regulations relating to the labeling or registration of pesticides.a review of the applicable statutes is instructive.
every manufacturer of,importer of,or dealer in any pesticide shall obtain a certificate of registration from the department before the pesticide is offered for sale.food.each applicant for a certificate of registration must identify every pesticide it intends to manufacture or sell and its ingredients.food.the registrant must attach to each container or package of pesticide to be sold a plainly printed label identifying the pesticide and the registered manufacturer,importer,or vendor.food.the registrant of any pesticide that is sold or delivered to a consumer in this state shall furnish printed directions for use,and dilution if any,upon the label,or shall enclose the printed directions in each container or package of the pesticide.food.if a manufacturer,importer,or dealer in pesticides that applies for registration of pesticides has complied with this chapter and the regulations that are adopted pursuant to it,the director shall register each pesticide that is sought to be registered and issue a certificate of registration to the applicant that authorizes the manufacture and sale of the pesticide in this state.food.the registration expires on december of each year,unless renewed.food.
each application for registration of a pesticide product or to amend the labeling of a pesticide product must be accompanied by six copies of the product labeling,tit.label amendments must be approved pursuant to section of the regulations,but they are not subject to separate registration renewal requirements,tit.no label may represent a registered pesticide and no supplemental or associated information,whether written or oral,may represent a registered pesticide until such label and information is accepted by the director as part of the labeling,tit.the labeling requirements imposed by the director regulations must meet,but may not exceed,the current united states environmental protection agency labeling requirements the director labeling requirements apply equally to pesticides registered by the epa and submitted to the director for registration,and those requiring registration only pursuant to food and agriculture code section,tit.the assigned registration number must appear on the epa registration number if one has been assigned,or the state registration number if no federal number has been assigned,tit.
contrary to appellants contention,there is no requirement that the labeling of a pesticide be registered separately from the pesticide in order to qualify as labeling registered pursuant to this chapter under food and agriculture code section.the pesticide and label are submitted together for registration the approved label that accompanies a registered pesticide constitutes the labeling registered pursuant to this chapter for purposes of that statute.food.
appellants concede they never questioned that the product or the pesticide was registered.it is unlawful to use or possess a pesticide that is not registered.food.the parties stipulated that appellants applied dimethoate to the property adjacent to ruiz property,as noted in exhibit and.exhibits and indicate the dimethoate was applied pursuant to the recommendation of a pest control adviser,dave vermeulen of western farm services both the recommendation exhibit and appellants pesticide use report exhibit reflect the registration numbers of the pesticides applied.the dimethoate and
