this case is a turf battle between neighboring local agency formation commissions lafcos under the local government reorganization act of,et the act.
lafco oversee local agency boundary changes,including the incorporation and disincorporation of cities,the formation and dissolution of most special districts,and the consolidation,merger,annexation,and reorganization of cities and special districts.each county in california has a lafco.in california,lafcos are working with nearly government agencies in counties,incorporated cities,and special districts.
lafcos have been described as watchdogs,guarding against the wasteful duplication of services that results from indiscriminate formation of new local agencies or haphazard annexation of territory to existing local agencies.citation.the primary objectives of lafcos are as follows to facilitate orderly growth and development by determining logical local agency boundaries to preserve prime agricultural lands by guiding development away from presently undeveloped prime agricultural preserves and to discourage urban sprawl and encourage the preservation of open space by promoting development of vacant land within cities before annexation of vacant land adjacent to cities 
lafcos review proposals for the formation of new local government agencies as well as boundary changes for existing agencies.given the extraordinary number of government agencies,cities,and special districts in the state,it is no surprise that agency boundaries often do not logically relate to one another,resulting in an overlap of service responsibilities and inefficiencies in service provision.the overarching goal of lafcos is to encourage the orderly formation and extension of government agencies,while balancing the competing needs in california for affordable housing,economic opportunities,and the preservation of natural resources.
when making determinations,lafcos must consider the effect that any proposal will have on prime agricultural lands and open space.specifically,lafcos seek to protect these resources by encouraging development away from these preserves and towards vacant urban sites.
moreover,lafcos work to discourage the irregular and chaotic growth referred to as urban sprawl,which often results in inefficient service delivery and the unnecessary loss of prime agricultural lands and open space.curtin talbert,curtin cal.land use and planning law ed fn.omitted.
the precise issue in this case is when two counties receive services from a multicounty service district,which county lafco has jurisdiction over planning matters spheres of influence and service reviews concerning that district work within an individual county.the trial court determined the principal county lafco,rather than the local lafco of affected territory,is vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to establish the sphere of influence and conduct service reviews for a multicounty district within the boundaries of the local lafco county.plaintiff placer county lafco placer lafco appeals from the judgment entered in favor of defendant nevada county lafco nevada lafco,following the submission of a stipulated set of facts,trial briefs,and oral argument to the trial court.intervener northstar community services district northstar,which aligns itself with placer lafco,also filed an appeal from the judgment.since the interests of plaintiff and northstar are aligned,our reference to plaintiff or placer lafco encompasses northstar position unless otherwise indicated.intervener truckee sanitary district tsd has filed appellate briefs taking the same position as nevada lafco.
we shall affirm the judgment 
factual and procedural background 
on october,placer lafco filed a complaint for declaratory relief,asking the trial court to construe the act and determine whether,for a multicounty district,the principal county lafco or the local lafco of affected territory is the appropriate agency to determine the sphere of influence for the portion of the district in the local lafco county,and which lafco or nevada jurisdiction to prepare the municipal service review for sewer services within placer county and the sphere of influence plan for tsd within the boundaries of placer county.
the stipulated facts,as summarized in the statement of decision,included the following 
placer lafco and nevada lafco are public agencies organized and existing pursuant to the act,which establishes a local agency formation commission for each of california counties.
intervener tsd is a special district formed under the sanitary district act of.health,et tsd is an example of a multicounty district.tsd provides wastewater collection service to territory within both placer county and nevada county.because a greater portion of the assessed value of the tsd taxable property lies within the boundaries of nevada county,nevada lafco is the principal county for tsd under the act.see fn,ante.
intervener northstar is a special district formed under the community services district law.et northstar is an example of a single county district and is located solely within the boundaries of placer county.in addition to wastewater collection service,northstar also provides fire services,potable water,snow removal,road maintenance,street lighting,and solid waste disposal to the territory within its boundaries.
there are nine multicounty districts that provide services in both placer and nevada counties.placer lafco is the principal county for three of these forest hospital district,tahoe truckee sanitation agency,and truckee tahoe airport district.nevada lafco is the principal county for the other six summit public utility district,nevada irrigation district,truckee donner public utility district,truckee donner recreation and park district,truckee fire protection district,and tsd.
in,placer lafco and nevada lafco entered into a joint powers agreement jpa whereby the two commissions adopted a joint meeting procedure to insure greater cooperation between the two commissions in actions that could have effects in both counties.the two commissions adopted an update of the sphere of influence for donner summit public utility district on june,and adopted an update of the sphere of influence for truckee fire protection district on december.the jpa was terminated by placer lafco in due to concern about its legality.
tsd current sphere of influence was adopted by principal county nevada lafco in and updated by nevada lafco for territory within nevada county in.
placer lafco says in its appellate brief that there is presently no conflict within placer county between tsd sphere of influence as adopted by nevada lafco and northstar sphere of influence as adopted by placer lafco,but tsd has proposed that its sphere in placer county be expanded to include territory to the east of northstar physical boundaries,overlaying a substantial portion of northstar existing sphere of influence.
as described in the complaint 
placer lafco we use the abbreviation lafco while the parties use lafco,with a small case o is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that tsd has submitted a request to nevada lafco to review,update and modify its sphere of influence plan for its territory in placer county and that nevada lafco may act upon the request in the near future.in conjunction with such request,nevada lafco is preparing a municipal service review of wastewater services within the current and prospective service area of tsd as provided by section of the act.a dispute has arisen between placer lafco and nevada lafco with respect to acting on these requests.nevada lafco claims that it is the appropriate agency to conduct the municipal service review for wastewater services in order to determine the sphere of influence plan for the entirety of tsd both in nevada county and placer county,pursuant to its role as the principal county under sections and of the act.placer lafco,on the other hand,disputes this interpretation of the statutes and contends that the principal county concept only applies to changes of organization or reorganization.placer lafco further contends that it is the appropriate agency to prepare a separate municipal service review for sewer services and sphere of influence plan for tsd within the boundaries of placer county pursuant to section and of the act.the parties agree that the issue regarding which agency is the appropriate agency to develop municipal service reviews and sphere of influence plans will arise again at such time as the existing sphere of influence plan is reviewed and modified for each of the other districts listed in the complaint.
the complaint alleged northstar sphere of influence plan would be affected by the establishment of tsd sphere of influence plan.
the complaint asked the trial court to declare which entity was the appropriate entity to adopt the municipal service review for service provided within placer county and the sphere of influence plan for multicounty districts including tsd shared by the two counties.the complaint alleged the declaration was urgently needed because the act,subd.f required updating of spheres of influence not less than once every five years,which would come due on january,and service reviews must be completed before the spheres of influence can be updated 
the trial court statement of decision,issued on june,concluded the principal county lafco nevada lafco had jurisdiction to determine the sphere of influence and service review of tsd services,including services within placer county.the court also endorsed plaintiff position that the exclusive jurisdiction to conduct municipal service reviews did not preclude an affected lafco from conducting its own municipal service review for unicounty districts that provide the same or similar services as those of multicounty districts under the jurisdiction of a principal county lafco.such municipal service review may of necessity include a review of the municipal service capability of the multicounty districts within the affected county.the exclusive jurisdiction of the principal county lafco extended to conducting municipal service reviews of its own multicounty districts for the purposes of exercising its exclusive jurisdiction to establish spheres of influence of those districts.
the trial court also concluded,however,that the principal county exclusive jurisdiction with respect to multicounty districts did not preclude an affected lafco from conducting its own service reviews for districts that provide the same or similar service as the multicounty districts,and such review may of necessity include a review of the municipal service capability of the multicounty districts within the affected county.the court said the exclusive jurisdiction of the principal county lafco extended to conducting service reviews of its own multicounty district for the purpose of exercising its exclusive jurisdiction to establish such district sphere of influence.a local lafco retained jurisdiction potentially to establish spheres of influence that overlapped the multicounty district sphere of influence.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of nevada lafco,concluding 
the act places the exclusive authority in the principal county lafco to establish the sphere of influence for a multicounty district,both within the principal county and in all other counties where the multicounty district has territory.
while the principal county lafco must conduct the municipal service review pursuant to section for each multicounty district under the principal county lafco jurisdiction,that jurisdiction does not preclude an affected lafco from conducting its own municipal service reviews for the districts that provide the same or similar services as those of multicounty districts under the jurisdiction of the principal county lafco.
nevada lafco has exclusive jurisdiction to prepare the sphere of influence plan for tsd within nevada and placer counties.

standard of review 
although lafco decisions are generally reviewable under a substantial evidence standard,this case,presented to the trial court on stipulated facts and arguments by competing lafcos concerning statutory interpretation,presents only questions of law on appeal.accordingly,our review is de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,chatsky associates superior court th,d.

ii.the issues 
placer lafco says the issue on appeal is whether placer lafco or nevada lafco determines the sphere of influence and performs the service reviews for a multicounty district within placer county.placer lafco admits nevada lafco,as the principal county,fn,ante with respect to tsd,has jurisdiction over changes of organization such as an annexation to tsd affecting placer county.placer lafco position is that a principal county has jurisdiction only over changes of organization affecting other counties,not over spheres of influence which are planning tools or service reviews,because section defines principal county with reference to districts for which a change of organization or reorganization is proposed.placer lafco notes a lafco,as a creation of statute,has only such powers as are bestowed on it by the legislature.timberidge enterprises,city of santa rosa d.
statutory framework 
the legislative intent of the act is expressed in section,which provides 
the legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state to encourage orderly growth and development which are essential to the social,fiscal,and economic of the state.the legislature recognizes that the logical formation and determination of local agency boundaries is an important factor in promoting orderly development and in balancing that development with sometimes competing state interests of discouraging urban sprawl,preserving and prime agricultural lands,and efficiently extending government services.the legislature also recognizes that providing housing for persons and families of all incomes is an important factor in promoting orderly development.therefore,the legislature further finds and declares that this policy should be effected by the logical formation and modification of the boundaries of local agencies,with a preference granted to accommodating additional growth within,or through the expansion of,the boundaries of those local agencies which can best accommodate and provide necessary governmental services and housing for persons and families of all incomes in the most efficient manner feasible.
the legislature recognizes that urban population densities and intensive residential,commercial,and industrial development necessitate a broad spectrum and high level of community services and controls.the legislature also recognizes that when areas become urbanized to the extent that they need the full range of community services,priorities are required to be established regarding the type and levels of services that the residents of an urban community need and desire that community service priorities be established by weighing the total community service needs against the total financial resources available for securing community services and that those community service priorities are required to reflect local circumstances,conditions,and limited financial resources.the legislature finds and declares that a single multipurpose governmental agency is accountable for community service needs and financial resources and,therefore,may be the best mechanism for establishing community service priorities especially in urban areas.nonetheless,the legislature recognizes the critical role of many limited purpose agencies,especially in rural communities.the legislature also finds that,whether governmental services are proposed to be provided by a agency,several agencies,or a multipurpose agency,responsibility should be given to the agency or agencies that can best provide government services.
section provides among the purposes of a commission are discouraging urban sprawl,preserving and prime agricultural lands,efficiently providing government services,and encouraging the orderly formation and development of local agencies based upon local conditions and circumstances.one of the objects of the commission is to make studies and to obtain and furnish information which will contribute to the logical and reasonable development of local agencies in each county and to shape the development of local agencies so as to advantageously provide for the present and future needs of each county and its communities.
under the act,when a service district such as tsd provides services in multiple counties,the act designates as principal county the county having most of the assessed value of the district taxable property.
the principal county has jurisdiction over changes of organization.change of organization means a city a district an annexation to,or detachment from,a city or district a consolidation of cities or special districts or a merger or establishment of a subsidiary district.reorganization means two or more changes of organization initiated in a single proposal.section provides except as otherwise provided in section lafcos may agree to transfer of jurisdiction,if any district is,or as a result of a proposed change of organization or reorganization would be,located in more than one county,the commission of the principal county shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the matters authorized and required by this part part of the act.part of the act includes determination of spheres of influence and service reviews 
a sphere of influence is defined as a plan for the probable physical boundaries and service area of a local agency,fn,ante see also,fn,ante determination of spheres of influence for orderly development and coordination of local agencies.service reviews are conducted in order to prepare and update spheres of influence.service means a class established within,and as a part of,a single function,as provided by regulations adopted by the commission pursuant to chapter commencing with section of part.

as indicated,placer lafco says the issue is whether placer lafco or nevada lafco should set the sphere of influence and conduct the service reviews for a multicounty district insofar as it affects placer county.we shall conclude,as did the trial court,that the act gives the principal county here,nevada lafco jurisdiction over spheres of influence and service reviews of multicounty districts within neighboring counties,and this conclusion does not conflict with section,which defines principal county with reference to changes of organization.
placer lafco admits nevada lafco,as the principal county,fn,ante with respect to tsd,would have jurisdiction over changes of organization such as an annexation to tsd affecting placer county.placer lafco position is that a principal county has jurisdiction only over changes of organization affecting other counties,not over spheres of influence or service reviews in the other counties,because section defines principal county with reference to districts for which a change of organization or reorganization is proposed.we shall reject this argument and conclude sections defining principal county with reference to taxable property within a district for which a change of organization is proposed and giving principal counties jurisdiction over authorized matters that include matters other than changes of organization can be read together harmoniously.a court does not determine the meaning of a statute from a single word or sentence but in context provisions relating to the same subject must be harmonized to the extent possible.citations.people anderson cal th,d.
as indicated,change of organization means a city a district an annexation to,or detachment from,a city or district a consolidation of cities or special districts or a merger or establishment of a subsidiary district.
in contrast to change of organization,a sphere of influence is a plan for the probable physical boundaries and service area of a local agency,fn,ante see also determination of sphere of influence.a sphere of influence is a flexible planning and study tool to be reviewed and amended periodically as appropriate.city of agoura hills local agency formation,supra,d at.see also,subds.f,g sphere of influence should be reviewed and updated as necessary every five years.the sphere of influence is a factor to be considered in reviewing proposals for changes of organization,subd.h.however,determinations regarding approval or disapproval of changes of organization shall be consistent with the spheres of influence of the local agencies affected by those determinations,fn,ante.
service reviews are conducted in order to prepare and update spheres of influence.
where a district provides services to multiple counties a multicounty district,the sphere of influence and service review will necessarily implicate multiple counties.as we shall see,nothing in the act calls for each county in a multicounty district to set its own sphere of influence for that district.
contrary to placer lafco position,the act goes beyond changes of organization and gives principal counties exclusive jurisdiction over spheres of influence and service reviews of a multicounty district within other counties serviced by the district.thus,as indicated,section provides,except as otherwise provided in section if any district is,or as a result of a proposed change of organization or reorganization would be,located in more than one county,the commission of the principal county shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the matters authorized and required by this part.italics added.this part is part agency formation commission,sections to includes the determination of spheres of influence,fn,ante and the conduct of service reviews,fn,ante.
thus,section unambiguously gives principal counties jurisdiction over spheres of influence and service reviews of multicounty districts.
placer lafco argues the phrase matters authorized and required by this part,as used in section,does not apply to spheres of influence or service reviews but refers only to things such as notices,proceedings,and orders,because a different provision of the act uses the authorized and required language in connection with notices,proceedings,and orders.nothing in the language of section sanctions this view,and we reject it.
placer lafco argues section can not give principal counties jurisdiction over spheres of influence and service reviews,because section fn,ante,defines principal counties as counties having most of the assessed value of taxable property within a district or districts for which a change of organization or reorganization is proposed.placer lafco argues section thus limits principal counties jurisdiction to matters concerning changes of organization or reorganization.in the same vein,northstar characterizes section as establishing a condition precedent to the definition of principal county.we disagree.
thus,section is a definitional statute that defines principal county.a definitional statute will not operate to abrogate another provision of the act,because section says the statutory definitions govern u nless the provision or context otherwise requires we believe section which defines principal county with reference to changes of organization and section which gives principal counties jurisdiction over authorized matters can be harmonized.
thus,change of organization is what the act is all about.it is why all lafcos exist,whether or not they are the lafcos of principal counties.additionally,it is obvious that a change of organization is a prerequisite for a principal county to come into being,because in order for a principal county to exist,there must be a multicounty district,and formation of a district constitutes a change of organization.once the principal county comes into being,we see no impediment to the legislature giving the principal county jurisdiction over additional matters beyond changes of such as sphere of influence and service reviews.we note a different statute expressly gives principal counties jurisdiction over proposed changes of organization,fn,ante,and therefore principal counties do not depend on the definitional statute of section as the source of their jurisdiction over changes of organization.
thus,principal counties unambiguously have jurisdiction over spheres of influence and service reviews pursuant to section.
placer lafco argues this reading of section must be wrong,because section gives jurisdiction to the principal county e xcept as otherwise provided in section,and section fn,ante limits itself to a proposal,which is defined in the act as a request for a change of organization placer lafco argues that,since section is limited to changes of organization,section must also be so limited.placer lafco argues the trial court erroneously construed section as allowing transfer of jurisdiction for any matter,not just for changes of organization.nevada county also questions the ruling on this point and states there is nothing that requires sections and to have the same scope.
we need not decide the meaning of section,because that statute is not at issue in this case.placer lafco seeks to use section to limit the scope of section,arguing without citation of authority that the two statutes must have the same scope.however,even assuming for the sake of argument that placer lafco interpretation of section is correct that section allows transfer of jurisdiction only with respect to changes of organization,we see nothing wrong with one statute conferring jurisdiction over multiple matters and another statute authorizing transfer of jurisdiction over some but not all of those matters.indeed,we agree with nevada lafco that placer lafco position that any limitation in section must be imported into section would operate as a partial repeal of section.there is a presumption against such repeals by implication.sacramento newspaper guild sacramento county bd.of suprs.d.
we conclude section gives principal counties jurisdiction over spheres of influence and service reviews of multicounty districts within neighboring counties.
we reject other miscellaneous attacks on this construction of the act.
thus,placer lafco argues the overall objectives of the act are to discourage urban sprawl and provide for orderly development of service agencies,and a local lafco is best able to determine the pattern of growth within its own county.however,having a neighboring county as opposed to the state determine a sphere of influence for a multicounty district does keep the matter local,and having one county determine the sphere of influence for a multicounty district as opposed to multiple counties within the district each determining their own sphere of influence for the district is consistent with the objectives of planned growth and discouragement of urban sprawl.
placer lafco argues that,because section fn,ante says the commission shall determine the sphere of influence of each local agency within the county to provide for needs of the county,this statute does not authorize principal counties to set spheres of influence in adjacent counties.however,section does so authorize,as we have seen.we disagree with placer lafco view of section as mandating control by the local county rather than the principal county.
placer lafco argues the responsibility to assure orderly growth lies with the lafco in the county where the development will occur,and if several different lafcos are responsible for preparing spheres of influence for various agencies within a county,the spheres of the various agencies with the potential to serve an area may conflict and the efficiency declared in the statute will give way to jurisdictional fights and conflicts.however,a similar defect could be identified in placer lafco position,if each county lafco in a multicounty district determines its own sphere of influence for its own little corner of that district,the spheres of the various counties within a single district may conflict.
placer lafco argues an example of a potential conflict is shown by this case,as follows northstar lies entirely within placer county and provides a range of collection,fire protection,emergency services,potable water,snow removal,road maintenance,street lighting,and solid waste disposal.tsd provides a single both placer county and nevada county.tsd current sphere of influence was adopted by nevada lafco.there is presently no conflict between tsd sphere as adopted by nevada lafco and northstar sphere as adopted by placer lafco.however,in july,tsd approved a placer county sphere of influence,proposed to expand its sphere in placer county to include land that overlays a substantial portion of northstar existing sphere.placer lafco argues that,if nevada lafco has exclusive authority to determine tsd sphere within placer county,then placer lafco would have no role in determining whether there is a need for tsd to provide services to an area within the existing sphere of northstar.once the sphere is established,any request to annex territory is made directly to nevada lafco,and placer lafco would have no authority to determine whether it is appropriate for the territory to be served by tsd or northstar.placer lafco complains it and local planning agencies will have no participation in decisions affecting them.placer lafco says that,under its proposal,principal counties will continue to retain jurisdiction over annexations to a multicounty district that occur in an adjacent county,but the appropriateness of that annexation and its impact on service and development issues in placer county already will have been considered by placer county.placer lafco argues that if principal counties have jurisdiction over spheres of influence in neighboring counties,then a lafco would have the authority to extend the boundaries of a district that is located solely within the boundaries of that county into an adjacent county,claim principal county status,and set a sphere for such district that conflicts with the planning and community attitudes of the adjacent county,a scenario in direct conflict with the express wording and purpose of the act.
nevada lafco responds overlapping spheres would not be the end of the world,but in any event,placer lafco arguments are an exaggeration,because the act has safeguards to insure input of each local county.for example,before adoption or revision of a sphere of influence,a public hearing must be held,and each affected county and local agency must receive notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard.additionally,contrary to placer lafco unsupported suggestion that commissioners are local officials accountable only to residents of that county,section directs commissioners to exercise their independent judgment on behalf of the interests of residents,property owners,and the public as a whole and represent the interests of the public as a whole and not solely the interests of the appointing authority.the act also has safeguards against arbitrary action by a foreign lafco with respect to decisions on changes of organization,because dissatisfied citizens can force the matter to a vote and override the decision.
as an example of potential conflict,placer lafco hypothesizes that it and all of its five neighboring counties are principal counties to multicounty districts that provide a variety of services in these counties and asks questions such as do six different lafcos have exclusive jurisdiction to determine potentially conflicting spheres of influence for agencies serving one county and could a small county larger neighbors allow the expansion of multicounty districts into the smaller county over the smaller county objection however,the last question is disingenuous,because it involves expansion,which is a change of organization,and placer lafco does not dispute that the principal county lafco has exclusive jurisdiction over changes of organization.thus,as conceded by placer lafco,different lafcos may be responsible for changes of organization within a county under the act,because placer lafco has jurisdiction for changes in districts covering only placer county,while whatever county is the principal county has jurisdiction for changes in multicounty districts that include but are not limited to placer county.as to potentially conflicting spheres of influence,placer lafco position that a single multicounty district should have multiple simultaneous spheres of influence also creates a potential for conflicts.
thus,placer lafco fails to prove its assertion that as long as each lafco is held to retain the jurisdiction to establish spheres of influence affecting territory within its own county,there can be no conflict.
to the contrary,nevada lafco does identify potential conflicts that might arise from placer lafco position.thus,nevada lafco argues placer lafco interpretation of the act would split responsibility for the planning process spheres of influence and service reviews from the.it would have the lafco of each affected county adopting a service review and sphere of influence plan for each multicounty district within the county.then the principal county lafco would have to use the affected county sphere plan and service review to base its decisions within the affected county.nevada lafco says this might not present a problem if the planning documents were simple and uniform,but that is not the case.the legislature has not enacted a uniform planning process,and each lafco adopts its own policies and procedures,subd.a each commission shall establish written policies and procedures.thus,nevada lafco will follow its own policies even if it were to use placer lafco sphere plans and service reviews.sphere plans and service reviews may vary from lafco to lafco.nevada county directs our attention to the written policies of placer lafco and nevada lafco,submitted to this court by a s tipulation to a ugment r ecord,which we granted.nevada lafco policies include six pages of requirements for spheres of influence.placer lafco policies include only a page and a half on spheres of influence.since decisions with respect to changes of organization must be consistent with spheres of influence,nevada lafco as principal county with exclusive jurisdiction over changes of organization may find itself required to base its decision on information that placer lafco did not require or include in its sphere plan.
nevada lafco also argues placer lafco position balkanizes the planning process between counties,because there would be a separate sphere of influence and service review in each county in which a multicounty district provided service,potentially subjecting the principal county lafco to varying requirements for each lafco.nevada lafco further argues such balkanization would discourage analysis of issues on a regional basis.nevada lafco cites as an example the valley area,but nevada lafco gives no citation to anything in the record to support its factual assertions about this area and respondents cite only to the statement of decision,which cited a trial brief,and we therefore will not consider it as a factual matter.we can,however,consider the point as a hypothetical in which integrated facilities of a multicounty district serve an area that is essentially a single community but that crosses a county line.each county lafco could decide,based on a limited study of that county only,that there is adequate capacity to double the service demands for that county.neither county lafco would have considered the combined impact of their decisions,and it could result in overtaxing the system capacity.
thus,placer lafco theory of the case will not result in an absence of conflicts.
placer lafco argues the considerations that go into determining spheres of influence,as required by section,subdivision e fn,ante,planned land uses in the area,need for services,are the types of considerations that can only be made by a local lafco,not a neighboring principal county lafco.the subdivision refers to matters such as present and planned land uses,need for and present capacity of public facilities,and existence of any social or economic communities of interest in the area if determined relevant by the commission.placer lafco fails to show why these determinations can be made only by the local lafco.we need not address points in appellate briefs that are unsupported by adequate factual or legal analysis.badie bank of america th,d kim sumitomo bank th,d in re marriage of nichols th,fn,d.
placer lafco cites section,which in describing the purposes of a commission says,one of the objects of the commission is to make studies and to obtain and furnish information which will contribute to the logical and reasonable development of local agencies in each county and to shape the development of local agencies so as to advantageously provide for the present and future needs of each county and its communities.we disagree that this statute preserves jurisdiction in placer lafco over multicounty districts for which placer lafco is not the principal county.this statute,which describes the objects of the commission applies equally to nevada lafco,which is also a commission.
placer lafco argues the statutory definition of principal county in section was amended in to add the language about changes of organization,after enactment of section.however,placer lafco fails to support this point with adequate authority,instead referring us to an entire trial brief of another party.we need not address this unsupported and undeveloped argument,and it is improper simply to incorporate by reference papers filed in the trial court.badie bank of america,supra,th at,d kim sumitomo bank,supra,th at,d in re marriage of nichols,supra,th at,fn,d garrick dev.hayward unified school dist.th,d.additionally,we observe that even before,section contained the language about changes of organization.stats,ch.this observation illustrates the importance of the requirement that appellate briefs provide an adequate factual and legal analysis.
placer lafco argues that,because there is a statutory definition for affected county as a county with territory for which a change of organization is proposed,and this definition corresponds with the principal county definition,and there is no statutory definition for a lafco which establishes a sphere of influence in another county,then principal county must be restricted to situations involving a change of organization.we disagree.
under a separate heading about service reviews,placer lafco argues in its opening brief that the trial court erroneously determined that a principal county lafco was vested with exclusive authority to conduct service reviews for multicounty districts 
placer lafco cites section,which provides in part that the commission shall conduct a service review of the municipal services provided in the county or other appropriate area designated by the commission.we reject the argument that this language means only placer lafco can conduct a service review of services in placer county.
