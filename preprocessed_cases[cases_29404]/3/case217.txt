we are asked to decide claims of mexican temporary farmworkers under the fair labor standards act and relevant state law.
peri sons is a nevada corporation that produces,harvests,and packages onions the plaintiffs are victor rivera rivera and other mexican citizens the farmworkers admitted to the united states to cultivate,harvest,and process onions on peri sons farm.since,peri sons has hired such foreign workers through the h program of the united states department of labor dol.
american agricultural employers may hire aliens for temporary labor under the h program if the dol certifies that 
a there are not sufficient workers who are able,willing,and qualified,and who will be available at the time and place needed,to perform the labor or services involved in the petition,and 
b the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the united states similarly employed.
a.before submitting an application for temporary employment certification,see,an employer must submit a job order,id.a.job orders must comply with various requirements relating to the terms of employment.see,id.
the farmworkers incurred expenses related to their employment with peri sons.some had to pay a hiring or recruitment fee of between and to peri sons employees in order to be considered for employment.all had to obtain h visas from the united states consulate in hermosillo,sonora,mexico.each farmworker paid the necessary fees and covered his own lodging costs in hermosillo.the farmworkers also paid a fee to obtain form i from the united states citizenship and immigration services upon entering the country.these immigration and travel expenses exceeded for each plaintiff.in addition,the farmworkers purchased protective gloves,which were required for the performance of their jobs,at a cost of at least per week.they each also incurred expenses of at least in traveling from peri sons farm in nevada back to their homes in mexico.
the farmworkers claim that these expenses were primarily for peri sons benefit but that the company did not properly reimburse them.
the farmworkers filed their original complaint on february.the operative complaint for this appeal,however,is the second amended complaint sac,which contained four counts.first,the sac alleged that peri sons violated the fair labor standards act flsa,et,partially because it failed to reimburse each farmworker during his first week of employment for travel and immigration expenses.second,it claimed that peri sons breached its employment contracts by violating the terms of the job orders submitted to the dol.third,it alleged violations of nevada laws for failure to pay the minimum wage and failure to pay wages owed under employment contracts.fourth,it asserted violations of the minimum wage requirement in the nevada constitution.
the district court dismissed the sac with prejudice.it rejected the farmworkers flsa claims on the ground that did not treat the relevant expenses as kickbacks.the district court dismissed the breach of contract claims because the farmworkers did not plead specific violations of the contracts beyond reiterating the wage claims.as to the state law statutory and constitutional claims,the district court treated them as redundant and dismissed both for the same reason it dismissed the flsa claims.it also applied a statute of limitations to the wage claims,both state and federal,holding that those having accrued before february,were barred.the farmworkers timely appealed.
both the specific regulations governing the h program and the more general flsa regulations promulgated by the dol control whether and when employers must reimburse employees for inbound travel and immigration expenses.the parties agree that peri sons relationship with the farmworkers is subject to the h regulations but dispute whether it is subject to the flsa regulations.
regulations concerning the h program require employers to reimburse an employee who completes percent of the work contract period for reasonable costs incurred by the worker for transportation and daily subsistence from the place from which the worker has come to work for the employer to the place of employment.h.peri sons argues that this regulation only obligated it to reimburse its employees travel expenses after the employees had completed half of their work rather than during each employees first week.
the flsa,on the other hand,requires that employers reimburse certain expenses during each employee first week of work.see applying the rule to any such workweek.the farmworkers argue that this flsa regulation required peri sons to reimburse them for immigration and travel expenses during the first week of work.peri sons argues that it is not subject to this flsa regulation because applying the flsa regulation to h employees would,as a practical matter,make the h regulation superfluous.peri sons also contends that deducting travel costs would frequently reduce a worker first week wages far below the minimum wage.
we must evaluate such arguments in light of the dol regulatory interpretation.a dol regulation has clarified that the flsa applies independently of the h requirements and imposes obligations on employers regarding payment of wages.h accord id.p an employer must make all deductions from the worker paycheck required by law.before issuing its regulation,the dol had rejected many of the specific arguments raised here by peri sons.see temporary agricultural employment of h aliens in the united states.under chevron,nrdc,we must defer to the dol interpretation if the statutory provision is ambiguous,and the agency interpretation is reasonable.
the flsa certainly does not unambiguously exempt employers from its requirements and related regulations.see requiring e very employer to pay the minimum wage to covered employees id.providing exemptions not relevant to peri sons.thus,the flsa either unambiguously applies the reimbursement requirement to h employers or contains an ambiguity on this point.assuming without deciding that the statute is ambiguous,the dol interpretation is reasonable.because the dol interpretation neither makes it impossible to comply with both provisions nor creates surplusage it is a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.
because peri sons is subject to the flsa reimbursement regulations,we must next decide whether the travel and immigration expenses incurred by the farmworkers are covered by such regulations.
the flsa requires employers to pay at least the federal minimum wage to each employee engaged in commerce.a.an employer has not satisfied the minimum wage requirement unless the compensation is free and clear,meaning the employee has not kicked back part of the compensation to the employer.thus,employers generally may not issue paychecks at the minimum wage rate and then require employees to give some of the money back.an employer may charge its employees for the reasonable cost of providing them board,lodging,or other facilities because such charges are not kickbacks,meaning they can be included in the wage calculation.m.facilities primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer do not count as other facilities and are not included in the wage calculation.d.
to the extent deductions for items not qualifying as board,lodging,or other facilities such as items primarily benefitting the employer lower an employee wages below the minimum wage,they are unlawful.id.b.thus,the question before us is whether the expenses incurred by the farmworkers primarily benefitted peri sons or the farmworkers.
the farmworkers argue that they incurred travel and immigration expenses,including fees associated with recruitment,visas,and i forms,for the benefit of peri sons.peri sons,on the other hand,characterizes immigration expenses as primarily for the benefit of the employee.
the flsa regulations provide an illustrative list of facilities that are primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer 
i tools of the trade and other materials and services incidental to carrying on the employer business ii the cost of any construction by and for the employer iii the cost of uniforms and of their laundering,where the nature of the business requires the employee to wear a uniform.
d see also id.c listing,as a facility primarily for the benefit of the employer,transportation charges where such transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment as in the case of employees of a railroad.meals,however,are always regarded as primarily for the benefit and convenience of the employee.id.c.
the status of inbound travel and immigration expenses is ambiguous under this regulatory standard.travel and proper immigration costs are essential for the h employment relationship to come to fruition.presumably,both employers and employees benefit from the employment relationship.employers can only hire h workers after demonstrating that they are unable to satisfy their labor needs with american workers,see b,so an employer benefit is clear.of course,foreign workers probably would not travel to the united states for temporary employment if employment of a similar quality were available closer to their homes.the employees benefit is also clear.with such clear benefits to both the farmworkers and peri sons,the identity of the primary beneficiary is ambiguous.
when regulations are ambiguous,we are required to defer to an agency reasonable interpretations of those regulations.see auer robbins,because the test is a creature of the secretary own regulations,his interpretation of it is,under our jurisprudence,controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.internal quotation marks omitted.deference,however,is not appropriate if the agency interpretation is nothing more than a convenient litigating position or a post hoc rationalization for its actions rather than a fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.christopher smithkline beecham,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a change in an agency interpretation does not present a separate ground for disregarding the agency present interpretation unless the change leads to unfair surprise.long island care at home,coke.
the dol has expressly addressed the status of inbound travel expenses.section p explains that an h employer who is subject to the flsa may not make deductions that would violate the flsa.p.in a section interpreting p and the flsa regulations,a regulatory preamble provides that an h employer covered by the flsa is responsible for paying inbound transportation costs in the first workweek of employment to the extent that shifting such costs to employees either directly or indirectly would effectively bring their wages below the flsa minimum wage.at.
with regard to immigration and recruitment expenses the preamble incorporated by reference the analysis from a previous field assistance bulletin.id.because of the similar statutory requirements and similar structure of the h and h programs,the same flsa analysis applies to the h program as was set forth in the field assistance bulletin.that analysis stated t ravel and costs necessary for workers hired under the h program are for the primary benefit of their employers,and the employers therefore must reimburse the employees for those costs in the first workweek if the costs reduce the employees wages below the minimum wage.dep t of labor wage and hour,field assistance bulletin,available at http.it also stated that under both the visa program regulations and the flsa,we believe that employers are responsible for paying the fees of any recruiters they retain to recruit foreign workers and provide access to the job opportunity.id.at.
in the face of regulatory ambiguity,the dol determination that inbound travel and immigration expenses primarily benefit h employers was reasonable.there is no reason to think that the dol determination was not a product of its considered judgment.although the dol briefly changed its interpretation at one point in,there is no indication that the change caused any unfair surprise for peri sons therefore,we defer to the dol interpretation.the district court erred in ruling that peri sons was not required to reimburse its employees during the first week of work for inbound travel and immigration expenses to the extent that such expenses lowered their compensation below the minimum wage.
the farmworkers also argue that,under the common law of nevada,peri sons breached their employment contracts by failing to adhere to the terms of the job order.the purported breaches of contract stemmed from not only the flsa violations discussed above but also the refusal to reimburse the farmworkers for the cost of their outbound travel and for the cost of gloves necessary to perform the job.the district court dismissed this claim on the ground that the sac did not plead the breach with sufficient specificity.
the federal rules of civil procedure require federal plaintiffs to include a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.rule a generally requires only a plausible short and plain statement of the plaintiff claim,not an exposition of his legal argument.skinner switzer.such a statement must give the defendant fair notice of the basis for the plaintiffs claims.swierkiewicz sorema.
under nevada law,the plaintiff in a breach of contract action must show the existence of a valid contract,a breach by the defendant,and damage as a result of the breach.saini int l game,d,citing richardson jones.the farmworkers complaint explained the contracts and damages at issue.it asserted that the underlying contracts were the job orders described in paragraphs to of this complaint.such is a plausible claim because i n the absence of a separate,written work contract entered into between the employer and the worker,the required terms of the job order and the certified application for temporary employment certification will be the work contract.q.the sac also claimed that the farmworkers had substantial injuries in the form of lost wages.
the sac alleged breaches by peri sons.employment contracts between h employers and employees must a t a minimum contain all of the provisions required by this section.id.q.such mandatory terms include provisions prohibiting h employers from mak ing deductions that would violate the flsa,id.p,and requiring h employers to provide or pay for the worker transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker departed to work for the employer,id.h.in light of these terms of the contract,the factual allegations incorporated into the breach of contract claim plausibly state a claim.
the district court erred in concluding that the farmworkers had not pled their breach of contract claims with sufficient specificity.such allegations were sufficient to give peri sons fair notice and to make the farmworkers breach of contract claims plausible 
the farmworkers asserted claims under nevada laws that are largely duplicative of their claims under the flsa and their claims for breach of contract.
in claims under nevada revised statutes and,as well as the nevada constitution,the farmworkers allege that peri sons failed to pay the nevada minimum wage under the same kickback theory on which they relied for their flsa claims.the district court dismissed these claims on the same grounds that it dismissed the flsa claims,reasoning that the nevada supreme court would follow federal precedent on this issue.we agree with the district court that the nevada supreme court would probably interpret nevada law to follow federal law on this issue.directing the labor commissioner to set the minimum wage in accordance with federal law.admin.code a prohibiting an employer from deduct ing any amount from the wages due an employee unless t he employer has a reasonable basis to believe that the employee is responsible for the amount being deducted.
peri sons claims that the nevada courts would not interpret state law to follow federal law on this issue.the cases on which peri sons relies,however,merely indicate that the nevada courts do not interpret state law in accordance with federal law when the relevant statutes contain materially different language.in boucher shaw,the
