background 
the facts in this case are not in dispute.in,the florida department of agriculture and consumer services fdacs initiated an eradication program to prevent the spread of citrus canker,a plant disease that results in unmarketable fruit.the fdacs program required the identification and removal of florida citrus trees infected with citrus canker.
in november and june congress appropriated federal funds to make payments to florida citrus grove owners affected by the citrus canker eradication program.see,consolidated appropriations act,pub,app.e,tit.ii,stat,agricultural risk protection act of,tit.ii,e,stat.these statutes provided for payments to compensate citrus growers for trees destroyed by the state of florida due to an outbreak of citrus canker.the united states department of agriculture usda published an interim rule describing the methodology for calculating payments pursuant to these appropriations.citrus canker payments for commercial citrus tree replacement.october,subsequently codified at.the agency provided for payment at the rate of per tree,and limited such payments to a maximum number of trees per acre.the number of trees per acre varied depending on the type of fruit.the per acre limitation was imposed as the productivity and hence value of fruit trees is inversely proportional to the number of trees planted per lower the density,the greater the productivity and value.a per acre limitation thus prevents the overcompensation of growers with higher density acreage in calculating the per acre limit,usda used data on the varietal average number of trees per acre reported by the florida citrus industry to the usda national agricultural statistics service through the florida agriculture statistics service.id.at.the florida agricultural statistics service produced data,in collaboration with the florida citrus industry,on citrus production in the state.these data included information on citrus acreage and the total number of trees,by variety of citrus,county,and year of inventory.florida agricultural statistics service,fdacs,commercial citrus inventory.these published data on citrus acreage,the source of the usda compensation amounts,limited the definition of acreage to land which is actually planted with citrus trees but excluded b ayheads,ponds,sinkholes,drainage canals,lateral and swale ditches,roads,turn rows,and wide middles.id.at vi.in order to secure payment under the interim regulations,the claimant was required to attach a copy of the fdacs order requiring the destruction.at.such orders listed the number of trees destroyed and the number of acres affected.
against this backdrop,on october,congress enacted the statute involved here,an act making appropriations for agriculture,rural development,food and drug administration,and related agencies programs for the fiscal year ending,stat.section of the statute appropriated funds for the secretary of agriculture to provide assistance to florida citrus growers whose trees were removed as a result of citrus canker control efforts,tit.viii,stat,hereinafter section.after passage of the act,the interim regulation of the usda concerning tree replacement was adopted as the final regulation for tree replacement payments.
section continued the existing policy of paying tree replacement costs for destroyed citrus trees.the relevant legislative history indicated that congress was aware of these earlier agency efforts and approved the agency actions.see,at noting previous usda actions,at noting how the committee original compensation figure was derived based on estimates of affected acreage and years of lost production.this congressional awareness of past agency practice was directly reflected in the text of the statute.
section a incorporated the limits on tree replacement payments that had already been established by usda,authorizing payments to florida commercial citrus and lime growers of for each commercial citrus or lime tree removed to control citrus canker in order to allow for tree replacement and associated business costs and using the same trees per acre limitations for such payments.id 
the statute for the first time provided for lost production income payments,under section b,which stated that t he secretary of agriculture shall compensate florida commercial citrus and lime growers for lost production,as determined by the secretary of agriculture,with respect to trees removed to control citrus canker.id.while the lost production provision of the statute did not specify a per acre limit,the implementing challenged on this rates for lost production payments for each variety of citrus,and these payments were calculated using the same per acre caps provided in section a,codified at b.the regulations governing both tree production and lost production payments also required that claimants completed application should be accompanied by a copy of the public order directing the destruction of the trees and its accompanying inventory.c c.the regulations explicitly referenced the fact that the inventory on the public order noted the number and the variety of trees removed,and in the case of the regulation for lost production payments,the regulation noted that the inventory included a description of the acreage.id.section e provided that the secretary of agriculture shall use of the funds of the commodity credit corporation to carry out this section,to remain available until expended.id.
over the course of a period,beginning in june of,fdacs issued public orders resulting in the removal of citrus trees owned by and,fed.cl.at.the inventories contained in these public orders set forth the number of trees to be destroyed and the affected acres.thus,for example,the november,order mandating the destruction of star ruby grapefruit trees,listed a total of trees and acres.
both appellants and ruby red filed claims for benefits with usda pursuant to section.their claims,in compliance with the implementing regulations,attached the fdacs public orders.appellants used the fdacs tree estimates and acreage calculations as specified in the destruction orders as a basis for their requested tree replacement and lost production costs.c c.between november and july,received payments on its claims totaling and ruby red received a total of in payments,fed.cl.at.usda used the affected acreage as reported in the florida orders,that is,the acreage actually planted with trees,in calculating the section benefit payments for appellants,as it did for all other claimants.id.
on september,appellants submitted amended claims to usda asserting that they were owed more money because the payments they had already received should have been calculated using what they there called grove acreage,rather than the standard acreage figures used by the state in the original destruction order.grove acreage has been defined for the purpose of this litigation as acreage which includes not only the acreage of the groves containing the trees destroyed,but also acreage excluded from the officially reported statistics of the florida citrus industry,the unplanted acreage used to support the trees destroyed,including land for harvesting,for maintenance machinery,for staging areas,for swales and for water treatment areas.id.at.the appellants claimed grove acreage was more than times the size of the acreage used in their original submission apparently,no other citrus growers besides appellants have submitted amended claims seeking payment upon a grove acre basis.on october,the usda denied these claims,noting its current policy for determining compensation is based on acreage figures that are provided by the state on its destruction order documents that describe the actual acres of trees that were required to be destroyed and that it was difficult to see how we could be expected to pay compensation for areas that were not actually planted in citrus and from which there is no direct loss.at.when the claims were filed and denied,the usda had not exhausted the appropriated under section,fed.cl.at.
more than a year later,on may,after the appropriated funds had been exhausted,appellants filed suit in the court of federal claims,alleging that the usda had breached its statutory and regulatory obligations by calculating their payments based on incorrect acreage and seeking recovery for and for ruby red for tree replacement costs and for lost production payments for and for ruby red.the government argued that the was a statutory cap and because the funds had been fully expended by usda before appellants filed suit,the claims should be dismissed.in granting the government summary judgment motion,the court of federal claims first held that the statutory language of section e established a cap of on the funds available for the citrus canker program,such that o nce the established funds are used up,no further payments under the program may be made,fed.cl.at.the court rejected appellants argument that even if section set a maximum expenditure of,they had a vested right to payment because they submitted their amended claims at a time when there were still funds available.id.at.the court found that no relief was available to appellants because the appropriation had been exhausted by the time suit was filed.the court did not reach the issue whether the government had calculated the payments correctly.id.at.
this appeal followed.after oral argument,we instructed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on w hether the secretary of agriculture erred in determining that,and should be interpreted to provide for payment to citrus growers on a net acreage basis.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.we review the grant of summary judgment without deference.thompson cherokee nation of,cherokee i,aff,cherokee nation of leavitt,d cherokee ii.
discussion 
we first address the holding of the court of federal claims that section imposed a statutory cap.the statute provides that t he secretary of agriculture shall use of the funds of the commodity credit corporation to carry out this section,to remain available until expended.e.if the statute imposes a cap,payments in excess of the cap would violate the act.a a see also highland montgomery cent.sch.dist.united states.appellants contend that the language does not establish a cap,arguing that,in the absence of express limiting phrases such as not to exceed or not more than,there can be no statutory cap on appropriations,and pointing out that elsewhere in this appropriations legislation the phrases not to exceed,not more than,and up to are used to denote a statutory cap.see,fed.cl.at summarizing appellants tallying of the occurrence of these phrases in.
in considering the effect of appropriations language both the supreme court and this court have recognized that the general accounting office publication,principles of federal appropriations law hereinafter the gao redbook provides significant guidance.cherokee ii.at lincoln vigil,d see also cherokee i,at collecting cases.in one respect,the gao redbook supports appellants.it states the most effective way to establish a maximum earmark is by the words not to exceed or not more than.gao redbook,ed.but the gao redbook also recognizes that t he shall be available family of earmarking language presumptively fences in the earmarked sum both maximum and minimum but is more subject to variation based upon underlying congressional intent.id.in other words,the shall be available language can establish a cap if congress so intends.
recently,in the cherokee case,both our court and the supreme court had occasion to address similar language in the contract context.the case involved a contract between indian tribes and the department of the interior which made the government liability subject to the availability of appropriations.the pertinent appropriations legislation stated of the funds provided,shall remain available until expended for the transitional costs of initial or expanded tribal contracts.cherokee i,at internal quotation marks omitted.both we,and on review,the supreme court,held that this appropriations language did not impose a statutory cap and that there were sufficient unrestricted funds available to make the payments.id.at,cherokee ii.at.each opinion left open the possibility that in other circumstances the language might be construed to impose a cap.in cherokee i,we noted that there was no indication from the statutory context or otherwise that the shall remain available language constituted anything other than a typical carryover provision.at.in cherokee ii,the supreme court noted its obligation to give this kind of statutory language its ordinary interpretation,at least in the absence of a showing that congress meant the contrary and that the government,in our view,has provided no convincing argument for a special,rather than ordinary,interpretation here.at.the supreme court and we both concluded that there was no legislative history pointing to an intention to impose a statutory cap.cherokee i,at the supreme court emphasized particularly the fact that a contract was involved,and the need for predictability in such circumstances,in order to provide a uniform interpretation of similar language used in comparable statutes,lest legal uncertainty undermine contractors confidence that they will be paid,and in turn increase the cost to the government of purchasing goods and services.cherokee ii.at.here,by contrast,the government is not seeking to limit contractual liability,but to limit benefit payments.in this context,considerations of predictability are far less significant,and we conclude that there is greater room to rely on other indicia of congressional intent,such as legislative history,to ascertain the congressional purpose.for example,in highland falls,we directly addressed similar statutory language within the context of a benefits program and found it to impose a cap.at.we agreed with the court of federal claims that,in context,statutory language such as shall be for entitlements under section of the act,established an earmarked appropriation that was binding on the agency.id.at.
here,the legislative history shows a clear intent to impose a statutory cap.the conference report,curiously not cited in either side brief,leaves no room to doubt that congress intended benefits available under section to be capped at.the conference report states that the language of section directs the secretary of agriculture to use not more than for replacement of citrus trees and for compensation for losses as a result of citrus canker.conf,at emphasis added.while the supreme court cherokee decision confirmed that it is inappropriate to rely upon legislative history to establish the existence of a statutory cap that is not contained in the text of the statute itself,see,cherokee ii.at,at the same time it agreed that such legislative history can be used to resolve ambiguities in the statutory text,id.at given the context here,the statutory text is ambiguous,and the conference report makes clear that congress intended to cap the total benefits available under section at,and we read the statute as imposing a cap.
the question remains,however,as to the effect of the cap.here the appellants argue that they made their amended claims on september,and that the available funds were not expended until march of.they further argue that the date of the claim rather than the may date their suit was filed in the court of federal claims,or the march date that judgment was entered should determine the availability of funds.no similar question was presented in,where congress had underfunded the entitlements at issue,and th
