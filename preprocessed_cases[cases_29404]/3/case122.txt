dairy farmers located mainly in wisconsin brought this suit to enjoin an amendment to the federal rules regulating the price of milk.the amendment,adopted by the department after a formal rulemaking proceeding,is published at c,and explained in milk in the mideast marketing area interim order amending the order.july.these rules are called milk marketing orders,and so the amendment is also a milk marketing order.the district judge held that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the amendment,not in the article iii sense that the plaintiffs had suffered and would suffer no harm from the amendment,or would derive no benefit from a judgment invalidating the amendment,but in the sense of having been denied by congress a right to sue.so he dismissed the suit for lack of federal jurisdiction.but he went on to declare that,if he was wrong about jurisdiction,the suit would still have to be dismissed because the plaintiffs challenge lacked merit.the plaintiffs have appealed,challenging the judge ruling on standing and also arguing that if there is standing we should reach the merits and vacate the amendment because the department of agriculture failed to give them proper notice concerning the relief that might emerge from the rulemaking proceeding.while the department defends the judge ruling on standing,it has also responded to the plaintiffs argument on the merits.the merits having thus been fully briefed,we can decide them if there is standing.
the federal scheme for regulating the price of milk pivots on the fact that milk is more highly valued by the market when it is sold for fluid consumption than when it is sold as an input into the manufacture of cheese or other dairy products.if milk were perishable,as it was in the days before refrigerated storage and transportation,dairy farmers serving urban markets where milk is more likely to be consumed in fluid form than made into cheese or butter would get higher prices for their output than dairy farmers remote from cities,who being unable to ship their milk a long distance would perforce sell most of it to manufacturers of cheese and other dairy products.but when refrigerated storage and transportation arrived on the scene,it became feasible for the remote dairy dairy farmers,for ship milk to cities in other states,pushing down the price of fluid milk there and so hurting the dairy farmers who were located near those cities.
this was a natural,procompetitive development,as in other cases in which a reduction in the cost of transportation enlarges geographic markets.but the federal regulatory scheme for milk,like so much economic regulation adopted during the great depression of the much of it,however,since abolished as a consequence of the deregulation movement,is premised on dissatisfaction with the results of competition,polemically described as ruinous by those producer interests that it pinches.for a near unintelligible description of conditions thought to render competition among dairy farmers unworkable,see nebbia new york.to limit the competition between remote and proximate dairy farmers for the lucrative business of the cities,congress in the agricultural marketing agreement act of,stat,as amended,et,authorized the department of agriculture to proceed as follows.the department fixes a minimum price for each class of milk,with class determined by end use thus the price fixed for milk intended for fluid consumption is higher than the price fixed for milk intended for cheese.this value of service pricing,conventional in regulated industries,is actually a form of price discrimination,that is,pricing guided not by cost the cost of producing milk is the same regardless of the use to which the milk is put by the purchaser,as under competition,but by differences across consumers in willingness to pay.price discrimination increases sellers profits,thus counteracting the alleged though almost certainly spurious tendency of dairy farmers to destroy their business by competing overvigorously.more realistically,milk price discrimination is intended to redistribute wealth from consumers to producers of milk.
farmers of course do not sell directly to the ultimate consumer.the direct purchasers of milk from dairy farmers are referred to as handlers.they might be owners of supply plants of which more later,or milk distributors,cheese factories,or other intermediaries in the milk market.it is the handlers who pay the prices fixed by the federal regulators.the revenues generated by the discriminatory pricing scheme and received in the first instance by the handlers are pooled,and each dairy farmer whose sales contributed to the pool receives a share of the revenues that is equal to his percentage not of the total revenues of the pool members but of their total physical output.by virtue of this method of dividing up the pie,each farmer receives the same price called a blended price for each unit of milk that he sells regardless of the end use of his milk.a farmer who sold all his milk to a cheese factory in fact most milk produced in wisconsin is used to make cheese,rather than being drunk would receive from the pool the same price per unit of output as a farmer who sold all his milk for fluid consumption,even though the handler would have paid a much lower price for the former than for the latter milk.the result,or at least the intended result,is that the first farmer in our example,the one who sells all his milk to a cheese factory,will have no incentive to divert some of his output to the fluid market,where the price is higher,because the price that he receives for the milk he sells is independent of the use to which that milk is put.such a diversion,what economists call arbitrage,would undermine and,if uncontrolled,eventually destroy the scheme of discriminatory pricing and thus reduce the incomes of dairy farmers as a group.the distant farmers are kept in their place,as it selling locally to the cheesemakers rather than trying to sell to distributors in the being given a share of revenues.
the fly in the ointment,and the cause of the present litigation,is that the agriculture department has divided the nation into regions and fixed different blended prices in the different regions.the blended price is higher in regions in which consumption is a higher fraction of total milk use,because in such regions a higher fraction of milk is sold to handlers at the high minimum price that the agriculture department has set for milk consumed in fluid form.the mideast,which comprises indiana,michigan,ohio,and parts of pennsylvania and west virginia,is one of these regions.wisconsin,which is a large manufacturer of cheese,is not in the mideast region and the blended price in its region is lower because of the high fraction of its milk output that goes to make cheese rather than being drunk.naturally,therefore,wisconsin dairy farmers would like to sell as much of their milk in the mideast as they can and for the further reason that the department has fixed a higher minimum price for milk sold for consumption in fluid form in the mideast states than in wisconsin,see or rather,they would like as many of their sales as possible to be pooled with the mideast producers sales and so be remunerated at the higher mideast blended price.for they have no wish to incur the costs of actually shipping their milk to the mideast they would much rather continue to ship it to nearby cheese factories in wisconsin,their traditional customers.to the extent that wisconsin milk production is pooled with that of the mideast dairy farmers,the latter will lose revenues because the wisconsinites will be taking out revenue at the mideast blended price while contributing to the pool the revenue generated by sales at lower prices to the cheese factories.if all their output were sold to cheese factories,the revenue they would be contributing to the pool would be their output multiplied by the low price fixed for the sale of milk destined for use as an input into the making of cheese,while the revenues they would be receiving as their share of the mideast pool would be their output multiplied by the mideast blended price.
to limit the type of arbitrage described in the preceding paragraph,the agriculture department has long required that a supply handler that buys milk from the farmer for storage and percent of its milk into a region in order to be eligible for the blended price fixed for that region.if it does sell percent there,however,its entire output,not just the percent,qualifies for the region blended price.moreover,the agriculture department also authorizes a practice called paper pooling,which permits a supply plant in one region to associate with dairy farmers in another region,who by virtue of the association which can be completely treated as if they shipped their milk to the supply plant.thus,if a dairy farm in indiana is associated with a milk supply plant in wisconsin,but sells its milk to a milk distributor in indiana and ships the milk directly there rather than via the supply plant,its sales,though entirely within indiana,nevertheless are counted as part of the percent of the wisconsin supply plant sales that must be made in the mideast region in order to allow the supply plant entire sales to be included in the mideast pool.ten percent of the percent must actually be shipped into the distant region,but the other percent need not be.so the nominal percent requirement is reduced to percent.a supply plant in wisconsin,buying all its milk from local farmers,need ship only percent of its milk to the mideast to qualify for the mideast blended price for its entire output,so long as another percent is supplied by mideast dairy farmers associated with the wisconsin plant.
the rationale for paper pooling,which makes perfectly good sense,is that farmers should be permitted to ship directly to distributors,without having to go through supply plants.and until,paper pooling did not create significant arbitrage opportunities,because the agriculture department forbade distant supply plants to receive the full blended price in the region of their associated dairy farmers.but the prohibition was rescinded that year,see,and with that rescission paper pooling became a loophole through which the wisconsin dairy farmers rushed.the amendment they challenge closes the loophole by forbidding the qualifying percent to include local shipments from distant supply plants.c.if a supply plant in wisconsin wants to associate with a dairy farmer in the mideast region,so that sales by that farmer will qualify for the mideast blended price,the plant must now require the farmer to ship his milk to the supply plant for reshipment to customers in the mideast.the plaintiffs criticize the requirement because it is often more economical for the dairy farmer to bypass the supply plant,especially as the quality of the milk may drop when it is pumped into and then out of the supply plant,and especially when the farmer and the distributor are near each other but distant from the supply plant.were the blended price in the mideast sufficiently high,an indiana dairy farmer might be induced to ship his milk to a wisconsin supply plant for resale to an indiana milk distributor,in order that the dairy farmer output would contribute to the supply plant making its percent quota.that would be a great waste.but the plaintiffs criticism is neither here nor there,since the only challenge they mount in this court to the amendment is that it was adopted without proper notice to them.
before we consider that issue,which is the issue on the merits,we must satisfy ourselves that the plaintiffs have a right to seek judicial review of the agriculture department order amending the mideast milk marketing order.the district judge,as we mentioned,thought they did not.the circuits have divided over the question.compare minnesota milk producers ass madigan,cir farmers union milk marketing yeutter,cir,and suntex dairy bergland,cir,all holding that milk producers dairy farmers do have a right to judicial review of milk marketing orders,with united dairymen of arizona veneman,cir,and pescosolido block,cir,holding that they do not.the judge thought that this court had taken the latter position in uelmen freeman,cir see also united milk producers benson,a similar case,and he felt bound by that decision,which in addition he thought bolstered by the supreme court ruling in block community nutrition institute,d,that consumers do not have standing to challenge milk market orders.
uelmen is not controlling.the supreme court had held in stark wickard,that even though the milk marketing law did not in so many words confer on producers a right to judicial review of milk marketing orders,they could challenge such an order if in issuing it the agriculture department had exceeded the authority delegated to it by congress and in doing so had infringed a definite right of the producer,id.at,criteria not satisfied in uelmen.the plaintiffs in our case seek judicial review not on the basis of the extrastatutory rule of stark,at,but on the basis of the administrative procedure act,which confers a right to mount a judicial challenge to agency action on persons adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,unless the statute in question preclude s judicial review.a.section certainly describes these plaintiffs,who are injured in their pocketbooks by having their access to the mideast blended price,which is higher than the blended price in their region,curtailed.moreover,dairy farmers,the plaintiffs in this case,are,as the court noted in stark,at,the very group that the milk marketing law seeks to protect.the right of judicial review is ordinarily inferred where congressional intent to protect the interests of the class of which the plaintiff is a member can be found in such cases,unless members of the protected class may have judicial review the statutory objectives might not be realized.barlow collins,d see also american federation of government employees,local cohen,cir first national bank trust national credit union administration.
the agriculture department argues that the milk marketing law repeals so much of the apa as would otherwise entitle dairy farmers to challenge a milk marketing order that harmed them.the milk marketing law expressly authorizes judicial review of milk marketing orders at the behest of handlers,but is silent on the right of a dairy farmer that is,a producer,rather than a purchaser from the producer to get judicial review.the department asks us to infer from this silence that congress meant to preclude judicial review by farmers,thus bringing this case within a.but inferences from congressional silence are treacherous oversights are common in the of congressional enactment omissions are not enactments and even deliberate omissions are often subject to alternative interpretations,as here.handlers are not indifferent to the price of milk,since they are the purchasers of milk from the dairy farmers.but as middlemen,able to pass on a portion,maybe a very large portion,of any higher price to their milk distributors,cheese factories,and so may be indifferent to many changes in milk marketing orders,including the one at issue in this case,which basically transfers wealth from mideast to wisconsin dairy farmers.no such indifference can attend the farmers who have brought the present suit every additional cent they receive for their milk goes directly to their bottom line.congress may have thought it obvious that as the intended beneficiaries of milk marketing orders,dairy farmers could challenge those orders in court,but not obvious that handlers could,and so it expressly authorized suits by them as well.
history supports this interpretation.what is now the milk marketing law was originally a part of the first agricultural adjustment act,passed in,stat,and that act contained no provision for judicial review of pricing orders issued under it,including milk marketing orders.the statutory provision authorizing handlers to sue was added to the aaa in and was retained when the act provisions dealing with milk marketing were split off and made the subject of a separate statute,the statute involved in this case,the agricultural marketing agreement act of.block community nutrition institute,
