this case presents an apparent conflict between a native american tribe desire to build homes for its members and willits valley residents efforts to preserve open space for agricultural uses.the mendocino county board of supervisors voted to grant the sherwood valley rancheria request for cancellation of williamson act agricultural use restrictions on land the tribe sought to develop.it issued a negative declaration that the tribe limited project would have no significant environmental impacts.the trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing mendocino county to set aside its approvals.because we conclude that the decision to adopt a negative declaration was permitted as a matter of law and the decision to cancel the agricultural use restrictions was supported by substantial evidence,we reverse.
background 
the sherwood valley rancheria tribe consists of approximately members of the pomo indian tribe.the willits valley is its aboriginal territory.its existing land is insufficient to provide homes for the current members of the tribe approximately families are now on a waiting list for adequate housing.the tribe has obtained a community development grant from the united states department of housing and urban development hud for use in acquiring additional land and constructing additional homes.
in may,after approximately two years of searching unsuccessfully for suitable additional land,the tribe settled on acquiring the bettansid ranch ranch,a parcel two and miles east of willits,california.the tribe intended to convey the ranch to the federal government in trust for the tribe and then construct homes on three and acres of the property.
the ranch consists of two distinct regions.the flat valley bottomland portion,approximately acres to the west of east side road,is prime agricultural land when irrigated.however,it has not been actively farmed since.the hilly upland portion,approximately acres to the east of east side road,has never been considered prime agricultural land.the tribe plan calls for constructing homes in a cluster in this upland portion of the ranch,reforesting the remainder of the upland side,and planting orchards in the bottomlands.
since,the ranch has been the subject of a williamson act contract between the county of mendocino county and the ranch owners,bettansid ranch.the williamson act establishes a mechanism for saving agricultural land by allowing counties to create agricultural preserves and then to enter into contracts with landowners within those preserves,et a williamson act contract obligates the landowner to maintain the land as agricultural for or more years,with resulting tax benefits.absent contrary action,each year the contract renews for an additional year,so that the use restrictions are always in place for the next to years.
three methods exist for terminating a williamson act contract.the county or the landowner may give notice of nonrenewal,in which case automatic renewal will cease and the contract will expire at the end of its remaining term.alternatively,the landowner may petition the county for cancellation of the contract,and the county may approve the petition upon finding that cancellation is in the public interest or is consistent with the purposes of the williamson act.finally,the government may institute eminent domain proceedings.a taking nullifies the contract.
as a condition of the release of any funds,hud required that the williamson act restrictions on use of the ranch be lifted.in september,bettansid ranch,and the tribe jointly applied to the county for cancellation of the williamson act contract.also in september,bettansid ranch,gave notice of nonrenewal of the williamson act contract.consequently,absent cancellation,the williamson act restrictions would expire in or.
the tribe commissioned an analysis of the environmental impacts of williamson act cancellation and construction of the planned homes the project in order to comply with the national environmental policy act and hud requirements for use of grant money.in addition,the tribe commissioned a report on biological resources and a report on archaeological resources.we refer to the environmental,biological,and archeological reports collectively as the environmental assessment.the environmental assessment concluded that the project would not result in any significant environmental impacts provided that several small archaeological sites were avoided in construction.
on november,the mendocino county lands program committee voted to recommend approval of the cancellation.the dissenting member expressed concerns that the project would induce further growth both and in the surrounding area.
the county department of planning and building services planning staff subsequently prepared an initial study of environmental impacts.the initial study reported no impacts on traffic flow,drainage,water resources,or growth rates.it did identify issues concerning archaeological and natural resources.the initial study concurred with the conclusion of the environmental assessment that so long as development avoided the archaeological sites on the ranch,there would be little impact on archaeological resources.as for natural resources,the initial study concluded that the project would result in a reduction in acreage for agricultural crops and an alteration of an agricultural resource protection zone.the planning staff viewed any voluntary agreement by the tribe not to develop the acres of bottomland as unenforceable.because of this impact,and because the planning staff believed findings related to general plan consistency were required and could not be made,the planning staff recommended denial of cancellation.nevertheless,in the event the planning commission or board of supervisors ultimately approved the project,the planning staff prepared a draft negative declaration.
on march,influenced by the initial study concerns about a loss of agricultural land,the agricultural commissioner,one of the lands program committee members who had voted for cancellation,reversed his recommendation.on march,concurring with the recommendations of its staff,the planning commission voted to deny the petition for cancellation.
the tribe appealed to the mendocino county board of supervisors board of supervisors.on april,the board of supervisors held a lengthy public hearing and voted to adopt a negative declaration that cancellation and subsequent development would have no significant environmental impacts.it also tentatively approved the cancellation application and scheduled a further hearing to follow circulation of documents to various state agencies.in july,the board of supervisors confirmed its tentative decision and granted the tribe petition to cancel the williamson act contract by a vote.
a critical factor underlying the approvals was the tribe submission of a proposed land use agreement agreement.the agreement,signed on april,and subsequently recorded as a covenant running with the land,obligated the tribe to comply with the terms of the prior williamson act contract on the bottomland portion of the ranch until september.the tribe also agreed to waive its sovereign immunity for the limited purpose of allowing the county to seek specific enforcement of the agreement.the agreement included as a condition precedent that the county cancel the williamson act restrictions.
within one month of approval of the project,this lawsuit followed.a group of local residents calling themselves friends of the east willits valley friends brought a mandamus action to challenge the county adoption of a negative declaration under the california environmental quality act ceqa and cancellation of the williamson act contract.bettansid ranch,and the tribe were named as real parties in interest.in a prior unpublished decision,we rejected initial challenges to trial court jurisdiction over the tribe,concluding that because the tribe had made a general appearance,it waived its sovereign immunity.
after full briefing and a hearing,the trial court granted the petition for a writ of mandamus.it concluded that substantial evidence prevented the county from adopting a negative declaration and required it to prepare an environmental impact report eir.it further held that no substantial evidence supported the decision to grant williamson act cancellation and that the grant of cancellation was therefore an abuse of discretion.it also reversed the county findings of consistency with its own general plan.the tribe has timely appealed.
during the pendency of this appeal,the tribe applied to the bureau of indian affairs bia to have the ranch accepted into trust by the united states the bia granted an initial approval.friends appealed to the department of interior board of indian appeals,notifying it of this proceeding and asking that approval be denied,but its appeal was denied for lack of standing.on april,the bia issued a final determination accepting the ranch into trust,and on june the tribe conveyed title to the ranch to the united states in trust for the tribe.
discussion 
i.this case is not moot because passage of the ranch into trust does not void the williamson act restrictions 
the bia acceptance of the ranch as federal trust land during the pendency of this appeal makes it necessary for us to consider the fundamental issue of jurisdiction.the tribe contends that the bia action voids the williamson act restrictions as a matter of either state law,or federal law and that we therefore need not decide whether the county cancellation of the restrictions was valid.in the alternative,the tribe argues that the bia action conclusively deprives this court and future courts of jurisdiction to enforce the restrictions.we disagree.neither state nor federal law voids the williamson act contract at issue here neither state nor federal law prevents the tribe from waiving its immunity and acceding to jurisdiction.this case presents a live controversy that we must resolve.
section does not void the williamson act restrictions because it applies only to eminent domain actions 
as we interpret government code section,it does not apply here.section provides in part when any action in eminent domain for the condemnation of the fee title of an entire parcel of land subject to a williamson act contract is filed,or when that land is acquired in lieu of eminent domain for a public improvement by a public agency or person,or whenever there is any such action or acquisition by the federal government,the williamson act contract will automatically terminate,emphasis added.such action or acquisition refers back to those specific actions and acquisitions defined in the first clause of the statute,condemnation actions under the eminent domain power or acquisitions negotiated under threat of institution of a condemnation action.the legislature did not provide that any federal acquisition terminated williamson act restrictions,only acquisitions through or under threat of the exercise of federal eminent domain powers.the tribe voluntary transfer of title and the federal government acceptance of that title in trust is not the involuntary taking contemplated by the statute and does not automatically terminate the restrictions on the ranch under government code section.
the tribe contends that the federal acquisition of the ranch was for a public use,housing for the tribe,and that this acquisition is analogous to an eminent domain taking and should trigger cancellation under government code section.see state of minnesota united states cir,use of government land for native american housing is public use.essentially,the tribe argues that the federal government could have acquired the ranch by actual or threatened use of its eminent domain powers,even though it did not.whether this is so we need not decide.government code section does not require the courts to exercise such hindsight it is triggered only when specified procedures are in fact used for acquisition.
the tribe implicit argument,that exercise of the trust power can be read into government code section as an alternate basis for termination,also does not withstand analysis.the federal government power to take land through eminent domain and its power to hold lands in trust for native american individuals or tribes are historically distinct both in their constitutional underpinnings and their application.the eminent domain power is a fundamental incident of sovereignty.united states carmack.the power of eminent domain is essential to a sovereign government kohl et united states.the right of eminent domain is the offspring of political necessity and it is inseparable from sovereignty see,amend.in contrast,the trust power finds its roots in johnson mcintosh wheat,which declared that the government held title to all lands as successor to colonial explorers,who acquired title by right of discovery.id.at.according to chief justice marshall,the act of discovery displaced the inhabitants right of ownership,though not their right of possession.ibid.subsequent judicial decisions have concluded that the federal government may hold lands in trust for native americans as an incident of this title.santa rosa band of indians kings county cir,fn.boisclair superior court cal d.the eminent domain power and the trust power are different in application as well.a taking pursuant to eminent domain necessarily rests on a prior finding that the land is needed for a public purpose.hawaii housing authority midkiff,d,amend.in contrast,acceptance of land into trust may be,but need not be,for the public benefit.see,considerations involved in trust acceptance.nothing in the language of government code section suggests that the legislature intended for termination to be triggered by exercise of this fundamentally different federal power.we conclude that acquisition pursuant to the trust power does not terminate the williamson act restrictions under government code section.
federal law does not preempt jurisdiction over this transaction 
in the alternative,the tribe argues that federal law preempts the contractual williamson act restrictions.the federal government has the plenary and exclusive power to deal with native american tribes.bryan itasca county,fn,d.this power derives from federal responsibility for regulating commerce with indian tribes and for treaty making.mcclanahan arizona state tax comm,fn,d see,art.i,cl.art.ii,cl.in,congress passed public law,which granted certain states including california limited civil and criminal jurisdiction over native american matters,subd.a.section,subdivision b specifies that the grant of jurisdiction is not intended to authorize preempted state or local regulation of native american property courts applying section consistently have found federal preemption of state and county regulation of trust land,bryan itasca county,supra,d state and county may not impose property tax united states county of humboldt cir county may not enforce zoning and building codes santa rosa band of indians kings county,supra,same middletown rancheria workers comp.appeals bd.th,d middletown rancheria workers compensation board may not enforce workers compensation laws on tribal land.
however,the federal preemption of involuntary restrictions on tribal land use is not at issue here.the issue is not whether the state or county can regulate the ranch in the future it is,instead,whether the ranch remains subject to voluntarily accepted contractual restrictions.while section may limit regulation,nothing in its language invalidates contractual commitments made before the passage of land into trust.indeed,the tribe and county expressly contemplated that the ranch would be accepted into trust,and nevertheless entered into an agreement to restrict development after this was accomplished we hold that federal law does not void prior restrictions on land agreed to before the land passed into trust.
finally,the tribe argues that even if the restrictions were to remain in place,they would be unenforceable in the future because public law precludes jurisdiction over the tribe.this is an overreading of the statute.it is true that the tribe enjoys sovereign immunity from suit in state court.santa clara pueblo martinez,d see united states state of or.cir,indian tribes enjoy immunity because they are sovereigns the constitution,and immunity is thought necessary to preserve autonomous tribal existence.it is also true that,while congress may abrogate that immunity and subject tribes to state court jurisdiction,it did not do so when it passed public law we have never read.to constitute a waiver of tribal sovereign immunity,nor found.to represent an abandonment of the federal interest in guarding indian.three affiliated tribes wold engineering,d.
however,congressional authorization and tribal consent are separate and independent bases for jurisdiction.as a matter of federal law,an indian tribe is subject to suit only where congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.kiowa tribe of manufacturing technologies,d,emphasis added accord c l enterprises,citizen band potawatomi tribe of,d holding that tribe contractually waived sovereign immunity and subjected itself to state court jurisdiction.indian tribes may consent to suit without explicit congressional authority.united states state of,supra,at accord smith hopland band of pomo indians th,d middletown rancheria,supra,th at,d hydrothermal energy fort bidwell indian community council d.hydrothermal energy see also people ex rel.of transportation naegele outdoor advertising cal d.indeed,the tribe waived sovereign immunity previously when it made a general appearance in this case.it also expressly waived sovereign immunity in connection with enforcement of the agreement if a tribe elects to waive sovereign immunity and submit itself to state court jurisdiction,nothing in the language of section stands as a bar to assumption of that jurisdiction.consequently,section does not render restrictions on the tribe development of the ranch unenforceable.
in reaching these conclusions concerning the scope and effect of section and government code section,we accord respect to the public policies underlying federal native american law federal predominance and the promotion of tribal sovereignty and.see generally boisclair superior court,supra,cal d at.section precludes involuntary local regulation of tribal lands our decision does not alter that rule.moreover,sovereignty and are promoted when tribes are free to decide what voluntary agreements they will or will not enter into,and when and under what circumstances they will waive their sovereign immunity and subject themselves to state court jurisdiction.hydrothermal energy,supra,d at.united states state of,supra,at.were we to hold that even voluntary restrictions on land use are automatically voided by the passage of land into trust,or that section forecloses jurisdiction even when a tribe otherwise voluntarily waives sovereign immunity,the ability of tribes to negotiate and plan would be impeded.united states state of,at parker drilling metlakatla indian community.here,for example,the tribe entered into a agreement in which it both voluntarily accepted land use restrictions and agreed to waive sovereign immunity.see ante,fn.the agreement was predicated on the assumption that the tribe concessions would be enforceable.the public policies underlying federal native american law countenance statutory interpretations that confirm that assumption,thereby preserving for native american tribes the freedom to judge for themselves what agreements best promote their own welfare 
because this case is not moot,we turn to the merits whether the county cancellation of the williamson act restrictions comported with ceqa,the williamson act,and general plan consistency requirements.
ii.the county adoption of a negative declaration did not violate ceqa 
iii.the county did not violate the williamson act 
as a second basis for issuing the writ of mandate,the trial court concluded that the county violated the williamson act.we review this holding de novo.sierra club city of hayward cal d,fn.in contrast to our analysis of the negative declaration,here we must accord deference to the county actions.we are limited to reviewing the county williamson act findings for an abuse of discretion.id.at,fn,code civ,subd.b.we will not disturb those findings unless the county has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.we conclude that the county made the necessary findings and its findings were supported by substantial evidence.consequently,this ground can not support issuance of the writ.
findings required by the williamson act 
a county may grant a williamson act cancellation petition only after making either of two discrete findings that cancellation is consistent with the purposes of the act,or that cancellation is in the public interest,subd.a.here,the county concluded that cancellation was in the public interest,subd.a.that determination requires two subordinate findings that other public concerns substantially outweigh the concerns protected by the act,and that no suitable land not subject to a williamson act contract is available,subd.c.
in the trial court,friends argued that the county was required to make an entirely different set of findings that an emergency situation existed citing sierra club city of hayward,supra,cal d at,the project was contiguous to existing development citing honey springs homeowners board of supervisors d.honey springs the project would not result in adjacent properties being removed from agricultural use citing,subd.b and the project was consistent with the mendocino county general plan.the trial court agreed,and concluded that these findings were not supported by substantial evidence.
however,in light of the statutory structure,we can not agree that any of these findings are necessary.we do not read sierra club city of hayward,supra,cal d,as requiring a board or council to make a specific finding that an emergency situation exists.even if it had,however,the legislature amended the williamson act in direct response to sierra club city of hayward,passing the robinson act in.see stats,ch.it is the robinson act amended version of government code section that now governs,and section,subdivision f confines the findings required for cancellation to those expressly set forth in section.section does not specify an emergency situation finding.
similarly,the contiguity requirement discussed by honey springs was part of government code section,a set of temporary cancellation requirements that were put in place by the robinson act and expired in.the contiguity requirement is still part of government code section,subdivision b,but the findings called for by subdivision b only come into play when a board bases cancellation on the alternate finding that cancellation would be consistent with the purposes of the williamson act.the county did not do so here.for the same reason,the findings called for by subdivision b have no bearing here.finally,as we will discuss in detail in part iv,post,the williamson act does not require findings of general plan consistency.
we turn to a consideration of the evidence supporting the two subordinate findings actually required to justify cancellation.
public interest finding 
the county identified the need for more housing as the public interest supporting cancellation.substantial evidence supports its conclusion that this interest substantially outweighs the interest in keeping the ranch under the williamson act.
there is no dispute that the provision of housing constitutes a substantial public interest.federal,state,and local law recognize the significance of this interest.see providing special funding for housing for native americans health,declaring promotion of decent housing a matter of state public policy and concern mendocino county general plan policy e making provision of housing for low income and special need populations under specified circumstances a county priority.however,friends argues that before the county could conclude that that interest was being served here,it first had to determine that the specific findings required by policy e of its general plan could be made.we disagree.the williamson act requires a finding that cancellation would promote other public interests that substantially outweigh
