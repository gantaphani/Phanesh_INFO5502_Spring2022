measure d amends the east county area plan,which is a component of the county general plan governing land uses in eastern alameda county.see shea homes limited partnership county of alameda th,d discussing measure d in upholding initiative against challenge by home developers.the stated purposes of the initiative are to preserve and enhance agriculture and agricultural lands,and to protect the natural qualities,the wildlife habitats,the watersheds and the beautiful open spaces of alameda county from excessive,badly located and harmful development.the text of the initiative submitted to the voters explains that measure d establishes a county urban growth boundary which will focus development in and near existing cities where it will be efficiently served by public facilities,thereby avoiding high costs to taxpayers and users as well as to the environment.
