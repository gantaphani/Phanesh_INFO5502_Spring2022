certain meat inspection regulations promulgated by the secretary of agriculture,which deal with the levels of salmonella in raw meat product,were challenged as beyond the statutory authority granted to the secretary by the federal meat inspection act.the district court struck down the regulations.we hold that the regulations fall outside of the statutory grant of rulemaking authority and affirm.
the federal meat inspection act authorizes the secretary of agriculture to prescribe the rules and regulations of sanitation covering 
slaughtering,meat canning,salting,packing,rendering,or similar establishments in which cattle,sheep,swine,goats,horses,mules and other equines are slaughtered and the meat and meat food products thereof are prepared for commerce 
further,the secretary is commanded to,
where the sanitary conditions of any such establishment are such that the meat or meat food products are rendered adulterated,refuse to allow said meat or meat food products to be labeled,marked,stamped,or tagged as inspected and passed.
in sum,the fmia instructs the secretary to ensure that no adulterated meat products pass usda inspection,which they must in order to be legally sold to consumers 
the fmia contains several definitions of adulterated,including m,which classifies a meat product as adulterated if it has been prepared,packed,or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth,or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.thus,the fmia gives the secretary the power to create sanitation regulations and commands him to withhold meat approval where the meat is processed under insanitary conditions.the secretary has delegated the authority under the fmia to the food safety and inspection service.
in,fsis,after informal notice and comment rulemaking,adopted regulations requiring all meat and poultry establishments to adopt preventative controls to assure product safety.these are known as pathogen reduction,hazard analysis and critical control point systems or haccp.haccp requires,inter alia,that meat and poultry establishments institute a hazard control plan for reducing and controlling harmful bacteria on raw meat and poultry products.in order to enforce haccp,fsis performs tests for the presence of salmonella in a plant finished meat products.
the salmonella performance standards set out a regime under which inspection services will be denied to an establishment if it fails to meet the standard on three consecutive series of tests the regulations declare that the third failure of the performance standard constitutes failure to maintain sanitary conditions and failure to maintain an adequate haccp plan for that product,and will cause fsis to suspend inspection services.the performance standard,or passing mark,is determined based on fsis calculation of the national prevalence of salmonella on the indicated raw product.
in june,supreme beef processors,a meat processor and grinder,implemented an haccp pathogen control plan,and on november,fsis began its evaluation of that plan by testing supreme finished product for salmonella.after four weeks of testing,fsis notified supreme that it would likely fail the salmonella tests.pursuant to the final test results,which found percent of the samples taken from supreme contaminated with salmonella fsis issued a noncompliance report,advising supreme that it had not met the performance standard.included in the report was fsis warning to supreme to take immediate action to meet the performance standards.supreme responded to fsis directive on march,summarizing the measures it had taken to meet the performance standard and requesting that the second round of testing be postponed until to afford the company sufficient time to evaluate its laboratory data.fsis agreed to the request and began its second round of tests on april.
on june,fsis again informed supreme that it would likely fail the salmonella tests and,on july,issued another noncompliance time informing supreme that percent of its samples had tested positive for salmonella.supreme appealed the noncompliance report,citing differences between the results obtained by fsis and supreme own tests conducted on companion parallel samples.those private tests,supreme asserted,had produced only a percent salmonella infection level,satisfying the performance standard.fsis denied the appeal but based on supreme commitment to install degree water source on all boning and trimming lines,granted the company request to postpone the next round of salmonella testing for days.fsis later withdrew the extension,however,after learning that supreme was merely considering installation of the water source.
the third set of tests began on august,and after only five weeks,fsis advised supreme that it would again fall short of the ground beef performance standard.on october,fsis issued a notice of intended enforcement action,which notified supreme of the agency intention to suspend inspection activities.the notice gave supreme beef until october,to demonstrate that its haccp pathogen controls were adequate or to show that it had achieved regulatory compliance.although supreme beef promised to achieve the percent performance standard in days,it failed to provide any specific information explaining how it would accomplish that goal,and fsis decided to suspend inspection of supreme plant.
on the day fsis planned to withdraw its inspectors,supreme brought this suit against fsis parent agency,the usda,alleging that in creating the salmonella tests,fsis had overstepped the authority given to it by the fmia.along with its complaint,supreme moved to temporarily restrain the usda from withdrawing its inspectors.the district court granted supreme motion and,after a subsequent hearing,also granted supreme motion for a preliminary injunction.
the national meat association filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the district court.the district court denied the motion on the grounds that nma was adequately represented by supreme in this litigation.the district court allowed nma and other industry groups,as well as various consumer advocacy groups,to file briefs.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of supreme,finding that the salmonella performance standard exceeded the usda statutory authority and entering a permanent injunction against enforcement of that standard against supreme.the usda now appeals.
we first must address the usda suggestion of mootness.in september,during the pendency of this appeal,supreme filed for chapter bankruptcy.the usda moved to lift the stay on the appeal and filed a suggestion of mootness with this court.supreme argued that it intended to resume operations after reorganization and that the injunction against enforcement of the salmonella performance standard was critical to that reorganization.a motions panel of this court denied the motion to remand the case with instructions to dismiss as moot on january.on may,the bankruptcy court converted supreme case into a chapter liquidation.
the usda has again raised the question of mootness.while we are not bound by the earlier determination of the motions panel,which in any event was made while supreme was still in chapter,rather than chapter,proceedings supreme asserts that it has substantial assets and could emerge solvent from the chapter liquidation proceeding.in general a matter is moot for article iii purposes if the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.the possibility that supreme may continue to function as a meat processor even after its chapter proceeding satisfies article iii 
the usda argues that this case is moot because even if supreme reopens it is conceivable that it will not open at the same establishment where the violations of the salmonella standard occurred and will not use the same suppliers.however,the district court order is not specific to supreme place of business nor its suppliers.the amended final judgment provides in part 
b is hereby declared to be outside the statutory authority of the united states secretary of agriculture the secretary and the united states department of agriculture the usda 
this injunction issued because the district court determined that the usda was without statutory authority to promulgate the salmonella performance can not be logically restricted to a particular facility.
furthermore,nma,having submitted a brief as an amicus curiae supporter of supreme,again moved to intervene as an appellee,arguing that were we to find that the case was moot with respect to supreme,nma interests were no longer adequately represented by supreme and this inadequacy only arose during the pendency of the appeal.
we granted nma motion to intervene.a party is entitled to an intervention of right if the motion to intervene is timely the potential intervener asserts an interest that is related to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the controversy in the case into which it seeks to intervene the disposition of that case may impair or impede the potential intervener ability to protect its interest and the existing parties do not adequately represent the potential intervener interest.the district court denied nma motion to intervene because it found that nma interests were adequately represented by supreme.in all other respects,nma satisfies the requirements of intervention as of right under rule a and we address only adequacy of representation here.
we recognize that while supreme retains a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this case,this is because of the possibility that supreme will emerge from bankruptcy as an entity wishing to carry out meat processing operations.it is also possible,we understand,that supreme will not so emerge from bankruptcy and be dissolved,perhaps during the pendency of any petition for panel rehearing,rehearing en banc,or writ of certiorari before the supreme court.nma need only show that supreme representation may be inadequate and we find the possibility that the case could be mooted by decisions made in supreme chapter proceeding sufficient to satisfy this requirement of rule a.were supreme to cease to exist as a legal entity,or were the case to otherwise become moot with respect to supreme,nma would be put in the position of having to identical issues on which supreme was successful in the district court.the interest in avoiding piecemeal litigation is thus served by allowing nma intervention 
having concluded that this case is not moot,we now turn to the question of whether the salmonella performance standard represents a valid exercise of rulemaking authority under the fmia.
our analysis in this case is governed by the approach first enunciated by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,the chevron inquiry proceeds in two steps.first,the court should look to the plain language of the statute and determine whether the agency construction conflicts with the text then,i f the agency interpretation is not in conflict with the plain language of the statute,deference is due.the district court held the salmonella performance standard invalid as exceeding the statutory authority of the usda under the first step of the chevron inquiry.
following chevron,we first repair to the text of the statute that the usda relies upon for its authority to impose the salmonella performance standard.the usda directs us to m,which provides that a meat product is adulterated 
if it has been prepared,packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth,or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.
this statutory definition is broader than that provided in m,which provides that a meat product is adulterated 
if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health but in case the substance is not an added substance,such article shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in or on such article does not ordinarily render it injurious to health.
thus if a meat product is prepared,packed or held under insanitary conditions such that it may be adulterated for purposes of m,then it is,by definition,adulterated for purposes of m.the usda is then commanded to refuse to stamp the meat products inspected and passed.
the difficulty in this case arises,in part,because salmonella,present in a substantial proportion of meat and poultry products,is not an adulterant per se meaning its presence does not require the usda to refuse to stamp such meat inspected and passed.this is because normal cooking practices for meat and poultry destroy the salmonella organism and therefore the presence of salmonella in meat products does not render them injurious to health for purposes of m.beef is thus routinely labeled inspected and passed by usda inspectors and is legal to sell to the consumer.
supreme maintains that since meat is not adulterated under m,the presence or absence of salmonella in a plant can not,by definition,be insanitary conditions such that the product may have been rendered injurious to health,as required by m.the usda,however,argues that salmonella status as a is not relevant to its power to regulate salmonella levels in end product.this is because the usda believes that salmonella levels can be a proxy for the presence or absence of means of pathogen controls that are required for sanitary conditions under m.however,as we discuss,and as the usda admits,the salmonella performance standard,whether or not it acts as a proxy,regulates more than just the presence of pathogen controls.
the district court agreed with supreme and reasoned that b ecause the usda performance standards and salmonella tests do not necessarily evaluate the conditions of a meat processor establishment,they can not serve as the basis for finding a plant meat adulterated under m.the district court therefore held that the examination of a plant end product is distinct from conditions within the plant for purposes of m because salmonella may have come in with the raw material.
we must decide two issues in order to determine whether the salmonella performance standard is authorized rulemaking under the fmia a whether the statute allows the usda to regulate characteristics of raw materials that are prepared,packed or held at the plant,such as salmonella infection and b whether m insanitary conditions such that product may have been rendered injurious to health includes the presence of beef in a plant or the increased likelihood of with salmonella that results from grinding such infected beef.since we are persuaded that the salmonella performance standard improperly regulates the salmonella levels of incoming meat and that salmonella can not be an insanitary condition such that product may be rendered injurious to health,we conclude that the salmonella performance standard falls outside of the ambit of m.
in order for a product to be adulterated under m,as the usda relies on it here it must be prepared,packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.the use of the word rendered in the statute indicates that a deleterious change in the product must occur while it is being prepared,packed or held owing to insanitary conditions.thus,a characteristic of the raw materials that exists before the product is prepared,packed or held in the grinder establishment can not be regulated by the usda under m the usda interpretation ignores the plain language of the statute,which includes the word rendered.were we to adopt this interpretation,we would be ignoring the court repeated admonition that,when interpreting a statute,we are to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.
the usda claims,however,that the salmonella performance standard serves as a proxy for the presence or absence of pathogen controls,such that a high level of salmonella indicates m adulteration supreme oversimplifies its argument by claiming,essentially,that the usda can never use testing of final product for a,such as salmonella,as a proxy for conditions within a plant.
we find a similar,but distinct,defect in the salmonella performance standard.the usda admits that the salmonella performance
