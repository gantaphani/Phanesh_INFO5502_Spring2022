in april,plaintiffs advised the fsa that they might arrange private financing to replace their fsa loan.the fsa told plaintiffs that this would cause the agreement to kick in,and that plaintiffs would then owe the fsa approximately under the terms of the agreement plaintiffs never obtained private financing and,thus,did not trigger the agreement by pay ing the loan in full.on january,the fsa sent plaintiffs a letter and advised them that the payoff amount remaining on their loan was.the letter did not reference the agreement.

you pay the rescheduled loan in full.
you ceased farming.
you transferred title to the property.

administrative proceedings 
plaintiffs protested to the fsa,contending that under the terms of the agreement they should not be required to pay shared appreciation.on september,the fsa refused to reconsider its determination and affirmed its decision to require payment of in shared appreciation.the fsa noted that it was bound by the code of federal regulations,which provides that shared appreciation is due at the end of the term of the shared appreciation agreement.
on october,plaintiffs appealed to the national appeals division of the department of agriculture.plaintiffs claimed,inter alia,that the agreement did not allow for recapture upon the expiration of the agreement.plaintiffs argued that because the formula for calculating recapture did not explicitly mention the agreement expiration,such expiration should not be considered a triggering event.under their view of the agreement,recapture occurred only where the borrower pays the loan in full,ceases farming,or transfers title of the security during the term of the agreement.
on december,hearing officer benner conducted an evidentiary hearing on the matter.during that hearing,plaintiffs testified that when they signed the agreement,they did not believe that expiration of the agreement constituted a triggering event.plaintiffs also stated that conversations in with michael drewiske and in the with karolyn corbett,both fsa employees,led them to believe that the expiration of the agreement was not a triggering event.
