in the legislature enacted a statutory scheme to phase down the practice of burning rice straw left over after harvest and to develop alternative uses for the straw.these alternatives failed to materialize as hoped,and growers had to incorporate almost all of the straw back into the soil,a practice that was costly and contributed to the incidence of rice disease.in the legislature amended the statute to suspend until the gradual reduction in the amount of straw burned.as part of the amendment,state agencies responsible for managing the phasedown were required to develop a plan to divert at least percent of the straw to uses by and to make a progress report in to the legislature on,among other things,progress in achieving that goal.
the rice grower plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate code civ,alleging that the diversion plan and progress report failed to comply with the statute.the petition was denied.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in failing to exercise its independent judgment in reviewing the plan and report.they also claim the plan and report were woefully deficient.
we disagree.the statute contemplates that the plan and report,in part,will aid the legislature in amending statutes.the agencies therefore performed the function of gathering information and making recommendations in aid of prospective legislation,acts that are reviewed under a deferential standard.
applying the appropriate standard,we find the relevant documents pass muster,reflecting consideration by the agencies of the relevant factors affecting development of uses for rice straw and demonstrating a rational connection between those factors and the purpose of the statute to divert percent of the straw.because the contents of the documents were not arbitrary,capricious,or without evidentiary support,we shall affirm the denial of the petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the rice straw burning reduction act 
the rice straw burning reduction act of health,et as originally enacted,provided for an annual reduction in the percentage of acres of rice straw that could be burned in the sacramento valley air basin,from percent in to percent in,former subd.c,stats,ch.in and thereafter,all rice straw burning would require a permit issued only where disease had significantly decreased crop yield,subds.b,f,h i.before the act,most rice straw in the sacramento valley was burned.
the statute also encouraged the development of all feasible alternatives to rice straw burning,declaring this to be the intent of the legislature,former subd.n,now subd.q.in the statute was amended to include a further legislative declaration that the restrictions on rice straw burning might create a solid waste disposal problem and the state should assist local governments and growers in diverting rice straw from landfills by researching and developing diversion options,former subd.n,now subd.p,as added by stats,ch.
the state agencies responsible for managing the phasedown,defendants california air resources board arb and the california department of food and agriculture cdfa collectively,the agencies,were directed by the statute to form an advisory committee composed of representatives from both public and private sectors to assist in the identification and implementation of alternatives to burning,and to prepare a list of goals for the development of alternative uses for rice straw,subd.l.
the agencies were also required,beginning in,to issue a progress report biennially on the phasedown of rice straw burning,including an economic and environmental assessment,the status of feasible and alternatives to rice straw burning,recommendations from the advisory committee on the development of alternatives to rice straw burning,and any recommended changes to this section,former subd.m.
the initial progress report report defined the problem addressed by the statute.rice was the most widely grown crop in the sacramento valley,with approximately acres planted in.after harvesting,typically three tons of rice straw per acre remain,which has to be cleared for future crops.burning the rice straw traditionally was the chosen method of disposal because it was relatively easy and inexpensive,and burning effectively controlled rice diseases that can reduce future crop yields.however,emissions of smoke and other pollutants,and their effects on air quality,caused many public complaints,leading to the passage of legislation to reduce the amount of straw that may be burned.
the report found,among other things,that virtually all of the unburned straw had been incorporated into the soil that this practice had increased the cost of farming and that reliance on soil incorporation could increase the incidence of rice disease,which growers reported caused a decline in yield.assessing alternatives to burning,the report stated that in the period from to,there were no alternatives to burning other than soil incorporation and a small amount of composting and erosion control.no facilities manufactured products containing straw or converted straw to energy.for through and beyond,it appeared that heavy reliance on soil incorporation would be necessary.the phasedown legislation did not appropriate funds to stimulate industry,and most proposals for straw use omitted details on costs and methods to overcome the difficulty of removing straw from the field,storing it,and transporting it to any facility for use.
the report recommended a statutory change to allow the total annual acreage permitted to be burned to remain the same from through to allow more time to develop alternatives to burning other than soil incorporation.
in the statute was amended to repeal the phasedown requirements for through and to allow acres of rice straw to be burned annually in those years,subd.c,as amended by stats,ch.a legislative committee comment on the bill to amend the statute mentioned the statement of the author that a rice disease referred to as rice blast had appeared in the state rice fields the year before.com.on environmental quality,com.on bill reg.sess.as amended.the author indicated the bill was intended to provide a negotiated solution to the need of rice farmers to protect their crops against disease while minimizing the impact on public health.ibid.the committee comment noted the recommendation of the agencies in the report that the phasedown be paused,as well as comments critical of the report,that there was no evidence of an increased prevalence of rice disease and that the report paid insufficient attention to the health hazards of burning.id.at.
the amendments to section revised both the diversion planning and progress report requirements.as amended,section,subdivision m subdivision m directs arb to produce an implementation plan for diversion of rice straw to alternative uses other than soil incorporation diversion plan.
subdivision m states on or before september,the state board,in consultation with the department,the advisory committee,and the trade and commerce agency,shall develop an implementation plan and a schedule to achieve diversion of not less than percent of rice straw produced toward uses by.uses may include,but are not limited to,the production of energy and fuels,construction materials,pulp and paper,and livestock feed.
the progress report requirements similarly were revised to incorporate the status of the diversion plan and its target of percent diversion as set forth in section,subdivision n subdivision n.subdivision n states on or before september,the state board and the department shall jointly report to the legislature on the progress of the phasedown of,and the identification and implementation of alternatives to,rice straw burning.this report shall include an economic and environmental assessment,the status of feasible and alternatives to rice straw burning,recommendations from the advisory committee on the development of alternatives to rice straw burning,the status of the implementation plan and the schedule required by subdivision m,progress toward achieving the percent diversion goal,any recommended changes to this section,and other issues related to this section.the report shall be updated biennially and transmitted to the legislature not later than september of each year.the state board may adjust the district burn permit fees specified in subdivision s to pay for the preparation of the report and its updates it shall be the goal of the state board and the department that the cost of the report and its updates shall not exceed fifty thousand dollars.
the pleadings 
arb issued the diversion plan several months after the statutory due date of september,subd.m,and also failed to meet the september,deadline for the first progress report due under the amendments hereafter progress report,subd.n.
plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate,alleging first that the diversion plan failed to comply with subdivision m because the approaches for achieving percent diversion were conceded by arb in the plan to be infeasible plaintiffs alleged the phasedown was based on the premise that alternative,uses would be developed before burning restrictions took effect in september.plaintiffs claimed arb was required to develop a feasible,realistic plan to achieve diversion of rice straw to uses.if arb could not develop such a plan despite its best efforts,plaintiffs alleged then the legislature should be advised by arb that the premise upon which the burning restrictions due to take affect sic on september are based is incorrect.based thereon,the legislature may choose to reconsider the restrictions,including postponing such restrictions until more uses of rice straw are developed.plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section compelling arb to develop a feasible,realistic implementation plan and schedule for achieving percent diversion of rice straw,or advise the legislature that they can not do so.
plaintiffs second claim is that the agencies violated subdivision n by failing to issue a final version of the progress report.plaintiffs alleged the draft report stated that soil incorporation will remain the primary alternative to burning in the next few years and reported the substantial economic costs associated with the phasedown restrictions.they further alleged the final report might recommend changes to the statute,and in light of the slow development of uses for rice straw,one such amendment could be a postponement of the restrictions due to take effect in september.however,without the report,the legislature is lacking the basic information from the agencies regarding the lack of progress in implementation of a feasible diversion plan,or regarding the economic impacts of the phasedown,on which an amendment to the statute would likely be based.plaintiffs sought a peremptory writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section,compelling defendants to complete the progress report and submit it to the legislature.
the agencies subsequently submitted the final progress report to the legislature in november,more than a year after the statutory due date.the report made no recommendations regarding changes to the statute.
plaintiffs then filed a first amended petition,revising their claims concerning the progress report.noting that the final version of the progress report and the preliminary draft report were apparently identical,plaintiffs now alleged that the report did not comply with subdivision n regarding the subjects required to be addressed in the report,in that its economic and environmental assessment of the phasedown,discussion of the status of the diversion plan,and analysis of the progress toward meeting the percent diversion goal were all deficient.
the amended petition added a third cause of action for declaratory relief,alleging a controversy between the parties as to whether the agencies had complied with subdivisions m and n.
plaintiffs served deposition notices pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,seeking the persons most knowledgeable at arb and cdfa about research,preparation,development,drafting,review,and issuance of the diversion plan and the progress report.the agencies moved for a protective order,arguing that deposition testimony would not be admissible or lead to the discovery of admissible evidence because in a mandamus proceeding only the administrative record would be admissible pursuant to western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,western states petroleum.
the trial court granted the motion on the ground urged and further ruled on the related issue of the standard of review applicable to the subject matter at bar t he standard for review at trial in this matter would be whether the agencies actions were arbitrary,capricious or wholly lacking in evidentiary support,and having done that,the general rule applies that the review is limited generally to the administrative record.
arb lodged a administrative record for the diversion plan and progress report.cdfa lodged a record regarding the progress report.
the trial court decision 
after a hearing,the court issued a written ruling and entered judgment denying the petition.the judgment states that arb had not failed to comply with subdivision m and that arb and cdfa had submitted the progress report beyond the due date set forth in subdivision n but had not failed to comply with that section as to the contents of the report.
plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
an ordinary mandamus action under code of civil procedure section permits judicial review of ministerial duties as well as acts of public agencies.county of del norte city of crescent city th,d.mandamus lies to compel the performance of a clear,present,and ministerial duty where the petitioner has a beneficial right to performance of that duty.ibid.mandamus may issue to correct the exercise of discretionary legislative power,but only if the action taken is so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary as to show an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.this is a highly deferential test.id.at,d.
as stated by the california supreme court in reviewing such decisions,the trial court does not inquire whether,if it had power to act in the first instance,it would have taken the action taken by the administrative agency.the authority of the court is limited to determining whether the decision of the agency was arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or unlawfully or procedurally unfair.fullerton joint union high school dist.state bd.of education cal d.the court in western states petroleum refers to this formulation as the arbitrary and capricious standard.western states petroleum,supra,cal th at,d.in applying this deferential test,a court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.id.at,d,quoting california hotel motel industrial welfare com.cal d,california hotel motel see also shapell industries,governing board th,d shapell industries.courts exercise limited review out of deference to the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary,to the legislative delegation of administrative authority to the agency,and to the presumed expertise of the agency within its scope of authority.california hotel motel,supra,cal d at,shapell industries,supra,th at,d.the court does not weigh the evidence adduced before the administrative agency or substitute its judgment for that of the agency,for to do so would frustrate legislative mandate.shapell industries,supra,th at,d.
as plaintiffs remind us,the standard of review can vary depending on the nature of the agency action.as our supreme court has stated the appropriate degree of judicial scrutiny in any particular case is perhaps not susceptible of precise formulation,but lies somewhere along a continuum with nonreviewability at one end and independent judgment at the other.shapell industries,governing board,supra,th at,d.administrative decisions are properly placed at that point of the continuum at which judicial review is more deferential ministerial and informal actions do not merit such deference,and therefore lie toward the opposite end of the continuum.western states petroleum,supra,cal th at,d.
in most cases,the appellate court must determine whether the agency had a ministerial duty capable of direct enforcement or a duty entitled to a considerable degree of deference.this question is generally subject to de novo review on appeal because it is one of statutory interpretation,a question of law for the court.see rodriguez solis th,d rodriguez california teachers ingwerson th,d jv city and county of san francisco th,d.in this instance,the nature of the agencies actions in preparing the diversion plan and progress report is dependent upon a judicial interpretation of subdivisions n and m.we therefore determine independently,based on these provisions,the proper standard of review to apply.
plaintiffs claim the deferential standard was wrongly applied here because the agencies actions in preparing the diversion plan and progress report were informal and nonlegislative.they insist that only rulemaking is.
to be sure,the formulation and adoption of rules is the clearest example of a function performed by an agency,a form of substantive lawmaking delegated by the legislature.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.but investigation and information gathering in aid of,or as a basis for,prospective legislation is another legislative function that may be accomplished through administrative agencies.see in re battelle cal,connerly state personnel bd.th,d see also d admin.law,for the purpose of supplying the legislature with information on which to base general legislative action is obviously legislative,the determination of facts and formulation of legislative policy being the very core of the legislative function.in authorizing administrative agencies to investigate,hold hearings,and report findings,the legislature is,in effect,using those agencies as an arm of the legislature itself,performing functions that are in nature.
we conclude the statutory provisions directing the agencies to develop and prepare a diversion plan and progress report are within this category of acts.subdivision m requires arb to develop an implementation plan and schedule to achieve diversion of percent of the rice straw to uses by.subdivision n instructs arb and cdfa to report on,among other things,the status of the implementation plan and the schedule required by subdivision m,progress toward achieving the percent diversion goal,and any recommended changes to this section read together,these subdivisions reveal a legislative purpose that arb and cdfa assemble the information and summarize the facts included in both the diversion plan and progress report in part to recommend changes to the statute.indeed,history shows that the progress report did recommend statutory changes based on findings derived from the information contained therein the legislature subsequently considered these recommendations when it amended the statute.while this is not as clear a case as rulemaking,the preparation of the diversion plan and the progress report must be considered acts.
plaintiffs argue that since the agencies were involved in implementation of the legislature directive under clear substantive requirements,they were operating pursuant to a ministerial duty subject to control by mandate.
a ministerial act is an act that a public officer is required to perform in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority and without regard to his own judgment or opinion concerning such act propriety or impropriety,when a given state of facts exists.discretion,on the other hand,is the power conferred on public functionaries to act officially according to the dictates of their own judgment.rodriguez,supra,th at,d italics added,supra,th at,d.thus,w here a statute or ordinance clearly defines the specific duties or course of conduct that a governing body must take,that course of conduct becomes mandatory and eliminates any element of discretion.great western sav.loan city of los angeles d.
plaintiffs are wrong in concluding that arb and cdfa need exercise no judgment or discretion in determining whether to issue the diversion plan and progress report and the subjects to be addressed in each they are spelled out in statute subdivision m mandates that arb,in conjunction with other agencies,develop an implementation plan and a schedule to achieve diversion of not less than percent of rice straw produced toward uses by.uses may include,but are not limited to,the production of energy and fuels,construction materials,pulp and paper,and livestock feed.the statute thus directs the agency to prepare a plan designed to achieve a generalized goal and mentions a few suggested areas to explore.but the specifics of the plan are left entirely to the agency.this is inconsistent with a ministerial duty,which requires no judgment or discretion.
similarly,the language of subdivision n,which requires the agencies to issue a progress report on the phasedown of rice straw burning and identification and implementation of alternatives to burning,directs them to prepare a report including an economic and environmental assessment,the status of feasible and alternatives to rice straw burning,recommendations from the advisory committee on the development of alternatives to rice straw burning,the status of the implementation plan and the schedule required by subdivision m,progress toward achieving the percent diversion goal,any recommended changes to this section,and other issues related to this section.italics added.this section clearly indicates the legislature viewed the percent diversion figure as a goal to aim for,not a result that could be automatically achieved by blind obedience to a legislative command.furthermore,the legislature would obviously be seeking guidance from the agencies findings and recommendations when the time came to consider amending the applicable statutes.
from the foregoing,it can be seen that subdivisions m and n do not eliminate agency discretion but require it.these provisions do not indicate either the approach to be taken or,in the case of the progress report,the conclusion to be reached.all the details critical to the undertaking are committed to agency judgment,which uses to endorse or emphasize,how to encourage such uses,and how to deal with the difficulties in achieving the goal of percent diversion.
even plaintiffs concede that the conclusion and recommendation they candidly seek in this suspension of the phasedown because feasible alternatives have not been developed probably can not be mandated by this court,as ultimate recommendations are within respondents sole discretion.we fail to see how the conclusions and recommendations of a report could be a matter of discretion while the investigative work,evidence gathering,and deductive reasoning leading to those conclusions are entirely ministerial.to the contrary,it appears that the entire enterprise involves balancing various factors and selecting among various approaches to the same problem,the hallmarks of discretionary acts.venice town council,city of los angeles th,d.
traditional mandamus may be used to compel an agency to exercise its discretion but not to control it,to force the exercise of discretion in a particular manner or to reach a particular result.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.extraordinary writs,and cases cited therein.we conclude that developing the diversion plan and preparing the progress report pursuant to subdivisions m and n fell on the deferential end of the continuum accorded agency action.thus,while plaintiffs could as they initially did compel the agencies to issue the statutorily required documents,since the manner of preparation and the contents are left to the discretion of the agencies involved,review is limited to determination whether the findings,conclusions,and recommendations were arbitrary,capricious,or unsupported by substantial evidence.california hotel motel,supra,cal d at.
ii.evidence 
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in ruling that evidence outside the administrative record was inadmissible in this action.they are wrong.
an unbroken line of cases holds that,in traditional mandamus actions challenging administrative decisions,evidence outside the administrative record evidence is not admissible.western states petroleum,supra,cal th at,d,shapell industries,supra,th at,d.however,the supreme court said in western states petroleum that since informal actions are not entitled to judicial deference,we will continue to allow admission of evidence in traditional mandamus actions challenging ministerial or informal administrative actions if the facts are in dispute.western states petroleum,supra,cal th at,d.the court was persuaded by commentators who pointed out that the administrative record developed during the process is usually adequate to allow the courts to review the decision without recourse to such evidence,and that evidence is usually necessary only when the courts are asked to review ministerial or informal administrative actions,because there is often little or no administrative record in such cases.id.at,d.
plaintiffs seize on this language to argue both that the trial court erred in granting the agencies motion for protective order and that it incorrectly applied a deferential standard of review in this action.they contend that performance of the agencies mandatory duties here are sic clearly informal in contrast to formal functions 
the court in western states petroleum did not define the characteristics of an informal agency action,but the commentators it cited western states petroleum,supra,cal th at,d,indicate informal actions are those that do not involve a hearing when a ccp ordinary mandamus proceeding is brought to challenge an administrative decision made without a hearing,if the facts are in dispute,a reviewing court is not limited to the record of the agency proceedings.in the absence of a hearing,the record documenting the agency action will not provide an adequate basis for judicial review.in such a case a reviewing court may hear evidence.kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act judicial review.
the informal action exception does not apply here.while it is true that neither agency held a formal hearing before developing the diversion plan or issuing the progress report nor were they required to,there were public meetings,workshops,and ample opportunity for input from the public.arb consulted with an advisory committee comprised of rice growers including plaintiffs themselves,a business community expert in market or product development,and public officials.in gathering information for the progress report,the agencies held two public workshops in addition to individual meetings with interested parties.the progress report was issued in draft form for public comment,and the comments were included in the administrative record and summarized in the report.those efforts led to the generation of a combined administrative record for the diversion plan and progress report that exceeds pages.
in friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection th,d friends of the old trees,a plaintiff that was challenging administrative approval of a timber harvest plan contended evidence was admissible because the agency action was simply an informal administrative decision made as a result of a proceeding which did not require the taking of evidence or a verbatim transcript of the proceedings.id.at,d.the court rejected this characterization,observing that the agency decision was not made in a bureaucratic vacuum leaving an inadequate paper trail,as the page administrative record demonstrates.ibid.the appellate court also saw it as significant that the approval process provided numerous opportunities for public and agency input.id.at,d.
as in friends of the old trees,here there was opportunity for public input as well as the generation of an extensive administrative record.because the agencies actions here were neither informal nor ministerial,the rule applies that evidence is inadmissible in traditional mandamus proceedings challenging acts.western states petroleum,supra,cal th at,d,cadiz land rail cycle th,d.we agree with the agencies that allowing evidence under these circumstances would encourage interested parties to withhold important evidence at the administrative level so as to use it more effectively to undermine the agency action in court.the trial court correctly ruled that evidence was not admissible.our review is properly confined to the administrative record.
iii.diversion plan 
plaintiffs claim the diversion plan did not comply with subdivision m in two basic ways it only recommended legislative action,and it was not feasible or realistic.as will be shown,neither contention has merit.
plaintiffs contend that under the correct interpretation of arb duty set forth in subdivision m of the act,the diversion plan arb issued is contrary to law because it consists almost entirely of just recommendations to the legislature for further legislative action,rather than constituting an implementation plan to achieve diversion of not less than percent of rice straw produced,as the act requires.
subdivision m directs arb to develop an implementation plan and a schedule to achieve diversion of not less than percent of rice straw produced toward uses by.the diversion plan sets forth a combination of approaches to meet this goal by but contains many caveats,including the observation that the legislature would have to appropriate funds and commit the state to certain uses of rice straw the plan also concluded that the approaches presented were not practical because they did not embody a permanent,solution.
based on these facts,plaintiffs claim arb merely punt ed the issue back to the legislature by issuing a plan that largely relies on recommendations,and that the agency abdicated its responsibility to come up with a practical and realistic plan for diversion.
at the outset,we take issue with plaintiffs assertion that their argument raises a question of statutory interpretation requiring de novo review.it is true that ultimate responsibility for construction of a statute rests with the courts.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,the diversion plan was not an interpretation of statutory was an effort to effectuate a statutory purpose.a court passing on the means employed by an agency to effectuate a statutory purpose will not substitute its judgment for that of the agency in the absence of arbitrary and capricious action.ralphs grocery reimel cal d,ralphs grocery.
moreover,the statute language does not prohibit a call for legislative action as part of the implementation plan,nor does it require arb to achieve the percent diversion unaided by the legislature.even accepting,for purposes of argument,plaintiffs assertion that subdivision m requires arb not only to develop a plan but also to implement it,if,as is stated in the plan and not disputed by plaintiffs,the methods using only the private sector have not been effective in achieving the goal of percent diversion,a plan calling for legislative action to create public incentives for commercial use legislative mandate for public use of rice straw is a rational means to effectuate the statutory purpose.
after all,the statute contains a declaration that t he state should assist local governments and growers in diverting rice straw from landfills by researching and developing diversion options.section,subd.p,italics added.it can not reasonably be maintained though plaintiffs do that the term state means only arb and not the legislature.therefore,the legislature was a participant in the effort to develop alternative uses for rice straw.indeed,as the diversion plan indicates,the legislature already had enacted a tax credit and grant program to stimulate uses of rice straw.the plan in part recommended legislative expansion of existing legislative programs to achieve the legislative goal.this approach was not arbitrary,capricious,or in conflict with the language of the statute.
plaintiffs also contend arb failed to perform its mandatory duty because the diversion plan it developed is infeasible,arbitrary,and unrealistic.despite plaintiffs attempt to insert more stringent standards of review into the discussion,their attack on the feasibility of the plan is nothing more than a challenge to its worth in effectuating the statutory purpose,which we review under a deferential standard to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary or capricious.ralphs grocery,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs claim fails because it consists of misreadings of what the plan said.they direct our attention to the conclusion stated at the end of the plan that arb does not believe that these approaches are practical,since they would not work towards a permanent,solution to using over a tons of straw annually.we read this statement to mean that arb does not favor a solution that might achieve the goal of percent diversion by but be unable to sustain it in the long run.in other words,the language does not comment on the lack of feasibility of the plan in meeting the diversion goal in but on its viability as a solution.arb misgivings on that score led it to propose an alternative plan to divert percent of rice straw to uses by nor was it arbitrary,capricious,or inconsistent with its statutory mandate for arb to acknowledge the deficiencies in its plan and to recommend a legislative solution more sustainable over the long term.
plaintiffs argue the plan was infeasible because arb observed in its text that i f the legislature were to implement additional measures,the earliest,practical date by which resources could be appropriated would during sic late or early.this would allow only about months to develop and implement programs that could affect the september straw harvest.there are very few straw usage categories which could be targeted in such a short time frame.again,we do not understand arb to be conceding that the plan can not realistically be accomplished,but rather that it was highlighting the difficulty of implementing the plan given the short time frame and the limited alternative uses that could be implemented during that period.
aside from semantic niceties,it is clear the function of judicial review of discretionary actions of an administrative agency is to ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.california hotel motel,supra,cal d at.we exercise deferential,but not perfunctory,review.id.at,fn.
the diversion plan passes this test.the plan adequately considered the relevant factors of the current,very limited amount of rice straw use the twentyfold increase in such use needed to achieve percent diversion by and the limited uses that could be developed or expanded in that time frame.to call for legislative action in the plan to stimulate this increase is a choice rationally related to those factors and the purpose of the enabling statute,which required a plan for percent diversion by but did not specify the approaches to take or the methodology to be used.
the supporting evidence referenced in the plan included a report by the advisory committee formed pursuant to section,subdivision l,which arb was required to consult in developing the plan,subd.m.the report of the advisory committee on alternatives to rice straw burning october made specific,recommendations to achieve the statutory diversion goal,which included,inter alia,amending the rice straw tax credit and budgeting funds for state agencies other than arb or cdfa to make rice straw available for erosion control and fire rehabilitation.in short,the committee report supported the plan conclusion that further legislative action was needed to achieve the legislature rice straw diversion goals if the diversion plan did not contain a solution to the problem,it was the result of external conditions encountered by arb,not the dereliction of its duty in preparing the plan.
iv.progress report 
with respect to the progress report,plaintiffs contend that the trial court findings do not support its decision,and that the report fails to comply with the requirements of subdivision n.
trial court findings 
plaintiffs target two statements made by the trial court about the report as a basis for reversal.the trial court said as petitioners point out,some of the information or data upon which the report is based does appear to be several years old and further,the progress report is not very detailed or explicit in describing the status of the implementation plan and schedule and the,in petitioners view,lack of actual achieving the percent diversion goal.these issues could have been covered more explicitly and in greater detail in the progress report.
plaintiffs apparent claim that these comments or findings by the trial court require reversal of the judgment is spurious.in two places in the opening brief including the page that follows this contention,plaintiffs recite the established rule that the trial court findings have no effect on appellate review of the reasonableness of agency action.in a mandamus proceeding,the ultimate question,whether the agency action was arbitrary or capricious,is a question of law.citations.trial and appellate courts therefore perform the same function and the trial court statement of decision has no conclusive effect upon us.shapell industries,supra,th at,d,italics added accord,lewin joseph hospital of orange d.personnel com.board of education d.we are not undertaking a review of the trial court findings or conclusions.instead,we review the matter without reference to the trial court actions.in mandamus actions,the trial court and appellate court perform the same function citations.friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs can not rely on the written comments of the trial court as a basis for reversal and at the same time advise us to disregard them.
economic and environmental assessment,status of diversion 
subdivision n requires arb and cdfa to include in the report to the legislature an economic and environmental assessment,the status of the implementation plan and the schedule required by subdivision m,and progress toward achieving the percent diversion goal 
plaintiffs put forward the combined argument that the progress report makes only an arbitrary,hypothetical assessment of the economic impact of increased disease and decreased yields caused by repeated incorporation of rice straw into the soil refers to but fails to assess university of california study findings that incorporation causes disease that may reduce yields and arbitrarily asks the legislature for funding to research economic impacts of reduced yields despite already having discretionary authority to assess fees to pay for such research.we review de novo the report treatment of these topics to determine whether the agencies actions were arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.see,friends of the old trees,supra,th at,d.
economic assessment 
plaintiffs complain that the progress report is dismissive and cursory.specifically,they criticize the statement in the report that c urrently,it is not known to what extent repeated soil incorporation decreases yields as inconsistent with the executive summary of the report,which states a ccording to studies by the university of california,davis,soil incorporation causes an increase in rice diseases and weeds which may cause a reduction in yields.
we see no conflict.the second statement notes that soil incorporation causes rice disease,which may cause decreased yield,but says nothing about the extent of decreased yield.therefore,it is not inconsistent with the first statement,which says that the precise extent of yield decrease due to soil incorporation is not yet known.
plaintiffs also fault the report for failing to relate the findings or analyze the university studies.we conclude the report accurately tracks the study findings,which offer little or no solid evidence to analyze.the current university study stated m any growers are reporting increased disease which they feel is damaging their rice.in the past two seasons average yields in california have been down dramatically and many question to what extent straw is responsible.evidence suggests that disease levels are higher,and since this is related to straw management,there is undoubtedly some impact on yield.to what extent low yields are direct effect of straw
