the issue in this case boils down to a simple question where the beef fence creek cattle company fence creek claimed that it had purchased over head of cattle from the former owner,which it wished to continue grazing on federal land.but,when questioned by the united states forest service forest service,fence creek could not sufficiently prove that it owned the cattle.consequently,the forest service cancelled portions of fence creek livestock grazing permit.
the forest service issued a term grazing permit to fence creek on february.the permit allowed cattle grazing on four allotments in oregon national forest chesnimnus,log creek,and middlepoint.however,the forest service cancelled fence creek use of the chesnimnus and log creek allotments on december,for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit.fence creek invoked the forest service internal procedures for administrative review,appealing to both the deputy forest supervisor and the deputy regional forester.each reviewer upheld the decision.
still unsatisfied with the cancellation of the two allotments,fence creek filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of oregon alleging under the administrative procedure act apa that the forest service decision was arbitrary and capricious and that the forest service violated both constitutional and statutory due process requirements.the district court granted the forest service summary judgment motion,and we affirm.
the facts pertaining to the grazing permit at issue arise from a real estate transaction in wallowa county,oregon.in september,gazelle land timber gazelle purchased over acres of land,called the lucky diamond ranch,cows,and bulls from garnet lewis.the real estate sales agreement required lewis to deliver grazing permit waivers to gazelle,or its nominee,for specific federal grazing allotments,including the ones at issue in this appeal the real estate sales agreement also provided that certain parcels of land be deeded to fence creek 
on february,fence creek submitted an application for a grazing permit for the chesnimnus,log creek,and middlepoint allotments the application was supported by waivers signed by the previous permittees operating on the allotments delbert lewis,garnet lewis,geraldine lewis,and barbara kudrna.the chesnimnus allotment was permitted for head of cattle,and the log creek allotment was permitted for head.fence creek also provided a bill of sale indicating that fence creek,a partnership of wayne and michele smith and bruce and mary agar,purchased cows and bulls from garnet lewis.bruce and mary agar,as the partners of fence creek,signed the application for the grazing permit and the supporting waivers.on february,the forest service issued the grazing permit for the chesnimnus and log creek allotments pursuant to the terms of the waivers and application it again permitted head of cattle to graze on the chesnimnus allotment and head to graze on the log creek allotment.
in conjunction with the purchase of the lucky diamond ranch,gazelle and fence creek formed a joint venture with wayne and michele smith,monty and shelly siddoway,bryan and zachary williams,and wyatt agar in october.the joint venture agreement provided that the members of the joint venture had purchased smaller parcels of land that were originally part of the lucky diamond ranch.it also identified fence creek as the purchaser of nearly head of cattle and the associated grazing permit.
in june,seventeen months after the issuance of the grazing permit,the forest service began investigating the ownership of certain cattle that rick smith,a forest service employee,had observed on fence creek allotments during the grazing season.smith saw cattle grazing on the chesnimnus allotment bearing a brand other than the registered lucky diamond brand.the terms and conditions of fence creek grazing permit authorized only fence creek cattle to graze on the permitted allotments.
the owner of the cattle seen on the chesnimnus allotment,wayne smith,claimed that he had sold them to fence creek and that the cattle were in fact marked with the lucky diamond brand,but it was smaller and harder to see because the brand was affixed as a hair brand rather than a cow brand there followed a series of telephone calls,meetings,and written communications.bruce agar told the forest service that fence creek originally planned to cull the cattle purchased from garnet lewis and replace the culled cattle with cattle purchased from wayne smith and monty and shelly siddoway.although the grazing permit did not list either wayne smith or the siddoways as partners of fence creek,bruce agar claimed that the intent was to include at least wayne smith as a partner of fence creek.unsatisfied with the explanation offered by wayne smith and bruce agar,the forest service decided to seek clarification of who owned the cattle to determine if further action was necessary.
the forest service sent a written request to fence creek on june,seeking additional documentation that fence creek was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grazing permit.the letter explicitly stated that fence creek needed to submit proof of ownership of the livestock permitted on the allotments and listed acceptable methods of proof.it also reminded bruce and mary agar that only livestock owned by the permittee are authorized to graze under this permit.this letter did not state that fence creek grazing permit would be subject to cancellation it simply requested verification that fence creek met the eligibility requirements for its grazing permit.
the agars visited the local forest service office to address the issues identified in the written inquiry.they produced brand inspection certificates for head of cattle purchased from the lewis family in.the agars admitted that they only purchased head and that they had never received a bill of sale listing them as purchasing all cows and bulls.instead,they intended to buy head from the lewis family and then add another contributed by wayne and michele smith and monty and shelly siddoway as capital for the fence creek partnership.one month later,the agars submitted information claiming that they had in fact purchased cows and bulls,but that only cows and bulls were brand inspected for fence creek.fence creek represented that it then obtained an additional head of cows and bulls from wayne smith and obtained another head from monty siddoway to make a herd of approximately head of cattle.
while the forest service was investigating fence creek grazing permit,the joint venture fractured and the parties entered into a settlement agreement on june.under the terms of this agreement,bruce and mary agar were to receive a buyout in exchange for the transfer of all right,title,and interest in the fence creek partnership and brands,as well as the grazing permit issued to fence creek.the agars also relinquished all right,title,and interest in gazelle.king williams,a partial owner of gazelle,then notified the forest service that he was in control of fence creek.bruce and mary agar requested the forest service contact williams regarding its concerns over the grazing permit issued in february,but the forest service responded that it needed to ensure that fence creek had in fact purchased the cattle from garnet lewis before it would accept a waiver of the grazing permit from the agars to williams.
the forest service sent the agars a letter on september,with a copy to williams,again attempting to acquire information that would validate the grazing permit issued to fence creek in february.it explicitly stated that the grazing permit could be cancelled if fence creek failed to provide the necessary documentation and requested a response by september.in response,the agars stated that they had no brand inspection certificate validating the purchase of permitted cattle for the log creek allotment,and that they only purchased cows from garnet lewis.the agars told the forest service that wayne and michele smith and monty and shelly siddoway were supposed to be partners in fence creek,but were unable to obtain financing.the agars admitted there was no brand inspection certificate showing that fence creek had purchased the cattle contributed by either the smiths or the siddoways.
king williams responded by arguing that the grazing permit for the log creek allotment was waived on the basis of the purchase of the base property,and that fence creek culled a substantial portion of the cows and bulls purchased from garnet lewis.he also asserted that the forest service knew of the culling of the original lewis herd and that fence creek did not have the necessary paper trail because the forest service staff always assured fence creek that they had all of the necessary documents.
the forest service finally sent the agars a letter on december,notifying them of cancellation of the permit for the log creek allotment for failure to comply with the conditions for waiver of a term grazing permit.the forest service also reduced the permit for the chesnimnus allotment by head of pairs for failure to comply with the conditions for waiver of a term grazing permit.finally,the forest service cancelled the permit for the chesnimnus allotment in its entirety for allowing livestock not owned by the permittee to graze on the permitted allotment.
fence creek administratively appealed the forest service decision,claiming that it was arbitrary and capricious and therefore in violation of the apa.the forest service decision was upheld on the appeal.the deputy forest supervisor found insufficient evidence to support waiver and issuance of a term grazing permit for the log creek allotment based on the purchase of either base property or permitted livestock.the reviewing official found there was no evidence that the forest service had approved extensive culling by fence creek,justifying the reduction of permitted cattle on the chesnimnus allotment.additionally,the deputy forest supervisor found no documentation to support fence creek claim that it acquired mont y siddoway or wayne smith livestock prior to stocking them on the chesnimnus allotment.finally,the reviewing officer found that there was sufficient support in the record for the complete cancellations.the deputy forest supervisor also denied all of fence creek challenges regarding the factfinding procedures employed by the forest service.fence creek then sought review through a appeal.the regional forester affirmed the forest service cancellation of the log creek and chesnimnus allotments for reasons similar to those identified in the appeal.
because fence creek had exhausted its administrative remedies,it filed a complaint in the district of oregon alleging violations of the apa and statutory and constitutional due process guarantees.fence creek sought to expand the administrative record by adding forest service files from twentyfive other grazing cases,and both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court refused to expand the administrative record,and then granted the forest service motion for summary judgment,concluding that the forest service provided fence creek all the due process required under the apa,and that the forest service decision was not arbitrary and capricious.fence creek timely filed a notice of appeal,giving us jurisdiction under.
generally,judicial review of an agency decision is limited to the administrative record on which the agency based the challenged decision.lands council powell,cir.we allow expansion of the administrative record in four narrowly construed circumstances supplementation is necessary to determine if the agency has considered all factors and explained its decision the agency relied on documents not in the record supplementation is needed to explain technical terms or complex subjects or plaintiffs have shown bad faith on the part of the agency.id.at.we review a district court decision not to expand the administrative record for an abuse of discretion.see sw.ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir.
the files fence creek wished to include concerned twentyfive grazing permits that were not cancelled by the forest service despite being deficient.the district court denied fence creek request because it found the administrative record was complete and that fence creek did not make an adequate showing of necessity or explain its failure to supplement the record before the agency.on appeal,fence creek argues that the proffered material would advance the intuitive notion that the forest service dramatically sic.
we interpret fence creek argument as an attempt to supplement the record in order to establish bad faith by the forest service.however,as discussed more thoroughly below,the forest service decision to cancel fence creek grazing permit for the chesnimnus and log creek allotments was justified.fence creek has not shown that review of agency files of unrelated grazing permits and actions taken concerning those permits would demonstrate that the forest service acted in bad faith in this specific case.fence creek has not met its heavy burden to show that the additional materials sought are necessary to adequately review the forest service decision here.as we said in lands council,at,t hese limited exceptions operate to identify and plug holes in the administrative record.fence creek has failed to show any such gaps or holes.we think the voluminous record already before us is sufficient to conduct the necessary review under the apa.we simply can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying fence creek motion.
fence creek next challenges the propriety of the forest service decision to cancel the chesnimnus and log creek allotments.the district court granted summary judgment to the forest service on these issues.we conduct a de novo review of a district court grant of summary judgment.anchustegui dep t of,cir.our review of the agency decision is from the same position as the district court.id.at.
when reviewing agency action,the apa directs us to hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we must be careful not to substitute our judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.instead,we examine the agency decision to ensure that it has articulated a rational relationship between its factual findings and its decision we also must determine that its decision was based on relevant factors and does not constitute a clear error of judgment.id.
fence creek challenges the forest service decision on two grounds.first,it argues that the decision was a clear error in judgment because the forest service did not explicitly find that fence creek knowingly and willfully misrepresented any facts relating to the purchase of the lucky diamond ranch and the permitted livestock.it then argues that the cancellation was arbitrary and capricious because fence creek adequately proved that it purchased the livestock necessary to support waiver of the grazing permit.
fence creek relies on a federal regulation,a,to support its argument that the forest service must make a factual finding that fence creek acted knowingly and willfully before it may exercise the authority to cancel the two allotments.the subsection upon which fence creek relies gives the forest service the authority to c ancel or suspend the permit if the permittee knowingly and willfully makes a false statement or representation in the grazing application or amendments thereto.id.we do not need to address whether the forest service adequately made a finding of knowing and willful action,however,because the forest service cancellation of the grazing permit is authorized under different subsections of.
the forest service may cancel a grazing permit if the permittee does not comply with provisions and requirements in the grazing permit.a.this authority does not require the forest service to find that the permittee acted knowingly or forest service need only ascertain that fence creek violated the terms and conditions of the grazing permit.id.the grazing permit issued to fence creek in february explicitly prohibits the grazing of livestock other than cattle owned by the permittee on the allotments encompas
