kane and garfield counties the counties sought access to records of the bureau of land management blm and the united states department of the interior concerning the granting and retiring of grazing permits in the grand national monument national monument in southern utah,pursuant to a freedom of information act foia,request.after the agencies did not produce certain records,the counties petitioned the district court to order production of all requested documents.the district court disposed of all foia issues,granting partial summary judgment for the counties and partial summary judgment for the government.our jurisdiction arises under,and we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
foia generally requires federal agencies to disclose agency records to the public upon request,subject to nine exemptions that protect certain types of documents from disclosure.relevant to this appeal is exemption,which exempts or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than the agency in litigation with the agency.b.to qualify under this exemption,a document must be the product of a government agency,and must fall within the ambit of a privilege against discovery under judicial standards that would govern litigation against the agency that holds it.dep t of the interior klamath water users protective ass n,d.the supreme court recognizes the attorney and the deliberative process privileges as falling under the ambit of this exemption.id.attorney covers information reflecting the mental processes of counsel,while the privilege protects documents,such as advisory opinions,recommendations,and deliberations,that reflect how government decisions are made.id.the deliberative process privilege may include materials generated by agency employees as well as consultants.id.at.
factual background 
kane and garfield counties,two utah counties,submitted several foia requests to the grand national monument office of the blm,seeking information regarding the management of several allotments within the national monument and the grant of several grazing permits to the grand canyon trust and canyonlands grazing corporation collectively canyonlands.br.aplee.the agencies provided several records,and reportedly some or access to,to the counties pursuant to their foia requests.the government did not,however,produce all of the requested records.the government did not produce records containing backup on computer tapes maintained at the blm utah state office,and also declined to grant a fee waiver for the costs associated with such a venture.see bd.of county comm rs of kane county dep t of the interior,wl,at july.it also did not produce certain documents created by karl hess,a paid consultant for the department of the interior.see id.at.the denial of the fee waiver and the nondisclosure of the hess records are at issue in this appeal.
communication on backup tapes 
included in the counties foia requests was a request for all communications sent or received from employees at the national monument pertaining to canyonlands from june,to march,the date of the foia request.aplee.david hunsaker,manager of the national monument,responded to the foia request,noting that records were available for the communications on staff computers at that time and that any printed copies of were available in staff files.however,hunsaker indicated that older records,which were included in the counties request,are not maintained by the national monument staff but are instead held on backup tapes housed at the utah state office of the blm.aplee.
the counties then requested those records.aplee.the utah state office responded to the counties,seeking clarification of the request and noting that production of the requested records would be extremely time consuming and cost prohibitive given the more than backup tapes.aplee.the utah state office further noted that the estimated cost of complying with the request based upon employees would be in excess of.aplee.the utah state office later revised that estimate due to clarification from the counties,concluding that production of the materials on the backup tapes would be based upon employees,and noting that it would not begin processing the request without a fee waiver from the counties.aplee.on october,the counties requested a waiver of fees pursuant to a a iii.aplee.see.on november,the utah state office denied the request on the grounds that copies of some of the had been previously provided and that any remaining on the backup tapes would not make a significant contribution to public understanding of government operations as required for a fee waiver under the statute.aplee.the counties then appealed the denial of the fee waiver to the department of the interior foia appeals office.aplee.that office,however,did not resolve the appeal and advised the counties of their right to seek judicial review of the matter.see bd.of county comm rs of kane county,wl,at.
karl hess reports 
the counties final foia request was sent to the office of the secretary of the interior on march.like the previous requests,this one sought documents and other records relating to livestock grazing permits administered by the blm on the national monument,and the retirement of grazing on those allotments.after conducting two searches,the office of the secretary of the interior released several documents but withheld others pursuant to foia exemptions and.see bd.of county comm rs of kane county,wl,at.br.see also b.included in the withheld documents were three documents authored by karl hess,a consultant hired by the department of the interior to assess policy alternatives concerning grazing and voluntary retirement of grazing permits in the national monument.see bd.of county comm rs of kane county,wl,at.the counties then filed an administrative appeal,which was never resolved by the department of the interior,and subsequently sought judicial review.
c.the district court memorandum decision 
the counties and the blm filed for summary judgment.the district court upheld the blm refusal to waive foia search fees under a a iii for a search of the backup tapes housed at the utah state office,reasoning that the production of these additional documents likely would not contribute to the public understanding and that the request was unduly burdensome.bd.of county comm rs of kane county,wl,at.the district court also upheld the blm decision to withhold various documents pursuant to exemption.however,the district court held that the blm erred in withholding two documents authored by hess and incorporated a prior court order that held that the third document authored by hess was improperly withheld,finding that the documents fell outside the scope of exemption.id.at.the district court recognized that the views of a governmental consultant can be deemed intraagency under exemption,but held that the exemption was not available where the consultant is communicating with the government in his own interest or on behalf of any person or group whose interests might be affected by the government action addressed by the consultant.id.at quoting klamath water users,at.the district court acknowledged that hess lacked any interest in competing for a grazing permit or representing any party who was interested in doing so,but concluded that he was not a disinterested expert and therefore the exemption was unavailable.id.the district court relied upon hess past scholarship and advocacy on the topic of grazing reform as disqualifying his reports for the exemption.id.
defendants now appeal,claiming that hess documents fell well within exemption,and that the district court ruling was an improper expansion of the reasoning in klamath.br.the counties,claiming that the district court erred in denying their request for a fee waiver regarding the communications stored by the utah state office.br.
