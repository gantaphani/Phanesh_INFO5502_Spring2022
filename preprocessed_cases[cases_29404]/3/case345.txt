this case involves an interpretation of the packers stockyards act,a and b,which prohibits live poultry dealers from engag ing in or us ing any unfair,unjustly discriminatory,or deceptive practice or device,or mak ing or giv ing any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or locality in any respect,or subject ing any particular person or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect.the plaintiffs,lucius and jill adkins,are broiler growers under contract with defendant operators of poultry processing facilities.the adkins claim that the defendants,cagle,cagle,cagle farms,cagle farms,and cagle foods jv,llc cagle jv,violated federal agricultural statutes,committed fraud and breach of contract,and are liable under other related causes of action.
the plaintiffs,lucius and jill adkins,had been engaged in farming for several years when they decided,in late or early,to grow broiler chickens in order to diversify their farm income met with danny eiland of cagle,who provided estimates of typical costs and expenses encountered in the business,derived from industry averages and actual production data on other farms.the estimates included a disclaimer which provided that the projections were for illustrative purposes only and not intended as a forecast of actual performance.the adkins independently verified the validity of the estimates and proceeded to construct four chicken houses in.the estimates proved reasonably accurate and the operation performed well.the adkins constructed two additional houses in,and four more houses on a new farm in.on each occasion,the adkins obtained additional estimates from cagle jv,which by that time was the only one of the defendant entities conducting business with the adkins 
by the time of the house construction,cagle jv had responded to market pressures by providing its broiler growers with larger birds,which resulted in a reduction in the number of flocks per year from the estimated figures.lucius admitted in a deposition that the adkins did not suffer any damages as a result of the change,and that cagle jv actions in making the change were not fraudulent.furthermore,lucius believed the new estimates he received before the construction to be accurate and reasonable.
the relationship between cagle and its growers was memorialized in a series of broiler production agreements,which set forth the obligations of cagle jv to provide the birds,feed,and medications,and to weigh the birds promptly upon harvest.the agreement also set out the pay schedule for the duration of the contract.no contract ever specified the specific number of birds to be placed in each house or the number of flocks per year.all the contracts contained merger clauses.
in,in response to requests from its largest customer,cagle jv began placing an even larger bird with its growers.in order to preserve the health of the bird,and for other reasons,cagle jv decreased the number of birds placed in each house.the adkins made no complaints at the time.the increase in bird size made up for the lower number of birds.furthermore,cagle jv payment per pound increased from cents to cents between and.
in may,the grain inspection,packers and stockyard administration gipsa found that up until,cagle jv had used different tractors to take the loaded weight and the tare weight of chicken trailers.cagle jv therefore recalculated its prior payments to correct for the discrepancy.cagle jv reimbursed the adkins and other farmers who had been underpaid,but did not request refunds from farmers who had been overpaid.
lucius adkins joined the united poultry growers association upga in,and became the upga president in november.at about the same time that lucius became involved in the upga,the adkins allege that cagle jv began sending them poor quality birds to raise on their farms.the adkins also claim that cagle jv sometimes sent them poor quality feed for the birds or failed to send sufficient feed.lucius asserts that employees of cagle jv repeatedly threatened that he should do as the company told him or the company would break him.the adkins claim that these threats were meant to discourage participation in the upga.
in may,cagle jv presented all its growers a new contract which provided for higher payments in exchange for an agreement to arbitrate disputes arising under the contract.the adkins rejected this proposal and continued to do business under the old contract 
in june,the adkins filed the present action in the middle district of georgia against cagle jv,cagle,and cagle farms.the complaint brought claims for violation of the packers and stockyards act psa,fraud,violation of the georgia rico statute,fraudulent inducement and promissory estoppel,violation of the agricultural fair practices act afpa,and breach of contract.in response,cagle,and cagle farms,filed a motion for summary judgment arguing,inter alia,that they had not had dealings with the adkins since and that the adkins claims were therefore.the district court granted the motion.cagle jv filed a motion for summary judgment on the merits of the adkins claims.the district court granted cagle jv motion as well.the adkins appeal both rulings.

b.the adkins claims against cagle foods jv 
packers and stockyards act claim 
the psa prohibits live poultry dealers from engag ing in or us ing any unfair,unjustly discriminatory,or deceptive practice or device,or mak ing or giv ing any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or locality in any respect,or subject ing any particular person or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect.a and b.the adkins have alleged that cagle jv violated this statute when it provided them with inferior birds,provided them with inferior or insufficient feed,improperly weighed birds they had raised,and offered them an unfair arbitration contract 
there is no evidence that the adkins received a substantial number of inferior birds,much less that cagle jv intended to provide them with poor quality birds.the adkins did demonstrate that cagle jv could choose to send buses of chicks to different farms once they were loaded,but this falls far short of a showing that cagle jv discriminated against the adkins by sending them inferior birds.uncontroverted evidence states that flocks were only sent to a different farm when the original destination farm was not yet ready to receive them.chick quality is also a complex matter which can not be determined at a glance,meaning that it would be difficult to judge the quality of a flock when loaded onto a bus for transport.nothing in the record suggests that cagle jv ever delivered poor quality chicks to the adkins or any other broiler growers with any discriminatory purpose.
nor have the adkins produced evidence of specific instances where cagle jv gave them insufficient or inferior feed.the evidence did suggest that some of cagle jv broiler farms would run out of feed from time to time while others received too much.but the adkins did nothing to show that they were ever specifically targeted for insufficient or inferior feed.
the adkins have also failed to establish any illegal weighing practices.in the earlier years of the camilla plant operation,there were discrepancies in the weighing process that might affect the live weight.cagle jv made reimbursement payments to cover all misweighings prior to,and the adkins can not identify any instances where cagle jv miswei
