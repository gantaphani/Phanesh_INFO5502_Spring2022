the principal question presented by this appeal is whether,under the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,et,a bank is liable to the beneficiaries of a paca trust for receipt of funds in breach of the trust where,having extended revolving overdraft privileges to a produce dealer covered by paca,the bank routinely applied deposited paca funds to reduce the negative balance in the produce dealer overdrawn account.
we consider here an appeal from a december,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york allen schwartz,judge holding defendant bank liable under paca for receipt of funds in breach of a paca trust,and awarding damages to plaintiff produce suppliers in the amount of.
under paca,a produce dealer proceeds from the sale of produce are subject to a paca trust,which the dealer is personally responsible for maintaining as trustee.see c.the beneficiaries of the paca trust are those produce suppliers from whom the produce dealer has purchased perishable agricultural commodities sellers or paca creditors.see c.paca thereby prevents produce dealers from providing creditors with security interests in their receivables superior to the claims of their creditors,by creating a trust for the benefit of only those creditors that are produce suppliers.see endico potatoes,cit,cir.for a more detailed explanation of the paca system,see our recent opinion in american banana republic bank,cir.
background 
factual history 
during the trust period relevant to plaintiffs claims,which the parties stipulate commenced on february,korea commercial bank of new york kcb or bank extended revolving overdraft privileges to defendant,produce dealer david lee produce service corporation dlps,which is not a party to this appeal,in the amount of.by the terms of the agreement between kcb and dlps,the bank would honor checks written on dlps checking account in amounts exceeding dlps available funds with the expectation that dlps would regularly make deposits to offset the negative balance.this revolving line of credit was not secured by dlps receivables from the sale of produce,which would constitute a violation of paca,but instead by dlps business assets,as well as personal guarantees of dlps principal,david lee,and a mortgage on lee home.dlps regularly wrote checks in excess of its available funds,and kcb routinely honored them until,in november,kcb terminated dlps overdraft privileges by converting the line of credit into a commercial loan to dlps in the amount of.
dlps deposited approximately million dollars into its kcb account during the relevant trust period,nearly all of which constituted proceeds from the sale of produce,and was thus subject to a paca trust for the benefit of dlps paca creditors the vast majority of the funds disbursed from dlps account were payments to paca creditors,including plaintiffs,with the exception of that dlps paid to creditors not including kcb,and that kcb retained for fees and interest associated with dlps account when dlps ceased operations in december,it owed plaintiffs,all paca creditors,a total of,and it had failed to make payment to any paca creditor since august.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiffs filed suit against kcb in the district court on march,alleging that the bank receipt of funds subject to a paca trust and use of those funds to offset dlps negative balance constituted receipt of funds in breach of a paca trust.plaintiffs claim that kcb is liable for satisfying the claims of paca creditors who were the beneficiaries of the paca trust up to the full amount dlps deposited in its checking account at kcb.accordingly,they argue that kcb is liable to them for the full amount of dlps unsatisfied debt to them,or,plus interest.
the district court opinion of december,relied on its earlier opinion,american banana republic national bank,civ.ags,slip op.at,american banana,which examined a similar arrangement between a produce dealer and a bank extending overdraft privileges,as well as on the ninth circuit decision in boulder fruit express heger organic farm sales transportation factoring,cir,to hold that kcb liability under paca was significantly narrower than alleged by plaintiffs.see armata,david lee produce service,wl,slip op.at.specifically,the district court held that kcb could not be liable for any amount deposited by dlps that was ultimately paid to paca creditors.id.because the vast majority of the funds at issue in this case were ultimately disbursed to paca creditors,including plaintiffs,the district court held that kcb liability was limited to the that dlps paid to creditors not including kcb,and that kcb retained for fees and interest associated with dlps account,or a total of.id.at.
the district court then evaluated several defenses to liability offered by kcb,including an argument that it was a bona fide purchaser with respect to trust funds it received from dlps.id.at citing restatement second of trusts,which provides that i f the trustee in breach of trust transfers trust property to a person who takes for value and without notice of the breach of trust,and who is not knowingly taking part in an illegal transaction,the latter holds the interest so transferred or created free of the trust,and is under no liability to the beneficiary.accepting the bank argument that it was a bona fide purchaser with respect to its receipt of trust funds through october,the district court further limited kcb liability to those payments disbursed to merchants including kcb through fees and interest after october,or.see armata,slip op.at 
discussion 
paca trusts 
paca protects growers and suppliers of perishable agricultural paca establishing a trust for their benefit from the proceeds of the ultimate sale of such commodities by commission merchant s,dealer s,or broker s 
perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission merchant,dealer,or broker and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities shall be held by such commission merchant,dealer,or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the transaction,until full payment of the sums owing in connection with such transactions has been received 
c emphasis added.we held in endico potatoes that t his provision imposes a floating trust on the commodities and their derivatives,and permits the commingling of trust assets without defeating the trust.endico potatoes,at.paca therefore requires each commission merchant,dealer,or broker for our purposes,dealers or paca trustees,to hold in trust his income from the sale of such commodities until all his paca creditors have been paid,but does not require him to maintain such assets separately from other assets.id.a dealer is responsible to the trust unpaid paca maintaining the trust.d the trust provides paca creditors with a right to recover against the purchasers superior to all creditors,including secured creditors.endico potatoes,at.
paca does not explicitly assign to third parties,such as banks,any responsibility for preserving a paca trust.albee tomato,shalom produce,cir.however,general trust law applies to paca trusts.id.citing endico potatoes,at,cited in american banana,at.accordingly,we turn to general trust principles to determine the circumstances,if any,under which a bank that accepts trust proceeds as deposits may be liable to beneficiaries for receipt of funds in breach of that trust.
as we noted recently in american banana,under general trust principles,a third party such as a bank in kcb circumstances can not be liable for receiving funds in breach of a paca trust unless the paca trustee transfer of funds to the third party constituted a breach of its duty as trustee to maintain trust assets.see american banana,at citing restatement second of trusts if the trustee transfers trust property to a third person and the trustee in making the transfer does not commit a breach of trust,the third person holds the interest so transferred free of the trust,and is under no liability to the beneficiary.emphasis added.thus,in the instant case,any possible liability of kcb as a transferee must be predicated on a breach of trust by dlps,the paca trustee.put another way,dlps must have committed a breach of trust in depositing funds in its kcb account before kcb can legally be responsible for receiving those funds in breach of trust.accordingly,in order to hold a bank in kcb position liable for receiving any dlps funds,we must first establish that dlps deposit of funds in its bank account constituted a breach of dlps duties as a paca trustee.
we turn,therefore,to what constitutes a breach of trust by a produce dealer under paca.in general,a breach of trust is a violation by the trustee of any duty which as trustee he owes to the beneficiary.see id.quoting restatement second of trusts internal quotation marks omitted.federal regulations prescribe the duties of produce dealers as paca trustees,which consist primarily of maintain ing trust assets in a manner that such assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities.d see also american banana,at.the same regulation provides that a ny act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility,including dissipation of trust assets,is unlawful and in violation of paca.d see also american banana,at.dissipation that would constitute a breach of trust includes any act or failure to act which could result in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents to recover money owed in connection with produce transactions.a see also american banana,at.
ii.district court opinion 
the district court adopted the holding and reasoning of its own earlier decision in american banana,see armata,slip op.at,in which the district court had applied general trust principles to paca trusts and concluded,as we have,see discussion,part i,ante,that the liability of a bank,as a third party,for receiving funds in breach of trust is predicated on there having been a breach of the trust by the trustee,american banana,slip op.at.considering what constituted a breach of trust by a paca trustee,the district court in american banana,and subsequently in the instant case,relied on the ninth circuit decision in boulder fruit,and held that,because a produce dealer trustee duties under paca consist of maintain ing trust assets in a manner that such assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to paca beneficiaries,d,the produce dealer did not breach his duties as a paca trustee merely by depositing funds into an account with a negative balance,as long as the funds remained freely available to repay trust beneficiaries.see armata,slip op.at citing boulder fruit,at american banana,slip op.at same.
in order to identify any breach of the produce dealer obligations as paca trustee,the district court considered in each case whether and which paca funds deposited by the produce dealer remained freely available to repay paca beneficiaries.again relying on boulder fruit,which held that no breach of the trust would have occurred on the part of a paca trustee if allegedly misapplied funds were used to pay off other perishable commodities producers,at,the district court in both american banana and the instant case held that a produce dealer committed no breach of trust with respect to any funds that were ultimately disbursed to pay beneficiaries of the paca trust.see armata,slip op.at citing boulder fruit,at american banana,slip op.at same.in other words,evidence that deposited funds ultimately ended up in the hands of paca creditors was sufficient to establish that those funds had been freely available to paca creditors,and thus,that the produce dealer had satisfied its obligation as a paca trustee with respect to those funds.in light of the district court previous holding that a transferee liability is predicated on a breach of trust by the paca trustee,the court proceeded to hold that kcb could not be liable as a third party for receipt of any funds that were eventually paid to paca creditors,which includes the vast majority of the million dollars deposited by dlps.see armata,slip op.at.
according to the district court,therefore,the only funds with respect to which dlps could have breached its obligations as a paca trustee were those funds it deposited at kcb that were ultimately disbursed to beneficiaries.see armata,slip op.at.the district court here,as it had in american banana,thus held that banks in kcb position could be liable for receipt of funds in breach of a paca trust insofar as they received funds from a produce dealer that were ultimately disbursed to parties who were not paca creditors.see american banana,slip op.at american banana republic national bank,civ.ags,slip op.at,partially granting plaintiffs motion to amend judgment to award damages not included in the original order.applying this holding in the instant case,the district court found that kcb liability for receipt of funds in breach of trust included the that dlps paid to creditors not including kcb,as well as the of fees and interest that kcb retained,for a total of.see armata,slip op.at 
iii.kcb liability for funds it did not retain 
funds ultimately disbursed to paca creditors 
the district court held that no breach of trust had occurred on the part of dlps,and therefore on the part of kcb,with respect to funds that were ultimately disbursed to paca creditors.see armata,slip op.at.in so holding,the district court relied on the ninth circuit opinion in boulder fruit,see armata,slip op.at,which had held that,in order for plaintiff paca creditors to establish that trust assets had been misallocated,they had to demonstrate at a minimum that the trustee had not paid the funds in question to other paca creditors,boulder fruit,at.applying that holding to the instant case,the district court rejected the argument of plaintiff paca creditors that dlps had dissipated the trust with respect to funds that were ultimately paid by dlps to other paca creditors.see armata,slip op.at.
although we agree with the district court that,in the instant case,no breach occurred with respect to those funds that dlps made available to paca creditors after their deposit at kcb,we decline to adopt a blanket rule that a paca trustee can commit no breach with respect to funds that are eventually paid to paca beneficiaries.armata,slip op.at.as we conclude below,see discussion,part,post,such a holding is not necessary,because the fact that dlps did not breach its duties as paca trustee by depositing funds at kcb is dispositive of plaintiffs allegations that kcb received funds in breach of trust.accordingly,although it seems correct to conclude that neither the paca trustee in boulder fruit nor the paca trustee in the instant case breached the trust with respect to the funds they ultimately paid to paca creditors,we decline to hold,as a general matter,that no breach of a paca trust could have occurred with respect to any funds that a paca trustee eventually makes available to paca creditors.
funds ultimately disbursed to creditors 
having concluded that kcb could not be liable for receiving funds that were ultimately disbursed to paca creditors,the district court seems to have assumed,without discussion,that kcb was liable in the full amount of those funds that were not ultimately disbursed to paca creditors see armata,slip op.at.that is,after the district court determined the scope of dlps breach of its duties as a paca trustee,excluding such a breach with respect to those funds that ended up in the hands of paca creditors,the court assumed that kcb was liable for the entire remainder of the funds at full amount dlps eventually paid to creditors id.we conclude that the district court erroneously omitted the step of considering the source of kcb liability,if any,as a transferee for receipt of paca funds in breach of trust.accordingly,we must determine whether kcb received funds from dlps in breach of trust.
kcb liability for receipt of funds in breach of trust 
as we have noted,see discussion,part i,ante,a transferee liability for receiving paca funds in breach of a paca trust is predicated on a transfer of those funds to the third party that itself constit
