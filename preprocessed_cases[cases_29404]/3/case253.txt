native ecosystems council,alliance for the wild rockies,and wildwest institute collectively nec appeal the district court summary judgment in favor of tom tidwell,bruce ramsey,mark petroni,and the united states forest service collectively forest service madison county and beaverhead county and sitz angus ranch,gary clark,moose creek grazing association,max robinson,max robinson,montana stockgrowers association,and montana wool growers association and collectively.nec argues that the district court erred in finding that forest service approval of a project to update grazing allotments in the national forest complies with the forest service obligation to ensure species diversity as required under the national forest management act nfma.it also contends that the district court erred in concluding that the environmental assessment undertaken by the forest service project satisfied the national environmental policy act nepa.we agree with nec on both counts.because the forest service environmental assessment was based on a nonexistent management indicator species mis,its habitat proxy analysis was not reliable.the forest service also failed to take the requisite hard look at the project as required by nepa.we therefore reverse the district court summary judgment in favor of the forest service,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
project area and allotment management plan amp 
the antelope lake project area is in the national forest bdnf in southwest montana.the project area is approximately acres and forms the southeast portion of the gravelly mountain range.most of the project area is open,mountain sagebrush grasslands with some scattered timber along streams.
three forest service activities have most affected the sagebrush ecosystem in the project area herbicide application to control sagebrush densities burning to control sagebrush densities and livestock grazing.sheep and cattle have grazed a majority of the project area over the past century.
as part of a settlement agreement in an unrelated case,the forest service agreed to a schedule for completing nepa environmental analyses and decisions for the authorization of livestock grazing and associated resource protection measures.the environmental assessment at issue in this case contains the nepa analysis underlying some of the livestock allotments listed in the schedule.
the project area was divided into eleven grazing allotments.the project proposed updating amps for these eleven allotments.the updated allotments would determine where livestock can graze,when grazing would occur and what specific guidelines would be established to regulate the intensity of grazing.as of the time of the proposal,the prior amps for all eleven allotments were ten years or older.
the proposal specifically identified the goals established in the bdnf land resource forest plan forest plan which governed the proposed project.these goals included maintaining a sufficient number of diverse habitats to support native wildlife and providing opportunities for grazing by domestic livestock without compromising extant forest resources.the proposal also stated that no further sage brush control measures such as burning or herbicides are contemplated in the project area in the near future.
the forest service prepared an initial environmental assessment for the proposed amps,and issued a revised environmental assessment after receiving public comments.the revised assessment specifically addressed concerns regarding the project impact on sage grouse,as well as other sagebrush habitat obligates.the environmental assessment considered three options for updating the amps alternative a,which continued the status quo alternative b,the preferred alternative,which modified the amps to protect riparian habitat while allowing grazing and alternative c,which banned grazing altogether.the united states fish and wildlife service issued a biological evaluation concluding that adoption of the preferred alternative was not likely to adversely affect or jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species.
in november,district ranger mark petroni released a decision notice and finding of no significant impact reflecting the administrative decision to proceed with alternative b.the concluded that the project was not a major federal action with significant effect on the quality of the human environment,and therefore no environmental impact statement eis was warranted under nepa.
b.the sage grouse 
to facilitate its goals of wildlife diversity,the governing forest plan designates certain wildlife as management indicator species mis.these species are monitored to measure the effect of various activities on corresponding wildlife habitats.the objective of monitoring the mis is to ensure the viability of wildlife species existing in the forest.the sage grouse is one such mis for the sagebrush wildlife habitat.
the sage grouse is entirely dependent on sagebrush ecosystems.the sage grouse population in southwestern montana has trended downward for the past decade.there are no identified active sage grouse leks in the project area the closest known active lek is approximately eleven miles west of the project area.see a review of usfs management activities and their relationship to sage grouse in the antelope lake area of southwestern montana,connelly september,hereinafter,connelly review.in the past fifteen years,only two possible sage grouse sightings have been noted in the project area.
approximately acres of the project area are considered to have potential sage grouse habitat.only acres are considered to have potential sage grouse nesting and early brood rearing habitat.
supplemental information report 
in december,the forest service issued a supplemental information report sir concerning the sage grouse,and specifically discussed information that had been released after the environmental assessment.the sir evaluated the findings of three primary works as they related to the proposed project conservation assessment of greater sage grouse and sagebrush habitats,connelly,knick,schroeder and stiver,western association of fish and wildlife agencies june,hereinafter,conservation assessment management plan and conservation strategies for sage grouse in draft plan,montana sage grouse work group march,and habitat modeling completed in by the forest service surveying active and inactive sage grouse leks in the vicinity of the project area.
to inform its analysis,the forest service requested that connelly undertake a review of the project area in light of the new information concerning the sage grouse.connelly findings were documented in the september,connelly review.the review concluded that the environmental assessment conclusions were reasonable and supported by the available evidence.effects to sage grouse resulting from project implementation will likely be minimal.
after considering the newly available information and the connelly review,the district ranger determined that the environmental assessment conclusions remained accurate.the sir retained the determination of minimal effects to sage grouse from project implementation,and did not recognize a need to further revise the environmental assessment or prepare an eis.

iii.discussion 
compliance with the nfma 
the nfma sets forth the statutory framework and specifies the procedural and substantive requirements under which the forest service is to manage national forest system lands.lands council mcnair,cir en banc.procedurally,all management activities undertaken by the forest service must comply with the forest plan,which in turn must comply with the nfma.idaho sporting,rittenhouse,cir.substantively,the nfma also places a duty on the forest service to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area g b.in order to ensure compliance with the forest plan and the nfma,the forest service must conduct an analysis of each site specific action,such as a timber sale,to ensure that the action is consistent with the forest plan.idaho sporting,at citation omitted.
regulations implementing the statute,in effect at the time the forest service issued its final decision,required the forest service to manage fish and wildlife habitat to maintain viable populations of existing species.to ensure population viability and monitor the effects of management,the regulations mandated the identification and selection of a management indicator species mis.see id.at a.the regulations also provided that p opulation trends of the management indicator species will be monitored and relationships to habitat changes determined id.at a 
the forest plan incorporated specific species diversity maintenance goals,explaining that 
maintenance and enhancement of wildlife habitat has high priority in the management of the forest.viable populations of all existing wildlife species will be maintained by providing a diversity of habitats throughout the forest.wildlife indicator species have been identified and will be monitored to ensure that assumptions concerning the effects of management activities on wildlife habitat and populations are appropriate.
united states forest service,forest plan,beaverhead national forest forest plan.the forest plan designated the sage grouse as the mis for sagebrush communities.the forest plan contemplated monitoring the sage grouse as an indicator species to measure the effect of management activities on representative wildlife habitats with the objective of ensuring that viable populations of existing native and desirable vertebrate species are maintained.id.
despite its designation as an mis,the sage grouse is virtually in the project area.because actual sage grouse population data is unavailable,the environmental assessment looked to the sagebrush habitat to assess viability for the sagebrush obligate species.this is known as the approach,whereby the forest service use s habitat as a proxy to measure a species population,and then use s that species population as a proxy for the population of other species.mcnair,at.
the approach effectively allows the forest service to avoid studying the population trends of the indicator species by using indicator species habitat as a proxy for indicator species population trends.lands council powell,cir,as amended.use of this approach however,is appropriate only where both the forest service knowledge of what quality and quantity of habitat is necessary to support the species and the forest service method for measuring the existing amount of that habitat are reasonably reliable and accurate.native ecosystems council united states forest service,cir.underlying the approach is the assum ption that maintaining the acreage of habitat necessary for survival would in fact assure a species survival.envtl.prot.info,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,t he test for whether the habitat proxy is permissible is whether it reasonably ensures that the proxy results mirror reality.gifford pinchot task force united states fish and wildlife service,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the approach reliability is questionable where the mis is absent from the project area regardless of whether the forest service methodology comports with established scientific standards,the habitat proxy does not reasonably ensure viable populations of the species at issue,when almost no sage grouse have been seen in the project area for fifteen years.idaho sporting,at.there is simply no basis to evaluate the forest service assertion that the sagebrush habitat is sufficient to sustain viable sage grouse populations when sage grouse can not be found in the project area.therefore,the forest service can not reasonably argue that the approach allows it to avoid separately monitoring sage grouse population trends,as sage grouse are its chosen mis.see powell,at noting that the result is aimed at establishing species population trends emphasis added.this is especially true where,as here,the forest plan requires monitoring of the mis.see earth island institute usfs,f d,cir rejecting the use of habitat monitoring where the forest plan required population monitoring,abrogated on other grounds by winter natural res.def.council.
we do not share our dissenting colleague perception that the forest service can meet its obligations to the environment by naming a virtually species to serve as a proxy for critical habitat in the targeted area.far from usurping the agency role,our opinion holds the agency to its statutory responsibility to fully study the effects of the planned agency action,and to maintain viable populations of existing species.c.emphasis added.it is unfathomable how the forest service could meet its responsibility to maintain existing species by selecting as a proxy a species that is virtually in the targeted area.a report of two sage grouse being taken illegally from the project area of acres in,see dissenting opinion,just does cut it.
our colleague in dissent also criticizes this result as undermining the forest service ability to develop one integrated plan for each unit of the national forest system.see dissenting opinion.the law does not support this contention.the forest service is bound to assess proposed actions on a site specific basis for compliance with the forest plan and nfma.see i see also inland empire pub.lands council forest,cir explaining that both the forest plan and project stages must fully comply with the nfma or.natural desert ass forest,cir explaining that amps are plans for specific allotments.if the forest service decided to select a project site consisting of the head ranger backyard,see dissenting opinion,it must indeed analyze that particular site to determine the effects of the proposed action.if the mis were absent from that site,it is difficult to see how an assessment of the mis could demonstrate that the proposed action at that site complied with either the nfma or a forest plan based on monitoring of the mis.
indeed,the record strongly suggests that the forest service methodology in applying the approach is flawed.in preparing its biological evaluation,the forest service expressly relied on the connelly guidelines in determining whether sage grouse habitat was sufficient.however,at least some of these guidelines assume the presence of birds as indicators of habitat health.see connelly guidelines.the connolly guidelines specifically note that quantitative data from population and habitat monitoring are necessary to implement the guidelines correctly.id.at emphasis added.moreover,in the conservation assessment,generated after the connelly guidelines,connelly and his recognized that populations of have been extirpated at places throughout their former range concomitant with habitat loss and degradation,so that the species current distribution is less closely aligned with that of sagebrush.citation omitted.thus,the very guidelines used by the forest service militate against the forest service assertion that evaluation of the sagebrush habitat in the complete absence of a sage grouse population meets its obligation under the nfma to ensure population viability of the sage grouse and other sagebrush obligates.
in response to the argument that population monitoring is essential to a proper analysis of the project under the nfma,the forest service repeatedly argues that population monitoring is outside the scope of the project,which is meant solely to consider updating grazing allotment protocols.however,to meet nfma requirements,the forest service needed to consider and preserve the project species.as the conservation assessment,noted,perspectives have goals to maximize a particular function that may have objectives competing with other resource use.for example,evaluation of sagebrush communities primarily based on their ability to provide forage for livestock may result in extensive alterations that are unsuitable for greater sage grouse and other species dependent on sagebrush habitats.citations omitted.
because the habitat proxy failed to track the mis population,the approach was unreliable in ensuring overall diversity in this case.in applying the approach to evaluate whether the project complied with the forest service duty to ensure wildlife diversity,the forest service did not adequately consider evidence that,despite the forest service asserted compliance with the connelly guidelines,the sage grouse population continued to trend downward over several decades.this omission on the part of the forest service would suggest that the agency has failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or has offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence in the record,and its decision is therefore arbitrary and capricious.motor vehicle mfrs,state farm mut.auto.ins.
the record further suggests that in addition to failing to monitor and incorporate sage grouse population data in its analysis,the forest service failed to adhere to the connelly guidelines in assessing the sagebrush habitat.in conducting its environmental analysis,the forest service failed to identify the nesting habitat in the project area later noted by connelly and addressed in the connelly review.the environmental assessment stated that there are no known nesting grounds in the project area,noting that n esting conditions are not met within the project area during the sage grouse nesting season may to.the forest service concluded that the absence of nesting habitat appears to be limited by growing conditions and plant physiology,not by past years cattle grazing the forest service ostensibly relied upon the connelly guidelines in reaching this conclusion.however,connelly concluded that there were at least acres of nesting habitat in the project area.see connelly review.indeed,connelly specifically stated that this area has relatively high canopy coverage of grasses and forbs with adequate height for nesting habitat.connelly review.in short,he concluded,the area seems to have all the characteristics associated with productive sage grouse breeding habitat.id.citing the connelly guidelines.
the discrepancy between the forest service conclusions and connelly conclusions,where both ostensibly applied the connelly guidelines,strongly suggests that the forest service method of measuring the sagebrush habitat is neither reasonably reliable nor accurate.see native ecosystems,at.this flaw in the forest service methodology further undermines the reliability of the forest service use of the approach.see powell,at holding that the approach failed to comply with nfma where habitat analysis was flawed.
the forest service analysis of the acres of breeding habitat also contradicted connelly view of whether cattle grazing would interfere with the sage grouse breeding period.the amps would allow cattle grazing in the area as soon as june.the forest service noted in the environmental assessment that the nesting season usually takes place from may to.in the sir,the forest service concluded that the grazing season was compatible with sage grouse breeding,because cattle generally did not graze in that region until late june however,the connelly review referenced scientific studies suggesting that t he hatching period for most sage grouse populations generally occurs from until early june.connelly review,emphasis added.connelly stated that there is some evidence that grouse using high elevation area may not begin nesting until.id.emphasis added citation omitted.connelly cited evidence that of nesting hens initiated nesting between may and june in the sawtooth valley of central idaho,an area with a similar elevation range as the project area.id.citation omitted.he noted that yet another scientist also reported that sage grouse may nest well into june id.citation omitted.
our colleague in dissent does not deny that inconsistencies exist between the forest service analysis and connelly conclusions.instead,the dissent takes refuge in connelly fuzzy assurance that the contemplated actions are generally consistent with the current management guidelines.dissenting opinion,quoting connelly review.however,that general observation in no way erases the specific discrepancies between connelly studies and the forest service analysis.
in sum,under the facts of this case,where the mis population has consistently declined and has not appeared in the project area in nearly two decades,and where the agency analysis conflicted with that of the scientific experts,the forest service use of the approach to ensure viability of sagebrush obligates did not comply with the dictates of the nfma to monitor population trends of the sage grouse as the selected mis.see earth island institute,at.the district ranger determination that the project would have minimal effects on the sage grouse was not derived from a reliable methodology.see id.at holding that the forest service acted arbitrarily and capriciously by relying on inadequate habitat monitoring of the mis.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on the plaintiffs nfma claim.
compliance with nepa 
in contrast to nfma,nepa exists to ensure a process,not to mandate particular results.neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir citation omitted.nepa requires a federal agency to the fullest extent possible,to prepare a detailed statement on the environmental impact of major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.ctr.for biological diversity highway traffic safety,cir citations and alteration omitted.

as discussed above,the forest service use of the nonexistent sage grouse as an mis to assess the project impact on all sagebrush species diversity was flawed.as a result,its overall study of the sage grouse habitat throughout the environmental assessment was similarly deficient.just as the methodology applied by the forest service to measure habitat conditions did not meet the nfma requirements,its flawed methodology in the complete absence of a sage grouse population does not constitute the requisite hard look mandated by nepa.see native ecosystems council usfs,cir recognizing that the forest service reliance on incorrect assumptions data violated nfma and did not meet the agency obligation to take a hard look under nepa.
we can not say that the results of the environmental assessment would have differed if an appropriate mis for sagebrush obligates had been selected.in the absence of that analysis,we reverse and remand for the forest service to undertake a new or revised environmental assessment.see earth island institute,at reversing and remanding due to defects in the forest service analysis.
finally,we note that the forest service decision not to supplement the environmental assessment following the connelly review discussion of the acres of nesting habitat fails to comply with the agency obligations to supplement an environmental assessment when t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c ii see klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.boody,cir.
the forest service justifications for its decision not to further revise the environmental assessment are unpersuasive.although the forest service suggests that it made no estimate of the amount of habitat in the allotments,the record clearly reflects otherwise.the forest service in fact analyzed the impact of the project on late habitat.this approach was taken precisely because the sagebrush habitat in the project area was not considered to be nesting habitat.however,connelly assessment of the project specified that the p roposed management will likely have little effect on this habitat unless offtake results in average herbaceous height cm in mid to late june connelly assessment.the environmental assessment,predicated on the assumption that no nesting habitat existed in the project area,did not address anticipated offtake results under the project at all.nor did the sir discuss the potential effect of grazing on nesting habitat.
the forest service efforts to minimize the importance of the potential nesting habitat further emphasizes the shortcomings of the environmental assessment.the forest service suggests that the acres identified by connelly as potential breeding habitat is less reliable because connelly made this identification on the basis of the quality of the vegetation,not on any documented breeding in this area.however,this argument undermines the forest service overarching position that reliance on habitat alone is sufficient to predict sage grouse viability.moreover,it highlights the fact that the new information regarding potential nesting habitat directly contradicts the environmental assessment,which concluded without explanation that nesting habitat is unavailable because of the nature of the vegetation and not as a result of grazing.
ultimately,the forest service attempts to avoid preparing a supplemental environmental assessment by suggesting that weather presents an immediate bar to the use of the identified habitat for nesting.however,the scientists who identified this habitat considered weather patterns.for example,connelly noted that late habitats are generally used from july to early september but vary annually due to annual weather conditions.and glenn hockett,the nec expert,specifically rejected the premise that weather conditions foreclose the use of the nesting habitat.in his declaration,he noted 
although the antelope lake area does receive a lot of snow in the winter,it melts in the spring.the importance of ephemeral temporary,water sources from melting snow banks may play an important role in the sage grouse habitat suitability for nesting and early brood rearing on the project area.
hockett,december.thus,the forest service conclusory assertion in the that nesting is impossible because of weather conditions is undermined by the scientists observations.
given the presence of potential nesting habitat and the corollary effect on that habitat of cattle grazing,the information impacted the project sufficiently that the environmental assessment should have been further revised.see klamath siskiyou,at.we note that a revised environmental assessment considering the issues addressed above might come to a different conclusion than the original environmental assessment and necessitate the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
iv.conclusion 
because the methodology utilized by the forest service violated both the nfma and nepa,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,and remand this case for the agency to prepare a new or supplemental environmental assessment consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
the majority oversteps the limited role of a court reviewing an agency decision.first,it holds that the forest service environmental assessment,six surveys,and bevy of supplemental reports all amount to a clear error of judgment that would render its action arbitrary and capricious under the national forest management act.the lands council mcnair,cir.second,on the basis of these same substantive criticisms,the majority holds that the service analysis was too flawed to satisfy the national environmental protection act hard look requirement.see,native ecosystems council forest,cir determining whether the forest service took the requisite hard look is judged against the apa arbitrary and capricious standard.
but ours is only the modest task of ensuring the service did perform an arbitrary and capricious analysis or come to an arbitrary or capricious conclusion.the service did neither so the majority is wrong to overturn its decision.
the national forest management act requires the forest service to develop a general resource management plan for every forest in the national forest system.forest plans permit productive uses of forests such as grazing while preserving the habitat to support viable populations of all plant and animal life.to keep track of animal populations,the forest service designates a small number of management indicator species to monitor as proxies for all the forest animals.a.and,rather than go out and individually count every animal,the service often monitors indicator species habitat as a proxy for their population.we long endorsed this approach.see,inland empire public lands council forest,cir.
forest plans,by definition,cover entire forests.national forest is the largest national forest in montana and,at million acres,it is roughly the size of connecticut.in the national forest plan,sage grouse are the indicator species for sagebrush dependent animals.the antelope lake project site,at acres of the total forest,is just a bit larger than the district of columbia.the service analyzed the project potential effects on the forest plan as nfma required and,as the forest plan required,it used sage grouse as the indicator species for animals.
but that is good enough for the majority,which holds that it was arbitrary and capricious for the service to rely on sage grouse because grouse are virtually in the project area.at.when grouse are absent from the project area the forest service can not reasonably argue that the approach allows it to avoid separately monitoring sage grouse population trends.id.at.this a project analysis is arbitrary and capricious unless there is proof that each indicator species lives in the project entirely new.it has at least four problems.
first,the majority does apply its new requirement fairly to the record.the record does not show,and the service does not concede,that there are no sage grouse in the antelope lake project site.the record shows only that no sage grouse have been observed in the project area in the past years and sage grouse surveys in did not find sage grouse or their sign.on the other hand,there is a report of two sage grouse being taken illegally from the project area in.rather than meaning that few sage grouse live in the project area,this could just mean the sage grouse in the project area are difficult to find.we repeatedly approved habitat monitoring when the indicator species is difficult to detect.see,mcnair,at.the majority notes that the government does not cite any monitoring difficulties that prevent detection of the sage grouse.at.but why would it have courts have never required that showing before.we can hardly fault the service for not providing an unnecessary justification in
