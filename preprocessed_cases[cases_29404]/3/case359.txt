appellant brought suit under the freedom of information act foia to compel the united states department of agriculture to disclose blueprints to buildings located on an agricultural research campus.concluding that the requested blueprints fall within foia exemption,which exempts from disclosure matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency,b,the district court granted summary judgment for the government.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm.
appellant damon elliott submitted foia requests seeking architectural blueprints for all buildings on the campus of the united states department of agriculture usda beltsville agricultural research center barc.elliott apparently seeks the blueprints in order to prove that building,a residential building on the barc campus,is nonfederal property.after conducting a search for responsive documents,the agency informed elliott that although it maintains blueprints for barc buildings,it has none for building.the agency refused to disclose any blueprints,however,asserting that foia exemption protects sensitive critical infrastructure information related to security and safety.letter from stasia hutchison,foia coordinator,usda,to damon elliott.
after exhausting his administrative remedies,elliott brought suit in the district court for the district of columbia to compel disclosure of all blueprints responsive to his foia requests.see.seeking summary judgment,the government argued that the blueprints fell within foia exemption because their disclosure would compromise the security of barc critical infrastructure and research programs.
the district court granted the government motion in part,finding that although the agency had performed an adequate search for responsive documents,it had failed to sufficiently justify withholding the blueprints under exemption.elliott dep t of,wl,at may.following a renewed motion for summary judgment and additional filings by both parties,the court then concluded that the blueprints were exempt from disclosure because they are used for predominantly internal purposes and their disclosure may risk circumvention of federal policies,statutes,or regulations.elliott dep t of,d.in addition,the district court held that no reasonably segregable portion of the blueprints could be disclosed without posing a security risk.id.elliott appealed,and we appointed amicus curiae to present arguments on his behalf.

this case concerns the scope of exemption,which covers matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.b.the courts have devoted thousands of pages of the federal reporter to the explication of these twelve words,cutting out some and pasting in others.as a result,like the ship of theseus,little of congress original language remains.we think it useful to briefly review how we got to this point.
for fifteen years after foia enactment,see,stat,considerable confusion surrounded the scope of exemption.this uncertainty stemmed from the seemingly contradictory interpretations of the exemption expressed in the house and senate reports.the senate report stated that exemption relates only to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.examples of these may be rules as to personnel use of parking facilities or regulation of lunch hours,statements of policy as to sick leave,and the like,at.taking a different view,the house report described the exemption as encompassing o perating rules,guidelines,and manuals of procedure for government investigators or examiners.h,at.even given these differences,however,the house and senate committees both saw exemption as narrowing the public disclosure exemption under former section of the administrative procedure act apa,which protected from disclosure any matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency.rose,at citing congress dissatisfaction with the broad sweep of the apa exemption,ed.
confronting the dueling house and senate reports for the first time in department of the air force rose,the supreme court declined to pick sides.on the one hand,the court accepted the senate interpretation of exemption as covering minor matters in which the public lacked a significant interest.id.at.on the other hand,the court acknowledged,but did not decide,that the exemption might protect the more important materials contemplated by the house report where necessary to prevent the circumvention of agency regulations that might result from disclosure to the subjects of regulation of procedural manuals and guidelines used by the agency.id.at.
with the question thus left open by the supreme court,and facing what we believed to be mutually exclusive views of exemption,we initially adopted the senate report as the authoritative expression of congress intent.in jordan united states department of justice,en banc,we stated that personnel refers only to matters relating to pay,pensions,vacations,hours of work,lunch hours,parking,applying this construction,we ordered the release of prosecutorial guidelines used by attorneys on the ground that,as envisioned by the senate report,the guidelines fell outside exemption scope.id.
three years later and sitting en banc,we reversed course and expressly repudiated jordan limited interpretation of exemption in crooker bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms.there,the foia requester sought a copy of a bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms atf manual used to train new agents in surveillance techniques.picking up where the supreme court left off in rose,we held that exemption protects nontrivial matters where disclosure might risk circumvention of the law.id.at.accordingly,the words personnel rules and practices encompass not merely minor employment matters,as we held in jordan,but may cover other rules and practices governing agency personnel,including significant matters like job training for law enforcement personnel.id.at.
despite exemption reference to documents related solely to internal rules and practices,we further explained in crooker that the exemption covers documents that are predominantly internal.id.at.this modification stemmed from our recognition that,if interpreted literally,the term relating is potentially while solely is potentially.id.at quoting vaughn rosen,f d,leventhal,concurring internal quotation marks omitted.thus,despite the fact that the withheld portions of the atf manual had some effect on the public at large,we held that the manual fell squarely within exemption because it was used for predominantly internal purposes,it was designed to establish rules and practices for agency personnel,law enforcement investigatory techniques,and its disclosure would risk circumvention of agency regulations.id.at.
crooker thus resolves the apparent conflict between the house and senate reports by explaining that exemption is actually two exemptions wrapped in one.the low exemption,tracking the senate report,covers predominantly internal documents that deal with trivial administrative matters of no genuine public interest.schiller nlrb,internal quotation marks omitted.the high exemption,following the house report,applies to p redominantly internal documents the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of agency statutes and regulations.id.
since crooker,we have articulated the requirements of the high one at issue in this terms of a inquiry.morley cent.intelligence agency.first,the information withheld must fall within the exemption language.schwaner dep t of the air force,quoting founding church of scientology of wash,smith.that is,the material must be used for predominantly internal purposes,and relate to rules and practices for agency personnel.crooker,at.second,if this threshold step is satisfied,the agency can defeat disclosure by demonstrating that release of the material would significantly risk circumvention of federal regulations or statutes.schiller,at see crooker at.
notably,t his exemption does not shield information on the sole basis that it is designed for internal agency use.morley,at internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.in schwaner department of the air force,for example,the plaintiff sought disclosure of a roster containing the names and duty addresses of military personnel stationed at bolling air force base.recognizing that exemption was a poor fit because data itself is not a practice,the district court nonetheless held that the list fell within the exemption because it was purely internal.schwaner,at internal quotation marks omitted.we reversed,holding that the list does not bear an adequate relation to any rule or practice of the air force as those terms are used in exemption.id.thus,although we have sometimes framed the first step of the test as one of predominant internality,see,treasury employees union customs,nteu,at least where the dispositive issue concerns whether the requested information adequately relates to internal matters,schwaner makes clear that predominant internality is necessary but insufficient to get past the threshold inquiry the government must also show that the predominantly internal material bears a sufficient relationship to agency rules and practices.
with this background in mind,we turn to the government argument that the requested blueprints are protected by the high exemption.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,remaining mindful that congress intended that exemption be interpreted narrowly and specifically,rose,at internal quotation marks omitted,and that the burden is on the agency to show that requested material falls within exemption,ass of home builders norton,internal quotation marks omitted.
the government argues that the blueprints satisfy exemption threshold test because the usda uses blueprints,and few individuals outside the usda have seen the blueprints.appellee br.record evidence supports the first of these claims,which amicus does not contest agency personnel use the blueprints to perform building repairs,add room number,room description and square footage information to building databases,coordinate office and laboratory moves,conduct security assessment upgrades,and identify watering responsibilities for barc greenhouse staff.bynum decl,july,taylor decl.
as to the government second point,that few individuals outside the usda have seen the blueprints,amicus argues that the blueprints are not predominantly internal because the usda has released blueprints for various barc buildings to the maryland historical trust.but we agree with the government that disclosure of some blueprints to an outside group does not vitiate the predominantly internal nature of the blueprints on file at barc and used in the course of the abovementioned activities.after all,elliott is presumably not seeking those blueprints that are housed at the maryland historical trust,but rather wants those that remain exclusively under the agency control.we therefore agree with the district court that the withheld blueprints satisfy exemption predominant internality requirement.
as explained above,however,to fall within exemption language documents withheld must also relate to rules and practices governing agency personnel.crooker,at.satisfying this component of the threshold test presents little difficulty in cases where the withheld material itself constitutes an agency personnel rule or practice.crooker,the canonical high case,fits this mold,as the atf training manual at issue there instructed government agents how to perform their official job duties.other materials falling within this category include instructions to agency employees implementing the equal access to justice act,schiller,at,customs service plans used to evaluate the qualifications of job applicants,nteu,at,and portions of the manual for marshals pertaining to the use of weapons and other law enforcement practices,cox dep t of justice.these cases clearly reflect the house report conception of exemption as covering o perating rules,guidelines,and manuals of procedure for government investigators or examiners,at.
true,unlike manuals and guidelines,blueprints give agency employees little explicit guidance about how to do their jobs.information need not take the form of a rule or practice,however,to fall within the high exemption.rather,the exemption expressly protects from disclosure material related to agency rules or practices.in schwaner we described two categories of material that could satisfy this relatedness requirement.one such category is exemplified by rose,where the plaintiffs sought summaries of cases decided by the air force academy honor committee.although case summaries are not themselves rules and practices,we explained that they manifest and implement the rules and practices of the agency relating to the conduct of cadets,who must conform their conduct not just to the academy honor code itself,but also to the committee decisions implementing the code.schwaner,at see also milner dep t of the navy,cir protecting from disclosure navy maps depicting explosives blast radii on the ground that the maps,created pursuant to a navy manual,constitute one part of the internal policies and procedures that navy personnel are bound to follow when handling and storing explosive ordnance.
exemption also encompasses materials that are so closely related to rules and practices that disclosure could lead to disclosure of the rule or practice itself.schwaner,at.for example,in founding church of scientology of washington,smith,we allowed the fbi to withhold from disclosure routing instructions appearing on documents to protect sensitive administrative instructions for the handling of the documents,and in lesar united states department of justice,we concluded that exemption protected symbols used to refer to fbi informants in fbi documents and records.as we explained in schwaner,the materials in these cases fall handily within the statutory requirement of being related to agency rules or practices in that they bear upon,or cast light upon,those practices.schwaner,at.the notations in founding church of scientology revealed the agency internal routing and distribution practices,and the redacted symbols in lesar shed light on the fbi practice of using symbols to communicate about secret informants.in contrast,the air force personnel lists requested in schwaner shed little light on any agency practice other than the practice of collecting the data itself.at.although the agency had argued that the lists reflected air force duty assignment practices,we found any such link too tenuous and indirect to satisfy the related requirement.id.at.
in schwaner,moreover,we distinguished between high and low cases,observing that j udicial willingness to sanction a weak relation to rules and practices may be greatest when the asserted government interest is relatively weighty.id.at.thus with respect to high materials,where the asserted government interest is,by definition,to prevent circumvention of law,the threshold inquiry may be somewhat less demanding than for low matters,for which we require a tighter nexus between the withheld information and personnel rules and practices.
acknowledging this more forgiving standard applicable to high materials,amicus nonetheless complains that the record is completely devoid of any explanation as to how the barc blueprints relate to the rules that govern usda employees,or the practices of those employees.amicus curiae br.emphasis added.although this somewhat overstates the case,it is true that the government briefs in both the district court and on appeal focus primarily on the predominant internality component of exemption threshold test,rather than on the requirement that withheld material relate to rules and practices governing agency personnel.but that is because in the district court elliott never challenged the relatedness of the blueprints to the practices of usd
