under the freedom of information act foia,an agency must disclose all records requested by any person,a,unless the information sought falls within a specific statutory exemption.d.ass of retired fed.employees horner.multi ag media llc multi ag,a commercial vendor of agricultural data,has made foia requests for various records of farm data maintained by the united states department of agriculture usda.invoking foia exemption,which protects individual privacy interests in government records,usda has withheld some of the requested information.because there is a significant public interest in disclosure that outweighs the personal privacy interest usda seeks to protect,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of usda.
within usda,the farm service agency fsa is the principal agency charged with promoting a stable and abundant american food supply.fsa meets this responsibility,in part,by offering subsidies and other financial assistance to farms.to qualify for fsa benefits,farmers must submit information about their operations to a local fsa office.the information includes data on each farm agricultural practices,acreage,soil,crops,livestock,and geographical location.
on july,multi ag submitted a foia request to usda seeking release of thirteen databases maintained by fsa relevant to its agricultural subsidy and benefit programs.fsa processed the request and released some information,but withheld other information on the ground that it contained private information about individual farmers protected by foia exemption.pressing its claim for the withheld information,multi ag exhausted its administrative appeals within usda without success,then filed suit in the district court.the district court sided with multi ag in ordering the disclosure of requested information in two of the files,but also partly granted usda motion for summary judgment and allowed the agency to withhold information in two other files,the compliance file and the geographic information system gis database.multi ag media llc usda,wl,at.multi ag appeals that decision the compliance file is a massive database with information on crops and field acreage for hundreds of thousands of individual farms across the country.it contains crop data that agricultural producers report to fsa to establish their eligibility for the government subsidy and benefit programs.in response to multi ag foia request,usda withheld information on irrigation practices,farm acreage,and the number and width of rows of tobacco and cotton.the district court concluded that this information was protected by foia exemption because its disclosure would reveal financial information associated with an individual without shedding any light on the government activities.id.at.
the gis database provides farm data on a digitized aerial photograph.usda uses gis as part of a system that combines global positioning system technology and aerial photographs to calculate acreage,identify crop types,and create maps of farmland.the gis database helps fsa verify farm features and thereby monitor compliance with regulations governing farm benefits.it also provides more specific information regarding the location of farms than do fsa other files,which provide only general state and county location information.declaration of robin wieland,february,wieland declaration stating that the gis database provides a specific geographic reference.usda released much of the gis database to multi ag,but withheld information on farm,tract,and boundary identification,calculated acreage,and characteristics of the land such as whether it is erodible,barren,or has water or perennial snow cover.the district court concluded that because this information reveals details of land ownership,its disclosure would compromise a substantial privacy interest,but that disclosure would serve no public interest because the information would not reveal anything about what the government is up to.multi ag media llc,wl,at.
usda argues on appeal that disclosure of the compliance file and the gis database would compromise farmers privacy interests and that these files are properly withheld under foia exemption.multi ag contends that disclosure of the files would not reveal anything personal about individual farmers and would advance a significant public interest by shedding light on usda administration of its subsidy and benefit programs.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.judicial watch,fda.in the foia context this requires that we ascertain whether the agency has sustained its burden of demonstrating the documents requested are exempt from disclosure under the foia.gallant nlrb,see also a b stating that the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.an agency may sustain its burden by means of affidavits,but only if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather than merely conclusory statements,and if they are not called into question by contradictory evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith.gallant,at quoting halperin cia.
foia basic purpose reflects a general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language.dep t of air force rose,d quoting,at.at all times,courts must bear in mind that foia mandates a strong presumption in favor of disclosure.ass of home builders norton,quoting dep t of state ray,d.foia exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of the act.rose,at.for that reason,they must be narrowly construed.id.and there is nothing about invoking exemption that lightens the agency burden.in fact,under exemption,the presumption in favor of disclosure is as strong as can be found anywhere in the act.norton,at citing.post dep t of health human.
foia exemption allows an agency to withhold personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b.we must pursue two lines of inquiry to determine whether usda has sustained its burden to show that the information multi ag seeks is properly withheld under this exemption.first,we must determine whether the compliance file and the gis database are personnel,medical,or similar files covered by exemption.if so,we must then determine whether their disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.id.this second inquiry requires us to balance the privacy interest that would be compromised by disclosure against any public interest in the requested information.dep t of def.flra,d ass of retired fed.employees horner.
similar files 
the district court concluded that the compliance file and the gis database are similar files within exemption,and even though the parties on appeal do not contest this point,we think it merits some explanation why business records such as these are covered by exemption.in national parks and conservation ass kleppe,we reversed the district court ruling that foia exemption,which protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged or confidential,b,could be used to lawfully withhold business records on grounds of individual privacy.we explained that personal privacy interests are not a relevant concern under the fourth exemption,but are under exemption.id.at.although exemption has not been extended to protect the privacy interests of businesses or corporations,id.at,we pointed out that personal or personalized financial information contained in the records of businesses that necessarily reveal s at least a portion of the owner personal finances,may well qualify for protection under exemption.id.at.
what we said in kleppe about exemption was correct and we apply it here.in united states department of state washington post,the supreme court explained that congress primary purpose in enacting exemption was to protect individuals from the injury and embarrassment that can result from the unnecessary disclosure of personal information,d emphases added.the court held that exemption was not limited to a narrow class of files containing only a discrete kind of personal information,but was intended to cover detailed government records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.id.at.as we explained in horner,t he supreme court has made clear that exemption is designed to protect personal information in public records.at.were we to deem an individual financial information unprotected by exemption simply because it is found in a business record,a cardinal purpose of exemption would not be served.it is clear that businesses themselves do not have protected privacy interests under exemption,but where their records reveal financial information easily traceable to an individual,disclosing those records jeopardizes a personal privacy interest that exemption protects.we thus hold that exemption applies to financial information in business records when the business is individually owned or closely held,and the records would necessarily reveal at least a portion of the owner personal finances.kleppe,at.
in our case,to determine whether the compliance file and the gis database are similar files covered by exemption,we must consider whether the farms are individually owned or closely held,and whether disclosure of the files would reveal information about individual farmers personal finances.in its affidavits,usda asserts that approximately percent of the farms represented in the files are family owned,meaning they are businesses or small family farms in which the financial makeup of the businesses mirrors the financial situation of the individual family members.wieland declaration.usda explains that the requested files contain various data fields such as state code,county code,farm number,and tract number,which are used together to trace the files to a specific agricultural producer or landowner,who are sic almost exclusively individual producers and closely held businesses.id.in the affidavit of its president,multi ag responds that the data in the compliance file and the gis database are not about individuals,but are all generic or demographic.affidavit of john montandon,montandon affidavit.multi ag further argues that many farms have multiple owners and operators and that this wide variety of ownership and operating vehicles completely negates any inference about the personal finances of any individual.id.
although usda does not offer evidence of specific farms owned by named individuals whose privacy interests in their personal financial information would be compromised by disclosure,it nonetheless establishes that a significant portion of the farms described in the compliance file and in the gis database are individually owned or closely held.information about the crops on these farms would necessarily reveal at least a portion of the owner personal finances.kleppe,at.multi ag affidavits have not controverted usda affidavits on this point.see gallant,at.multi ag has shown that because farm ownership is complex,the crop information that is revealed may be less invasive of individual privacy than usda claims,but multi ag has not shown that all farms are owned in such a manner that disclosing their assets will in no instances allow the public to trace the information to individual farmers.multi ag in fact concedes that many farms are owned by a single family.id.it counters that these family owned farms are often large,substantial businesses,but disclosure of an individual financial information is no less protected under exemption simply because his assets are significant.the affidavits do not establish the number of farms for which the information would be easily traceable to individuals,but they confirm that this is the case for at least a significant portion of them,and this showing is sufficient for us to conclude that the files are covered by exemption.
balancing privacy and public interests 
the balancing analysis for foia exemption requires that we first determine whether disclosure of the files would compromise a substantial,as opposed to de minimis,privacy interest,because i f no significant privacy interest is implicated foia demands disclosure.ass of retired fed.employees horner.our use of the word substantial in this context means less than it might seem.a substantial privacy interest is anything greater than a de minimis privacy interest.id.finding a substantial privacy interest does not conclude the inquiry it only moves it along to the point where we can address the question whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the individual privacy concerns.ass of home builders norton.in other words,a privacy interest may be than de yet be insufficient to overcome the public interest in disclosure.
the parties dispute whether disclosure of the compliance file and the gis database would reveal private personal financial information.usda argues that disclosing the withheld information would reveal assets that,for family owned farms,would invade their owners privacy interests.for example,as usda explains,the field and crop information in the compliance file bear directly on the value of the producer land and the wealth of the producer in general.wieland declaration.disclosure of a farm reported acreage and data on the number and width of rows of tobacco may provide a snapshot of a farm financial circumstances and shed light on the financial condition of the farmer.id.disclosure of the gis database only heightens these privacy concerns because its information is set forth in photographs or maps.
by contrast,multi ag contends that release of the compliance file and the gis database would not shed light on the financial condition of any particular farm,because there are too many very common economic variables,such as market price variability,weather variability,technological changes,and disease impacts that affect farm and crop values.montandon affidavit,affidavit of william nganje,nganje affidavit.multi ag argues that it is not accurate to equate information about crops and acreage directly with financial information of farms.nganje affidavit.it also argues,as noted above,that the complexity of farm ownership negates any inference that might be drawn from the crop information about the finances of individual farmers.
although multi ag has shown that economic variables weaken the correlation between farm assets and a farmer financial situation,we conclude that the privacy interest that would be compromised by disclosure of the files is greater than de minimis.see horner,at norton.at finding that the government had established only the speculative potential of a privacy invasion without any degree of likelihood but nonetheless v iewing the asserted privacy interests as involving more than minimal invasions of privacy.telling the public how many crops are on how much land or letting the public look at photographs of farmland with accompanying data will in some cases allow for an inference to be drawn about the financial situation of an individual farmer.because usda has not made a showing of how often this may be the case,we are not persuaded that the privacy interest that may exist is particularly strong.nonetheless,our standard at this stage is not very demanding,so we are willing to engage in the balancing inquiry by concluding that disclosure of the information would constitute a more than minimal invasion of personal privacy.norton,at.
having found a greater than de minimis privacy interest in the requested information,we must weigh that privacy interest in against the public interest in the release of the records in order to determine whether,on balance,disclosure would work a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.horner,at.because the basic purpose of foia focuses on the citizens right to be informed about what their government is up to,information that sheds light on an agency performance of its statutory duties is in the public interest dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of press,d see also dep t of def.flra,d stating that the relevant public interest under foia is the extent to which disclosure of requested files would serve the core purpose of the foia,which is contribut ing significantly to public understanding of the operations or acti
