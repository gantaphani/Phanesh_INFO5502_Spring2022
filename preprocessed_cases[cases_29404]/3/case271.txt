in this case,we are presented with a preexisting sip containing language that prohibits open burning generally and contains no exception allowing farmers to burn the residue left in their fields after harvesting their crops.petitioner,safe air for everyone safe,challenges epa decision to approve an amendment to that sip authorizing such burning.safe argues that certain caa provisions which prohibit amending sips so that they interfere with meeting air quality standards forbid epa action,at least absent further analysis of field burning impact on idaho air quality epa maintains that its approval of the amendment does not contravene any caa provisions.
we hold that as it presently stands,epa approval is legally unsustainable.epa grounded its approval of this amendment on the premise that the preexisting idaho sip did not ban field burning,so that the amendment only clarified what was already the case.this view of the preexisting sip is one with which we can not agree.because our review of an administrative agency decision begins and ends with the reasoning that the agency relied upon in making that decision,see sec chenery.ctr.for biological diversity kempthorne,cir,we grant the petition for review and remand for epa reconsideration of safe objections under a correct understanding of the preexisting idaho sip.
the current treatment of field burning in the idaho sip came about as the result of a regulatory evolution.after reviewing the factual administrative record,we first explain the regulatory process established by the caa and then trace the development of the current sip provisions related to field burning in idaho.we then closely examine how the preexisting idaho sip treated field burning prior to,when epa approved an amendment to the sip that explicitly authorized the practice.finally,we explain why our interpretation of the sip as it existed at the time of the amendment resolves this case and requires that we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.
open burning of agricultural fields is a common practice in idaho,particularly among bluegrass farmers in the northern portion of the state.those farmers maintain that burning the grass residue improves the productivity of their fields and has certain environmental benefits,views with which the idaho legislature has expressed agreement.see idaho code ann.the legislature finds that the current knowledge and technology support the practice of burning crop residue to control disease,weeds,pests,and to enhance crop rotations the legislature finds that due to the climate,soils,and crop rotations unique to north idaho counties,crop residue burning is a prevalent agricultural practice and that there is an environmental benefit to protecting water quality from the growing of certain crops in environmentally sensitive areas.safe air for everyone meyer,cir recognizing that the growers realize farming benefits from reusing grass residue in the process of open burning.
despite these attested benefits,the administrative record establishes that such field burning is also a source of particulate matter that contributes to air pollution.safe submitted evidence indicating that the burning of agricultural fields in idaho creates significant air quality problems.that evidence documents that clouds of smoke cover large portions of rural idaho and surrounding states during burning season that area doctors believe that this smoke has had particularly severe health consequences for individuals with respiratory ailments that some individuals with such ailments have fled their homes during burning season to avoid the smoke and that a coroner report linked at least one fatality to field burning.epa has recognized that substantial pollution and health problems are created by the practice.see epa,agricultural burning epa makes northwest field burning a top priority f ield burning can cause serious environmental and health effects scientific with thousands of that smoke is unhealthy exposure to fine particles,either alone or combined with other air pollutants,has been linked to difficulty in breathing,aggravated asthma,increased emergency room visits and hospital admissions,and,in some cases,premature deaths.
under the caa,epa has the authority to issue national air quality standards setting the maximum allowable concentration of a given pollutant.a using this authority,epa has issued limits for particulate matter.
to assure that such air quality standards are met,the caa establishes a system heavily dependant upon state participation.see a each state shall have the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within the entire geographic area comprising such state see generally train natural res.def.council,d.as a central aspect of this system,states promulgate sips that provide for implementation,maintenance,and enforcement of the caa air quality standards within the state.a.although states retain significant flexibility in establishing the details of these plans,the caa,and epa regulations,outline many required features.id.a pt.among them is the mandate that state plans provide for regular revisions to reflect evolving air quality conditions and standards.a h.these revisions need not be wholesale recastings of sips instead,the caa allows the states to submit,and epa to review,piecemeal amendments dealing with discrete sip provisions,leaving most of the plan untouched.see hall epa,cir.
before a sip becomes effective,epa must determine that it meets the caa requirements.k.epa must also approve plan amendments and shall not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress or any other applicable requirement of the caa.id.l.
idaho,like every other state,was first required to submit a sip to epa within thirteen months of the act passage.see train,at.the original idaho sip was approved by epa in may.approval and promulgation of implementation plans,may.a provision on open burning was among the idaho state regulations incorporated into that sip no person shall allow,suffer,cause or permit any open burning operation which does not fall into at least one of the categories of section.field burning was included in the types of burning allowed by section,but with significant limitations 
the open burning of plant life grown on the premises in the course of any agricultural,forestry,or land clearing operation may be permitted when it can be shown that such burning is necessary and that no fire or traffic hazard will occur.convenience of disposal is not of itself a valid necessity for burning.
it shall be the responsibility of any person conducting such burning to make every reasonable effort to burn only when weather conditions are conducive to a good smoke dissipation and only when an economical and reasonable alternate method of disposal is not available.
when such alternate method is made available,it shall be put into use within a reasonable time.
any person conducting an agricultural,forestry,or land clearing burning operation similar to an operation carried out by a governmental agency shall follow the rules and procedures of the agency with regard to minimizing air pollution.
when such burning creates air pollution or a public nuisance,additional restrictions may be imposed to minimize the effect upon the environment.
section also allowed eight other categories of open burning food preparation and recreational fires weed control fires fires for firefighting training industrial flares residential solid waste disposal fires in rural areas disposal site fires junked motor vehicle fires and orchard fires 
in,epa approved amendments to the idaho sip that substantially changed the open burning provisions.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans,july,noting that in idaho submission,the existing rules for control of open burning and categories of allowable burning were revised extensively and that t hese new and revised provisions for open burning comply with epa general requirements for sip control strategies citations omitted.these sip provisions,incorporating section a of idaho air pollution regulations in effect on december,contained a general prohibition on open air burning 
no person shall allow,suffer,cause or permit any open burning operation unless it is a category of open burning set forth in section and does not include any of the following materials 
ii.dead animals or parts thereof 
iii.junked motor vehicles or any materials resulting from a salvage operation 
iv.tires or other rubber materials or products 
vi.asphalt or composition roofing or any other asphaltic material or product 
vii.tar,tar paper,waste or heavy petroleum products,or paints 
viii.lumber or timbers treated with preservatives 
ix.trade wastes except as allowed in section 
insulated wire 
xi.pathogenic wastes or 
xii.hazardous wastes.
emphases added.the revised regulation incorporated into the sip listed categories of allowable burning that no longer included field burning.instead,that list retained seven of the nine categories of permitted fires included in the sip preparation and recreational fires,weed control fires,fires for firefighting training,industrial flares,residential solid waste disposal fires in rural areas,disposal site fires,and orchard fires omitted two categories of permitted fires from the motor vehicle fires and agricultural fires and added three new categories of permitted burning,dangerous material fires,and infectious waste burning.
in,epa approved another set of idaho sip amendments.those amendments incorporated updated versions of idaho regulations.this round of revisions,however,updated the open burning regulations only to reflect a recodification.see approval and promulgation of implementation plans,s ince epa last approved the idaho sip in,idaho has revised nearly every section of its air quality rules to some degree.many of these amendments have been editorial and are renumberings,changes to citations for rules or statutes,changes in terminology,or grammatical corrections.the substantive language of the incorporated provisions on open burning was identical to the language approved in the sip.
that rulemaking approved amendments to the sip that added field burning as an eleventh category of allowed burning.the relevant provision,incorporating section of the idaho administrative code in effect on march,states the open burning of crop residue on fields where the crops were grown is an allowable form of open burning if conducted in accordance with the smoke management and crop residue disposal act and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto.citations omitted.although idaho first enacted statutes dealing with field burning in and amended them in,and,see act of march,ch,idaho sess.laws codified as amended at idaho code a nn.to,the sip amendment approved by epa in was the first explicit reference to those statutes in the sip,see approval and promulgation of air quality implementation plan final sip,july,noting that the field burning legislation was not previously specifically submitted to epa as a sip revision 
safe submitted comments to epa during the rulemaking process and now challenges epa approval of the amendment permitting field burning in this court.we have jurisdiction over safe challenge to this rulemaking under b.this court reviews epa decision to approve sip amendments under the arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law standard of the administrative procedure act apa.hall,at see a.
as detailed above,idaho sip mandated that n o person shall allow,suffer,cause or permit any open burning operation unless it is a category of open burning set forth in ten specified sections that establish categories of open burning that are allowed when done according to the prescribed conditions.emphases added.those ten sections cover recreational and warming fires weed control fires for abatement along fence lines,canal banks,and ditch banks training fires for firefighting training industrial flares residential solid waste disposal fires landfill disposal site fires orchard fires prescribed burning for fire management purposes dangerous material fires and infectious waste burning.field burning does not fit into any of these categories.epa so acknowledged during the rulemaking proceedings.see final sip.at epa recognizes the rule language does not,on its face,appear to identify crop residue as a category of allowed burning id.at noting epa agreement with safe that field burning does not come within the prescribed burning exception.nor is it debatable that field burning is an open burning operation covered by the sip expansive mandatory terms.
in short,given the sip broad prohibition and the absence of any pertinent exception,the plain meaning of the sip,in the clearest of terms,prohibits field burning.craft park,cir t he regulation by its terms clearly prohibits appellants activities.with two exceptions,the regulation prohibits dredg ing or otherwise alter ing the seabed in any way.there can be no question but that this language prohibits the excavation activities in which appellants were engaged.second and third alterations in original quoting a iii.
in interpreting a sip,we begin with a look toward the plain meaning of the plan and stop there if the language is clear.this much is clear from bayview hunters point community advocates metropolitan transportation commission bhpca,cir,a leading case in this court in which the meaning of a sip was at stake.in considering the sip for the san francisco bay area related to transit ridership,bhpca began by observing that w e start with the plain language of the sip.a regulation should be construed to give effect to the natural and plain meaning of its words,and then noted that t he expected ridership increase was never described as anything more than a target.id.at quoting crown pac.occupational safety health review comm n,cir.because the plan did not,on its face,require a ridership increase of,we held t hat by its plain language the sip does not establish a mandatory requirement to increase transit ridership by a specified percentage weighs heavily against the conclusion that such an obligation can be imposed based upon the sip.id.internal quotation mark omitted see also idaho conservation league boer,d,refusing to defer to a state environmental agency interpretation that can not be reconciled with the plain language of the regulations included in the sip united states dynamics,the texas state agency interpretation of the texas sip to allow plantwide averaging is unreasonable,because it contradicts specific language of the sip citizens for a better env t deukmejian,refusing to credit evidence that the provisions of a sip did not make a binding commitment when the sip included unequivocal phrasing.applying that same methodology here,we would quite readily conclude that the idaho sip did not permit field burning.
epa,however,assumed during the rulemaking proceedings that this prohibition of field burning does not resolve the meaning of the sip as it existed as of the proceedings.instead,the agency considered idaho intent in drafting the sip,conducting an examination of the state overall approach to field burning and consider ing such things as the legislative history of idaho provisions related to agricultural burning and smoke management,various reports and plans prepared by the state,and various agreements signed by the state.final sip.at.epa also noted that its own past actions indicate that epa understood agricultural burning to be allowed in idaho and that the sip does not prohibit it.id.at.epa did not,however,justify or explain this approach to interpreting a sip,and the approach can not be reconciled with the role of sips in the federal regulatory scheme 
interpreting a similar state implementation plan scheme under the clean water act the supreme court held that the clean water act effectively incorporates into federal law those standards the agency reasonably determines to be applicable.in such a situation,then,state water quality by the states with substantial guidance from the epa and approved by the part of the federal law of water pollution control.arkansas oklahoma,d footnote omitted.similarly,a sip,once approved by epa,has the force and effect of federal law.trs.for alaska,at quoting union,at internal quotation marks omitted.in accord with this general proposition,a state may not unilaterally alter the legal commitments of its sip once epa approves the plan.see i f an emission standard or limitation is in effect under an applicable implementation plan such state or political subdivision may not adopt or enforce any emission standard or limitation which is less stringent than the standard or limitation under such plan motors united states,d there can be little or no doubt that the existing sip remains the applicable implementation plan even after the state has submitted a proposed revision.
thus,the sip became federal law,not state law,once epa approved it,and could not be changed unless and until epa approved any change.consequently,the state interpretation of the regulations incorporated into the sip,even if binding as a matter of state law,is not directly dispositive of the meaning of the sip.
accordingly,we look to the standards governing the interpretation of federal regulations.as a general interpretative principle,the plain meaning of a regulation governs.wards cove packing marine fisheries,cir.other interpretative materials,such as the agency own interpretation of the regulation,should not be considered when the regulation has a plain meaning.see id.citing christensen harris county,d see also roberto dep t of the navy,if the regulatory language is clear and unambiguous,the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.
the plain language of a regulation,however,will not control if clearly expressed administrative intent is to the contrary or if such plain meaning would lead to absurd results.dyer united states,cir although clearly expressed intent of regulators therefore could overcome the plain meaning of a regulation,see,we have never considered how definitely and in what form such intent must be expressed.doing so now,we conclude that the notice requirements of the apa,a,b requires that some indication of the regulatory intent that overcomes plain language must be referenced in the published notices that accompanied the rulemaking process.otherwise,interested parties would not have the meaningful opportunity to comment on proposed regulations that the apa contemplates,id.c because they would have had no way of knowing what was actually proposed.for,as the circuit has observed 
courts reliance on the plain meaning rule in this setting of interpreting administrative regulations is not a product of some fetishistic attraction to legal formalism.in order to infuse a measure of public accountability into administrative practices,the apa mandates that agencies provide interested parties notice and an opportunity for comment before promulgating rules of general applicability.this right to participate in the rulemaking process can be meaningfully exercised,however,only if the public can understand proposed rules as meaning what they appear to say.moreover,if permitted to adopt unforeseen interpretations,agencies could constructively amend their regulations while evading their duty to engage in notice and comment procedures.as applied to agency regulations,then,the plain meaning doctrine is an interpretive norm essential to perfecting the scheme of administrative governance established by the apa.
to protect the integrity of the apa required procedures,we can not permit an agency to rely on its unexpressed intentions to trump the ordinary import of its regulatory language.
exportal ltda.united states,citations and emphases omitted.
such a mode of interpretation is particularly sensible under the caa,which requires that judicial challenges be filed within sixty days of a sip approval.b.if an agency can promulgate a regulation with plain language that dictates one meaning but later interpret it according to an intent indicated neither in the regulatory language nor in the promulgation documents,parties may depend on the plain meaning of the regulation in deciding not to launch a challenge within the prescribed time limit.if,later,the agency relies on an undisclosed intended meaning,interested parties might be foreclosed from challenging the regulation,contrary to the statutory permission to launch such challenges 
here,following the plain language prohibiting field burning in idaho sip does not produce absurd results or contravene the pertinent administrative history.see dyer,at.as the administrative record of air quality and health problems created by field burning demonstrates,it is far from patently inconceivable that the federal air pollution law covering idaho would ban a significant source of the state particulate pollution.indeed,one of idaho neighbors has enacted a broad ban,except in limited circumstances,on the open burning on farms that produce grass seed.see.admin.code.so the interpretation of the sip mandated by its plain language is not absurd at all,much less sufficiently absurd to justify departure from a plain words interpretation.see crooks harrelson.t o justify a departure from the letter of the law upon that ground,the absurdity must be so gross as to shock the general moral or common sense.
likewise,no administrative intent expressed in an appropriate way contradicts the plain meaning of the sip none of the published notices that accompanied the consideration or adoption of idaho previous sips established any intent concerning field burning.instead,epa purported intent to allow field burning in idaho is demonstrated,if at all,only through informal materials such as letters and presentations and its silent acquiescence when approving certain antipollution strategies submitted by idaho although idaho lawmakers and regulators made their intentions toward field burning known through more formal actions,such as enacting legislation and regulations allowing field burning,none of these measures were referenced in the published materials that accompanied adoption of the earlier sips.
for the first time on appeal,epa proffers two additional reasons we should not rely on the plain meaning of the and earlier sips.we owe no deference to these post hoc litigating positions,adopted by counsel for epa.see bowen georgetown,d w e have declined to give deference to an agency counsel interpretation of a statute where the agency itself has articulated no position on the question.we do not find epa arguments persuasive.
epa argues,first,that giving effect to the plain meaning of a sip contrary to the true intent of state policymakers would violate case law prohibiting epa from enacting more stringent sip provisions than those proposed by the state.see riverside cement thomas,cir holding that epa approval of a sip after removing a proviso submitted by the state was arbitrary and capricious bethlehem steel gorsuch,cir holding the caa partial approval provision did not allow epa to make a sip stricter train,at.s o long as the ultimate effect of a state choice of emission limitations is compliance with the national standards for ambient air,the state is at liberty to adopt whatever mix of emission limitations it deems best suited to its particular situation.hall,at by virtue of the states roles in devising a strategy and adopting an implementation plan,i t is to the states that the act assigns initial and primary responsibility for deciding what emissions reductions will be required from which sources.alteration in original quoting whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.those decisions,however,interpreted the caa provisions concerning the authority of epa to approve or deny sips.they are not relevant to the task presently before the sip language that was originally proposed
