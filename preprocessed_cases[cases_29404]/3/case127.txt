lamers dairy lamers sought an exemption from milk marketing order,promulgated under the agricultural marketing agreement act of,et.after the secretary of the united states department of agriculture the usda denied the petition in a final administrative order,lamers sought review in the district court.the usda counterclaimed for enforcement of the secretary decision and for a judgment against lamers in an amount equal to the unpaid monetary assessments due under the terms of the marketing order.the district court granted summary judgment to the usda on lamers complaint and on the usda counterclaim.it ordered further proceedings on the amount due.subsequently,the district court denied a motion for reconsideration by lamers and entered an amended judgment awarding the government.lamers appeals.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
lamers dairy,a wisconsin dairy,has as its principal business the handling and packaging of fluid milk.in this appeal,lamers challenges aspects of the federal regulatory scheme.to understand the nature of lamers challenges,we must discuss briefly the dairy industry and the regulatory and market forces governing it 
the dairy industry 
in the dairy industry,dairy farmers,also referred to as producers,produce and sell raw milk to handlers.handlers,in turn,prepare the milk product for resale to consumers or serve as intermediaries to those who do.consumer dairy products,such as fluid milk beverages,ice cream and cheese,can all be produced from grade a or fluid grade raw milk in the consumer market,however,milk beverages generally command a higher price than products,which are known also as manufactured dairy products.for this reason,the market into which dairy farmers sell their product more highly values and pays a premium price for grade a milk ultimately used to produce beverage milk.this market premium based on end use creates an incentive among producers to divert their grade a product to fluid milk handlers were this incentive not controlled,lower market prices would result,harming milk production revenues 
the dairy industry also is characterized by daily and seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.consumer demand fluctuates significantly on a daily basis,primarily due to consumer buying patterns milk production,on the other hand,is relatively constant on a daily basis.conversely,milk production varies seasonally based on the animals nutritional health.in fall and winter months,less milk is produced,but in spring and summer months,more milk is produced.to meet consumer demand in the winter,producers must maintain large herds these same herds in the summer.given milk perishable quality,the supply must go to market at least every other day.historically,handlers were thus able to obtain summer supplies at bargain prices.
the regulatory scheme 
in the wake of the great depression,in an attempt to address these unique industry characteristics,congress enacted various provisions governing the dairy industry as part of the agricultural marketing agreement act of the amaa.a driving purpose of the amaa was to remove ruinous and competition among the producers and permit all farmers to share the benefits of fluid milk profits according to the value of goods produced and services rendered.zuber allen,d.the amaa,as amended,thus ensures that producers receive a uniform minimum price for their product,regardless of the end use to which it is put.
to accomplish this objective,the statute contains several mechanisms.first,it authorizes the secretary to classify milk according to its end use and to establish minimum prices for each classification.see a.second,it authorizes the secretary to establish a uniform minimum price,termed the blend price,based on a weighted average of all units of production of classes of milk sold to handlers associated with a marketing area.see id.third,it requires handlers to pay producers the blend price,regardless of the end use to which the milk will be put.see id.b.fourth,it authorizes a method for adjustments in payments among handlers so that the final amount paid by each handler equals the value of the milk that handler has purchased,according to the minimum prices established.see id.c.overall,the provisions attempt to promote orderly by maintaining minimum prices for producers and limiting the competitive effects of excess supply of grade a milk.
although it protects producers,the amaa regulates handlers only.pursuant to the amaa directives,the secretary has classified milk into the following classes of utilization class i milk includes fluid milk processed and bottled as a beverage class ii milk includes soft milk products such as cottage cheese,sour cream,yogurt and ice cream class iii includes hard cheese and cream cheese and class iv includes raw milk used for butter and dry milk powder.as directed by the amaa,the secretary has established a uniform pricing scheme for each of these classes of milk,as well as the average blend price handlers governed by orders must pay producers this uniform blend price.the process of blending the prices of the different classes of milk on a monthly basis has come to be known as pooling.
this uniform minimum pricing is intended to reduce the incentive producers would have to divert all fluid milk to class i handlers and,literally,to flood that market.as the system operates,dairy producers within a marketing area receive the guaranteed uniform blend price for their milk,regardless of the end use to which it is put.because the uniform price is a weighted average,some handlers pay producers less for their milk than its market worth while other handlers pay more.handlers who pay less to producers must make compensating payments into the producer settlement fund while handlers who pay more to producers may withdraw compensating payments from the fund thus,within the regulatory scheme,handlers ultimately pay an amount equal to the utilization value of the milk they purchase this simplified example of the regulatory scheme by the district court for the district of connecticut is helpful 
suppose handler a purchases units of class i fluid milk from producer a at the minimum value of per unit.assume further that handler b purchases units of class ii soft milk products milk from producer b at the minimum value of per unit,and that handler c purchases units of class iii hard milk products milk from producer c at per unit.assuming that this constitutes the entire milk market for a regulatory district,during this period the total price paid for milk is,making the average price per unit of milk.thus,under the regulatory scheme,producers a,b,and c all receive for the milk they supplied,irrespective of the use to which it was put.however,handler a must,in addition to the that it must tender to producer a,pay into the settlement fund because the value of the milk it purchased exceeded the regulatory average price.along the same vein,handler c will receive from the settlement fund because it will pay producer c more than the milk it received was worth.
stew leonard glickman.the system of compensating payments into and out of the settlement fund thereby fulfills the amaa requirement that the total sums paid by each handler shall equal the value of the milk purchased by him at the prices fixed.c.
the country is divided into regional areas,which are governed by different marketing orders.milk marketing order governs the upper midwest marketing area,including portions of illinois,iowa,michigan,minnesota,north dakota,south dakota and wisconsin.as a wisconsin dairy that bottles milk for fluid consumption,lamers is subject to regulation under milk marketing order as a class i handler.
price inversions 
as discussed,class i prices are generally higher than class iii prices.thus,the blend price usually falls above the class iii price,and class iii handlers typically are entitled to withdraw compensating payments from the settlement fund after paying producers the blend price.however,occasionally,periods of price inversion occur in which class iii prices exceed class i prices.price inversions occur in part because of differences in how and when classes of milk are priced.class i milk prices are set prospectively while class iii and iv prices are set retrospectively,based on actual market prices during the pertinent time period.the usda has explained 
class price inversion occurs when a markets sic regulated price for milk used in manufacturing exceeds the class i fluid milk price in a given month,and causes serious competitive inequities among dairy farmers and regulated handlers.advanced pricing of class i milk actually causes this situation when manufactured product prices are increasing rapidly.
milk in the new england and other marketing areas,dep t of.thus,price inversions occur during times of increased demand for manufactured products,primarily cheese.
under order,class iii handlers are not required to participate in the regulatory pooling.they may either join the pool or remain outside the minimum price structure.this is true to some extent under other orders as well.when class iii handlers withdraw from the pool,or,they are not obligated to make compensating payments to the settlement fund.during times of price inversion,then,class iii handlers have an incentive to withdraw from the pool.the usda has explained the effect of price inversions on the dairy industry 
in the past when price inversions have occurred,the industry has contended with them by taking a loss on the milk that had to be pooled because of commitments to the class i market,and by choosing not to pool large volumes of milk that normally would have been associated with federal milk order pools.when price inversions occur,it places fluid milk processors and dairy farmers or cooperatives who service the class i market at a competitive disadvantage relative to those who service the manufacturing milk market.
milk used in class i in federal order markets must be pooled,but milk for manufacturing is pooled voluntarily and will not be pooled if the returns from manufacturing exceed the blend price of the marketwide pool.thus,an inequitable situation has developed where milk for manufacturing is pooled only when associating it with a marketwide pool increases returns.
id.when producers prefer to sell outside the pool due to higher manufacturing returns,class i handlers may have to pay premiums to attract their supply.
thus,during times of price inversion,class iii handlers who may pay less than the class iii price.at the same time,class i handlers inside the pool may be forced practically to pay more than the class i price because of premiums.in sum,the ability of class iii handlers to under order has negative economic consequences on class i handlers who must remain within the pool.
administrative and district court proceedings 
in september,lamers stopped making required compensating payments into the settlement fund.instead,lamers filed an administrative petition with the usda for exemption modification of the provisions of order.lamers petition alleged that order violated equal protection and contravened the amaa by permitting unfair trade practices.lamers sought relief in the form of an order exempting it from pooling and from the obligation to make payments into the producer settlement fund.after an evidentiary hearing,an administrative law judge alj sustained order and dismissed lamers petition.lamers appealed to a usda judicial officer.the judicial officer affirmed the alj.lamers then brought an action in the district court,and the usda counterclaimed for enforcement of the secretary decision.
the district court affirmed the secretary.it determined that,as to lamers unfair trade practices claim,lamers was attempting to sue under a right.as to lamers equal protection claim,the district court noted that the economic regulation was subject to rational basis scrutiny and concluded that the provisions of the regulatory scheme survived challenge under that standard.the district court subsequently ordered lamers to pay to the settlement fund.lamers timely appeals.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see indiana family soc.servs.admin.thompson,cir.all facts are drawn and all inferences viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.
equal protection claims 
lamers contends that the ability of class iii handlers to,and its inability to do so,violates its right to equal protection of the law.when considering an equal protection claim,we first must ask whether the governmental action involves fundamental rights or targets a suspect class.see,llc wisconsin dep t of,cir.the distinction drawn by the secretary between class i and class iii handlers is based upon the end use to which these handlers put producer milk.it therefore clearly does not involve fundamental rights or target a suspect class and is merely an economic regulation.see,id.such an economic classification is accorded a strong presumption of validity.heller doe,d.the presumption applies not only to legislative actions,but also extends to administrative action.see pac.states box basket white.see also steffan perry.
we therefore review the secretary difference in treatment to determine whether there is a conceivably rational relationship to a legitimate interest.see fcc beach communications,d united states ret.bd.fritz,d.practically,our review must be highly deferential 
e qual protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices.in areas of social and economic policy,a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.
beach communications,at.governmental action only fails rational basis scrutiny if no sound reason for the action can be hypothesized.see northside sanitary landfill,city of indianapolis,cir.furthermore,a circumspect approach is especially appropriate in reviewing a challenge to the federal regime.see blair freeman,a court deference to administrative expertise rises to zenith in connection with the intricate complex of regulation of.any court is chary lest its disarrangement of such a regulatory equilibrium reflect lack of judicial comprehension more than lack of executive authority.see also zuber allen,d describing federal regime as a labyrinth.
the usda submits that the different treatment of class i and class iii handlers is rationally based because of the purposes of regulation and the differing marketing conditions faced by fluid milk and cheese producers.we agree.the amaa charges the secretary of agriculture with establishing and maintaining orderly marketing conditions so as to establish parity prices to farmers.see.the secretary also is charged with establishing and maintaining orderly marketing conditions so as to ensure an orderly flow of supply and thereby prevent unreasonably fluctuating prices.see id.in order to achieve these legitimate marketing objectives,it is conceivably rational for the secretary to treat class i and class iii handlers differently with respect to pooling requirements.
in assessing the rationality of the secretary action,we must recall the relevant supply and demand characteristics of the market.as we have noted previously,the milk production industry is highly subject to seasonal fluctuations and characterized by excess supply.that excess can not be stored by producers it must be marketed.fluid milk products less easily are stored and transported than milk in other forms.they are more perishable and thus more subject to the fluctuations in daily demand.they are generally more highly valued.these circumstances affect the market for producer milk in critical ways and thus provide a rational basis for different pooling requirements among fluid milk and manufacturing handlers.to maintain stability in the milk market,the secretary reasonably can require that milk used to produce fluid products be pooled while exempting other handlers from obligatory pooling.indeed,the amaa is premised on obligatory pooling of class i milk,so that all producers may partake of its economic benefits.see zuber,at.the plain thrust of the federal statute was to remove ruinous and competition among the producers and permit all farmers to share the benefits of fluid milk profits according to the value of goods produced and services rendered.
next,we must keep in mind that pooling essentially requires handlers to pay out a uniform minimum price for their supply and is required,in part,to maintain prices for producers.see alto dairy veneman,cir describing system as means of redistribut ing wealth from consumers to producers of milk.class i handlers end use typically represents the cream of the crop,or the highest end use of grade a producer milk,and so class i purchases in the pool generally raise the blend price.class iii handlers,however,can use grade b milk in their products,and their purchases in the pool of grade a milk generally lower the blend price.it is relatively unsurprising,then,that the secretary deems pooling by class i handlers vital to the regulatory scheme but deems pooling by class iii handlers less essential,even though price inversions sometimes occur that disrupt normal marketing conditions.
finally,we note that the history of the regime evidences primary concern with producer competition to make sales to the fluid milk market,not the manufacturing market.see zuber,at.discussing amaa purpose to remove ruinous and competition among producers for sales in the fluid milk market see also block cmty.nutrition,d discussing pooling requirements as means t o discourage destabilizing competition among producers for the more desirable fluid milk sales united states rock royal.characterizing system of compensating payments under the settlement fund as reasonably adapted device designed to foster,protect and encourage interstate commerce by smoothing out the difficulties of the surplus and competition which burdened the fluid milk market given this driving concern over ruinous and producer competition in the fluid milk market,zuber,at,it is not irrational for the secretary to allow class iii when market incentives are reversed and when sales to the manufacturing market become more attractive to producers 
lamers challenge to the exemption of class iii handlers from pooling requirements is essentially one to the breadth of the regulatory regime,the secretary failure to require class iii handlers to make compensating payments to the settlement fund when price inversions occur.however,it is that reform may take one step at a time,addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind without creating an equal protection violation.williamson lee optical.as such,provisions are virtually unreviewable because the government must be allowed leeway to approach a perceived problem incrementally.beach communications,at.
similarly,equal protection does not require a governmental entity to choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.dandridge williams,d.indeed,m ere underinclusiveness is not fatal to the validity of a law under the fifth amendment guarantee of equal protection.seariver.fin.holdings,mineta,cir internal quotation and citation omitted see also minnesota ex rel.pearson probate court of ramsey county.if the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt,it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied.internal quotation and citation omitted.furthermore,broad legislative classification must be judged by reference to characteristics typical of the affected classes.califano jobst,d.
in light of these governing principles,it is clear that congress and the secretary can regulate based upon typical conditions without thereby violating equal protection.here,congress and the secretary have chosen to address the perceived problem of excess milk supply in the dairy industry by requiring class i handlers to pool all their supply while exempting other handlers from that same requirement,based on an assumption that class i milk carries the highest market value.they have chosen,in effect,to address the usual situation while not addressing the abnormal,aberrant situation in which class i milk does not carry the highest market price.such incremental regulation does not violate equal protection see beach communications,at.see also bilandic,cir noting that the illinois supreme court could act incrementally in restricting judicial employees political activities,while exempting sitting judges from that restriction,regardless of the probability that the government will ever address the rest of the problem.
we recognize that the secretary exemption of class iii handlers from pooling requirements effectively gives them a competitive advantage.they may participate in pooling when it is beneficial and withdraw when it is not.see milk in the new england and other marketing areas,dep t of.at.thus,the class iii pooling exemption is economically harmful to lamers and other class i handlers as well as to producers committed to dealing with them who must suffer the effects of class iii.that harm,however,does not rise to the level of invidious discrimination.williamson,at.therefore,it is not a harm we can redress.see dandridge,at.noting that i n the area of economics and social welfare,a governmental entity does not violate equal protection merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect,and further stating,i f the classification has some reasonable basis,it does not offend the constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality quoting lindsley natural carbonic gas.see also heller doe,d r review in equal protection analysis is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices.quoting beach communications,at.
in cases involving economic and social regulation,so long as distinctions are conceivably rational,the recourse of a disadvantaged entity lies in the democratic process see beach communications,at.the constitution presumes that,absent some reason to infer antipathy,even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.quoting vance bradley,d footnote omitted see also,at noting that improvident decisions should be rectified through the democratic process and not the courts.lamers equal protection claim based on the different pooling regulations governing class i and class iii handlers must therefore fail.
we briefly address one additional issue under the rubric of equal protection analysis.lamers submits that the failure of the regulations to account for certain premiums it must pay to attract its supply violates its right to equal protection.lamers equal protection claim based on these premiums is fundamentally flawed because lamers presents no distinction for this court to review.specifically,lamers has demonstrated no difference between it and any other handler as to the secretary treatment of these premiums the regulations simply do not take them into account 
even if we treat lamers complaint as somehow raising an equal protection claim,it fails.although some handlers may be able to attract supply without paying such premiums,the secretary decision not to give any handler credit for such competitive costs does not thereby rise to an equal protection violation,at determining that statute,which prohibited certain tobacco wholesalers from deducting trade discounts from costs but permitted other wholesalers to deduct such costs,did not violate equal protection.it is conceivably rational that accounting for such costs of competition would hinder the objectives of the regulatory scheme,in that it would reduce payments to the settlement fund.furthermore,as we have discussed,the secretary is permitted to engage in increm
