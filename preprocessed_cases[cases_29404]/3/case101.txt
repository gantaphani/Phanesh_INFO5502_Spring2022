in,terry bought a poultry farm in tennessee and entered into an agreement with tyson,which contracts with independent growers to raise broiler chickens owned and provided by the company.tyson provides the chicks,feed,and technical advice the responsibility of the grower is to raise the chickens to a target processing weight and then return the mature birds to tyson.tyson pays its growers according to a formula that measures the relative productivity of the growers by comparing the amount of feed provided and the weight of the chickens upon their return to the processing plant.consequently,the weight of the chickens at the end of the period is an important factor in the compensation equation,and federal regulations provide that weighing is to occur immediately upon arrival at the processor plant.see b a grower is entitled to watch his birds being weighed.see e tyson alleged failure to promptly weigh terry chickens and allow terry access to the weighing of his birds began the chain of events that culminated in this lawsuit.
before he purchased the farm,terry researched the poultry business,reviewed the seller production records,and spoke with tyson production manager at its shelbyville,tennessee,complex about tyson intent to continue its placement of chickens at the farm following the sale.the production manager assured terry that the farm and equipment were in excellent condition and that it was a farm.these assurances lead terry to believe that the farm would need no substantial improvements in the near future.in the summer of,terry and his family moved to the farm,and he took over management of the poultry flock.
terry thereafter became aware of numerous problems that poultry growers were experiencing with tyson and other poultry processors.in,terry attended a conference in north carolina with other contract growers,attorneys representing growers,and representatives of farmers organizations.the purpose of the conference was to address the problems faced by growers in their dealings with processors and to provide guidelines for the organization of grower associations.after the conference,terry became actively involved in organizing the poultry growers in his area into what ultimately became the tennessee poultry growers association tpga.in,he was elected chairman of the directors for the tpga.in his capacity as a tpga officer,terry educated poultry growers about their rights under federal law and reported complaints about tyson to officials at the packers and stockyards administration in washington,
meanwhile,terry became concerned that his poultry was not being weighed promptly upon arrival at the tyson plant,as required by his contract and federal regulations.in august and december of,he went to tyson plant to watch his birds being weighed,but he was denied access.he complained to a federal official and requested that a letter be sent to tyson.on february,terry followed a truck loaded with his poultry to tyson processing plant.when he arrived at the plant at,he was told that his chickens would not be weighed until after.when terry returned at,he was once again denied access to the plant.plaintiff called an agent with the grain inspection division of the packers and stockyards administration,who told terry that he was in route to the plant and would find out why terry was not allowed to observe the weighing of his poultry.
later that same week,terry met with tyson local managers.following the meeting,tyson delayed its placement of birds on terry farm for a full flock rotation,costing terry in lost compensation.when terry met with tyson managers again on march,they informed him that tyson made a company decision to discontinue the placement of birds at his farm after he made the weighing complaint.terry asked for,but was refused,compensation for the damages he sustained as a result of the missed flock.
on january,tyson notified terry that his contract would not be renewed,allegedly because of his confrontational behavior toward tyson representatives and his failure to make costly and unnecessary changes to his poultry operation,despite the fact that terry was a successful poultry producer and was well above average in the grower rankings.terry avers that t he reasons provided by tyson for termination of his contract were false and pretextual to disguise tyson real reason,which was to thwart his efforts to organize growers,and in retaliation for his complaints to the packers and stockyards administration.terry subsequently advertised his farm for sale,but claims that he has been unable to sell it due to tyson demands for costly upgrades as a condition to the continued placement of poultry at the farm.this lawsuit followed.

hereinafter.
terry alleges in count two of his complaint that d efendant violated the psa by engaging in unfair,unjustly discriminatory,or deceptive practices or devises sic in violation of of the psa,a and by subjecting plaintiff to undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in violation of b.however,tyson argued,and the district court agreed,that because the psa is essentially an antitrust statute,subsections a and b require a party to allege an adverse effect on competition in order to sustain a cause of action.the district court dismissed terry psa claim for failure to allege such anticompetitive activity on tyson part.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted the dearth of sixth circuit precedent on this issue and followed the prevailing tide of other circuit court decisions that have held that subsections a and b of require an anticompetitive effect.
the tide has now become a tidal wave,with the recent issuance of the fifth circuit court of appeals en banc decision in wheeler pilgrim pride,cir en banc,in which that court joined the ranks of all other federal appellate courts that have addressed this precise issue when it held that the purpose of the packers and stockyards act of is to protect competition and,therefore,only those practices that will likely affect competition adversely violate the act.wheeler,at.all told,seven fourth,fifth,seventh,eighth,ninth,tenth,and eleventh now weighed in on this issue,with unanimous results.see wheeler,been,cir pickett tyson fresh meats,cir,cert.denied,london fieldale farms,cir,cert.denied,ibp,glickman,cir philson goldsboro milling,wl,at cir,unpublished table decision jackson swift eckrich,cir farrow united states dep t of,cir dejong packing united states dep t of,cir,cert.denied,and pac.trading wilson,cir.
in this appeal,terry,joined by amicus curiae united states department of agriculture usda,seeks to persuade us to adopt the decidedly minority view embraced by some district courts and vigorously articulated by judge garza,along with six of his colleagues,in his dissenting opinion in wheeler.see wheeler,at garza,dissenting.see also schumacher tyson fresh meats,d,holding that a does not prohibit only those unfair and deceptive practices which adversely affect competition kinkaid john morrell,d,t his court finds that only a strained reading of the statute could require that practices that are unfair or deceptive within the meaning of a must also be monopolistic or anticompetitive to be prohibited.gerace utica veal,holding that it is unnecessary to allege restraint of trade or hindrance of competition under a.
ultimately,terry and the usda would have this court deviate from the course taken by the seven other circuits that have spoken on this issue,thus creating a conflict.we decline to do so.w hile we recognize that we are not bound by the law of other circuits,this court has also routinely looked to the majority position of other circuits in resolving undecided issues of law.we also take note of the importance of maintaining harmony among the circuits on issues of law.wong partygaming,cir citations omitted see also united states washington,cir t his court routinely looks to our sister circuits for guidance when we encounter a legal question that we have not previously passed upon.as one court has explained,this is more than a courtesy 
as a general matter,we do not create conflicts among the circuits without strong cause.we adhere to this view because federal law unlike state law is supposed to be unitary.it would,of course,be foolhardy to suggest that we should blindly adhere to another circuit court decision as a method of preventing intercircuit conflict.congress has created multiple and intermediate federal appellate courts,each with an equal power and duty to decide the cases properly brought before it.this regime,by design,embraces the possibility of a considered difference in views among the circuit courts on a given question a policy of blind adherence to the decision of another circuit,apart from any utility it might have in promoting uniformity and predictability in outcome,would flout the manifest will of congress.as ginsburg had occasion to observe in in re korean air lines disaster,each federal court has an obligation to engage independently in reasoned analysis,aff.at the same time,the interest that all prospective parties before the court have in uniformity and predictability of outcome must be given its due.we thus temper the independence of the analysis in which we engage by according great weight to the decisions of other circuits on the same question.
washington energy united states,indeed,the wheeler court was sensitive to the vast body of cohesive precedent when it pointed out that p redictability must be the lodestar.wheeler,at.
as the next in line to interpret requirements,we,too,assign great weight to the unanimity of thought that precedes our own determination of this issue.needless to say,w e are not merely to count noses.united states hill,cir however,the rationale employed by our sister circuits is and grounded on sound principles of statutory construction.moreover,under the fundamental principle of stare decisis,we deem the construction of this nearly statute to be a matter of settled law.we therefore join these circuits and hold that in order to succeed on a claim under a and b of the psa,a plaintiff must show an adverse effect on competition.
in the present case,the district court properly determined that although terry asserts a number of wrongful acts by tyson,his complaint does not allege that tyson actions had an anticompetitive effect plaintiff focuses solely on how defendant action harmed him as an individual grower.he makes no allegations regarding the effect of defendant actions on the pricing of poultry or on overall competition in the poultry industry.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting tyson motion to dismiss terry psa claim.
congress enacted the afpa in to protect the right of farmers and other producers of agricultural commodities to join cooperative associations through which to market their products,and to rectify a perceived imbalance in bargaining position between producers and processors of such products.canners and freezers ass n,agric.mktg.and bargaining,footnotes omitted.t he act principal purpose is to protect individual producers from interference by processors when deciding whether to belong to a producers association see also newark gardens.potato indus.comm n,cir because agricultural products are produced by numerous individual farmers,the marketing and bargaining position of individual farmers will be adversely affected unless they are free to join together voluntarily in cooperative organizations as authorized by law.consistent with these aims,the afpa proscribes certain actions by processors,known as handlers under the act 
it shall be unlawful for any handler knowingly to engage or permit any employee or agent to engage in the following practices 
a to coerce any producer in the exercise of his right to join and belong to or to refrain from joining or belonging to an association of producers,or to refuse to deal with any producer because of the exercise of his right to join and belong to such an association or 
b to discriminate against any producer with respect to price,quantity,quality,or other terms of purchase,acquisition,or other handling of agricultural products because of his membership in or contract with an association of producers.
in count one of his complaint,terry alleges that tyson violated by knowingly permitting its employee or agent to coerce and intimidate plaintiff in the exercise of his right to join and belong to an association of producers and by discriminating against plaintiff with respect to the quantity and quality of poultry and feed supplied to plaintiff because of his membership in an association of producers.
the parties do not dispute that tyson is a handler and terry is a producer,as defined by the afpa.see a and defining these respective terms.rather,the dispositive issue is whether the association with which terry was the afpa definition of an association of producers,so as to bring his allegations of coercion and discrimination under the protective umbrella of the statute.during the time period relevant to this cause of action,the afpa defined an association of producers as any association of producers of agricultural products engaged in marketing,bargaining,shipping,or processing as defined in section a of title,or in section of this title.c emphasis added 
section c of the afpa two other statutes,the agricultural marketing act of ama and the act,which define similar farming associations.the ama was enacted to promote the efficient production and distribution of agricultural commodities,in part,by permitting producers to organize cooperative associations to assist in bringing products to market.a see fairdale farms,yankee milk,cir observing that the declared policy of the ama is to promote the effective merchandising of agricultural commodities through a farm marketing system of and cooperative associations.the ama defines the term cooperative association as 
any association in which farmers act together in processing,preparing for market,handling,marketing the farm products of persons so engaged,and also means any association in which farmers act together in purchasing,testing,grading,processing,distributing,furnishing farm supplies farm business services 
the act removed from the proscription of the antitrust laws cooperatives formed by certain agricultural producers that otherwise would be directly competing with each other in efforts to bring their goods to market.broiler mktg.ass united states,footnote omitted.it was passed by congress in to make it clear that the formation of an agricultural organization with capital would not result in a violation of the antitrust laws,and that the organization,without antitrust consequences,could perform certain functions in preparing produce for market.id.at see also newark gardens,at noting that the act exempts agricultural cooperatives from the antitrust laws.the act includes within its scope agricultural producers who act together in associations in collectively processing,preparing for market,handling,and marketing farm products in interstate and foreign commerce.the real sense behind such an association and the prime purpose of the persons so banding together is to accomplish a common marketing.it is a collection of producers cooperating to sell the goods they have produced.united states elm springs farm,see also alexander farmers,cir the unmistakable purpose of the act is to permit farmers and only farmers to band together and benefit economically from collective marketing of their products.
in its motion to dismiss,tyson argued that the tpga does not qualify as an afpa association of producers because terry does not allege that the tpga engaged in the requisite marketing,bargaining,shipping,or processing activities enumerated in c instead,terry complaint avers only that the tpga gathered information,educated its members,and reported complaints about tyson and other processors to the purportedly outside of the purview of the afpa.
the district court examined terry complaint and,relying on the plain language of c,agreed with tyson that the tpga does not fall within the statutory definition of an association of producers 
interpreting c,the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit has held that a potato commission was not an association of producers because it did not engage in marketing,bargaining,shipping or processing of agricultural products.newark gardens.potato indus.comm n,cir.
in his capacity as president of the tpga,plaintiff gathered information from other growers about problems they were having with tyson and reported these complaints to government agencies.complaint,court doc.plaintiff also educated other growers about federal laws prohibiting abuse of growers in the poultry industry.id.at.plaintiff distributed video tapes to other growers that reported on problems in the poultry industry.id.at.from the allegations in plaintiff complaint,it appears that tpga is principally involved with educating growers about their rights and assisting growers with enforcing their rights by reporting producers violations to federal agencies.
defendant argues that tpga educational and informational efforts and,to the extent that they exist,its government complaints,do not qualify it as an association of producers under the afpa.court doc.at.the statutory language is clear that an association of producers includes only those organizations that engage in marketing,bargaining,shipping or processing of agricultural products.c.the court must therefore evaluate whether the tpga is involved with any of the specified activities.
marketing is the act of buying and selling in a market the commercial functions involved in transferring goods from producer to consumer.the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.no reasonable inference can be drawn from the allegations in the complaint that the tpga engages in buying or selling of goods in a market or in the commercial functions involved with transferring goods from producer to consumer.the actions of the tpga do not,therefore,qualify as marketing under.
shipping is the act or business of transporting goods.id.at.producing is to bring forth,yield to manufacture to cause to occur or exist to make or yield products or a product.id.at.no reasonable inference can be drawn from the complaint that the tpga is involved with shipping or producing agricultural goods under.
bargaining is to negotiate the terms of an agreement,as to sell or exchange to engage in collective bargaining to arrive at an agreement.id.at.there is no allegation that tpga negotiates on behalf of any of its members or,as discussed above,sells or exchanges agricultural goods.collective bargaining is negotiation between organized workers and their employer or employers to determine wages,hours,rules,and working conditions.id.at.although it appears that plaintiff,in his role as president of tpga,discussed issues such as working conditions and federal laws with other growers,there is no allegation that he ever discussed those issues with defendant.moreover,the relationship between plaintiff and defendant is not that of but of two commercial organizations under contractual obligations to each other.there is no indication from the allegations in the complaint that tpga had any interaction with defendant and could not,therefore,have collectively bargained with defendant.as such,there is no indication that tpga engaged in bargaining,collective or otherwise,with regard to agricultural products as required by.
the district court further determined that the tpga educational and enforcement activities did not otherwise fall within the definitions set forth in the ama and act,and observed that t here is no apparent policy reason that the activities of the tpga would be subject to antitrust laws and therefore no need to establish an exemption for such activities.therefore,because a material element of terry afpa claim was fatally lacking,the district court dismissed terry afpa claim.we affirm the district court sound decision.
terry argues that in granting tyson motion to dismiss,the district court employed a pleading standard that is too exacting under twombly.he contends that a plausible reading of his c omplaint is that one of the purposes of the tpga was to strengthen the marketing and bargaining position of the growers who were organizing to address common grievances and concerns in their relationship with tyson and,therefore,the tpga qualifies as an association of producers.according to terry,the district court narrow construction of the afpa is at odds with the remedial purpose of the statute,to prevent processors from using their superior bargaining position to the detriment of producers.terry maintains that tyson has effectively chilled the ability of its contract growers to form an association for their mutual benefit and increase their bargaining power,thereby defying the protective goals of the afpa.
however,terry interpretation of the afpa disregards the plain language of the statute,see thompson am.stainless,f d,cir en banc,and the germane maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius the expression of one thing is the exclusion of others,millsaps thompson,f d,cir,that justif ies the inference that activities not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice,not inadvertence city of cleveland ohio,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.terry complaint does not allege that the tpga engaged in any of the primary functions of an association of producers enumerated in the afpa or related statutes.moreover,terry stance is contradictory to our prior decision in newark gardens.
in newark gardens,the plaintiff,a michigan business,brought suit against the michigan potato industry commission,alleging that certain provisions of a michigan statute that required potato producers to pay a promotional assessment to the commission was in conflict with and,thus,preempted by the afpa.newark gardens,at.the plaintiff argued that it was being coerced into joining or belonging to an association of producers in violation of a of the afpa,or maintaining a marketing contract with an association of producers in violation of c.id.at.the express purpose of the potato commission was to foster,develop,and promote the potato industry through research,promotion,advertising,market expansion,development of new markets,education,and the development and dissemination of market and industry information.id.at quoting.comp.laws.we rejected the plaintiff expansive interpretation of the definition of association of producers,namely,its argument that because the potato commission supplied market information,it therefore engaged in marketing under the afpa 
the district court concluded that the definitional sections of the afpa,ama and act described traditional cooperatives among farmers and did not contemplate governmental commodity promotion boards such as the potato commission the district court found that the potato commission was not within the cooperative association tradition because it did not engage in collective bargaining on behalf of farmers,nor did it perform any act which involved the sale or transfer of title in potatoes from grower to shipper to retailer to consumer.therefore,since the commission did not fit within the definitions contained in or a,the court reasoned that it was not an association of producers within the meaning of the afpa as defined in c.we agree.
we therefore affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendant.id.at.in so holding,we distinguished treasure valley potato bargaining ass foods,cir,in which the ninth circuit court of appeals held that two associations engaged in marketing within the meaning of the act and therefore were immune from antitrust prosecution.the ninth circuit broadly construed the term marketing and concluded that even though the associations did not collectively process,prepare for market,handle or actually sell potatoes,their activities nonetheless constituted marketing because each association negotiat ed contracts for the sale of potatoes by its members,which necessarily require d supplying market information and performing other acts that are part of the aggregate of functions involved in the transferring of title to the potatoes.treasure valley,at.
in newark gardens,we concluded that t he collective bargaining activities of the associations which represented the farmers in treasure valley are clearly distinguishable from the activities of the potato commission these bargaining associations which negotiated with the processors on behalf of the farmers were within the traditional definition of cooperative associations.newark gardens,at.by contrast,the potato commission does not attempt to dictate the price,terms,or timing of the sale of potatoes in michigan.id.at.potato producers are free to sell to whomever they choose at whatever price they negotiate.id 
as our decision in newark gardens makes clear,the term association of producers includes only those organizations that are directly involved with bringing farmers products to market.the tpga,according to terry allegations,simply does not fit this profile.like the potato commission in newark gardens,the tpga neither negotiates with poultry processors nor perform s any act which involve s the sale or transfer of title in poultry from grower to shipper to retailer to consumer.id.at.nothing in terry complaint suggests that the tpga is primarily engaged in one or more of the afpa designated activities,marketing,bargaining,shipping or processing its members agricultural products.c.jamestown farmers union federated coop.transp.ass n,aff cir i f the cooperative is predominantly engaged in one or more of the activities specified in the ama,such association does not lose its fundamental character as a cooperative by engaging in other activities incidental to the primary statutory activity.rather,it is an organization principally involved with educating growers about their rights and assisting growers in the enforcement of those rights by reporting processors violations to federal authorities.the fact that the tpga educational and policing activities may have the incidental benefit of increasing the growers bargaining power,as terry posits,does not bring it within the afpa definition of association of producers,because,as newark gardens demonstrates,such an association must itself bargain or market on behalf of its members.
terry has failed to allege that tyson unlawful actions stem from his involvement with an association of producers.consequently,his complaint is deficient,in that it does not contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all material elements to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.tam travel,at citation omitted.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of his afpa claim pursuant to rule b.leonhardt western sugar,cir,abrogated on other grounds by exxon mobil allapattah,the prohibition on the making of false reports under e of the afpa appl ies only to false reports about associations of producers or handlers which are intended to influence or that have the effect of influencing a producer decision to join an association.because plaintiffs complaint made no allegation concerning membership in such an association,we affirm the district court dismissal of p
