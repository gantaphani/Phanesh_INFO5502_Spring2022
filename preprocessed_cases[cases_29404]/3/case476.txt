this is an appeal from judgment entered after the trial court sustained a demurrer,without leave to amend,to appellants complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief brought against respondent calf ranchers.appellants assert causes of action for violation of penal code section in confining animals without an adequate exercise area,and for commission of unfair business practices under business and professions code section et causing the consumer appellants loss of money or property.we find the trial court did not err there is no private cause of action pursuant to penal code section under the present circumstances,and none of the appellants have shown an ability to allege any facts of economic injury.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
appellant animal legal defense fund is a nonprofit corporation established to protect the lives and interests of animals through the legal system,as described in the complaint.appellants kristin burford and kristina filipovich are california residents and consumers of retail dairy products.because the issues concerning the corporate and individual appellants require separate discussions,and for convenience and clarity,we will refer to the corporate appellant as aldf and the individuals as the consumers.
defendants and respondents victor mendes and debbie mendes respondents are engaged in business in tulare county as mendes calf ranch respondents are in the business of raising calves placed with them by dairies.after about six months,the calves are returned to their owners the complaint alleges respondents have approximately calves at any one time.
the factual core of the complaint is an allegation that calves are confined to isolation crates for up days at a time.each crate is barely bigger than the calf and is not large enough to permit the calf to turn around or lie in a natural position for periods of rest.only the bottoms of the crates are regularly washed,and fecal matter and other materials are washed from the top and sides of the crates only upon a change of occupant.
the first cause of action,asserted by aldf only,alleges that respondents confinement of calves constitutes a violation of penal code section.that section,as relevant here,provides that it is a misdemeanor to confine an animal without an adequate exercise area.as to this cause of action,the complaint seeks a declaration that respondents actions violate penal code section and an injunction prohibiting respondents from continuing to violate that section.
the second cause of action,asserted by the consumers only,alleges respondents have violated the unfair business practices law,business and professions code section et.this violation is alleged to arise because the consumers reasonably presumed that dairy products they purchased were being produced in accordance with california law and that the individual dairies providing the milk were treating their calves in accordance with california law.therefore,the consumers have suffered harm and lost money as a result of purchasing dairy products that were unlawfully,unfairly and illegally produced.the complaint further alleges that as a direct and proximate result of respondents wrongful conduct,the consumers have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial pecuniary losses and irreparable injury.the second cause of action seeks the same declaratory and injunctive relief sought in the first cause of action 
respondents demurred to the complaint on the basis that it failed to state a cause of action.after a hearing on the demurrer,the court adopted its tentative ruling as its final ruling and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.judgment was entered accordingly.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
aldf cause of action 
there are at least three different ways alleged violations of criminal law can result in civil actions.first,and perhaps most commonly,violation of a criminal statute can be used to establish a breach of the standard of care or other element of an ordinary tort cause of action.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.second,and pertinent to aldf argument on appeal,a criminal statute can expressly or impliedly give rise to a private right of action for its violation.ibid.third,under some circumstances,a governmental or agency can sue to enjoin further breaches of the statute on a public nuisance or related theory.see people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d.
aldf contends penal code section impliedly establishes a private right of action in entities with a longstanding commitment to carrying out the laws protecting animals and a history of direct work in the area of animal cruelty law enforcement and protection.alongside prosecutors,groups like aldf are the natural torchbearers for society and the animals in ensuring the protections under california laws,and aldf and its members are significantly injured when those laws are violated.aldf notes,as part of its discussion in support of this claim,that more than thirty statutes in the california penal code are designed to grant protections to animals in this state from abuses and maltreatment,all designed with the intent to benefit both animals and groups like aldf who take on the task of shielding them from harm.
the issue in a case such as this is primarily one of legislative intent.if the legislature intended a private right of action,that usually ends the inquiry.if the legislature intended there be no private right of action,that usually ends the inquiry.if we determine the legislature expressed no intent on the matter either way,directly or impliedly,there is no private right of action fireman fund ins.companies cal d,with the possible exception that compelling reasons of public policy might require judicial recognition of such a right.see id.at,see also katzberg regents of university of california cal th,d,considerations for judicial recognition of private right of action for constitutional violations.
in the present case,we conclude the legislature intended there not be a private right of action to enforce penal code section in light of the overall statutory scheme effectively deputizing humane societies to aid local authorities in the enforcement of anticruelty laws,we think it clear that the legislature did not intend to create a private right of action in other private entities,no matter how the goals of such entities.see arriaga loma linda university th,d.
since,california has authorized the formation of corporations for the prevention of cruelty to animals.see former,repealed by stats,ch,see also stats,ch,enacting.such a corporation hereafter corporations may prefer a complaint against any person,before any court or magistrate having jurisdiction,for the violation of any law relating to or affecting animals,and may aid in the prosecution of any such offender before such court or magistrate.
presumably because the law confers powers on these corporations,the articles of incorporation of such corporations filed with the secretary of state shall be endorsed by the department of justice or by a judge of the superior court of the county in which the principal office of the corporation is located,as evidence of necessity.if the department of justice fails to act on an application for endorsement within days,or refuses such endorsement,the organizers of the corporation may apply to a superior court judge,who shall act on the application after giving due consideration to the necessity of such corporation and assuring himself that the incorporators are acting in good faith.
only corporations may apply for appointment of humane officers,whose duty shall be the enforcement of the laws for the prevention of cruelty to animals,subd.a a i.humane officers are required to have initial qualifications and subsequent periodic training.id.at subd.i.powers to enforce anticruelty laws are conferred on humane officers by statute.see id.at subds.i a c,i a c see also,seizure of certain animals by humane officers.
not only do the corporations code and the penal code provide for extensive regulation and empowerment of corporations and humane officers,the penal code expressly provides a reme
