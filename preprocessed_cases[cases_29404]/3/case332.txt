discussion 
application of the agricultural exemption 
summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards applied by the district court.byers city of albuquerque,cir.in addition,exemptions under the flsa are to be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.arnold ben kanowsky,d see also sanders elephant butte irrigation,cir.thus whiting farms bears the burden of showing its processing activities fit plainly and unmistakably within the terms and spirit of the agricultural exemption.
the fair labor standards act and the agricultural exemption 
the fair labor standards act establishes various labor requirements,such as a minimum wage and overtime pay,for employees in those workweeks when they are engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such commerce.one of the act requirements is the payment to employees of one and times the regular rate for hours worked in excess of forty in a single workweek.a see also id.a making it unlawful for any person to violate the provisions of.employers must satisfy the act requirements unless the act provides an applicable exemption.one such exemption exists for any employee employed in agriculture.id.b.agriculture is defined at f emphasis added 
agriculture includes farming in all its branches and among other things includes the cultivation and tillage of the soil,dairying,the production,cultivation,growing,and harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities,the raising of livestock,bees,animals,or poultry,and any practices including any forestry or lumbering operations performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations,including preparation for market,delivery to storage or to market or to carriers for transportation to market.
this definition of agriculture contains two distinct branches,and includes farming in both a primary and a secondary sense.bayside,nlrb,d see farmers reservoir irrigation mccomb.nlrb karl farm dairy,cir.the first contains the primary meaning of agriculture,which includes farming in all its branches and includes the raising of poultry.f.the definition also includes a second,broader meaning of agriculture.this secondary meaning includes other practices that do not themselves fit within the primary meaning of agriculture,but that are nevertheless performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations.id.the agricultural exemption was meant to apply broadly and to embrace the whole field of agriculture,but it was meant to apply only to agriculture thus the critical issue is what is and what is not included within that term.maneja waialua agric.
application of exemption to whiting farms 
rodriguez and gomez do not dispute that the handling of live chickens on whiting farms constitutes agricultural work under the primary definition of agriculture.aplt.br.at.by definition,the statute includes the raising of poultry,f,which includes the breeding,hatching,propagating,feeding,and general care of poultry.b see also holly farms nlrb,d primary farming includes the raising of poultry.rodriguez and gomez argue,however,that the processing of hackle following slaughter is not included under the definition of agriculture,and thus the agricultural exemption is inapplicable.it is true s laughtering,which is the antithesis of raising,is not included in the primary definition of agriculture.b.slaughtering nevertheless will constitute agriculture if it comes within the secondary meaning of the term agriculture.id.thus whiting farms argues the skinning and trimming of chickens on its farm fits within the secondary definition of agriculture.
to constitute secondary farming,the practice must be performed by a farmer or on a farm,and the practice must be incident to or
