the question is whether the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra and its implementing regulations preempt state damage claims for crop,damage to peanut plants.ordinarily in federal preemption cases,we are asked to decide the scope of preemption,whether congressionally expressed or implied.but in this case,it is not the breadth of preemption,but rather the breadth of the congressionally created exception to express preemption that determines the outcome.
as we explain,congress has dictated that state actions regarding product labeling are preempted to the extent that the content of the product label is regulated.but congress has permitted its regulatory body,the environmental protection agency,to choose not to regulate product labeling with respect to how well a product works,that is,the product efficacy.central to this case,the epa has also chosen to define product efficacy to include target area phytotoxicity,that is,the effect of a particular product or combination of products on the crops that are deliberately sprayed.simply put,the epa does not regulate herbicide labels regarding how well a product works,and this includes if the product actually injures the crops it was intended to assist.because of the epa choice not to regulate,and therefore because there are no labeling or packaging requirements regarding crop damage imposed under fifra,we conclude that state claims about target area crop damage are not preempted.thus,the geyes claims are not preempted.
terry geye and his son brandon are peanut farmers.the summary judgment evidence shows that in they treated part of their peanut crop with a mixture of the herbicides pursuit and prowl,both of which american cyanamid manufactures.in selecting the combination,the geyes claim they relied on various labels and advertisements that specifically stated that pursuit could be tank mixed with prowl.the advertisements also stated that pursuit was a sound choice for crop safety and that it does not cause injury to peanut plants.but the geyes allege that applying the mix to their fields actually injured their peanut plants.the geyes assert that the mix stunted root growth and inhibited foliage development which resulted in a per acre reduction in crop yield.
the geyes sued american cyanamid.they alleged breach of express and implied warranties,strict liability,and violation of the texas deceptive trade practices act.american cyanamid filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that fifra preempted the claims.the trial court agreed and dismissed the claims.the court of appeals reversed,holding that fifra did not preempt the geyes claim we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,the laws of the united states are the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.a state law is preempted and without effect if it conflicts with federal law.congressional intent determines whether a federal statute preempts state law preemption may be determined by the express provisions provided by congress it may also be implied if the statute scope indicates that congress intended federal law to occupy the field,or when state law actually conflicts with federal law finally,preemption based on an actual conflict may still exist even if the claim is not expressly preempted under the relevant statute 
this is an express preemption case.fifra contains an express preemption clause that provides that a state shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under fifra.preemption of state law claims under this provision is linked to the labeling and packaging requirements imposed by fifra.under this act,congress has given the epa the role of evaluating and determining the content of pesticide labels 
the administrator is authorized to prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of this act.such regulations shall take into account the difference in concept and usage between various classes of pesticides,including public health pesticides,and differences in environmental risk and the appropriate data for evaluating such risk between agricultural,nonagricultural,and public health pesticides 
consequently,the epa regulations define the domain expressly.because the epa labeling requirements determine what state actions are preempted,we can not know whether the geyes claim is preempted until we determine what the epa requires for product labels concerning crop safety.
fifra is a comprehensive federal statute regulating pesticide use,sales,and labeling,and granting enforcement authority to the epa the act provides a detailed scheme for regulating the content and format for labeling herbicides.under fifra,all herbicides sold in the united states must be registered with the epa each manufacturer must submit to the epa a statement that includes a complete copy of the labeling of the pesticide,a statement of all claims to be made for it,and any directions for its use.each manufacturer must also submit the complete formula of the pesticide and a full description of the tests made and the results thereof upon which the claims are based.after evaluating this information,the epa then registers a product that perform s its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
but despite fifra comprehensive nature,congress authorized the epa in to choose not to require the submission of data relating to the efficacy of products efficacy refers to how well a product works or,as defined by the epa,to the product ability to control the specific target pest or produce the specified plant or animal response when the product is applied in accordance with the label directions,precautions,and limitations of use.congress said in considering an application for the registration of a pesticide,the epa administrator may waive data requirements pertaining to efficacy,in which event the administrator may register the pesticide without determining that the pesticide composition is such as to warrant proposed claims of efficacy.the epa,acting under this authorization,has chosen not to collect efficacy data for any products except in a specific set of circumstances that are not relevant here essential to this case,the epa has also chosen to include target area phytotoxicity within the concept of efficacy,and therefore the epa has chosen not to collect data concerning target area phytotoxicity.
target area refers to the area intentionally treated with a pesticide when label use directions are followed,the peanut field.the epa further defines target area plants as all plants located within the target area,and includes both desirable and undesirable species,the peanuts and the weeds.target area phytotoxicity then describes the toxic effect to both desirable and undesirable plants within the target area.the geyes peanuts are desirable plants that are target area plants and are within the target area.
the fact that the epa has chosen not to collect data concerning target area phytotoxicity is found principally in two places.first,the data table found in identifies the data that manufacturers must submit regarding plant protection.the table limits the submission of target area phytotoxicity to special review circumstances under and in certain public health situations.american cyanamid does not assert that either of these reviews occurred in this case.
second,the epa has authored a set of pesticide assessment guidelines that contain the standards for conducting acceptable tests,guidance on evaluation and reporting of data,definition of terms,further guidance on when data are required,and examples of acceptable protocols.specifically,pesticide assessment guidelines,subdivision j hazard evaluation nontarget plants provides 
d target area phytotoxicity testing waiver of requirements.
the administrator has determined that efficacy test data include target area phytotoxicity testing data,and that data submittal for such testing may be waived,by his authority under fifra c c for most kinds of pesticide products such
