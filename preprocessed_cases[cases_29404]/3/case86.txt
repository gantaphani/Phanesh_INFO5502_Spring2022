pelts skins farms alligators in louisiana.william dwight landreneau is secretary of the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries dwf,the agency responsible for overseeing conservation of alligators louisiana requires alligator hunters and farmers to pay various fees,and dwf uses a portion of those fees to support generic marketing of alligator products.pelts skins alleges that this practice constitutes a compelled subsidy for private speech that violates the first amendment.the district court agreed with pelts skins and permanently enjoined use of the fees to support generic marketing of alligator products.
we conclude that pelts skins lacks standing to challenge the use of certain fees.with regard to the fees pelts skins does have standing to challenge,we agree with the district court that the use of those fees for generic marketing violates the first amendment.we therefore affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand in part.
the american alligator was once endangered,but louisiana law now allows the hunting and farming of alligators for their meat and skins.dwf regulates the hunting,farming,processing,and shipment of alligators and alligator parts.see.ann.b west supp.dwf does not regulate the prices or marketing of alligators,but it does administer two funds,the proceeds of which support generic marketing of alligator products the louisiana fur and alligator public education and marketing fund the marketing fund and the louisiana alligator resource fund the resource fund.the generic marketing supported by these two funds is the focus of this case 
the marketing fund derives its revenues from license fees,the fees associated with the hunting licenses that fur trappers and alligator hunters must carry.see id.a,d.twenty dollars of every license fee are earmarked for the marketing fund id.the louisiana legislature created the marketing fund to market alligator and fur products,to educate the public about the harvesting of those products,and to recommend strategies to the fur and alligator industry.id.b.
the resource fund derives its revenues from a variety of fees imposed on alligator hunters,farmers,and processors.id.the most notable of these fees is the tag fee,a charge for the tag that must be attached to every harvested alligator skin.id.c the legislature created the resource fund to help defray the cost of alligator programs administered by dwf.id.a.the resource fund supports research and,when surplus funds are available,helps to fund law enforcement and marketing programs.id.b.
dwf monitors both funds,and the secretary must approve all expenditures for generic marketing,but another entity,the louisiana fur and alligator advisory council the council,is directly responsible for the content of the generic marketing and must review and approve all expenditures from the funds.id.c,d.the council comprises the secretary or his designate,who serves ex officio,and eleven appointed members.id.c.the speaker of the house and the president of the senate each appoint one member.id.the secretary appoints nine members,and those nine members must represent a of trappers,alligator hunters,coastal landowners,and alligator farmers.id.two of those nine members must represent a private organization,the louisiana alligator farmers and ranchers association.id.the secretary may appoint the remaining seven members based on nominations from the louisiana trappers and alligator hunters association.id.
pelts skins,as louisiana and the world largest alligator farming operation,pays fees that account for roughly of the revenues received by dwf.pelts skins does not object to the collection of these revenues but does object to the expenditure of these funds on generic marketing.according to pelts skins,its business depends on convincing consumers that it produces a unique product that is superior in quality to other alligator products.generic alligator marketing undercuts this message because generic marketing does not differentiate between particular types,qualities,or brands of alligator products,but rather promotes the notion that alligator products in general are desirable,reliably available,and lawfully produced pelts skins also hints broadly that the council generic marketing campaign,which consists mainly of sending representatives to fashion shows and setting up educational displays,is a boondoggle.however,pelts skins is quick to clarify that its objection to generic marketing stems from the message of that marketing,not its efficacy.
based on its objection to the generic marketing content,pelts skins sought to enjoin dwf from expending revenues from the marketing fund and the resource fund for generic alligator marketing.according to pelts skins,louisiana violated the first amendment by imposing mandatory fees on pelts skins,then using those fees to subsidize a message with which pelts skins disagrees.in response,the secretary argued that the tax injunction act of barred federal jurisdiction that the generic marketing at issue was government speech not subject to first amendment scrutiny and that,in the alternative,the generic marketing was merely ancillary to a broader cooperative regime and therefore consistent with the first amendment.
the parties agreed to submit the case on the record without live testimony.the district court determined that the tax injunction act did not bar federal jurisdiction that the generic marketing was not government speech and that the use of mandatory fees to fund generic marketing was not ancillary to a broader cooperative regime.pelts skins,jenkins,d.the court permanently enjoined the secretary from approving,authorizing or expending any revenue from the louisiana fur and alligator public education and marketing fund or from the louisiana alligator resource fund for the purpose of generic alligator marketing.id.at.the secretary appealed 
we first address the secretary contention that pelts skins lacks standing to challenge expenditures from the marketing fund.the secretary failed to raise this argument in the district court,but a party may raise standing at any time,even on appeal.johnson city of dallas,cir.
the first requirement of standing is that a party must demonstrate an injury in fact.see mcconnell fec,d.pelts skins alleges that it has been injured in fact because it must pay fees that directly support a message with which it disagrees.the secretary claims that pelts skins has failed to prove this injury with regard to the marketing fund.the secretary concedes that pelts skins has paid the tag fees that support the resource fund,and the record amply supports that concession however,according to the secretary,pelts skins has not shown that it has ever paid the license fees that support the marketing fund.
we agree with the secretary that pelts skins failed to prove that louisiana use of the marketing fund has caused an injury in fact.because this case proceeded to final judgment the factual allegations supporting standing if controverted must be supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.walker city of mesquite,cir see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d.pelts skins must support each element of standing just as it would support any other matter on which it bears the burden of proof.lewis casey,d.
pelts skins has not carried this burden.nowhere does the record indicate that pelts skins ever held a hunting license or paid any fee that supports the marketing fund.instead,pelts skins relies on assertions in pleadings.had the district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss,these allegations would be sufficient however,once a case passes this preliminary stage,a plaintiff must set forth evidence of an injury in fact.see lujan,at.walker,at the record contains no such evidence.
pelts skins also relies on the district court finding that plaintiff farming operation is conditioned upon payment of mandatory fees license fees and tag fees to the dwf.d at.we review for clear error the findings underlying a district court determination of standing.rivera,cir pederson.state,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous if a review of the evidence leaves us with a firm conviction that the district court has made a mistake.dickerson ex rel.dickerson united states,cir.the absence of any evidence supporting the district court finding firmly convinces us that,based on the record as it stands,the district court has made a mistake.walker dep t of hous.urban,cir given the parties failure to contest and to address standing in the district court,the district court finding is unsurprising nevertheless,that finding is clearly erroneous on this record.
on this record,therefore,pelts skins lacks standing to challenge expenditures from the marketing fund.a district court may only remedy the injury in fact the plaintiff has established.lewis,at.we therefore vacate the portion of the injunction concerning the marketing fund.
when jurisdiction is not clear from the record but could exist,we may remand to the district court so that the parties may supplement the record.molett penrod drilling,cir.remand is especially appropriate when,as in this case,jurisdiction may hinge on a simple factual matter that was left untested because the parties did not dispute standing in the district court.after further review,the district court may determine that pelts skins has paid the license fee.we therefore remand this case in part.on remand,the district court should ascertain whether pelts skins has standing to challenge the marketing fund and modify the injunction accordingly.
although pelts skins lacks standing to challenge use of the marketing fund,it has standing to challenge use of the resource fund.we therefore consider whether the use of the resource fund to promote generic alligator marketing violates the first amendment.we review the district court resolution of this constitutional question de novo.baby dolls topless saloons,city of dallas,cir.
we first consider whether the generic alligator marketing is government speech or private speech.the government speech doctrine holds that when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its own,it is entitled to say what it wishes.rosenberger rector visitors of of,d.the secretary argues that generic alligator marketing is immune from first amendment review because the state of louisiana is speaking 
we disagree.not all speech is government speech.the government speech doctrine does not apply if a program is designed to facilitate private speech,not to promote a governmental message.velazquez,at.in this case,three method by which dwf funds generic marketing,the composition and operation of the fur and alligator advisory council,and an application of the policies underlying the government speech us that the generic marketing at issue is not government speech,but government facilitation of the private speech of fur and alligator harvesters 
first,the method by which dwf funds generic alligator marketing suggests that generic alligator advertising is the message of fur and alligator harvesters,not louisiana as a whole.government speech is typically funded from a government general revenues,not assessments levied on a particular group.see keller,at.pork,at frame,at.the portions of the resource fund administered by the council do not come from general state revenues rather,they come from fees levied on only one group harvesters of furs and alligators.the resource fund remains in an account segregated from the state general revenues.ann.c west supp.moreover,the expenditures recommended,reviewed,and approved by the council primarily concern precisely those persons who must contribute to the resource fund.this close nexus between the individuals who pay for the speech and the content of the speech suggests that louisiana is facilitating a private message,not expressing its own.see frame,at.
second,an organization that represents private interests,the council,is primarily responsible for the generic marketing campaign.cochran,michigan pork,and frame all dealt with generic marketing programs run by councils.in each of these cases,the federal agriculture secretary appointed the members of the council based on nominations from industry representatives.because these councils were composed of industry representatives,the courts determined that those councils,though appointed by the government,represented private interests.see cochran,at michigan pork,at frame,at.
likewise,although the council is a government creation,the composition of the council demonstrates that it represents primarily private interests the secretary or his designate serves on the council ex officio,and he and other government officials appoint all the remaining members of the council,but the secretary does not enjoy plenary discretion to appoint any person to the council.ann.c west supp.rather,he must appoint a carefully calibrated cross section of trappers,alligator hunters,coastal landowners,and alligator farmers.id.two members of the council must represent a private organization,the louisiana farmers and ranchers association.id.the secretary may choose all nine of the council members he appoints based on nominations from private organizations,and the record suggests that the secretary does so.because representatives of private alligator harvesters compose the heavy majority of the council,it naturally reflects private rather than governmental interests 
furthermore,although the secretary portrays alligator marketing as a program,the council,not dwf,primarily controls how the resource fund is used michigan pork,at.dwf can not spend money from the resource fund without the council approval.ann.d west supp.moreover,the record suggests that dwf approval of contracts recommended by the council is largely perfunctory.united foods,at.suggesting in dictum that evidence of pro forma oversight implies that generic marketing is not government speech.our review of the record reveals no evidence that dwf crafts or edits the content of any of the generic marketing at issue rather,this task falls to private contractors hired by the council to market alligator products.thus,the council,not dwf,is primarily responsible for generic alligator marketing.
third,the policies underlying the government speech doctrine do not support the application of that doctrine to this case.one rationale for the government speech doctrine is that,without the doctrine,every citizen would have a right to insist that no one paid by public funds express a view with which he disagreed and the process of government as we know it would be radically transformed.keller,at.this case,however,does not raise the specter of paralysis.as our discussion of standing demonstrates,only members of the narrow group compelled to contribute funds to subsidize directly a private message have standing to challenge the expression at issue.
a second rationale for the government speech doctrine is that w hen the government speaks,for instance to promote its own policies or to advance a particular idea,it is,in the end,accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy.velazquez,at.quoting southworth,at.in contrast,the government can easily avoid accountability when it imposes costs on a single,narrow group to facilitate a specialized message,especially if only a small minority of that group objects to the message expressed.
we are not dealing with a program funded from general revenues by broadly applicable taxes.nor are we dealing with a governmental message crafted,controlled,and expressed by an agency designed to represent state government.rather,in this case we confront a program in which the government uses its authority to exact fees from private individuals,then facilitates the use of those fees to express a message designed to benefit private commercial interests.this sort of program is not government speech.
because we have determined that use of the resource fund for generic marketing represents a compelled subsidy for private speech,we must decide whether that compulsion is nonetheless permissible.the supreme court has twice addressed compelled subsidies for generic marketing.in glickman wileman elliott,d,the court upheld compelled subsidies for generic fruit marketing.in united states united foods,d,the court struck down compelled subsidies for generic mushroom marketing.we must mediate between these two contrasting precedents,or,in the words of the district court,determine whether louisiana alligator producers are more like mushroom producers than like peach producers.pelts skins,d at.
in glickman,the court evaluated a new regulatory scheme that required producers of peaches,plums,and nectarines to participate in c ollective,rather than competitive,marketing.at.this collective marketing scheme displaced competition by imposing uniform prices,dictating the quality and quantity of the fruits marketed,determining the grade and size of the fruits sold,providing for the orderly disposition of surplus,authorizing joint research and development projects,requiring standardized packaging,and even exempting affected producers from antitrust laws.id.as part of this displacement of competition,the government required producers to pay for generic marketing of the fruit.id.a group of growers alleged that the assessments violated the first amendment.the court upheld the assessments only after stress ing the importance of the statutory context.id.at.because the growers were part of a broader collective enterprise in which their freedom to act independently was already constrained by the regulatory scheme,the court characterized the assessments for generic marketing as a species of economic regulation that should enjoy the same strong presumption of validity that we accord to other policy judgments made by congress.id.at.
later,in united foods,mushroom handlers refused to pay mandatory assessments to fund generic mushroom marketing.at.the court struck down the assessments as violations of the handlers first amendment right not to subsidize speech with which they disagreed.id.at.unlike the program in glickman,the court reasoned,the mushroom program was not ancillary to a more comprehensive program restricting marketing autonomy.id.at.rather,the generic mushroom advertising,far from being ancillary,was the principal object of the regulatory scheme.id.at.the court summarized its compelled subsidy cases and enunciated a guiding principle when the government binds individuals into a collective association,the government can also require that those persons subsidize speech germane to the purpose underlying the association.united foods,at.see also keller,at.integrated bar abood detroit bd.of,d closed union shop.because the mushroom program did not require association except to support generic marketing,the program violated the first amendment.united foods,at.
we agree with the district court that louisiana generic alligator marketing program more closely resembles the mushroom program at issue in united foods than the fruit program at issue in glickman.the glickman rule permitting compelled subsidies applies when individuals have been bound together in a collective.united foods,at.accord cochran,at delano farms cal.table grape comm n,cir striking down compelled subsidies for generic grape marketing.without an underlying collectivized association,a state can not justify a compelled subsidy.see united foods,at.louisiana alligator producers are not part of a collective association akin to glickman marketing cooperative.none of the laws governing alligator production imposes collective rather than competitive marketing as the scheme in glickman did.cochran,at.rather,as the secretary admits,the state of louisiana does not regulate prices in the alligator market,and alligator harvesters are free to negotiate prices and to market products as they wish 
the secretary emphasizes louisiana extensive regulation of alligator harvesting and argues that generic alligator marketing,like generic peach marketing,is permissible because it is ancillary to louisiana alligator regulations regulations alone do not create compelled association.see cochran,at delano farms,at.in glickman,the fruit producers were subject to a specific type of regulation a scheme that displaced individual marketing efforts and thus necessitated collective generic marketing.see at.likewise,in keller and abood,the state required that individuals join a collective interest group to be effective,that interest group had to speak on behalf of its members on certain issues.see keller,at.abood,at.a number of interdependent state,federal,and international laws impose requirements on alligator harvesters,but these laws do not require collective association,and it is only the overriding associational purpose which allows compelled subsidy for speech in the first place.united foods,at.emphasis added 
we recognize that,unlike the assessments at issue in united foods,cochran,and delano farms,a majority of the assessments fund programs other than generic marketing.see united foods,at.cochran,at delano farms,at.in each of the past several years,the council has spent approximately of the resource fund on generic marketing and the remainder on research and law enforcement.this distinction in the percentage of fees that go to generic marketing does not support applying glickman to this case.the key element of highly collectivized marketing still absent.the common thread uniting abood,keller,glickman,and united foods is that compelled subsidization of speech is permissible when individuals have been bound into a collective association.united foods,at.the fees imposed here,though used for more than generic marketing,represent a collective association only in the loosest sense of that term 
in sum,louisiana alligator regulations are more analogous to the mushroom marketing program in united foods than to the fruit marketing collective in glickman.the use of mandatory fees for generic marketing is not ancillary to a collective association.louisiana use of the resource fund to support generic marketing therefore violates the first amendment 
as the record stands,pelts skins has not proven that it has standing to challenge use of the marketing fund.therefore,we vacate the portion of the injunction barring louisiana from using the marketing fund to support generic alligator marketing and remand so that the district court may determine whether pelts skins has standing and modify the injunction accordingly.
with regard to the remaining challenge,we conclude that louisiana use of the resource fund to support generic marketing violates the first amendment.we therefore affirm the district court judgment granting a permanent injunction against use of the resource fund for generic alligator marketing.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded in part.
landreneau replaced james jenkins as secretary after the district court ruled.to avoid confusion,we refer to landreneau as the secretary.
this type of subsidies for generic produced many familiar campaigns,including got milk pork the other white meat the incredible,edible egg ah the power of cheese and the touch the feel of cotton the fabric of our lives.see cochran veneman,cir.pork producers ass veneman,cir,petition for cert.filed sub.nom.veneman campaign for family farms.
the state treasurer may apply collected fees to the marketing fund and the resource fund only after she ensures that state revenues can cover due and payable state debts.ann.d,c west supp.the record does not indicate that the treasurer has ever applied fees to state debts.
section c a allows dwf to charge up to four dollars per tag,and during some years,pelts skins paid four dollars per tag.but starting in september,dwf temporarily suspended the collection of two dollars of the regular fee.admin.code tit,a a xi.
pelts skins objection to the message embodied in generic marketing may seem minor,but the supreme court has explained that the perceived importance of a plaintiff objection is immaterial.see united states united foods,d first amendment values are at serious risk if the government can compel a particular citizen,or a discrete group of citizens,to pay special subsidies for speech on the side that it favors and there is no apparent principle which distinguishes out of hand minor debates about whether a branded mushroom is better than just any mushroom.
the secretary has appealed neither the district court findings of fact nor its ultimate holding with regard to the tax injunction
