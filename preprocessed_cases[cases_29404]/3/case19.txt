background 
plaintiffs filed suit against dom and gargiulo in the southern district of new york to enforce paca statutory trust provisions requiring produce buyers to hold perishable agricultural commodities,and receivables and proceeds from the sale of those commodities,in trust for the benefit of unpaid sellers until full payment has been made.c.plaintiffs sought to recover damages from both dom and gargiulo for the principal amount due on unpaid invoices plus interest and attorneys fees.
platinum funding corporation platinum subsequently intervened in plaintiffs action,claiming that dom owes it over one million dollars pursuant to the factoring agreement between them.dom and gargiulo deny platinum allegations and assert that platinum owes dom for breaching the factoring agreement.in addition,defendants contend that in unidentified accounts receivable were improperly written off by platinum.the district court severed these disputed matters from plaintiffs paca claims.the disputed claims are pending.
plaintiffs motion for summary judgment was referred to chief magistrate judge peck,who recommended granting summary judgment to plaintiffs against both dom and gargiulo for the principal amount in unpaid invoices plus interest and attorneys fees.the magistrate judge concluded that as dom sole shareholder,officer and director,gargiulo should be held personally liable for dissipating the paca trust assets,exhaustion of dom assets if any,that were tied up in litigation with platinum,was not required prior to holding gargiulo personally liable,and plaintiffs were entitled to an award of attorneys fees and interest based on language contained in their invoices.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and granted summary judgment for plaintiffs.on the consent of the parties,the magistrate judge awarded plaintiffs in principal,interest and attorneys fees in an order and final judgment pursuant to.b certifying that there was no just reason for delaying entry of final judgment against defendants.

discussion 
federal jurisdiction is based on the action being brought pursuant to paca,a federal statute.see c.we have appellate jurisdiction from the final judgment entered after the.b certification.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.greenidge allstate ins,cir.summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.because the relevant facts on this appeal are undisputed,we review only the district court conclusions of law.
we recently reviewed the history of paca and its trust provisions in r best produce mktg,cir see also am.banana republic bank of,cir.congress enacted paca in to regulate the interstate sale and marketing of perishable agricultural commodities.see am.banana,at.the statute provides growers and sellers of agricultural produce with a tool enabling them to protect themselves against the abnormal risk of losses resulting from and practices by buyers or receivers of fruits and vegetables.rothman korea commercial bank of,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.under the relevant provision,perishable commodities or proceeds from the sale of those commodities are held in trust by the buyer for the benefit of the unpaid seller until full payment is made 
perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission merchant,dealer,or broker and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities shall be held by such commission merchant,dealer,or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the transaction,until full payment of the sums owing in connection with such transactions has been received by such unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents.
c.as a paca trustee,a produce buyer is charged with a duty to insure that it has sufficient assets to assure prompt payment for produce and that any beneficiary under the trust will receive full payment.rothman,at internal quotation marks omitted.paca affords produce sellers a highly unusual trust beneficiary status that permit s them,in the case of defaults,to trump the buyers other creditors,including secured ones.am.banana,at.
personal liability under paca 
an individual who is in a position to control the assets of the paca trust and fails to preserve them,may be held personally liable to the trust beneficiaries for breach of fiduciary duty.see servs.paglia,cir patterson frozen foods crown foods int l,cir fresh source produce,cir hiller cranberry prods.koplovsky,cir sunkist growers fisher,cir accord bronia,ho,morris okun,harry zimmerman.gargiulo concedes that as dom president,sole shareholder and sole director,he was in a position of control over the paca trust assets and that,as such,he can be held personally liable for any breaching of dom fiduciary duties.however,gargiulo argues that he is not personally liable at this time because he did not dissipate the paca trust assets,and plaintiffs have not exhausted dom corporate assets.we reject both arguments.
dissipation of trust assets 
paca trustees are required to maintain trust assets in a manner that such assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities.d emphasis added.paca regulations provide that a ny act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility,including dissipation of trust assets,is unlawful.id.dissipation is defined as any act or failure to act which could result in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents to recover money owed in connection with produce transactions.id.a emphasis added.thus,to determine whether a paca trustee actions or omissions constitute a breach of fiduciary duty,we examine whether the trustee in any way encumbered the funds or rendered them less freely available to paca creditors.rothman,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants contend that they did not dissipate paca trust assets because dom factoring agreement with platinum was commercially reasonable and any loss of assets was due solely to platinum breach of the agreement.we have held that a paca trustee does not commit a per se breach of fiduciary duty when trust funds are used to conduct a commercial transaction with a party.armata,korea commercial bank of,cir citation omitted.armata was a paca suit against a bank that charged fees for maintaining a checking account for the paca trustee produce buyer.id.at.the paca trustee was not a defendant in that suit.id.at.the armata court was only concerned with the liability of the bank.id.we determined that,in order to hold a transferee in breach of trust for receipt of paca funds there first must be a determination that the transfer
