duane huber,huber farms general partnership hfgp,and huber farms,hfi were convicted of violating various federal laws dealing with fraudulent statements to the government,tax fraud,and money laundering.the district court sentenced huber to imprisonment,and it sentenced hfgp and hfi to terms of probation.the court also ordered that huber forfeit approximately million in the form of a money judgment for the charge.the court declined to impose a fine or restitution on any defendant.huber,hfgp,and hfi assign five errors to the district court in this appeal.huber also appeals the forfeiture judgment.the government,assigning approximately eight sentencing errors.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for resentencing.
background 
duane huber,doing business as hfgp and hfi,operated a large farming operation in north dakota.steven huber,jeff greff,douglas bergan,and chad bickett were involved with huber in what huber claimed was a coordinated farming operation.according to huber,he,hfgp,and hfi facilitated these individuals farming efforts by renting or land to them,providing the machinery that was used on their farms,providing the labor force that worked the land,and cosigning the individuals operating notes.like many farmers,steven huber,greff,bergan,and bickett enrolled in the federal farm program by submitting a form form to the local farm services administration fsa office,representing their eligibility to participate in the program once enrolled,these individuals could receive payments under a variety of mechanisms.the four also insured their crops against loss through federally subsidized crop insurance,again representing their eligibility to purchase such policies.during the typical year,they received income from the government through the federal farm program,from private insurers through claims on their policies,and through grain sales.this money was then paid to huber,hfgp,hfi,or third parties.huber claimed these payments were for the land,machinery,and labor he provided to them.
the government viewed these four individuals involvement with huber farming operation differently.according to the government,huber enlisted them to defraud government programs of millions of dollars in benefits in the form of payments and federally subsidized benefits.this belief rested on the notion that these individuals were not eligible to receive such benefits because they had no farms of their own.more specifically,the government believed that the group had set things up to look as though they were eligible to enroll in the federal farm.e,to look like they were actively engaged in farming.once the four had fraudulently enrolled by submitting false form,the government believed they funneled the ensuing payments along with benefits and proceeds to huber and others in the form of,labor,machinery,individuals never incurred.by structuring things this way,huber could avoid the payment limitations that applied to him under the farm program.the government also believed that the benefits the four individuals received were fraudulently obtained because none of the them had an insurable interest in the crops they,they were ineligible to purchase federally subsidized policies.finally,the government believed that huber allocated expenses and income amongst the four individuals,huber,hfgp and hfi as part of the scheme,violating various laws.
the government presented its case to a grand jury,which returned a indictment,charging huber,hfgp,and hfi with various violations of federal law.the indictment also included a forfeiture allegation.at trial,the government produced witnesses that were allegedly part of huber operation and experts on and eligibility,as well as requirements.the jury found huber,hfgp,and hfi guilty of all charges.
the jury,in a subsequent forfeiture proceeding,was also charged with determining the amount of funds involved in the conspiracy to launder money that was charged in count eighteen of the indictment.the jury concluded,by a preponderance of the evidence,that huber was accountable for.this amount reflected the value of payments,benefits,and proceeds received by greff,bergan,steven huber,and bickett from through.
the district court sentenced huber to imprisonment,declining to enhance huber sentence as requested by the government.and the district court entered a money judgment against huber for the the jury found should be forfeited.
huber,hfgp,and hfi appeal their convictions.huber also assigns error with regard to the forfeiture phase of the proceeding.the government with regard to sentencing.
ii.discussion 
huber appeal 
huber brief raises approximately six assignments of error the district court erred in concluding that dawn rose involvement in the investigation did not render her testimony or the evidence she helped procure inadmissible,rose testimony about what bergan told her was admissible,huber had not been selectively prosecuted,sufficient evidence supported the jury verdict,the amount of the forfeiture judgment was proper,and huber due process rights had not been violated by a late disclosure of incriminating evidence.huber raised the first two purported errors below in an appropriate motion to suppress.the remaining claims were raised in a rule motion for a judgment of acquittal,but the only proper basis for such a motion is insufficient evidence of guilt.the district court construed huber motion as one under rule new trial to the extent such a motion was the proper method of asserting his claim and it addressed his claim even though it was raised for the first time in the rule motion.
rose involvement 
dawn rose kept huber books in conjunction with the farming operation.special agent ward,the government main investigating officer in huber case,approached her on august,and asked her some questions about huber operation.on that day,she offered to turn over the financial data she had in her possession.agent ward declined the offer,advising her to wait until he could present her with a subpoena.he returned with that subpoena on august,along with an offer of immunity for her cooperation.rose then gave him the information.
at trial the government offered evidence gleaned from this allocation of expenses and income with regard to huber and each of the individuals allegedly involved in the conspiracy.huber moved to suppress the evidence and the court held a hearing out of the jury presence.at that hearing,the district court questioned rose extensively about her motivation to assist the government.she testified that she turned over the information voluntarily and that she collected no information at the government behest.even though she continued to enter data into the bookkeeping software from august until august,she said she did this at huber direction.
the district court denied huber motion to suppress,citing a lower expectation of privacy in business records,the subpoena,and inevitable discovery.the court concluded that rose was not an agent of the government and she was trying to protect herself.huber renewed his challenge to the evidence in his rule motion.the district court again addressed the issue,restating its conclusion that rose was not an agent of the government and,thus,the information she gave to the government was not obtained improperly under the fourth amendment.
huber challenges the district court ruling on his motion to suppress,claiming rose was a government agent for purposes of the fourth amendment after she spoke with agent ward on august.we review the denial of a motion to suppress for clear error when the appellant challenges the district court factfinding,and de novo with regard to its interpretation of the protections afforded by the fourth amendment.united states smith,cir.a private citizen conduct can nonetheless implicate the fourth amendment if the private citizen is acting as a government agent.the fourth amendment analysis with regard to whether a private citizen acted as a government agent includes several factors whether the government had knowledge of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct whether the citizen intended to assist law enforcement agents or instead acted to further his own purposes and whether the citizen acted at the government request.id.at.
agent ward did ask rose to turn over the data in her possession on august.however,the subpoena,the validity of which huber does not challenge,required her to produce it.and while agent ward knew as of august that rose had information that could be helpful to his investigation,there is no evidence in the record from which the district court could conclude that agent ward acquiesced in,knew about,or asked rose to engage in any of the other actions she took.rose may have been motivated,to some extent,by an urge to help the government,either as a means of protecting herself through the prospect of immunity or by the simple but often powerful convention of openness and honesty.coolidge new hampshire,d.but this is not enough to make her a government agent.see united states malbrough,cir.we find no error in the district court denial of the motion to suppress.
hearsay evidence 
next,huber assigns error to the district court admission of evidence in the guilt phase of the proceeding under federal rule of evidence d e coconspirator statement.huber claims the district court allowed rose to testify to what bergan said about the farming relationship bergan had with huber.huber,however,cites us to no place in the record where rose testified to,or based her testimony upon,what bergan told her.nor does he note the location,if any,of his objection to this testimony.rose testimony spans pages of transcript,and our review of the record has not disclosed the basis for the error huber asserts.thus,we affirm the district court admission of rose testimony.
huber also assigns error to the district court failure to make an explicit finding of admissibility on the record.see united states bell,cir.however,huber did not request such a ruling,the district court heard and ruled on huber motion for acquittal,and we find no plain error in its determination.united states mccracken,cir employing standard under similar circumstances.
selective prosecution 
huber raised a claim in his rule motion.this claim was not properly before the district court because huber raised it for the first time in a rule motion.a claim alleg es a defect in instituting the prosecution that must be raised before trial.b a.otherwise,it is waived.e united states dion,cir,reversed in part on other grounds,d.nonetheless,the district court considered the claim.under rule e,it could grant relief from the waiver for good cause.but the district court did not mention rule e.huber claims that he could not have discovered the basis for the claim until the prosecutors touted the nature of the prosecution to the press after the trial.but huber did not present that to the district court as good cause.despite this lack of clarity,we will assume that the district court properly considered this aspect of huber motion,because we affirm the district court decision on the merits of the claim.
the district court held that huber had not made out a prima facie case of selective prosecution because he had not established that he was singled out for prosecution while others similarly situated were not prosecuted for similar conduct,and the decision to prosecute him was based on an impermissible motive such as race,religion,or an attempt by the defendant to secure other constitutional rights.united states kelley,cir quotation omitted.huber argues that the prosecutors statements relating to the ingenuity of this prosecution establishes his prima facie case.we disagree.even if a prosecution is rare,that does not mean the government chose to charge the defendant because of his race,his religion,or some other attempt he made to secure his constitutional rights.and huber has made no showing that others similarly situated have been left unprosecuted.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion.id.standard of review.
evidentiary sufficiency 
in reviewing a district court denial of a motion for acquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and will reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged.united states lacey,cir.much of what huber argues with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence pertains more to the forfeiture proceeding than the guilty verdict.the arguments pertaining to forfeiture are discussed below.as to the evidentiary sufficiency of the guilty verdict,huber does not identify which counts of the indictment,let alone which elements of those counts,are lacking evidentiary support.in fact,he makes no mention of the statutory provisions at issue,leaving us to wallow in the indictment,eighteen of which name huber,and the voluminous record of the proceeding below.
count one charged huber with conspiring to make false statements to influence the actions of the department of agriculture in connection with claims for crop insurance and benefits,in violation of conspiracy,and false statements to influence the actions of various government agencies.counts two,three,and four charged huber with aiding and abetting various fraudulent acts that violated and,and a.counts six seven,eight,nine,and ten charged huber with various violations under and,and with aiding and abetting such unlawful conduct by greff,bergan,bickett,and steven huber.these charges relate to huber allocation of income and expenses amongst these four individuals.counts twelve,thirteen,fourteen,fifteen,sixteen,and seventeen charged huber with aiding and abetting various violations under a a i and b i,and.count eighteen charged huber with conspiring to commit money laundering in violation of h.counts nineteen and twenty charged huber with aiding and abetting mail fraud in violation of and wire fraud in violation of,respectively.
one discernible argument from huber brief cites the lack of evidence of a bribe that huber was alleged to have paid the coconspirators.we take this argument to attack the evidence of one of the many overt acts alleged in the indictment with regard to count one.even if there were no evidence of this overt act,huber claim would fail.the government is not bound to prove each and every overt act alleged in the indictment.united states sellers,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,aff,cir.
huber may also be making his argument with regard to the conspiracy charged in count conspiracy to launder money in violation of h.a close reading of the indictment,however,suggests that no overt act was alleged in count eighteen,and the jury instructions on this count did not include an element.section h does not require any such act be charged or proven.whitfield united states,d.so huber arguments miss the mark for another reason with regard to his section h conviction.
we have carefully examined the evidence presented to the jury,united states kenyon,cir,in light of huber other arguments pertaining to guilt.we find them to be without merit.
forfeiture 
huber argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the amounts of money included in forfeiture exhibit were involved in the conspiracy to launder money.forfeiture exhibit is a spreadsheet summarizing other evidence of payments received by the coconspirators.it depicts the amounts of money that bickett,greff,steven huber,and bergan received in their bank accounts as payments,proceeds,and benefits.the jury found that huber was accountable for all of these amounts,totaling approximately million.
the amount of forfeiture was submitted to the jury based solely on count eighteen of the indictment,and the court ordered forfeiture only with regard to that count in the form of a money judgment.see.the criminal forfeiture statute invoked in the forfeiture allegation was,which requires a court to impose forfeiture on a defendant convicted of as to any property,real or personal,involved in such offense,or any property traceable to such property.a.forfeiture under section a in a case allows the government to obtain a money judgment representing the value of all property involved in the offense,including the money or other property being laundered the corpus,and any property used to facilitate the laundering offense.united states hawkey,cir quotation omitted.
the theory of forfeiture that the government appears to present in this case is that the payments,the proceeds,and the benefits represent the corpus of the conspiracy.while that reasoning is sound with regard to most of the funds,we conclude huber argument has merit with regard to that portion of benefits that the individuals never received.
the corpus of a conspiracy is the funds that the defendant conspired to launder.thus,the corpus of a conspiracy rests on whether certain conduct involving funds constitutes money laundering.to determine that,we look to the statutory text,winnowed by the allegations of the indictment.count eighteen alleged a conspiracy to engage in money laundering under h.section h outlaws conspiracies to commit any offense defined in this section or section.the offenses charged as the objects of the conspiracy were violations of sections a and.a person violates section if he engages in a financial transaction that involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,and either engages in the transaction to promote further acts of specified unlawful activity or with knowledge of a design to conceal the nature,ownership,or control of the funds being laundered.a a i b i.for our purposes,section is different only with regard to the third element.that is,no intent to promote or knowledge of a design to conceal is required,but the transaction must consist of property with a value greater than.a.if the amounts included in the jury verdict reflect the value of property that huber and the other individuals conspired to launder in violation of these statutory provisions,then the forfeiture verdict and the ensuing judgment were proper.
a payments 
with regard to the payments,the funds were deposited in the four individuals bank accounts.the indictment characterizes the conspiracy as involving further transactions from the individuals accounts to huber or third parties that were labeled as payments for machinery,labor,and land.those payments,made by check,are qualifying transactions.c defining transaction,c defining financial transaction,f defining monetary transaction.
the payments the individuals received also qualify as proceeds of specified unlawful activity.count eighteen alleged that the payments were obtained through violations of,and.specified unlawful activity includes violations of and any act or activity constituting an offense listed in section,which includes mail fraud under and wire fraud under.c.the jury returned a guilty verdict on other counts of the indictment that charged huber with violating those provisions,and huber has not successfully challenged the propriety of those findings.thus,the jury could reasonably conclude that the qualifying transactions involved payments that were proceeds of specified unlawful activity.
finally,the jury could reasonably conclude that the transactions were undertaken either to promote the scheme or with knowledge of a design to conceal the ownership,nature,or control of the funds derived from that scheme.a a i b i.on paper,these transactions were made to appear as payments for the expenses associated with producing crops on the lands allocated to the four individuals.but the evidence at trial showed that the individuals incurred no expenses.a reasonable jury could therefore conclude that the transactions at maintain the individuals appearance of eligibility because those expenses,if legitimately incurred by them,would help establish that they were actively engaged in farming.this,in turn,promoted the carrying on of the scheme to defraud the government,which involved specified unlawful activities.a a i.the jury could also reasonably conclude that the payments were made with knowledge of a design to conceal the true ownership or control of the unlawfully obtained funds.indeed,concealing huber involvement bolstered the individuals appearance of eligibility.thus,a reasonable jury could conclude that the conspiracy involved violations of sections a a i,a b i,or both.see united states wilkinson,cir.therefore,the jury properly included the amount of payments in its forfeiture calculation under section a as part of the corpus of the section h conspiracy.
b proceeds 
huber argues that the value of the proceeds should not have been included in the forfeiture judgment.the money the four individuals received from the sale of crops is not derived from a specified unlawful activity.selling crops is not illegal,even if the seller falsifies his or insurance eligibility.thus,these monies do not immediately appear to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.the government proceeded in the indictment,in its brief,and at oral argument on a commingling theory of forfeitability with regard to these funds.
the proceeds were properly forfeited under section a.as part of the conspiracy,huber would place or direct others to place proceeds in the individuals bank accounts.illegitimate funds from the government were also placed in those accounts and commingled with the legitimate funds.as explained above,the payments from those accounts constituted money laundering because they were financial transactions made for,or with knowledge of,an unlawful purpose,and they involve d the proceeds of specified unlawful activity the payments.the presence of legitimate funds made the transactions no more lawful because the transactions still involved the illegitimate proceeds.united states habhab,cir.we can find no basis to conclude that the proceeds,although lawfully obtained,were not also laundered in violation of the statute when they were part of the transactions.as funds huber conspired to launder,they were properly included in the forfeiture judgment as part of the corpus of the conspiracy.see united states baker,cir.
huber argues that the proceeds should have been offset by the expenses that went into producing the crops that generated those funds.but he offers no authority for this proposition.huber appears to argue that he could not be forced to forfeit all of the proceeds that were funneled through the individuals accounts because the payments made to huber were for expenses he actually did incur in producing the crops on the land he allocated to those individuals.two problems exist with that argument.first,the legitimacy of those expenses was brought into question by the evidence at trial.and,second,even if the expenses were legitimately incurred by huber,they would not reduce the amount subject to forfeiture.see united states grasso,cir collecting cases and concluding that expenses should not be deducted,vacated on other grounds,d united states simmons,cir.indeed,the passing of those expenses to individuals who had not incurred them promoted the underlying fraud,which is what,inter alia,made the transactions illegal.huber argument fails.
c benefits 
much of the reasoning above holds true for the benefits the individuals received.like the payments,the benefits the individuals received were paid out of the individuals accounts by check the funds were obtained through violations of sections,and and the transactions were undertaken to promote specified unlawful activity by maintaining the appearance of eligibility with knowledge of a design to conceal huber involvement.like the proceeds,the received funds were also forfeitable because they were part of transactions that involved the proceeds of specified unlawful benefits.however,part of the value attributed to this category of funds represented monies that the individuals never received.so we must address whether that portion of these funds was involved in the conspiracy.
forfeiture exhibit was the basis for the forfeiture amount the jury found and,thus,the district court forfeiture judgment.the exhibit included a portion of insurance benefits that were never received by greff,bickett,bergan,or steven huber.to possibly oversimplify,under the federally subsidized program,once a claim is filed and approved,the insurer deducts the farmer share of the premium from the claimed amount of loss,and the insurer receives a subsidy from the government to pay the remaining portion of the policy premium.the government included in its forfeiture calculations both the amount of the premium withheld by the insurer the premium charge and the amount the government paid to the insurer the premium subsidy.huber argues that these funds were not subject to forfeiture under section a.we agree.these funds were not part of the corpus of the conspiracy,nor are they forfeitable as property that facilitated the conspiracy.
these funds were not part of the corpus of the conspiracy.to violate section,the defendant must conduct or attempt to conduct a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.a.conducts is defined as initiating,concluding,or participating in initiating,or concluding a transaction.c.transaction is defined as including a purchase,sale,loan,pledge,gift,transfer,delivery,or other disposition.id.c.and a financial transaction is defined as a transaction involving the movement of funds by wire or other means or involving one or more monetary instruments.id.c a.proceeds is not defined.
as we have explained above,the transactions at issue with regard to the money the individuals actually received are the further payments from the individuals accounts.the same sorts of transactions did not occur with the premium charges and premium subsidies because the funds never came into the individuals accounts.with regard to the premium charges,no financial transaction occurred because no funds ever moved and no monetary instruments were involved see c defining monetary instruments.we are also not inclined to infer a transaction that did not occur,as the government seems to suggests we should do.see post.for example,withholding payment on the insured account for expenses the insured owed to the insurer like a premium could be tantamount to a full payment to the insured with a return payment for a portion of the policy premium to the insurer.but,even if we were to infer such a transaction,the premiums are used to pay the claims made on the policies to insureds like the claimant.taken in this light,the transaction is much closer to that addressed in hawkey,where we held that a forfeiture amount had to be credited by the amount of misappropriated funds returned to the victim of the specified unlawful conduct.at.thus,the premium charges were not part of the corpus of the conspiracy.
the premium made by the government to the a closer question.there,funds did move,likely by wire,so a financial transaction did arguably occur.and the situation can not be characterized as a return of misappropriated funds.the question thus becomes whether the individuals conducted the transaction by participating in initiating a transaction,c,and whether that transaction involved proceeds.we do not believe the statutes cover the situation at issue here.the coconspirators simply had no control over the funds involved in the transactions that occurred between the insurer and the government.thus,the funds never became proceeds of the unlawful activity,nor did the individuals participate in initiating the transaction though actual possession may not be required,control must be shown to substantiate a charge of money laundering.see,united states prince,cir discussing issue and collecting cases united states bolden,cir.thus,the premium subsidies were not part of the corpus of the conspiracy.
but were the premium subsidies and premium charges nonetheless forfeitable under section a involved in clause through a facilitation theory facilitation of a laundering offense occurs when the property makes the prohibited conduct less difficult or more or less free from obstruction or hindrance.hawkey,at quotation omitted facilitation is not to be confused with promotion under section a a i.abstractly speaking,promotion and facilitation overlap that which promotes,facilitates,and that which facilitates,promotes.but the two have different applications.section a a i promotion is geared at the purpose of a transaction that involves funds unlawfully promote or facilitate the specified unlawful activities that generate the funds being laundered.when proceeds of specified unlawful activity are involved in a financial transaction that has as its purpose the promotion of specified unlawful activity,those funds are forfeitable as the corpus of the offense but facilitation under section a involved in clause is geared at the forfeitability of instrumentalities,including funds in some cases,that facilitate or promote the transactions.often this theory is invoked to take computers or other objects used in the enterprise.facilitating funds can be forfeited even if they were not part of the transaction.
causally speaking,the premium subsidies and premium charges did allow the individuals to receive the benefits.after all,the government role in this market is what makes this sort of insurance available to producers at reasonable rates,and premiums enable the insurer to pay insureds claims.but neither of these effects is sufficient to establish section a facilitation because neither promotes the money laundering.they do contribute in some way to the procurement of the funds,but they do not make the further laundering of those funds any less difficult or more or less free from obstruction or hindrance.hawkey,at.huber and the other individuals simply did not use the funds withheld by the insurer or the funds transferred between the government and the insurer to launder money.so these amounts were not recoverable through the forfeiture provisions because the funds were not involved in the conspiracy within the meaning of section a.
huber brief represents that the premium charges totaled and that the premium subsidies totaled.appellants br.at.the government does not question these amounts,but we can not reasonably verify the accuracy of huber representation because he offers no basis for his calculations or citations to the record that substantiate these amounts.thus,the district court should determine these amounts on remand and reduce its forfeiture judgment accordingly 
late disclosure 
forfeiture exhibit,which summarized various forms and amounts of income to greff,bickett,bergan,and steven huber from through,was not given to huber until just before the close of the trial.huber argues that his due process rights were violated by the late disclosure of this document under brady maryland,d.we disagree.there was no exculpatory evidence in the exhibit or anything that could be used for impeachment.thus,brady did not require the exhibit disclosure.see united states thomas,cir incriminating evidence is not favorable to the accused.
huber also cites rule,but does so without argument or authority.even if rule would have required a timely disclosure of this exhibit,and if the disclosure was indeed untimely,huber does not explain his prejudice except in the most conclusory terms.as discussed at length above,all of the numbers the jury used from the exhibit to calculate the forfeiture were proper,except for the premium charges and premium subsidies that had been included in the column of the exhibit.thus,to the extent huber claims prejudice in his inability to detect that error,our judgment provides an appropriate remedy because it requires the district court to enter a forfeiture judgment that does not include those amounts.
we have considered all of the other arguments huber raises,and we find them without merit.
b.the government sentencing 
the district court made a valiant effort at finding an appropriate sentence for huber,hfgp,and hfi under the united states sentencing guidelines.various hearing transcripts,memoranda,filings,and quite intricate psrs,complete with approximately pages related to the parties objections to them,appear in the record.reluctantly,we vacate the sentences imposed and remand for resentencing because our changes to the forfeiture judgment lead us to believe the district court should be afforded the opportunity to resentence the defendants.we have concluded that the forfeiture amount,which represents the corpus of the laundered funds,could be approximately million,rather than the million the jury and the judge concluded sho
