plaintiffs,seasonal agricultural workers,brought this action under labor code section and other theories to recover unpaid minimum wages.plaintiffs contend the industrial welfare commission iwc wage order,entitled order regulating wages,hours,and working conditions in agricultural occupations,tit,commonly known as wage order,defines defendants as their employers for purposes of section.the lower courts rejected the argument.we affirm.
background 
this case arises out of the strawberry farming operations of isidro munoz,who did business as munoz sons munoz.plaintiffs are seasonal agricultural workers whom munoz employed during the strawberry season antonio perez cortes,catarino cortez,otilio cortez,asuncion cruz,hilda martinez and miguel martinez.munoz,originally named as a defendant,has been granted a discharge in bankruptcy.the remaining defendants are two of the produce merchants through whom munoz sold strawberries apio,apio,and combs distribution,together with its principals,corky and larry combs,and its field representative juan ruiz collectively combs.plaintiffs separate action against a third merchant,frozsun,frozsun,has been stayed pending the outcome of this action.a fourth merchant,ramirez brothers,has petitioned for bankruptcy.
during the season,munoz grew and harvested strawberries in the santa maria valley,which lies on the central coast along the border of san luis obispo and santa barbara counties.munoz farmed a total of acres divided among four sites.he leased two acre sites the oceano and zenon fields from defendant apio and a acre site the el campo field from an unidentified third party munoz had leased the oceano and el campo fields in prior years.he rented an additional acre site the santa maria field from ramirez brothers.munoz operated his business as a single,integrated concern,using his employees and equipment in all four fields,as needed,and combining his revenues and expenses.during the peak of the harvest,munoz employed approximately agricultural workers,three foremen including his brother,armando munoz and two office workers including his son,isidro munoz.munoz owned his equipment,including trucks,tools and strawberry carts,and paid his own business expenses,including plants,fertilizer,pesticide,irrigation,fuel,packaging,and rent for additional trucks,a large tractor and field toilets.on the occasions when apio and combs paid munoz expenses in the first instance,they billed him.both defendants,for example,charged munoz for packaging that bore their companies labels,and for refrigeration,and apio charged munoz for his portion of the cost of a shared irrigation system.
munoz grew and harvested strawberries for two distinct markets fresh sale to consumers in markets,and sale for processing typically freezing.fresh market and freezer berries are harvested differently.fresh market berries can not be too green or too ripe,and the calyx sepals and stem is left attached.market berries are packed in the field,as they are picked,into the containers in which they will be sold to consumers,such as plastic baskets or clamshell boxes.freezer berries,in contrast,are selected for advanced ripeness and packed in bulk into crates with the calyx removed.munoz harvested strawberries for both markets from the same fields.he decided which fields to harvest on any given day,and whether to harvest for fresh market sale or the freezer,based largely on the need to pick fields every three days,informing the merchants of his schedule and taking into account their orders and the berries condition.
the four produce merchants through which munoz sold strawberries are not related to one another.munoz had dealt profitably with defendant apio for three years prior to,and with defendant combs for one.the principals of ramirez brothers were munoz personal friends.apio,combs and ramirez brothers dealt only in fresh market berries,and frozsun dealt only in freezer berries.apio,combs and frozsun each accepted berries from many independent growers,not just munoz.combs also sold beans for munoz after the strawberry season ended.
munoz had different contractual relationships with each merchant.apio and combs acted as produce brokers,selling munoz strawberries for a commission and remitting to him the net proceeds munoz retained title until sale.both defendants,following a common practice of produce merchants on the central coast,advanced money to munoz before the season began,in exchange for exclusive rights to fresh produce from designated fields.these advances were retired over the season from sales revenues.apio and combs handled payment differently.combs agreed to remit the actual net proceeds of sale to munoz within days,in weekly payments,minus a deduction for loan repayment percent,expenses such as packaging materials and cooling,and an percent commission.apio operated similarly and charged the same commission but,rather than making weekly payments to munoz of actual net proceeds,paid him estimated net proceeds in the form of a weekly pick pack payment that was initially set at per carton but actually varied with the price of strawberries.frozsun,which purchased strawberries exclusively for processing,paid munoz on delivery the official field price posted by the processing strawberry advisory board of california.munoz and ramirez brothers,being personal friends,conducted business without a written contract.their understanding was that munoz would pay for plants and labor and ramirez brothers would pay all other expenses,remitting net profits to munoz after recovering their costs.
munoz financial resources for the season came from many sources.much of his cash during the season came from sales proceeds,including at least in pick pack payments estimated net proceeds from apio,in net proceeds from frozsun,and an unspecified amount from combs.munoz also invested at least of his own funds and an unspecified amount of loan proceeds.the record does not identify all of munoz financing sources.some financing,as noted,came from the produce merchants.apio advanced munoz,or per acre for the oceano and zenon fields,and combs advanced,or per acre for el campo.these advances were not intended to cover munoz actual costs for growing and harvesting strawberries,which were far higher the of apio described that company advances as covering rent for the oceano and zenon fields.frozsun agreed to make or facilitate a loan of up to in exchange for the exclusive right to purchase freezer and cannery berries from all of munoz acreage.munoz also received loans from personal friends and financing for equipment from ford motor company and john deere.
munoz alone,with the assistance of his foremen,hired and fired his employees,trained them when necessary,told them when and where to report to work,when to start,stop and take breaks,provided their tools and equipment set their wages,paid them,handled their payroll and taxes,and purchased their workers compensation insurance 
munoz and his foremen also supervised his employees.plaintiffs contend defendants apio and combs participated in the supervision,characterizing as supervision the activities of defendants field representatives in the areas of quality control and contract compliance.we will return to this subject below.see post,d at,at et summarizing for present purposes,picking and packing strawberries for fresh market sale necessitated communication in the field,during the harvest,between defendants and munoz personnel.both apio and combs regularly sent field representatives to ascertain the quality of available strawberries and to explain the manner in which they were to be packed.apio sent their representatives juan toche and manuel cardenas.combs sent defendant juan ruiz,who performed similar services for many entities and whom combs eventually hired as an employee in june.munoz contract with apio expressly provided for these quality control activities.the contract provided,under the headings performance oversight and coordination and quality of crops,that apio would set the standards for,and be the sole judge,of the quality and maturity of the crops and the pack,and that apio would have the right to send its quality control personnel to the fields at any time to confirm that the crops are the quality required for purchase by apio marketing and sale under apio labels munoz operated the same way with combs,apparently as a matter of standard practice,even though the parties terse,contract did not address the subject.
munoz began delivering fresh market strawberries to apio and combs sometime in march.he delivered the last fresh berries to apio on may,and to combs on may.the freezer berry harvest began at the end of april and thus overlapped the last few weeks of the fresh berry harvest.when the fresh berry harvest ended,the freezer berry harvest greatly increased.to illustrate,as of may munoz had sold to frozsun a total of pounds of freezer berries for.in the next week alone ending may,munoz sold pounds for.sales to frozsun continued until august,eventually totaling pounds and in payments to munoz.
in the last few weeks of the fresh strawberry harvest,the market for fresh berries deteriorated.according to munoz,more berries were grown and harvested in than the market could handle.apio,combs and ramirez brothers were receiving poor prices for berries and,in some cases,no price at all when customers took berries on consignment.apio pick pack payments of estimated net proceeds,initially set at per carton,reached a high of per carton from to april and then dropped gradually to in may as the price of strawberries fell.apio paid munoz on may for berries delivered the week ending may,in advance of the day contractual due date for payment.the next pick pack advance payments from apio were due on june for the week ending may,and on june for the week ending may.apio actually advanced munoz for both weeks sometime between june and.combs advanced munoz in the last five days of may.munoz received no payments at all from ramirez brothers during the season.munoz finished the season owing apio about,combs about,and ramirez brothers about.
despite advances from apio and combs,and despite increasing payments from frozsun,munoz at some point in may began to have problems paying his workers.this led to a work stoppage on the afternoon of saturday,may,in the el campo field,where over of munoz employees were harvesting freezer berries.munoz employees,who had apparently not been paid for several weeks,had stopped work and were talking with jose popoca serrano,who identified himself as a member of the organization for human rights.serrano was compiling a list,which he later gave to the department of labor standards enforcement dlse,of workers claiming unpaid wages.munoz supervisor arturo leon,and munoz himself by telephone,asked serrano to help persuade the workers to return to work,telling serrano that munoz could not pay because apio was withholding payment munoz promised serrano he would pay his workers on tuesday.at some point,combs field representative juan ruiz arrived,telling serrano he had a check payable to munoz from combs for and that munoz already had another.ruiz then spoke directly to munoz workers.according to plaintiff asuncion cruz,juan ruiz told us to keep working and help munoz.juan told us not to worry and said he guaranteed we would be paid as his boss had checks he was delivering to isidro munoz.cruz heard workers tell juan they were concerned that the amount of the check he brought with him would not be enough to pay everyone.juan told us not to worry as he would deliver even larger amounts of money from his boss to isidro munoz the following week,and even more money the week after that,which would be enough to pay us all.munoz workers recognized ruiz as the field representative for the company combs to whom munoz delivered fresh market berries from the el campo field.according to leon,ruiz also spoke with individual workers,explaining that if all of you stop right now,the strawberries are going to go to waste.and they wo be able to pay you.after ruiz spoke,several workers crossed their names off serrano list and returned to work,but workers left for the day to return on monday.
on june,the dlse began to investigate wage claims against munoz,based on serrano information.the next day,dlse investigator paul rodriguez met with tim murphy,apio,who said that a payment to munoz of approximately was pending.rodriguez asked murphy not to pay munoz but,instead,to pay munoz employees directly.murphy declined because apio owed the money to munoz,not his employees,and did not want to breach its agreement with munoz.subsequently,however,apio and munoz agreed,at the dlse suggestion,that apio would pay munoz,and that cashier checks would immediately be issued in the names of the employees who had filed wage claims.implementing this agreement on june or,murphy and munoz visited mid state bank trust in guadalupe,where murphy did business.munoz endorsed apio check to the bank,and the bank issued checks to the workers named on a list munoz provided.on june,murphy delivered the checks to dlse investigator rodriguez at the betteravia government center in santa maria.rodriguez,a second dlse investigator,and munoz foreman arturo leon distributed the checks to munoz employees.murphy observed the distribution but did not participate.
on november,plaintiffs filed the present action against defendants apio,combs and ruiz,as well as the now bankrupt munoz.plaintiffs asserted a variety of claims.specifically,plaintiffs alleged defendants were liable for unpaid minimum wages,liquidated damages for unpaid minimum wages unpaid contract wages,waiting time penalties,penalties for failure to provide wage statements,and breach of contract.on behalf of similarly situated employees,plaintiffs also alleged claims under the unfair competition law bus,et ucl for restitution,and liquidated damages.plaintiffs did not seek class certification.
defendants apio,combs and ruiz moved for summary judgment on all claims.plaintiffs opposition to the motions focused on three theories of liability.first,applying the definitions of employ and employer set out in wage order plaintiffs contended defendants apio and combs,together with munoz,jointly employed plaintiffs and were thus liable under sections and for their unpaid wages and liquidated damages.second,plaintiffs argued they were beneficiaries of the contract between munoz and apio,in which,among other things,munoz agreed to comply with all applicable laws,including the labor laws.third,plaintiffs asserted they were parties to an oral employment agreement with combs the superior court rejected plaintiffs arguments and granted judgment for defendants.
plaintiffs appealed.the court of appeal affirmed in part and reversed in part.finding no california case law interpreting the iwc definitions of employ and employer,wage order,tit,subd.c,f,the court imported the economic reality test for employment developed in federal cases interpreting the fair labor standards act of.et see goldberg whitaker house coop,d.applying that test,the court concluded defendants did not exercise sufficient control over plaintiffs,and over munoz agricultural operation,to be plaintiffs joint employers,and thus affirmed the summary judgment for defendants on plaintiffs claims under labor code sections and.the court also affirmed the summary judgment for apio on plaintiffs claim as purported beneficiaries of apio contract with munoz.finally,the court found triable issues of fact on plaintiffs claim regarding the alleged oral agreement with combs.the court of appeal reversed the judgment on this claim alone,and combs did not seek review.in all other respects,the court of appeal affirmed.
we granted plaintiffs petition for review and deferred further action pending consideration of a related issue in reynolds bement cal th,d,reynolds.
ii.discussion 
introduction 
the central question before us is whether defendants are subject to suit by plaintiffs under section the statute provides in relevant part as follows notwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage,any employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime compensation,including interest thereon,reasonable attorney fees,and costs of suit,subd.a.the legislature has thus given an employee a cause of action for unpaid minimum wages without specifying who is liable.that only an employer can be liable,however,seems logically inevitable as no generally applicable rule of law imposes on anyone other than an employer a duty to pay wages.
plaintiffs effort to recover unpaid wages from persons who contracted with their ostensible employer raises issues that have long avoided the attention of california courts.the statute currently designated as section,with its specific operative language,was enacted in as part of the act that created the iwc and delegated to it the power to fix minimum wages,maximum hours of work,and standard conditions of labor.stats,ch.in the ensuing years,however,we have touched only once upon the question of how employment should be defined in actions brought under section.reynolds,supra,cal th,d.similarly,the phrases the iwc presently uses to define the terms employ and employer in all of its current industry and occupation wage orders iwc wage orders to,tit,first appeared in orders dated and respectively,yet the courts of this state have never considered their meaning or scope likewise has the concept of joint employment avoided judicial scrutiny in the context of wage claims brought under state law.although we have recognized that a person,by exercising significant control over the employees of another,may come to share the employer legal obligations,our decisions on this point have concerned statutory schemes other than the wage laws 
how then do we define the employment relationship,and thus identify the persons who may be liable as employers,in actions under section the question is ultimately one of legislative intent,as o ur fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.day city of fontana cal th,d.in this search for what the legislature meant,t he statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator,so we start with the statute words,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.if the words themselves are not ambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the statute plain meaning governs.on the other hand,if the language allows more than one reasonable construction,we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction.in cases of uncertain meaning,we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,including its impact on public policy.wells learning foundation cal th,d.
b.the parties arguments.
the uncertainty surrounding the definition of the employment relationship in actions under section has led the parties to offer several diverse arguments.those arguments,and our conclusions,may be summarized as follows 
plaintiffs contend the language and history of section show the legislature intended generally to defer to the iwc regulatory definitions of the employment relationship in its wage orders.plaintiffs would give those definitions sweeping breadth.specifically,plaintiffs argue defendants suffer ed,or permit ted plaintiffs to work wage order,tit,subd.c,because defendants knew munoz would need to hire workers to fulfill his contracts with defendants,and that defendants thus,in some sense,suffered or permitted plaintiffs to work for their benefit.plaintiffs further argue defendants exercise d control over plaintiffs wages,hours,or working conditions wage order,tit,subd.f,because defendants,under the terms of their contracts with munoz,controlled the remittance to him of his share of the proceeds of sale,and thus a portion of the income from which he paid his employees.
defendants,in opposition,cite our decision in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,where we looked to the common law to define employment in a suit under section seeking to hold the directors and officers of a corporation liable for its employees unpaid overtime compensation.reynolds,at,d.alternatively,in the event reynolds is distinguishable and the wage order definitions do apply,defendants argue we should construe the wage order as if it incorporated the federal economic reality definition of employment developed in cases arising under the fair labor standards act of et flsa see goldberg whitaker house,supra.and articulated in federal regulations promulgated under the flsa see and the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act et h 
we hold as follows in actions under section to recover unpaid minimum wages,the iwc wage orders do generally define the employment relationship,and thus who may be liable.an examination of the wage orders language,history and place in the context of california wage law,moreover,makes clear that those orders do not incorporate the federal definition of employment.applying these conclusions to the facts of the case,we affirm the court of appeal judgment.
labor code section.
as noted at the outset,the legislature has not,within the four corners of section,either defined the employment relationship or identified the persons who are liable under the statute for unpaid wages.we thus turn for guidance to the statute context and legislative history.section is the direct successor of,and its operative language comes immediately from,section of the uncodified act stats,ch,that created the iwc and delegated to it the power to fix minimum wages,maximum hours and standard conditions of labor for workers in california an examination of section in its statutory and historical context shows unmistakably that the legislature intended the iwc wage orders to define the employment relationship in actions under the statute.
the act creating the iwc the act joined a wave of minimum wage legislation that swept the nation in the second decade of the century.no state law provided for a minimum wage before.by the end of,however,nine states had enacted such laws,motivated by widespread public recognition of the low wages,long hours,and poor working conditions under which women and children often labored.by,another five states,the district of columbia and puerto rico had followed.brandeis,labor legislation minimum wage legislation in history of labor in the united states commons edit,brandeis.these states took a variety of approaches to the problem.for example,two states massachusetts and nebraska enacted voluntary minimum wage laws,and one state utah set a minimum wage by statute.other states,including california,went much further by directing commissions to study labor conditions and to set minimum wages based on the cost of living,and by making the failure to pay the minimum wage a crime.brandeis,supra,at note,woman work am.lab.legis.these states did not follow a federal model as congress would not enact the flsa et until.
in california specifically,calls to enact a minimum wage followed legislation prohibiting some child labor and regulating the hours women and children could be required to work stats,chs,and a comprehensive report by the state bureau of labor statistics on wages,hours and labor conditions throughout the state.the report showed,among other things,that approximately percent of working women earned less than per week.state bur.of lab.statistics,biennial.although interpretations of this evidence varied widely,most experts thought that these wages were unreasonably low.the bureau itself considered them below a decent standard of living many women were living below any normal standard,and such subnormal living was having a most disastrous effect on the health and morals of the women workers.hundley,supra,pac.hist.at,fn.omitted,quoting iwc,what california has done to protect the women workers may.although the legislation had nearly eliminated unpermitted child labor,the bureau reported that minors from to years old working with permits still constituted just under percent of the workforce.state bur.of lab.statistics,biennial,supra,at.the bureau did not report working minors wages.
the legislature addressed these continuing problems by creating the iwc and delegating to it broad authority to regulate the hours,wages and labor conditions of women and minors stats,ch,and by proposing to the voters a successful constitutional amendment confirming the legislature authority to proceed in that manner the argument in favor of the proposed constitutional amendment informed the voters that i n bills were passed controlling the hours of women and children work,and it was obvious that the work was less than half done unless the other two minimum rules of industrial life were also made to protect this weakest and most helpless class that is,that the safety and the sanitary conditions in which women worked should be controlled,and,what was more important,that they should be certain of a living wage a wage that insures for them the necessary shelter,wholesome food and sufficient clothing.ballot,argument in favor of assem.const.amend.on this point,the ballot pamphlet cited the findings of the state bureau of labor statistics and expressed concern that substandard wages frequently led to ill health and moral degeneracy.ibid.
the iwc initial statutory duty under the act was to ascertain the wages paid,the hours and conditions of labor and employment in the various occupations,trades,and industries in which women and minors are employed in the state of california,and to make investigations into the comfort,health,safety and welfare of such women and minors.stats,ch,subd.a.to assist the iwc in this work,the legislature gave the commission broad investigatory powers,including free access to places of business and employment,subd.b,par,as well as the authority to demand reports and information under oath,subd.b,par,to inspect records,subd.b,par,and to issue subpoenas requiring the appearance and sworn testimony of witnesses.if,after investigation,the iwc determined that the wages paid to women and minors in any industry were inadequate to supply the cost of proper living,or the hours or conditions of labor were prejudicial to the health,morals or welfare of the workers,the iwc was to convene a wage board of employers and employees.based on the wage board report and recommendations,and following a public hearing,the commission was to issue wage orders fixing for each industry a minimum wage to be paid to women and minors adequate to supply the necessary cost of proper living and to maintain their health and welfare,subd.a,par,the maximum hours of work,and the standard conditions of labor,subd.a,pars.
today,the laws defining the iwc powers and duties remain essentially the same as in with a few important exceptions first,the voters have amended the state constitution to confirm the legislature authority to confer on the iwc legislative,executive,and judicial powers.cal,art.xiv,italics added added by assem.const.amend.reg.sess,as approved by voters,prim.june,see industrial welfare com.superior court cal d.second,the legislature has expanded the iwc jurisdiction to include all employees,male and female,in response to federal legislation barring employment discrimination because of sex tit.vii of the civil rights act of,et.see stats,ch,stats,ch,see generally industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,at.third,while retaining the authorizing language of the act,the legislature has restated the commission responsibility in even broader terms industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,at,charging the iwc with the continuing duty to ascertain the wages,hours and labor conditions of all employees in this state,to investigate their health,safety,and welfare,to conduct a full review of the adequacy of the minimum wage at least once every two years,and to convene wage boards and adopt new wage orders if the commission finds that wages paid to employees may be inadequate to supply the cost of proper living,subd.a see also.finally,while the amount of the minimum wage has in recent years been set by statute,specific employers and employees still become subject to the minimum wage only through,and under the terms of,the iwc applicable wage orders,
to ensure the iwc wage orders would be obeyed,the legislature included criminal,administrative and civil enforcement provisions in the original act.the criminal enforcement provision declared that employers who failed to pay the minimum wage,as well as officers,agents and other persons acting for such employers,would be guilty of misdemeanors.stats,ch.the administrative provision authorized the iwc to take all proceedings necessary to enforce payment of the minimum wage based on complaints filed by underpaid employees.the civil provision the immediate predecessor of labor code section gave employees a private right of action to recover unpaid minimum wages and invalidated agreements to work for less than the minimum wage.stats,ch,quoted ante,d at fn,at,fn.more robust versions of these enforcement provisions appear in today labor code.see administrative enforcement,civil actions,criminal liability.
the act did not give any employee the immediate right to receive a minimum wage.instead,the legislature provided that implementation and enforcement of the minimum wage would depend upon,and await,the iwc issuance of wage orders governing specific industries and occupations.this was the effect of section of the act,which provided that t he minimum wage for women and minors fixed by said commission as in this act provided,shall be the minimum wage to be paid to such employees,and the payment to such employees of a less wage than the minimum so fixed shall be unlawful stats,ch.accordingly,the essential predicate of each employer obligation to pay a minimum wage was the iwc issuance of an applicable wage order fixing the minimum wage for a particular industry or occupation.the applicable wage order also provided the necessary legal basis for an action by an employee to recover unpaid minimum wages.section of the act,the original civil liability provision,permitted a ny employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage applicable to such employee to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of such minimum wage stats,ch,italics added.the italicized phrase unambiguously referred to the wage mandated by the terms of the applicable wage order,because section defined the wage fixed by said commission as the minimum wage to be paid and its nonpayment as unlawful.stats,ch.
virtually the same statutory and regulatory structure remains in place today.under section,t he minimum wage for employees fixed by the commission is the minimum wage to be paid to employees,and the payment of a less wage than the minimum so fixed is unlawful.under section,any employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage,subd.a.accordingly,today,as under the act,specific employers and employees become subject to the minimum wage only under the terms of an applicable wage order,and an employee who sues to recover unpaid minimum wages actually and necessarily sues to enforce the wage order.
the newly created iwc moved diligently to exercise its broad delegated powers.after investigating labor conditions in the fruit and vegetable canning industry,the commission convened the first wage board in and later that year issued its first wage order iwc former wage order see d,fn,fn,ante,making women and minors working in that industry the first employees in california to receive a legally established minimum wage.by the end of,the commission had issued additional orders establishing minimum wages in the mercantile,laundry,fish canning,fruit and vegetable packing,and manufacturing industries,and in general and professional office occupations.iwc,third biennial.today wage orders are in effect,covering specific industries and occupations one covering all employees not covered by an industry or occupation order and a general minimum wage order amending all others to conform to the amount of the minimum wage currently set by statute 
d.how the iwc has defined the employment relationship.
the iwc first wage order,adopted in,contained no separate definition of the term employ,but various substantive provisions imposing duties on employers began with language like that the iwc still uses today in all of its industry and occupation wage orders to define the term.for example no person,firm or corporation shall employ or suffer or permit any woman or minor to work in the fruit and vegetable canning industry in any occupation at time rates less than the following iwc former wage order,italics added see,wage order,tit,subd.c employ means to engage,suffer,or permit to work italics added.the chosen language was especially apt in an order intended to regulate the employment of women and minors because it was already in use throughout the country in statutes regulating and prohibiting child labor and occasionally that of women having been recommended for that purpose in several model child labor laws published between and see rutherford food mccomb,fn.the language had been interpreted to impose criminal liability for employing children,or civil liability for their industrial injuries,even when no common law employment relationship existed between the minor and the defendant,based on the defendant failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent child labor from occurring.
not requiring a common law master and servant relationship,the widely used employ,suffer or permit standard reached irregular working arrangements the proprietor of a business might otherwise disavow with impunity.courts applying such statutes before had imposed liability,for example,on a manufacturer for industrial injuries suffered by a boy hired by his father to oil machinery curtis gartside pigg,supra,and on a mining company for injuries to a boy paid by coal miners to carry water purtell philadelphia reading coal iron,supra.
results such as these,while foreign to the common law,were generally understood as appropriate under child labor statutes that included the employ,suffer or permit standard.as one state supreme court explained,i f the statute went no farther than to prohibit employment,then it could be easily evaded by the claim that the child was not employed to do the work which caused the injury,but that he did it of his own choice and at his own risk and if it prohibited only the employment and permitting a child to do such things,then it might still be evaded by the claim that he was not employed to do such work,nor was permission given him to do so.but the statute goes farther,and makes use of a term even stronger than the term permitted.it says that he shall be neither employed,permitted,nor suffered to engage in certain works.curtis gartside pigg,supra.the standard thus meant that the employer shall not employ by contract,nor shall he permit by acquiescence,nor suffer by a failure to hinder.ibid.similarly,another state supreme court rejected the employer argument that the standard could only apply when the relation of master and servant actually exists.purtell philadelphia reading coal iron,supra.to put such a construction on this statute would leave the words permitted or suffered to work practically without meaning.it is the child working that is forbidden by the statute,and not his hiring,and,while the statute does not require employers to police their premises in order to prevent chance violations of the act,they owe the duty of using reasonable care to see that boys under the forbidden age are not suffered or permitted to work there contrary to the statute.ibid.
the iwc separate definition of employer,a person who employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person is only relatively recent,having first appeared in a order regulating the manufacturing industry the same language appears today in all of the iwc industry and occupation orders.beginning with the word employs,the definition logically incorporates the separate definition of employ,to engage,suffer,or permit to work as one alternative.the remainder of the definition exercises control over wages,hours,or working conditions has no clearly identified,precisely literal statutory or common law antecedent.about this language,however,one may safely make three observations 
first,the scope of the iwc delegated authority is,and has always been,over wages,hours and working conditions,see stats,ch.for the iwc to adopt a definition of employer that brings within its regulatory jurisdiction an entity that controls any one of these aspects of the employment relationship makes eminently good sense.
second,phrased as it is in the alternative,wages,hours,or working conditions the language of the iwc employer definition has the obvious utility of reaching situations in which multiple entities control different aspects of the employment relationship,as when one entity,which hires and pays workers,places them with other entities that supervise the work.consistently with this observation,the iwc has explained its decision to include the language in one modern wage order as specifically intended to include both temporary employment agencies and employers who contract with such agencies to obtain employees within the definition of employer.
third,and finally,the iwc employer definition belongs to a set of revisions intended to distinguish state wage law from its federal analogue,the flsa.we touched upon this point in morillion royal packing,supra,cal th,d.in,congress limited the flsa by enacting the portal to portal act et,which relieved employers of the obligation to compensate employees for time spent travelling to the work site,even in an employer vehicle,and for time spent in activities preliminary and postliminary to work,a.in response,the iwc,exercising its authority to provide employees with greater protection than federal law affords morillion royal packing,supra,at,d,see also ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,revised its wage orders from forward to define the term hours worked as meaning the time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer,includ ing all the time the employee is suffered or permitted to work,whether or not required to do so.at the same time,the iwc defined employer as meaning any person who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of an employee.noting this history,defendant combs argues the iwc changes were intended solely to expand the definition of hours worked and not also to affect the definition of employer.this is plainly wrong,as the iwc could have redefined hours worked without also redefining employer.one change did not logically compel the other.
judicial deference to the iwc orders.
the legislature and the voters have repeatedly demanded the courts deference to the iwc authority and orders.in the original act,the legislature narrowly confined the scope of judicial review of the commission orders,making its findings of fact conclusive in the absence of fraud and declaring that the minimum wage fixed by the commission was presumed to be reasonable and lawful.stats,ch,see now,iwc orders shall be valid and operative,iwc findings of fact are conclusive in the absence of fraud.at the same time,as noted,the legislature enacted and successfully proposed to the voters a constitutional amendment approving the iwc creation and providing that no part of the state constitution would be construed as limiting the legislature authority in the matter.cal,former article xx,section see ante,d,fn,fn.the ballot argument in favor of the measure explained the assembly had proposed the amendment to make sure that after the commission work is done,its findings and rulings can not be assailed and made useless by the state courts declaring this the act unconstitutional.see ballot,supra,argument in favor of assem.const.amend,at.in,the legislature provided that the iwc orders shall be valid and operative and exempt from the administrative procedure act,et,stats,ch,as amended.in,as noted,the voters again amended the constitution to confirm in even stronger terms that t he legislature may provide for minimum wages and for the general welfare of employees and for those purposes may confer on a commission legislative,executive,and judicial powers.cal,art.xiv,italics added see ante,fn,fn.see generally industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,cal d.
obeying these formal expressions of legislative and voter intent,the courts have shown the iwc wage orders extraordinary deference,both in upholding their validity and in enforcing their specific terms.concerning the wage orders validity,j udicial authorities have repeatedly emphasized that in fulfilling its broad statutory mandate,the iwc engages in a endeavor,a task which necessarily and properly requires the commission exercise of a considerable degree of judgment and discretion.industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,cal d.because of the nature of the iwc authority,the judiciary has recognized that its review of the commission wage orders is properly circumscribed a reviewing court does not superimpose its own policy judgment upon a agency in the absence of an arbitrary decision,quoting rivera division of industrial welfare d.moreover,past decisions teach that in light of the remedial nature of the legislative enactments authorizing the regulation of wages,hours and working conditions for the protection and benefit of employees,the statutory provisions are to be liberally construed with an eye to promoting such protection.industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,at.
concerning the specific terms of wage orders,we have explained that t he power to fix the minimum wage does not confine the iwc to that single act.it may adopt rules to make it effective.cal.restaurant clark cal d,italics added.the power to provide safeguards to insure the receipt of the minimum wage and prevent evasion and subterfuge,is necessarily an implied power flowing from the power to fix a minimum wage delegated to the commission.it is true that an administrative agency may not,under the guise of its rule making power,abridge or enlarge its authority or exceed the powers given to it by the statute,the source of its power.citations.however,the authority of an administrative board or officer to adopt reasonable rules and regulations which are deemed necessary to the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly granted can not be questioned.this authority is implied from the power granted,at,quoting bank of italy johnson cal.
consistently with these deferential principles of review,we have repeatedly enforced definitional provisions the iwc has deemed necessary,in the exercise of its statutory and constitutional authority cal,art.xiv,to make its wage orders effective,to ensure that wages are actually received,and to prevent evasion and subterfuge.cal.restaurant clark,supra,cal d.such provisions have,for example,excluded restaurant servers tips from the legal minimum wage,at,defined h ours worked as including the time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer,even if travelling on the employer bus and not actually working,wage order,tit,subd.g see morillion royal packing,supra,cal th,d,and required that an o utside salesperson,to be exempt from overtime compensation must regularly work more than half the working time away from the employer place of business in sales activities iwc wage order,tit,subd.j see ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d.such provisions constitute valid exercises of the iwc authority because,and to the extent,they have a direct relation to minimum wages cal.restaurant clark,supra,at,and are reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute see ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d,see also cal.restaurant clark,supra,at.courts must enforce such provisions in wage actions because,as we have explained,an employee who sues to recover unpaid minimum wages under section actually sues to enforce the applicable wage order.only by deferring to wage orders definitional provisions do we truly apply section according to its terms by enforcing the legal minimum wage,subd.a.
f.the significance of reynolds,supra,cal th.
against this background we consider the significance of reynolds,supra,cal th,d,and whether that decision governs this case.in reynolds we looked to the common law rather than the applicable wage order to define employment in an action under section seeking to hold a corporation directors and officers personally liable for its employees unpaid overtime compensation.reynolds,at,d.we conclude reynolds does not govern this case.wage order,and not the common law,properly defines the employment relationship in this action under section.
the plaintiff in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,worked for a corporation that owned and operated automobile painting shops.he sued under section to recover unpaid overtime compensation allegedly due him under the iwc applicable wage order.plaintiff named as defendants,in addition to the corporation,eight of its officers and directors in their individual capacities.the question before us on demurrer was whether the plaintiff had stated a cause of action against the individual defendants.we held he had not.reynolds,supra,cal th,d.
we properly began our analysis in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,by looking to the iwc intent in promulgating the employer definition.the applicable wage order defined employer in precisely the same language as all of the commission other industry and occupation orders.thus,employer meant any person who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.iwc wage order,tit,subd.g.reasoning that t he best indicator of the commission intent is the language of the provision itself reynolds,at,d,we accepted plaintiffs concession that the plain language of wage order defining employer does not expressly impose liability under section on individual corporate agents reynolds,at,d,this reasoning sufficed to dispose of the reynolds plaintiff claim because,as we have explained,a claim under section is in reality a claim under the applicable wage order and thus subject to the order definitional provisions.
nevertheless,we went on in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,to state that the common law rather than the applicable wage order defined the employment relationship for purposes of the plaintiff action under section.we reached this conclusion in two steps first,we rejected the suggestion that the legislature had intended to incorporate the iwc definitions into section.reynolds,at,d.second,we applied the maxim of interpretation that a statute will be construed in light of the common law unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally indicates otherwise,quoting california of health facilities department of health services cal th,d.elaborating on the latter point,we explained that when a statute refer s to employees without defining the term courts have generally applied the common law test of employment.reynolds,at,d,quoting metropolitan water dist.superior court,supra,cal th,d.in a footnote,we added that the plaintiff ha d not persuaded us that one may infer from the history and purposes of section a clear legislative intent to depart,in the application of that statute,from the common law understanding of who qualifies as an employer.reynolds,at,fn,d.
as we have now shown,an examination of section in its full historical and statutory context shows unmistakably that the legislature intended to defer to the iwc definition of the employment relationship in actions under the statute.the legislature has delegated to the iwc broad authority over wages,hours and working conditions et,the voters have repeatedly ratified that delegation cal,art.xiv,see,former art.xx,and we have confirmed that t he power to fix the minimum wage does not confine the iwc to that single act.it may adopt rules to make it effective cal.restaurant clark,supra,cal d at.the power to adopt rules to make the minimum wage effective includes the power to define the employment relationship as necessary to insure the receipt of the minimum wage and to prevent evasion and subterfuge,at.finally,as we have explained,a worker who sues under section for unpaid minimum wages actually sues to enforce the applicable wage order.this is because the legal minimum wage recoverable under section is t he minimum wage fixed by the commission in the applicable wage order,even if that order merely incorporates the amount currently set by statute,and because employers and employees become subject to the minimum wage only through the applicable wage order and according to its terms see ante,d at fn,at fn.
this is not to say the common law plays no role in the iwc definition of the employment relationship.in fact,the iwc definition of employment incorporates the common law definition as one alternative.as defined in the wage orders,e mployer means any person who employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person,and e mploy means to engage,suffer,or permit to work,wage order,tit,subd.c,f,italics added.the verbs to suffer and to permit,as we have seen,are terms of art in employment law.see ante,d at,at et in contrast,the verb to engage has no other apparent meaning in the present context than its plain,ordinary sense of to employ,that is,to create a common law employment relationship this conclusion makes sense because the iwc,even while extending its regulatory protection to workers whose employment status the common law did not recognize,could not have intended to withhold protection from the regularly hired employees who undoubtedly comprise the vast majority of the state workforce.to employ,then,under the iwc definition,has three alternative definitions.it means a to exercise control over the wages,hours or working conditions,or b to suffer or permit to work,or c to engage,thereby creating a common law employment relationship.
while the common law definition of employment plays an important role in the wage orders definition,and thus also in actions under section,to apply only the common law definition while ignoring the rest of the iwc broad regulatory definition would substantially impair the commission authority and the effectiveness of its wage orders.the commission,as noted,has the power to adopt rules to make the minimum wage effective by prevent ing evasion and subterfuge cal.restaurant clark,supra,cal d at.we have repeatedly upheld the commission exercise of this authority.see ante,d at,at et furthermore,language consistently used by the iwc to define the employment relationship,beginning with its first wage order in suffer,or permit was commonly understood to reach irregular working arrangements that fell outside the common law,having been drawn from statutes governing child labor and occasionally that of women.see ante,at,at et for the iwc,created as it was to regulate the employment of women and minors,to use this language to define the employment relationship was thus uniquely appropriate.to adopt such a definitional provision also lay squarely within the iwc power,as the provision has a direct relation to minimum wages cal.restaurant clark,supra,at,and is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute see ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d,see also cal.restaurant clark,supra,at.for a court to refuse to enforce such a provision in a presumptively valid wage order simply because it differs from the common law would thus endanger the commission ability to achieve its statutory purposes.
one can not overstate the impact of a such a holding on the iwc powers.were we to define employment exclusively according to the common law in civil actions for unpaid wages we would render the commission definitions effectively meaningless.concerned about such a result,we suggested in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,that the iwc definitions might still play a role in administrative proceedings to recover unpaid minimum wages,berman hearings.see et,tit,et since reynolds,however,the court of appeal has correctly observed that t he distinction between judicial and administrative proceedings may be an empty one,since berman hearings are reviewed de novo in superior court at the request of either party.jones gregory,supra,th,d.the statutory trial de novo see is neither a conventional appeal nor review of the labor commissioner decision,but is rather a de novo trial of the wage dispute murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d,and the court hears the matter,not as an appellate court,but as a court of original jurisdiction,with full power to hear and determine it as if it had never been before the labor commissioner,at,d,quoting collier wallis,astor cal d,italics added.in such a trial,a rule requiring courts in wage cases to define employment according to the common law,reynolds would presumably apply,leaving the iwc definitions ultimately unenforceable even in proceedings that begin as berman hearings.
in sum,we hold that the applicable wage order definitions of the employment relationship do apply in actions under section.the opinion in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,properly holds that the iwc definition of employer does not impose liability on individual corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency.reynolds,at,d.the opinion should not be read more broadly than that.
g.the iwc definition of the employment relationship does not incorporate federal law.
with this background,we may easily dispose of defendants argument that the iwc wage orders should be construed as if their provisions defining the employment relationship incorporated federal law.they do not.
in no sense is the iwc definition of the term employ based on federal law.as we have explained,the iwc has used the phrase suffer or permit in wage orders to define the employment relation since borrowing the phrase from the common,wording of contemporary child labor laws.see ante,d at,at et not until did congress enact the flsa,defining the term employ with similar language g,added by stat,and not until did the united states supreme court engraft onto the language of the flsa the nonstatutory economic reality test for employment.goldberg whitaker house,supra.moreover,the federal test has uniquely federal antecedents.while the high court in was aware the phrase suffer or permit g had been widely used in state child labor laws see rutherford food mccomb,supra,fn,the court derived the economic reality test not from that body of law but rather from the language of a judicial decision defining employment for purposes of the federal tax and social security laws united states silk,which in turn relied on a decision interpreting the national labor relations act et national labor relations board hearst publications.see goldberg whitaker house,supra,at.we see no reason to substitute this definition of employment,which has no basis in california law,for definitions in wage orders regularly adopted by the iwc.
furthermore,the language used by the iwc in wage orders since to define employer employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person does not appear anywhere in the flsa et or its implementing regulations.one court has suggested the wage orders definition of employer is almost identical to the federal definition bureerong uvawas,but a comparison of the different state and federal definitions does not confirm the observation instead,as noted see ante,d at,at et,the wage orders language mirrors the scope of the iwc regulatory authority over wages,hours and working conditions,and by its terms imposes liability on multiple entities who divide among themselves control over those different aspects of the employment relationship.
the iwc has on occasion deliberately incorporated federal law into its wage orders.however,where the iwc intended the flsa to apply to wage orders,it has specifically so stated.morillion royal packing,supra,cal th,d.for example,iwc wage orders through,and all expressly incorporate specific federal regulations issued under the flsa to define exempt executive,administrative professional employees in contrast,the wage order applicable to this case wage order and one other iwc wage order do not.the only reference to federal law in wage order appears in a provision exempting individuals participating in national service programs all wage orders contain a similar provision.no wage order,however,incorporates federal law in defining the terms employ or employer.
we have previously cautioned against confounding federal and state labor law ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d,and explained that where the language or intent of state and federal labor laws substantially differ,reliance on federal regulations or interpretations to construe state regulations is misplaced see also morillion royal packing,supra,cal th,d.courts must give the iwc wage orders independent effect in order to protect the commission delegated authority to enforce the state wage laws and,as appropriate,to provide greater protection to workers than federal law affords see morillion royal packing,supra,cal th,d,ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d.we therefore apply the applicable wage order according to its terms,having in mind its distinct language,history and function in the context of state wage law.
summary judgment.
this case comes to us on review of a summary judgment.defendants are entitled to summary judgment only if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.to determine whether triable issues of fact do exist,we independently review the record that was before the trial court when it ruled on defendants motion.johnson american standard,cal th,d,state of health services superior court cal th,d.in so doing,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the losing parties,resolving evidentiary doubts and ambiguities in their favor.johnson american standard,supra,at,d.
plaintiffs claims under the wage laws.
we first consider plaintiffs claim that defendants are liable as employers for plaintiffs unpaid minimum wages under section and wage order because defendants allegedly suffer ed,or permit ted plaintiffs to work exercise d control over their wages,hours,or working conditions wage order,tit,subd.c,f.
s uffer,or permit to work.
the iwc,as we have seen,borrowed its definition of employ to engage,suffer,or permit to work in from the language of early statutes prohibiting child labor.see ante,d at,at et statutes so phrased were generally understood to impose liability on the proprietor of a business who knew child labor was occurring in the enterprise but failed to prevent it,despite the absence of a common law employment relationship.as courts had explained,the language meant that the proprietor shall not employ by contract,nor shall he permit by acquiescence,nor suffer by a failure to hinder.curtis gartside pigg,supra.the language thus cast a duty upon the owner or proprietor to prevent the unlawful condition,and the liability rest ed upon principles wholly distinct from those relating to master and servant.the basis of liability is the owner failure to perform the duty of seeing to it that the prohibited condition does not exist.people sheffield farms slawson decker,italics added,affd,the omission to discover and prevent was a sufferance of the work.
we see no reason to refrain from giving the iwc definition of employ its historical meaning.that meaning was well established when the iwc first used the phrase suffer,or permit to define employment,and no reason exists to believe the iwc intended another.furthermore,the historical meaning continues to be highly relevant today a proprietor who knows that persons are working in his or her business without having been formally hired,or while being paid less than the minimum wage,clearly suffers or permits that work by failing to prevent it,while having the power to do so.
plaintiffs argue defendants apio and combs suffered or permitted plaintiffs to work because defendants knew plaintiffs were working,and because plaintiffs work benefited defendants.concerning defendants knowledge,plaintiffs note defendants were aware munoz would need to hire labor to supply strawberries to defendants,and that defendants field representatives had observed munoz employees at work.plaintiffs also point out that munoz subleased the oceano and zenon fields from apio,which retained a right to enter the leased property.
what is in dispute is the significance,under the wage order,of the assertion that defendants benefited from plaintiffs labor.certainly defendants benefited in the sense that any purchaser of commodities benefits,however indirectly,from the labor of the supplier employees.however,the concept of a benefit is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for liability under the suffer or permit standard.instead,as we have explained,the basis of liability is the defendant knowledge of and failure to prevent the work from occurring.see,people sheffield farms slawson decker,supra,the basis of liability is the owner failure to perform the duty of seeing to it that the prohibited condition does not exist,affd,the omission to discover and prevent was a sufferance of the work curtis gartside pigg,supra,the employer shall not permit by acquiescence,nor suffer by a failure to hinder.here,neither apio nor combs suffered or permitted plaintiffs to work because neither had the power to prevent plaintiffs from working.munoz and his foremen had the exclusive power to hire and fire his workers,to set their wages and hours,and to tell them when and where to report to work.perhaps apio or combs,by ceasing to buy strawberries,might as a practical matter have forced munoz to lay off workers or to divert their labor to other projects,such as harvesting berries for the other defendant,for frozsun or for ramirez brothers.but any substantial purchaser of commodities might force similar choices on a supplier by withdrawing its business.such a business relationship,standing alone,does not transform the purchaser into the employer of the supplier workforce.
plaintiffs interpretation of the wage order is also unreasonably broad.for the same reason that defendants benefited from plaintiffs work,so too did the grocery stores that purchased strawberries from defendants,and the consumers who in turn purchased strawberries from the grocery stores.had the iwc intended to impose a rule capable of creating such potentially endless chains of liability,one would expect the commission to have announced it in the plainest terms after vigorous debate.yet the concept of downstream benefit as a sufficient basis for liability appears nowhere in the wage order definition of employ or in the decisions interpreting the child labor statutes from which the iwc borrowed the definition.we reject plaintiffs broad interpretation of the iwc definition of employ for this reason.
we also note that plaintiffs broad interpretation of the iwc definition of employ would be difficult to justify as an appropriate exercise of the commission power.the iwc power to define employment is,as we have explained,not expressly granted in the act creating the commission but merely implied,and thus extends only so far as necessary to permit the commission effectively to exercise its expressly granted powers to regulate wages,hours and working conditions.cal.restaurant clark,supra,cal d.a n administrative agency may not,under the guise of its rule making power,abridge or enlarge its authority or exceed the powers given to it by the statute,the source of its power,at.accordingly,regulations issued by an administrative agency such as the iwc under a delegation of legislative power must be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute.ramirez yosemite water,supra,cal th,d,yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.that the iwc has not,in nearly a century of administering the minimum wage,seen fit to propose plaintiffs theory of liability strongly suggests the theory is not reasonably necessary to permit the commission to discharge its statutory responsibilities.we also find significant that the single rule of california law that even approaches the breadth of plaintiffs theory in imposing liability for wages appears not in a wage order adopted by the iwc,but in a statute enacted by the legislature,subd.a.these considerations suggest that rules of liability as broad as those plaintiffs advocate are appropriately left to the legislature.
e xercises control over wages,hours,or working conditions 
defendant apio.
plaintiffs next argue that defendant apio,through its contractual relationship with munoz,dominated his business financially and thus exercised indirect control over his employees wages and hours in making this argument,plaintiffs seek to portray munoz as a straw man,engaged by apio to shield itself from agricultural workers wage claims.certainly wage order definition of employer,which encompasses any person who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person,is broad enough to reach through straw men and other sham arrangements to impose liability for wages on the actual employer.the undisputed facts,however,show that munoz alone controlled plaintiffs wages,hours and working conditions.
plaintiffs contend apio indirectly controlled munoz ability to pay his employees because apio unilaterally decided the amount of estimated net proceeds to advance to munoz as pick pack payments,and because apio demanded that munoz continue to harvest produce that would not produce a net return.apio right to set off its expenses,however,was simply an aspect of its contractual relationship with munoz.munoz had made a profit from the same relationship in prior years.plaintiffs note that apio reduced its pick pack payments below the level initially set by contract as the end of the season neared and the market deteriorated,but the contract unequivocally permitted apio to set off its expenses before remitting net proceeds.moreover,nothing in the record shows that apio ever compelled munoz to harvest on any occasion.although munoz had strong incentives to harvest fresh market berries for apio in order to repay apio preseason advance and also to make a profit for himself,he testified without contradiction that he,alone,decided which fields to harvest on any given day and whether to harvest strawberries for fresh market sale or for the freezer.so far as the record discloses,negotiations between apio and munoz over the amount of fresh market berries to be delivered took place in the field,after munoz had already informed apio that he planned to harvest fresh market berries from the oceano or zenon field on a given day.while munoz stated on may,during the work stoppage in el campo,that he could not pay his workers because apio was withholding payment,the undisputed facts show that apio had paid munoz ahead of schedule and more than it was eventually determined to owe him.
more importantly,plaintiffs factual assertions do not establish that apio business relationship with munoz allowed the company to exercise control over munoz employees wages and hours.in making the argument,plaintiffs ignore the following undisputed facts first,munoz operated a single,integrated business operation,growing and harvesting strawberries for several unrelated merchants and combining revenue from all sources with a personal investment,in the hope of earning a profit at the end of the season.munoz paid his employees out of those combined revenues and assets.second,munoz had losses unrelated to his business with apio from his unsuccessful business with ramirez brothers,who paid munoz nothing during the season.third,munoz had substantial revenue from other sources on may.on that same day,frozsun paid munoz,bringing to the amount it had paid him since april.this source of revenue continued until august,by which date frozsun had paid munoz a total of.finally,munoz alone,with the assistance of his foremen,hired and fired plaintiffs,trained and supervised them,determined their rate and manner of pay hourly or piece rate,and set their hours,telling them when and where to report to work and when to take breaks.plaintiffs claim that apio dominated munoz financial affairs can not be reconciled with these facts.
taking a different approach not based on the applicable wage order,plaintiffs attempt to compare this case with borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,borello,in which we held that workers hired by a large agricultural landowner under sharefarmer agreements were employees rather than independent contractors for purposes of the workers compensation law.et the sharefarmers,we found,exhibit no characteristics which might place them outside the act intended coverage of employees.they engage in no distinct trade or calling.they do not hold themselves out in business.they perform typical farm labor for hire where jobs are available.they invest nothing but personal service and hand tools.they incur no opportunity for profit or loss like employees hired on a piecework basis,they are simply paid by the size and grade of cucumbers they pick.they rely solely on work in the fields for their subsistence and livelihood,at,fns.omitted.applying the common law test of employment in light of the remedial purposes of the workers compensation law,we reasonably concluded the sharefarmers were,w ithout doubt,a class of workers to whom the protection of the workers compensation law is intended to extend,at,fn.omitted.
assuming the decision in borello,supra,cal d,has any relevance to wage claims,a point we do not decide,the case does not advance plaintiffs argument.plaintiffs are correct in that,if munoz had been apio employee rather than an independent contractor,munoz employees arguably would also have been apio employees the determination that a purported independent contractor is in fact an employee raises the strong possibility,generally speaking,that the contractor and its employer jointly employ the contractor employees.rinaldi workers comp.appeals bd.d,and cases cited.but munoz was not apio employee.in contrast to the in borello,munoz held himself out in business,invested substantial capital and equipment,employed over workers,sold produce through four unrelated merchants,enjoyed an opportunity for profit or loss dependent on his business acumen and market conditions,and had indeed made a profit in prior years operating in the same manner.
next,plaintiffs argue apio controlled their wages on june or,when apio tim murphy cooperated with the dlse and munoz to ensure that munoz used apio final advance of net proceeds to pay his workers.see ante,d at,at.the argument fails.at that time,as noted,murphy gave munoz a check for,munoz endorsed the check to the bank,and the bank immediately issued cashier checks payable to employees whose names munoz had provided.in so doing,apio participated with the government in what amounts to a garnishment of money owed to munoz for the benefit of his employees.to hold on this basis that apio controlled plaintiffs wages would punish apio for cooperating with the dlse attempt to enforce the wage laws and likely deter future cooperation by others.
viewing the undisputed evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,we find no basis for concluding apio exercised control over plaintiffs wages and hours.
ii.defendant combs.
plaintiffs contend defendant combs exercised control over their wages and hours based on the events of may,at the el campo field.on that date,as noted ante,d at,at et,plaintiffs had been picking freezer berries and stopped work to talk with jose serrano about unpaid wages.juan ruiz,combs agent,convinced some of munoz employees to return to work.according to plaintiff asuncion cruz,juan ruiz told us to keep working and help munoz.juan told us not to worry and said he guaranteed we would be paid as his boss had checks he was delivering to isidro munoz.cruz heard workers tell juan they were concerned that the amount of the check he brought with him would not be enough to pay everyone.juan told us not to worry as he would deliver even larger amounts of money from his boss to isidro munoz the following week,and even more money the week after that,which would be enough to pay us all.cruz declaration is consistent with those of others who heard ruiz speak the record contains no statements by ruiz about what he said.
based on this evidence,plaintiffs contend that combs offered plaintiffs employment through its agent ruiz.assuming for the sake of argument ruiz was acting as combs agent in making the alleged statements the evidence in our view does not fairly support the inference that ruiz offered plaintiffs employment.certainly a promise to pay a person for work would be an offer of employment,as well as an exercise of control over wages and hours sufficient to bring the promisor within the wage order definition of employer.wage order,tit,subd.f.but ruiz did not offer plaintiffs employment with combs.instead,he asked plaintiffs to continue working to help munoz and pointed out that munoz was not yet utterly without funds to pay them,as he was still receiving payments from combs.plaintiffs declarations show they understood the distinction,as they questioned ruiz not about the terms of any hypothetical work for combs but about whether the amount of the check ruiz had brought with him would be enough to pay everyone.that plaintiffs were not working for combs on may was also reasonably apparent in that they were harvesting freezer berries in bulk rather than picking and packing fresh berries for market sale.again,plaintiffs understood the distinction and recognized ruiz as juan,the person they had seen checking the strawberries for the company to whom munoz delivered the market strawberries we picked for sale.italics added.
for these reasons,we find plaintiffs argument lacks merit.
iii.defendant ruiz.
relying on the same evidence,plaintiffs also contend that ruiz personally exercised control over their wages and hours and is thus personally liable as an employer under section and wage order.the claim fails under our holding in reynolds,supra,cal th,d,that the iwc definition of employer does not impose liability on individual corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency.reynolds,at,d.plaintiffs specifically allege in the operative complaint that ruiz,in making the alleged statements on may,was acting in his capacity as agent for combs 
iv.defendants apio and combs.
plaintiffs contend that defendants apio and combs,through their field representatives activities in the areas of quality control and contract compliance,became joint employers of munoz workers by exercis ing control over their working conditions within the meaning of wage order,tit,subd.f.plaintiffs devote little attention to the argument,but it deserves discussion.
as we have noted,picking and packing strawberries for fresh market sale necessitated close communication during the harvest between defendants and munoz personnel.this is because market berries are packed in the field,as they are picked,into the containers in which they will be sold to consumers,often that same day or the next.the contract between apio and munoz expressly provided for such activities,and munoz operated in the same manner with combs,apparently as a matter of standard practice.see ante,d at,at.viewing the facts most favorably to plaintiffs,apio sent its representatives juan toche and manuel cardenas to the field on days when munoz harvested fresh berries from the oceano and zenon fields,and combs sent defendant juan ruiz when munoz harvested berries from el campo.apio and combs representatives followed the same procedure in the morning,the representatives would explain to munoz and his foremen how the merchant wanted strawberries packed,and munoz and his foremen would demonstrate the packing style to the workers.for about an hour,the representatives,together with munoz and his foreman,would check the packed containers as workers brought them from the field to the truck where they would be loaded for shipping.while the representatives would generally bring problems to the attention of munoz and his foremen,they would also sometimes speak directly to the workers,pointing out mistakes in packing such as green or rotten berries.in the afternoon,the representatives would return briefly to check the quality and quantity of berries in the loaded truck.
the question is whether this evidence raises a triable issue of fact as to whether apio and combs exercised control over the working conditions of munoz employees.as we have explained,one of the reasons the iwc defined employer in terms of exercising control was to reach situations in which multiple entities control different aspects of the employment relationship.this occurs,for example,when one entity such as a temporary employment agency hires and pays a worker,and another entity supervises the work.see ante,d at,at.supervision of the work,in the specific sense of exercising control over how services are performed,is properly viewed as one of the working conditions mentioned in the wage order.to read the wage order in this way makes it consistent with other areas of the law,in which control over how services are performed is an important,perhaps even the principal,test for the existence of an employment relationship.see,metropolitan water dist.superior court,supra,cal th,d,common law tieberg unemployment.bd.cal d,unemployment insurance mcfarland voorheis trindle cal d,workers compensation.
while the evidence indicates that apio and combs field representatives spoke with munoz employees about the manner in which strawberries were to be packed,it does not indicate the field representatives ever supervised or exercised control over his employees.no evidence suggests munoz employees viewed the field representatives as their supervisors or believed they owed their obedience to anyone but munoz and his foremen.plaintiffs,relying on cases interpreting other bodies of law,argue the right to exercise control over the manner in which work is performed is sufficient to prove the existence of an employment relationship,whether or not the right is exercised,borello,supra,cal d,tieberg unemployment ins.app,supra,cal d.but even assuming the same rule applies here,munoz contracts with apio and combs gave the merchants no right to direct his employees work.neither does any evidence in the record suggest that anyone munoz,apio,combs,the merchants field representatives,or plaintiffs believed the merchants or their representatives had such a right.confusion on this point was not likely to arise,since munoz and his foremen were present when the field representatives interacted with munoz employees.for all of these reasons,we conclude the claim lacks merit.
plaintiffs claims as purported third party beneficiaries.
lastly,plaintiffs contend they are entitled to recover unpaid wages as third party beneficiaries of the contract between munoz and apio.the claim has no factual basis.nowhere in its contract with munoz did apio undertake to pay his employees under any set of conditions.there simply is no relevant obligation to enforce.
in their contract,apio and munoz agreed that munoz would be solely responsible for the selection,hiring,firing,supervision,assignment,direction,setting of wages,hours,and working conditions of his employees,among other things.in addition,munoz warranted that he would comply with all provisions of federal,state and local laws applicable to his farming operations,including,without limitation,labor italics added.finally,munoz and apio each agreed to indemnify the other from claims concerning the employment of individuals to perform such party functions under this agreement,including matters pertaining to wages italics added.the plain import of these contractual provisions is that munoz agreed to pay his employees the wages required by law,assuming sole responsibility in the matter,and to indemnify apio if his employees sued apio for unpaid wages.
apio contends plaintiffs can not establish standing to enforce the contract because no evidence shows the parties to the contract,apio and munoz,intended to benefit plaintiffs.see hess ford motor cal th,d.we need not decide the point.even if plaintiffs could establish standing,they would gain thereby only the right to stand in apio shoes and enforce the contract terms by suing munoz to compel him to pay their wages.this,munoz bankruptcy precludes.nothing in the rules of law concerning third party beneficiaries permits us to rewrite the contract to impose on apio an obligation to pay wages that it never undertook.
