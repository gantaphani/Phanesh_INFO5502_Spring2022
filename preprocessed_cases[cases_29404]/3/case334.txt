petitioner robert mccloy,appeals from an order of the secretary of agriculture the secretary finding him liable under the horse protection act hpa,for allowing a sore horse to be entered in a horse show.we have jurisdiction under b,and we affirm.
background 
congress enacted the hpa in to combat the cruel and inhumane practice of soring tennessee walking horses in order to improve their performance at horse shows.if the front feet of the horse were deliberately made sore,the intense pain which the animal suffered when placing his forefeet on the ground would cause him to lift them up quickly and thrust them forward,reproducing exactly the desired gait,reprinted in.s oring is usually done by applying a blistering agent,such as oil of mustard,to the pastern area of the horse leg and by wrapping this area with chains or metal rollers.id.
the hpa prohibits 
the a showing or exhibiting,in any horse show or horse exhibition,of any horse which is sore,b entering for the purpose of showing or exhibiting in any horse show or horse exhibition,any horse which is sore,c selling,auctioning,or offering for sale,in any horse sale or auction,any horse which is sore,and d allowing any activity described in clause a,b,or c respecting a horse which is sore by the owner of such horse.
those found in violation of the hpa are subject to civil penalties of up to for each violation and suspension from showing horses for a period of at least one year.see b b vii adjusting fine upward to in accordance with federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of c.knowing violations are subject to criminal penalties.a.the hpa authorizes the secretary to issue such rules and regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of the hpa.
mccloy purchased ebony threat professor missy,a tennessee walking horse,in and placed her with trainer ronal young in.according to mccloy,he instructed young that t here was no need to sore the horse,tr,and he made unannounced visits to young stables to insure that missy was not sored,tr,although mccloy also admits in his affidavit that he gave young no verbal or written instructions concerning the training of missy.young was given complete custody in training the horse.complainant exh.despite the apparently inconsistent testimony,the judicial officer jo for the united states department of agriculture usda found that mccloy had given young a genuine instruction not to sore missy.i at.
missy was entered in the annual tennessee walking horse national celebration in shelbyville,tennessee,on september.officials from the horse show inspected missy and disqualified her from participating on the ground that she was sore.two veterinarians from the animal and plant health inspection service aphis,an agency of the usda,then examined missy and determined that she was indeed sore.mccloy learned of the disqualification while watching the show in the stands and testified later that he was not aware that missy would be shown.
the aphis filed a complaint against mccloy in may of.an administrative law judge alj determined on august,that mccloy had violated the hpa by allowing entry of a sore horse and assessed a fine of.on appeal to the jo,the aphis argued that mccloy should also be disqualified from showing horses for a period of time and mccloy argued that the alj had erred in concluding that he had violated the hpa.on march,the jo filed a opinion affirming the finding that mccloy violated the hpa,affirming imposition of the fine,and additionally imposing a disqualification period.
the jo determined that the evidence establishes that mccloy did not know that ronal young entered missy until he was informed that missy had been turned down,and the jo also noted that there is no evidence that mccloy objected to his trainers entering missy in horse shows or horse exhibitions,and,specifically,the record contains no evidence that mccloy objected to ronal young entering missy in the annual tennessee walking horse national celebration.i at.adopting the usda position on what constitutes allowing a sore horse to be entered,the jo further found that mccloy was a guarantor that missy would not be sore when ronal young entered missy in the annual tennessee walking horse national celebration and mccloy breached his guarantee as a horse owner that ronal young would not enter missy in the show while she was sore.id.at.the secretary position,as characterized by the jo,is that a horse owner who allows a person to enter the owner horse in a horse show or horse exhibition for the purpose of showing or exhibiting the horse is a guarantor that the horse will not be sore when the horse is entered in that horse show or horse exhibition.id.at citing in re carl edwards sons stables,agric,in re gary edwards,agric,in re john gray,agric.a subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied,and mccloy filed a timely petition for review with this court.
discussion 
our review of the jo decision is limited to determining whether the proper legal standards were employed and substantial evidence supports the decision.gray usda,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also b f indings of the secretary shall be set aside if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence.mccloy challenges both the legal standard employed by the jo and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jo findings.we begin with the challenge to the legal standard.
section of the hpa prohibits 
the a showing or exhibiting,in any horse show or horse exhibition,of any horse which is sore,b entering for the purpose of showing or exhibiting in any horse show or horse exhibition,any horse which is sore,c selling,auctioning,or offering for sale,in any horse sale or auction,any horse which is sore,and d allowing any activity described in clause a,b,or c respecting a horse which is sore by the owner of such horse.
clause d is the clause that governs the liability of owners.it states that the owner is liable for allowing any activity described in clause a,b,or c respecting a horse which is sore.the decisive question is what must the owner allow if he is to be liable.the usda reading of the statute is that the owner need only allow the entry of the horse in a show,the sale of the horse.the fact of the horse being sore is not a component of what the owner must allow.the owner need have no knowledge of the horse being sore,nor need the owner bear any fault with respect to the soring.if,for example,the owner allows a horse to be entered in an exhibition,then the owner is liable if it turns out that the horse was sore.we will refer to this interpretation as the interpretation.
the alternative reading of the statute is that the owner must allow not just the entry of a horse,but the entry of a sore horse.if that is the proper reading of the statute,there remains the issue of what it means to allow the entry of a sore horse.one could say that the owner allows the entry of a sore horse only if the owner knows the horse is sore.or one might say that an owner can allow such entry by failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the horse from being entered when sore.or one might interpret allow to require some other degree of responsibility by the owner.all such interpretations,however,would require some element of owner responsibility for the soring itself.we will refer to these interpretations as interpretations.mccloy argues for an interpretation.he contends that usda contrary construction of the statute is simply wrong.
when an agency charged with the administration of a statute consistently applies a reasonable construction of the statute in the course of formal adjudication,we ordinarily defer to that construction.see sec zandford,d consistent interpretation of b by sec in formal adjudication is entitled to deference if reasonable united states mead,d crawford usda,deferring to usda interpretation of.there can be no dispute that the usda is charged with administering the hpa,and that it has consistently interpreted d in the context of formal adjudication.but there is a circuit split regarding whether the usda construction of the hpa with respect to owner liability is reasonable.compare crawford usda,deferring to usda
