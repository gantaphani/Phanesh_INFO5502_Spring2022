these appeals relate to the continuing efforts by farmers to obtain relief from the discriminatory distribution of federal farm benefits by the united states department of agriculture usda.see,pigford glickman.this time the complaints were filed by female and hispanic farmers who alleged that since the usda has unlawfully discriminated against them in the administration of its farm benefit programs and failed to act on their administrative complaints in accordance with usda regulations.this court affirmed the denial of class action certification and the dismissal of the claims brought under the equal credit opportunity act ecoa.love johanns,garcia johanns.the question in this second interlocutory appeal is whether appellants claims are reviewable under the administrative procedure act apa.because appellants fail to show they lack an adequate remedy in a court,we affirm the dismissals of their apa claims and remand the cases to the district court.
the ecoa provides that it is unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant,with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of race,color,religion,national origin,sex or marital status,or age.a.the statute authorizes the recovery of actual damages from creditors,including the federal government,see id.e f,a,and a court may grant such equitable and declaratory relief as is necessary to enforce the ecoa,as well as reasonable attorney fees to applicants bringing a successful action.id.c d.claims under the ecoa must be filed within two years of the date of the occurrence of the violation.id.f.
usda regulations have long provided that applicants alleging discrimination by the usda in its direct benefit programs may file administrative complaints with the usda.see see also love connor,d,appellants allege,however,that for years the usda ignored discrimination complaints like theirs.indeed,in the usda publicly acknowledged that in the early it effectively dismantled its civil rights enforcement apparatus 
in response,congress enacted a special remedial statute in for applicants who had filed a nonemployment related complaint with the usda before july,that alleged discrimination occurring between january,and december.omnibus consolidated and emergency supplemental appropriations act of,e,stat.codified at note hereinafter section.the statute extended the ecoa statute of limitations until october,and provided that such eligible complainants could either file an ecoa action in federal court,pursuant to section a,or renew their administrative complaints and obtain a determination on the merits of their claim from the usda,pursuant to section b.subsection b of the statute required the usda to timely process renewed administrative complaints,to investigate the claims,and to issue merits determinations after a hearing on the record.subsections d and g provided that complainants denied administrative relief could seek de novo review in federal court.
appellants,nearly all of whom appear to have filed complaints with the usda before july,chose the first option on the eve of the october,deadline,they filed complaints in the federal district court here under the ecoa and the declaratory judgment act,a.their complaints also included claims under the apa they alleged that the usda had discriminated against them with respect to credit transactions and disaster benefits in violation of the ecoa,and also had systemically failed to investigate complaints of such discrimination in violation of usda regulations.in the district court only appellants ecoa credit transaction claims and the garcia appellants apa disaster benefit claims have survived the usda motion to dismiss.the district court also denied appellants motions for class certification on their remaining ecoa discrimination claims,and this court affirmed upon interlocutory review in.see love,garcia.following a remand of the apa claims,the district court reaffirmed its dismissal of those claims on the ground that section provided appellants an adequate remedy at law.see love connor,d order,garcia veneman,civ.the district court certified its interlocutory ruling,and this court granted appellants petition for leave to appeal pursuant to b.
the apa provides that a gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.in bowen massachusetts,d,the supreme court interpreted as precluding apa review where congress has otherwise provided a special and adequate review procedure.id.at.internal quotations omitted.an alternative remedy will not be adequate under if the remedy offers only doubtful and limited relief.id.at.so understood,this court has held that the alternative remedy need not provide relief identical to relief under the apa,so long as it offers relief of the same genre.el rio santa cruz neighborhood health ctr.dep t of health human.thus,for example,relief will be deemed adequate where a statute affords an opportunity for de novo review of the agency action.id.at.in such cases,the court has reasoned that congress did not intend to permit a litigant challenging an administrative denial to utilize simultaneously both the review provision and the apa.id.at quoting envtl.defense fund reilly,omission and alteration in original.relief also will be deemed adequate where there is a private cause of action against a third party otherwise subject to agency regulation.id.at.in evaluating the availability and adequacy of alternative remedies,however,the court must give the apa a hospitable interpretation such that only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.id.at quoting abbott labs.gardner,d see also bowen massachusetts,at.
appellants contend that the district court erred in two respects in holding that they could not bring a claim under the apa challenging the usda failure to investigate their civil rights complaints first,the district court misapplied bowen by disregarding record evidence that under section there was no real adequate alternative remedy in a court for their claims second,the district court mistakenly relied on this court precedents involving claims against an agency for failing to regulate wrongdoers,and therefore failed to follow circuit precedent that permits a plaintiff to bring an apa claim for the agency failure to follow its regulations in addition to a discrimination claim.appellants emphasize that their survival as farmers depends in significant part on their ability to obtain federal benefits authorized by congress to be administered by the usda,and that when the usda fails to comply with its regulations for handling and processing administrative complaints,the benefits systems envisioned by congress are thwarted and their efforts to survive as farmers are stymied.although this court has no occasion to doubt appellants claims of harm,their legal challenges to the dismissal of their apa claims are unpersuasive.
first,there is clear and convincing evidence that in enacting section congress did not intend for complainants who choose to proceed in the district court on their ecoa claims to pursue their claims under the apa simultaneously in the same lawsuit.in responding to the dilemma presented by the usda failure to investigate discrimination claims,congress resurrected claims and gave such complainants two options either file a complaint in the district court or renew their administrative complaint with the usda with subsequent judicial review if the usda denied relief.although appellants had the option first to renew their administrative complaints with the usda pursuant to section b,they chose not to do so.had appellants done so,the usda would have been obligated to process,investigate,and adjudicate appellants complaints of discrimination in a timely fashion and absent relief de novo judicial review would be available.having chosen instead to proceed directly to the district court pursuant to section a,appellants complaints sought declaratory and injunctive relief that the usda should have investigated their old,unrenewed ad
