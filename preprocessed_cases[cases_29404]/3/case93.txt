defendant,bernard ellis,appeals the district court denial of a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.defendant was convicted of manufacturing and possessing with intent to manufacture in excess of one hundred marijuana plants,in violation of a,pursuant to a guilty plea,on november,and sentenced on september,to a probation term of four years with a special condition of confinement in a community corrections center for eighteen months.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
defendant is a public health epidemiologist he has worked on a myriad of public health projects with numerous entities,including the national cancer institute and the centers for disease control,and as a consultant for approximately one hundred major tribal,state,federal governmental and private organizations.
defendant cultivated and processed marijuana in a small plot on his one hundred acre property,located at fly hollow road,santa fe,maury county,tennessee farm.on august,the governor task force on marijuana eradication conducted a search of defendant farm and discovered the marijuana cultivation.defendant was charged with manufacturing and possessing with intent to manufacture in excess of one hundred marijuana plants,in violation of a,in a one count felony information filed on august.on february,the government filed a complaint for forfeiture against defendant farm in a parallel civil in rem action.see united states fly hollow road,et,civ.defendant waived his right to a grand jury indictment.
defendant reported to the district court that,on his farm,he was work ing toward s a pick your own berries operation with blackberries,blueberries and raspberries.he grew marijuana in a number of small patches around the farm,but the total square footage would not have added up to a great deal because only a of an acre or less was used for growing marijuana.defendant had cultivated marijuana for to years at the time of the raid but had never sold marijuana.he maintains that he grew marijuana for medicinal purposes 
why were you growing marijuana,ellis 
i growing it for my own medicinal use and to provide to,at the time of raid,three other people.
and what were you doing with the marijuana 
again,both drawing and drying,processing it myself,and at the time providing it to two people who were in the last stages of cancer,and one person who was a late stage hiv patient.
any other categories of people that you have provided this marijuana to 
i have also provided to a person with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,and i think on two occasions people with other conditions,multiple sclerosis,there was another i think severe asthma patient who used it orally or drank it as a tea.
he reported that some of the people to whom he provided marijuana were using it with their physicians awareness.he personally used marijuana for medicinal purposes because he suffered from problems associated with fibromyalgia,and degenerative joint disease in his hips and spine.for its part,the government maintained that the argument that defendant was producing marijuana purely for medicinal purposes is belied by the amount of marijuana that he was growing.indeed,defendant marijuana cultivation appears to have been expanding 
i think you also indicated that when you initially started growing marijuana,that it was a fairly small operation,with or plants each year 
and that this operation had progressed over the years is that correct 
a.that i had over that year grown more than was usual and the year before had grown more than i usually grew.so for those two years i had grown more than was usual.
i think the year before,you had grown approximately plants is that correct 
i said close to a hundred.i thought i said under a hundred.
and this year there were plants that were taken by the officers when they came to your property is that right 
that the number that the laboratory has provided us.we have seen the plants,but that the number we been working with.
the government affirms that two bags of marijuana,scales,three rifles and two other firearms,which defendant claimed were used for hunting,target practice and personal protection,and in cash,which he claimed to have saved over a two year period,were seized during the search of the farm.
although the government avers that defendant was growing a substantial amount of marijuana,the exact amount of marijuana seized from the farm is unclear.it appears that the government reported several different marijuana plant counts and weights.an initial report indicated that five hundred marijuana plants were seized from the farm.the government amended this submission to clarify that a total of marijuana plants were taken from the farm,later,the government indicated that four hundred marijuana plants were seized.the plant weight is similarly unclear and dropped from one hundred pounds to pounds.excluding unusable parts of the plant like root balls,dirt,stems and stalks,defendant estimated that the usable plant weight was between seven and eight pounds.
on august,the parties signed a plea agreement.in pertinent part,the plea agreement provides that 
the defendant will enter a plea of guilty to court one of the information and will agree to the forfeiture count.count one will charge a violation of a of manufacturing in excess of marijuana plants.the parties agree that the total number of marijuana plants is and that their weight is a total of pounds or kilograms.the government will take no position on whether the guns seized during the execution of the consensual search had any relationship to the manufacturing of the marijuana.the forfeiture count will seek the forfeiture of cash.
the defendant agrees to the criminal,civil and administrative forfeiture of any and all funds,proceeds or assets that have been acquired in whole or in part from funds received,generated,derived from,or used in furtherance of criminal activity.such forfeiture shall include cash to be paid to the government prior to the date of the sentencing.
the defendant agrees to forfeit the guns seized during the execution of the consensual search of his property.the parties agree that no further action is necessary to accomplish the forfeiture of these guns.
no additional promises,agreements or conditions have been entered into other than those set forth in this letter and none will be entered into unless in writing and signed by all.
emphasis added.in the second paragraph,the plea agreement expressly stipulates a cash forfeiture.however,subsequent broader language implies that the government may seek the forfeiture of other funds,proceeds or assets.id.the plea agreement does not specifically reference defendant farm.on november,the court held a hearing at which defendant entered a guilty plea.
by letter dated december,the government provided defendant with a proposed decree of forfeiture.in the proposed decree,the government agrees to accept in settlement of the civil forfeiture case and will provide the release of lis pendens upon receipt of.in pertinent part,the government proposed forfeiture decree provides that 
bernard ellis,agrees to pay the united states two hundred twelve thousand five hundred in settlement of this case.the shall be comprised of the following 
that was seized from the defendant property on august,by the governor task force on marijuana eradication.
b.a cashier check or money order made payable to the united states marshals service asset forfeiture fund in the amount of.
failure to submit aforementioned check or money order by february,will result in the nullification of this order.
upon payment and in consideration for the settlement,plaintiff united states of america shall furnish a release of the lis pendens recorded in the maury county register of deeds office against the defendant property.the united states will provide the release of lis pendens upon receipt of the,and claimant ellis shall be responsible for the recording of the release of lis pendens.
defendant did not execute the proposed forfeiture decree.
after entering the guilty plea,defendant could not come up with the money he agreed to forfeit under the plea agreement.on may,more than six months after entering the guilty plea,defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea arguing that he simply could not produce the cash forfeiture.on august,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion.on february,the district court denied the motion absent corroborative evidence of the defendant financial limitations.
on february,defendant provided the district court with supplemental information regarding his financial status.defendant argued that,after entering his guilty plea,his cousin,who was supposed to loan him the forfeiture money,told him that he would not be able to do so.defendant submitted several affidavits from family members indicating that they could not provide a loan.on september,the district court ruled that the supplemental affidavits were insufficient to set aside the defendant plea and directed that the case proceed to sentencing.
on september,the district court held a sentencing hearing.defendant was sentenced to a probation term of four years with a special condition of confinement in a community corrections center for eighteen months.moreover,since nothing in the plea agreement indicated that the forfeiture provision was contingent upon defendant being able to obtain a loan in order to pay the cash forfeiture,the government indicated that it would seek forfeiture of defendant farm via the pending parallel civil in rem forfeiture action.
defendant appeals the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.he contends that he was not aware that the farm itself was at risk for being lost,because the plea agreement did not contain any language permitting the government to take the farm if he did not come up with the money.for its part,the government contends that defendant knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily entered the plea,and has failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason for withdrawing his guilty plea.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.united states denkins,cir united states mader,cir united states pluta,cir.abuse of discretion results when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.united states heavrin,cir.this court may also find an abuse of discretion if the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.united states schreane,cir quotation and citation omitted.
defendant motion to withdraw the guilty plea 
a plea bargain is contractual in nature and subject to standards.united states mandell,cir quotation and citation omitted united states herrera,cir.a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea and bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea.mader,at united states bazzi,cir.when a defendant has entered a knowing and voluntary plea of guilty at a hearing at which he acknowledged committing the crime,the occasion for setting aside a guilty plea should seldom arise.united states morrison,cir quotation and citation omitted.the withdrawal of a guilty plea is inherently in derogation of the public interest in finality and the orderly administration of justice.united states horne.
a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea after the court accepts the plea,but before it imposes sentence if the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.d b.this rule is designed to allow a hastily entered plea made with unsure heart and confused mind to be undone,not to allow a defendant to make a tactical decision to enter a plea,wait several weeks,and then obtain a withdrawal if he believes he made a bad choice in pleading guilty.united states alexander,cir quotation and citation omitted united states bashara,cir pluta,at.withdrawal of a plea is appropriate where there is a real confusion or misunderstanding of the terms of the agreement.see,mandell,at united states wells,cir.
this court considers a number of factors to determine whether defendant meets the burden of proving that the withdrawal of his guilty plea is for a fair and just reason,including 
the amount of time that elapsed between the plea and the motion to withdraw it 
the presence or absence of a valid reason for the failure to move for withdrawal earlier in the proceedings whether the defendant has asserted or maintained his innocence the circumstances underlying the entry of the guilty plea the defendant nature and background the degree to which the defendant has had prior experience with the criminal justice system and potential prejudice to the government if the motion to withdraw is granted.
bashara,at pluta,at.the factors listed are a general,list and no one factor is controlling.bazzi,at.in the instant case,the application of these factors demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion and supports an affirmance of the district court denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.each factor will be discussed in turn.
the amount of time that elapsed between the guilty plea and the motion to withdraw the plea 
the first factor the court considers to determine whether defendant motion to withdraw the guilty plea is for a fair and just reason,is the amount of time that elapsed between the guilty plea and the motion to withdraw the plea.bashara,at.the shorter the delay,the more likely a motion to withdraw will be granted,and a defendant reasons for filing such a motion will be more closely scrutinized when he has delayed his motion for a substantial length of time.united states baez,cir.in the instant case,the government extended a plea offer to defendant on august.defendant did not enter a guilty plea until november.defendant therefore had three months to consider the plea offer and to decide whether he would enter into the plea agreement.on may,more than six months after he entered the guilty plea,defendant filed a motion to withdraw the plea.
this court has denied motions to withdraw guilty pleas where the amount of time that elapsed between the guilty plea and the motion to withdraw the plea was shorter than six months.see,pluta,at four month delay united states valdez,cir unjustified delay,alone,supported the court denial of a motion to withdraw united states durham,cir the strongest factor supporting the district court denial of durham motion is the length of time between durham plea and the filing of his motion to withdraw.durham waited approximately days to file his motion after entering his guilty plea.baez,at day delay united states goldberg,cir day delay united states spencer,cir five week delay.in the instant case,the court finds that the prolonged delay weighs heavily against defendant and supports an affirmance of the district court denial of the motion.
the presence of a valid reason for failing to move for withdrawal earlier 
the second factor the court considers to determine whether defendant motion to withdraw is for a fair and just reason is the presence of a valid reason for the failing to move for withdrawal earlier in the proceedings.bashara,at.defendant argues that the motion to withdraw should have been granted because a it was impossible for him to perform his part of the plea agreement b the provisions of the plea agreement are ambiguous and c the plea agreement purpose was frustrated.for its part,the government contends that defendant entered into the plea agreement knowingly,intelligently,voluntarily and with the advice of competent counsel.
impossibility of performance 
defendant argues that impossibility of performance should discharge the plea agreement.he contends that it became impossible for him to perform his part of the agreement because his family could not lend him money to satisfy the cash forfeiture.he maintains that he filed the withdrawal motion as soon as he learned that he was not able to borrow the money.however,none of the affidavits defendant filed indicate any dates on which he tried to obtain loans or dates on which his family members refused to loan the money.
