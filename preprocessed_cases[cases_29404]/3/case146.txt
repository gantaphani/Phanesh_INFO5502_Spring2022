plaintiffs david hudson and donna hudson the hudsons entered into a contract to raise chickens for conagra poultry company conagra.disputes eventually arose between the parties,which culminated in conagra cancellation of the contract and the hudsons decision to file for arbitration of their claims.following a decision by an arbitration panel,the hudsons filed tort claims against conagra in state court.conagra removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,and the district court compelled arbitration of the hudsons tort claims against conagra.the arbitration panel found that the hudsons tort claims were barred by res judicata and therefore granted conagra motion for summary disposition.the hudsons moved to vacate,modify,or correct the arbitration order,and the district court denied the motion.the hudsons appeal the district court orders compelling arbitration and denying their motion to vacate,modify,or correct the award.we affirm.
background 
the hudsons own and operate a farm in claiborne parish,louisiana.conagra had poultry processing plants in nearby arcadia,louisiana,and el dorado,arkansas.conagra representatives approached the hudsons in to form a business arrangement.conagra and the hudsons entered into an agreement whereby conagra would deliver chicks to the hudsons,the hudsons would feed and raise the chicks to adult size,and conagra would return later to collect the birds.the hudsons constructed chicken houses suitable for performance under the agreement.the parties maintained their relationship for several years under a series of contracts,each lasting the duration of one delivery of chicks to one of adult chickens.the parties signed the agreement at issue in this case the broiler grower agreement or bga in.conagra drafted the contract.
the bga contained an arbitration clause governing a ll claims arising out of or relating in any way to the negotiation,execution,interpretation,and performance of the contract.it also contained a separate provision stating that t he laws of arkansas shall exclusively apply and govern this agreement.in addition,the bga set forth different rates of compensation depending upon whether the hudsons chose to retrofit their chicken houses to meet new conagra specifications.this compensation provision was absent from prior agreements between the parties,and conagra alleges that it was a uniform addition in its contracts with other growers that year.
the hudsons objected to retrofitting their houses and to the lower compensation for chickens raised in facilities that were not retrofitted,which they said placed them at a competitive disadvantage.numerous disputes followed.the hudsons alleged that conagra was intentionally tardy in picking up the birds,while conagra alleged that hudson brandished a firearm and threatened conagra associates when they visited the farm.citing this latter incident,conagra terminated the bga on january.
six months later,the hudsons filed a demand for arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause of the bga.the hudsons claimed that conagra breached the contract in several respects,including untimely of the chickens,institution of the compensation system which,according to the hudsons,conflicted with other compensation provisions of the bga,and the ultimate termination of the bga.an arbitration panel ruled in favor of conagra on all grounds in september of.the hudsons do not appeal any issues relating to the disposition of their claims.
on january,the hudsons brought tort claims in arkansas state court alleging that several of conagra actions during the course of their business relationship violated the arkansas deceptive trade practices act.ann.et.conagra removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of arkansas and moved to compel arbitration,citing the arbitration provision of the bga.the district court granted the motion,finding that the language of the parties arbitration provision encompassed the hudsons tort claims.
the parties proceeded to a second arbitration.on january,a second arbitration panel granted conagra motion for summary disposition on the basis of res judicata.the hudsons moved the district court to vacate,modify,or correct the second arbitration award,arguing that the panel in this second arbitration improperly refused to hear evidence of their tort claims,that the claims should not have been subjected to arbitration,and that the arbitrators erred in applying res judicata to bar the claims.the district court denied their motion.the hudsons appeal that denial,as well as the district court prior grant of conagra motion to compel arbitration.
ii.discussion 
the hudsons raise two primary issues on appeal.first,they argue that the district court erred in compelling arbitration of their tort claims because w ritten agreements to arbitrate have no application to tort matters under the arkansas uniform arbitration act.terminix int l stabbs,ann.b.second,the hudsons argue that the district court erred by failing to modify the second arbitration panel finding that res judicata precluded the tort claims.we address these issues in turn.
arbitrability of the hudsons tort claims 
we review a district court interpretation of a contractual arbitration provision de novo.kelly golden,cir.the federal arbitration act governs contracts involving interstate commerce.terminix,dobson,d.under the federal arbitration act,we generally construe broad language in a contractual arbitration provision to include tort claims arising from the contractual relationship,and we compel arbitration of such claims.see cd partners grizzle,cir broadly worded arbitration clauses such as the ones at issue here are generally construed to cover tort suits arising from the same set of operative facts covered by a contract between the parties to the agreement.nevertheless,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.howsam dean witter reynolds,d quoting steelworkers warrior gulf nav,d internal marks omitted.
when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.here,the parties decided that t he laws of arkansas shall exclusively apply and govern this agreement.arkansas courts look to the parties intent,as expressed in their agreement,to determine the question of arbitrability,and,under arkansas law,any doubts and ambiguities must be resolved in favor of arbitration.pest,langer,wl,slip op.at.
there is no question that the bga was a contract involving interstate commerce and contained an arbitration provision,and it is therefore governed by the federal arbitration act.further,there is no question that the hudsons tort claims fall within the language of the arbitration provision of the bga,which calls for arbitration of a ll claims relating in any way to performance of the contract.on its face,the arbitration provision is both broad and unambiguous.therefore,absent some indication that the parties intended to limit the scope of arbitrable matters more narrowly than the bare language of the arbitration provision suggests,we would find that the district court was correct in compelling arbitration.see pest,at,wl,slip op.at finding,under arkansas law,that a broad arbitration provision showed the clear intent of the parties to arbitrate all claims arising from their contract,including tort claims.
we first turn to the language of the bga as a whole to determine whether there is any indication of an intent to narrow the scope of the arbitration provision.initially,we note that nothing in the bga explicitly excludes tort claims from the reach of the broadly worded arbitration provision indeed,there is no language that explicitly modifies the scope of arbitrable matters at all,aside from the broad language of the arbitration provision itself.the bga provision,however,warrants further discussion relating to the parties intent.because contractual arbitration provisions do not apply to tort claims under the arkansas uniform arbit
