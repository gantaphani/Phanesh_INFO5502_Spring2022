richard bot and phyllis bot appeal from the tax court decision upholding the internal revenue service assessment of tax on the payments the bots received from the minnesota corn processors cooperative association mcp in and.the bots argue that the tax court erred in finding that they earned the payments from the carrying on of a trade or business.we agree with the tax court and affirm its judgment.
the internal revenue code imposes tax on the income earned by an individual,which is a corollary to the federal insurance contributions act,or fica,tax paid by employers and employees to fund social security benefits.the sole issue in this case is whether the payments that the bots received from mcp were derived from a trade or business carried on by the bots,and thus were subject to tax,or if the payments represented investment income not subject to tax.
richard and phyllis bot are a married couple who filed joint tax returns for and,the years at issue in this case.the bots are retired farmers who own acres of farmland in minnesota that they have sharecropped with two of their sons since,when the bots retired from daily farming activities.the crop share agreement effective for the years at issue provided that the bots were entitled to of the crops grown on the farm.
the bots were members of mcp at all times relevant to this appeal.they bought common stock in mcp in,which stock can only be held by producers of agricultural products,including lessors of land who receive part of the crops produced on their land as rent.appellants app.at,art.v.in various years since,they also entered into numerous uniform marketing agreements uma with mcp which obligated the bots to supply to mcp one bushel of corn for each equity unit the bots owned.the bots purchased the equity units at an average cost of per unit.the uma required mcp to market and process the corn supplied under the umas into corn products to sell.the umas had a rolling term,such that after the first year,the agreement was automatically renewed for an additional year,and the uma maintained its term.upon notice of termination,the grower was still obligated to supply corn for a period of four years following his or her notice of termination.id.at.pursuant to a supplement to the uma,the bots agreed to a pro rata change in the number of bushels they were obligated to supply depending on mcp total corn needs.under the uma,the grower appoints and designates the cooperative to act as grower sole agent in the sale and marketing of the corn committed to the cooperative under this agreement.id.at.members satisfied their obligation to supply corn to mcp with corn grown by the member,corn purchased by the member on the open market,or through mcp option pool corn,which is corn mcp buys on the open market and makes available to members to use to meet their delivery obligations.if option pool corn was used,the grower paid mcp per bushel as a service fee and mcp retained title to the corn.regardless of the source of the corn,the grower warranted in the uma that he or she was the producer or owner of the corn.id.at.
mcp paid the members under the uma as follows an initial payment of at least of the loan value of the pool corn on delivery storage and interest fees for corn required to be delivered after october a payment,which is such payment from mcp net operating proceeds which will further compensate grower for grower corn and still allow mcp to retain its financial integrity appellants app.at and patronage dividends.because the bots used only option pool corn to meet their uma obligations,the only payments they received from mcp were the payments and the separately determined patronage dividends.the bots reported the patronage dividends on form,farm rental income and expenses,along with the income earned under the crop share agreement with their sons,which the internal revenue service irs does not dispute.only the payments received by the bots from mcp are at issue in this case.
as indicated above,the bots entered the first uma in and always satisfied their obligation to supply corn to mcp with option pool corn.in,the bots held active equity units,for which they had paid.in,the bots held active units,at a total cost of.they delivered bushels in of the number of their equity units and bushels in of the number of their equity units from mcp option pool corn.they received and in and,respectively,as payments.they reported those receipts as gross proceeds from the sale of capital assets on schedule d of their and tax returns.they reported their basis in the assets as in and in.the bases were derived from the handling fee paid to mcp to use the option pool corn to meet their obligations in and in plus payments the bots made to their sons for their half of the seed,fertilizer,and weed spray as required by the crop share agreement in and in the bots separately reported their income from the crop share agreement on form farm rental income and expense,which income is not at issue in this appeal.
on audit,the irs determined that the bots were in the trade or business of producing,marketing,processing,and selling corn and that the payments should be reported on schedule c instead of schedule d,thus subjecting the payments,less any allowable deductions,to tax.the irs simply moved the net income from schedule d to schedule c,allowing the bots to deduct the claimed bases for each year as expenses against the payments received to arrive at net income subject to tax.
upon appeal of the assessment,the bots argued to the tax court that the payments represented investment income on their shares held in the mcp cooperative,not income from a trade or business subject to tax.the tax court determined that the bots activities of regularly and continuously acquiring and selling corn and corn products through the mcp with the intent of making a profit qualified as engaging in the trade or business of dealing and processing corn,even though they retired from daily farming activities in.the court also relied on the unique nature of the relationship between a cooperative and its members to find that the bots engaged in the trade of dealing in corn through mcp acting as their agent.the court found a direct nexus between the bots trade of dealing corn and the payments because the payments were distributed based on the number of bushels of corn delivered to mcp by the bots.the bots appeal.
we review the tax court legal conclusions de novo and its for clear error.the bots have the burden of establishing that the irs characterization of the payments as income is erroneous.see campbell comm r,cir,cert.denied,d.
the internal revenue code imposes tax on the net earnings from derived by an individual.a,b.the term net earnings from is defined as the gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by such individual,less the deductions allowed.a.the term trade or business is defined only by reference to relating to trade or business expenses,see c,but is not otherwise defined in either section or section.income is determined by the source of the income,not the taxpayer status at the time the income is realized.schelble comm r,cir internal quotations omitted.the derived from requirement necessitates a nexus between the income and the trade or business actually carried on by the taxpayer.that is,the trade or business activity must give rise to the income.milligan comm r,cir.treasury regulations provide that the trade or business must be carried on by the individual,either personally or through agents or employees.reg.a b.thus,the payments are income if they are derived from a trade or business carried on by the bots or their agents.the tax provisions are broadly construed to favor treatment of income as earnings from.see braddock comm r,wl hornaday comm r,wl see also comm r groetzinger,d discussing the meaning of a trade or business and concluding that the statutory words are broad and comprehensive.
on their tax returns,the bots claimed that the payments constituted gain from the sale of capital assets.they have abandoned that theory on appeal and argue that the payments were the result of passive investment,similar to
