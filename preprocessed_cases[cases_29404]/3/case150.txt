after the lexington insurance company declined to cover expenses incurred by its policyholder offutt company due to a switchgear failure,offutt brought this declaratory judgment and breach of contract action.the district court granted offutt motion for summary judgment and awarded it attorney fees,and lexington appeals.we affirm.
offutt company is a minnesota corporation whose principal place of business in is fargo,north dakota.it owns properties in various states,including a acre parcel of farmland near the columbia river in morrow county,oregon.because offutt manages this property through threemile canyon farms,llc,a wholly owned subsidiary,the property is referred to as threemile.offutt leases to various third party tenants on a long term basis.the tenants use the land to grow crops such as potatoes,alfalfa,onions,wheat,and corn which require irrigation to sustain them.under the leases offutt has entered into with its tenants,it is obligated to provide them with water between march and october of every year and must indemnify them against all liabilities,losses,and damage incurred due to any failure to satisfy its obligations as lessor.
on june,there was a switchgear failure at a water pumping station at threemile.that pumping station takes water from the columbia river and directs it to the farmland for crop irrigation and other purposes.the switchgear controlled the supply of electricity to the pump,and its failure cut pumping capacity in half.jimmy brewer,the farm manager at threemile,testified in his deposition that if the failure had not been addressed immediately,crops would have died and offutt would have faced liability claims from its tenants.there is also evidence that without irrigation offutt would have been liable to governmental agencies for wind erosion and airborne dust.
offutt determined within the hour period following the switchgear failure that permanent replacement of the switchgear would take weeks or even months.in order to maintain the pumping station full capacity in the meantime,offutt manager rented portable generators and bought diesel fuel to supply them.jimmy brewer testified that these measures were taken to prevent crop loss and liabilities to tenants.offutt spent on the generators,fuel,and related labor and freight charges.
offutt had purchased insurance for threemile from lexington,a delaware corporation.its policy covered all risk of direct physical loss or damage to all real and personal property at threemile which offutt owned,used,leased,or intended for use.the policy provided that in the event of loss or damage,lexington would consider offutt the sole and unconditional owner of covered property,notwithstanding any contracts or leases to the contrary.in addition to physical loss or damage,the policy insured against losses resulting from business interruptions and extra expenses caused by property damage.under its expediting expense clause,the policy covered the reasonable extra cost of temporary repair replacement expediting the repair replacement of damaged property insured hereunder.l oss or damage to g rowing crops was specifically excluded from coverage.coverage extended from august,to august.
after the switchgear failure caused offutt to incur expenses,it submitted a claim to lexington for its costs in renting generators and purchasing fuel as well as in permanently replacing the failed switchgear with a new one.lexington paid offutt to indemnify it for its costs in permanently replacing the switchgear,but it declined to cover the expenses related to the generators and diesel fuel.lexington asserted that these expenses were not covered under the policy because they had been incurred to save the crops growing at threemile.offutt then brought this case in the district of north dakota.its complaint sought declaratory relief and alleged breach of the insurance contract and bad faith denial of coverage.after discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.
the district court,applying the law of north dakota concluded that the contract expediting expense clause allowed for a temporary replacement for damaged property and that the fuel and generator rental costs were covered.the district court also concluded that the policy contemplated that covered property such as the switchgear had value for the function it performed in addition to its value as a piece of property.the policy provision on expediting expenses therefore applied to both the cost of temporarily replacing the switchgear function and the cost of permanently replacing it.because the rented generators and purchased fuel replaced the switchgear function of powering the water pump,the expediting expense clause covered the costs incurred in obtaining them.the district court decided that the policy growing crops exclusion did not apply because it barred coverage for physical loss or damage to crops,not for costs incurred to replace covered property in order to save or protect crops.the court granted declaratory relief and summary judgment to offutt on the contract.it also granted summary judgment to lexington on offutt claim of bad faith on the theory that the question of coverage was reasonably debatable.offutt has not appealed that ruling,and the bad faith claim is not at issue on this appeal.
offutt then moved for an award of attorney fees,citing north dakota case law which allows the insured to recover attorney fees in a declaratory judgment action between the insurer and insured.lexington opposed the motion,arguing that the district court should not use its discretion to grant fees,pointing out that the insurance policy did not provide for recovery of attorney fees and that lexington good faith weighed against a fee award.the district court concluded that the north dakota supreme court cases in which the insured was awarded attorney fees were indistinguishable from the present case and that fees should be awarded.it further determined that offutt should not receive fees for time spent on its unsuccessful bad faith claim.it therefore awarded fees in the amount of,representing the time offutt attorneys had spent on the case other than on the bad faith claim.
lexington now appeals the grant of summary judgment and the award of attorney fees.it argues that the district court erred in concluding that the policy covered the generator and fuel costs which offutt incurred.it claims the expediting expense clause only covered temporary replacement of the damaged switchgear with another.further,the expenses are excluded from coverage because the policy does not cover loss or damage to growing crops or liabilities incurred to third parties.lexington also argues that the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to offutt since its denial of coverage had a reasonable basis.it contends in addition that offutt declaratory judgment action is only piggybacked on its breach of contract claim which would not allow recovery of fees.
offutt responds that it does not seek recovery for damage to growing crops,but rather for its expenses in replacing covered property.it contends that the plain language of the growing crops exclusion and the expediting expense clause demonstrate that the generator and fuel costs are not excluded but covered by the policy,asserting that its motive to avoid crop loss and liability to third parties is irrelevant.it also argues that the award of attorney fees was proper under north dakota law.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party summary judgment is proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.allianz ins.of can.sanftleben,cir.we also review de novo a district court interpretation of an insurance contract.id.
lexington maintains that the district court erred in its grant of summary judgment to offutt.its first argument is that the expenses offutt incurred by renting generators and purchasing fuel are not covered by the expediting expense clause.it does not argue that the claimed expenses are unreasonable,but rather that they do not qualify as expediting expe
