in,swift entered into nearly identical contracts with the hog producers for the supply of hogs.under the contract,swift would pay the hog producers a base price,which was equal to the market price,except that the base price could not be less than per pounds of live animal weight.if the market price was below,swift would pay the hog producers and debit the hog producers adjustment account for the difference.when the contract term ended,each hog producer had a debit balance in his account.section of the contract states that if,at the termination of this agreement,there is a debit balance in the adjustment account,seller shall pay to buyer a cash amount equal to such debit balance.emphasis added.the issue raised by swift claim is whether the hog producers were required to pay swift the debit balance at the expiration of the contract.
the parties dispute whether the expiration of the contract is the same as the termination of the agreement.swift argues that termination in section simply means end,whether by natural expiration or by some affirmative act.the hog producers argue that termination refers only to an affirmative is,something other than natural expiration.the hog producers derive this definition from the use of the word terminated in section of the contract,which states t his contract shall continue and remain in full force and effect through december,unless otherwise extended by the parties hereto or unless terminated in accordance with the terms hereof.emphasis added.the parties agree that terminated in accordance with the terms hereof in section refers to sections and of the contract,which define the termination rights of the parties as the right to terminate the contract in the event of a default.because section distinguishes between the natural expiration of the contract and an earlier end by default,and uses a form of the word terminate to refer only to the latter,the hog producers argue that termination in section must have the same meaning.
the district court agreed with the hog producers.the court noted that the dictionary definition of termination includes both an end by natural expiration and an end by some affirmative act,but that in this case the plain and clear language of the contract,read as a whole and providing full effect to all provisions,limits termination to an affirmative act by a party,precipitated by the other party default.swift,wl,at.because neither party had exercised its termination rights under the contract,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the hog producers.
we conclude,however,that the agreement is ambiguous,and that swift claim for breach of contract can not be resolved as a matter of law.everyone agrees that the plain meaning of termination does not resolve the dispute over section.termination can be the act of ending something,or the end of something in time or existence.black law dictionary ed.moving beyond the meaning of that word in isolation,swift and the hog producers make several arguments,based on the text and purpose of the contract,that their interpretation is correct as a matter of law.after considering these conflicting arguments,however,we conclude that the language is reasonably susceptible to either interpretation.
both parties rely on additional textual material to support their positions.as noted,the hog producers point to the use of terminated in section,which refers exclusively to an act of termination,and argue that when a derivative use of the word terminate appears in section,it must also refer to an act of termination.on the other hand,swift argues that because section uses the definite article if,at the termination of this agreement it unambiguously demonstrates that termination in this context is not merely a possible contingency as with a default or other affirmative act,but an event that the parties intend definitely to occur as with expiration.each argument tends to support the interpretation favored by the party that advances it,but neither is conclusive.absent countervailing textual evidence,each party position,standing alone,could well be dispositive.but when they are pitted against each other,the textual cues conflict.the parties simply have signed an agreement that is not clear on its face.
swift argues that termination must refer to an end,whether by an affirmative act or by natural expiration,because the hog producers narrower interpretation would lead to absurd results.swift argues that the purpose of the adjustment account is to protect the hog producers from market volatility.the adjustment account,swift contends,allows the hog producers to level their income over time,with the adjustment account acting as a bearing loan.therefore,they say,if there is a balance in the adjustment account at the end of the contract,the hog producers must repay the loan.
the hog producers,to support their narrower interpretation,argue that section is a penalty provision,which was meant to punish the hog producers if they defaulted and swift exercised its termination rights.this interpretation faces some challenge in explaining why section also applies in the case of a default by swift,because it seems strange for the agreement to penalize a hog producer who terminates the contract after the hog buyer defaults.but it is not necessarily unreasonable to conclude that the provision was adopted because the parties were concerned with defaults by hog producers,not with defaults by swift,and that swift negotiated the agreement to discourage hog producers from exercising their termination rights in the event of a default by swift.a jury may well find this interpretation less likely than swift,but given the ambiguous text,we are not prepared to say it is unacceptable as a matter of law.
because the agreement use of termination is ambiguous,the interpretation of the contract becomes a question of fact,and summary judgment is inappropriate unless the evidence of the parties intent is conclusive.donnay,at.each party has submitted extrinsic evidence in support of its interpretation.ed brems,a former swift who participated in the drafting and signing of the contracts,submitted an affidavit in which he stated that swift intended that the contracts might terminate due to the natural expiration of its term or through an act of termination.on the other hand,hog producers stan turbes,william johnson,and steven elias,a shareholder and officer of elias farms,submitted affidavits claiming that when they entered into the contract,they understood that they would not pay the balance in the adjustment account unless the contract was terminated for default.
