in levine conner,d,the united states district court for the northern district of california district court determined that,while the plain meaning of the word livestock as used in the hmsa of is ambiguous,congressional intent behind the term was clear and consistent with the interpretation adopted by the usda.because we conclude that levine can not satisfy the redressability prong of article iii standing,we vacate that decision and remand to the district court so that it can dismiss the action.
background 
statutory background 
in,congress passed the hmsa of.see,stat.codified as amended at.that legislation mandated and continues to mandate that the slaughtering of livestock and the handling of livestock in connection with slaughter shall be carried out only by humane methods.it also authorized and directed the secretary to designate humane methods of slaughter conforming to the policy stated in this chapter for each species of livestock.id.at b.
when enacted,section set forth two methods of slaughtering and handling as humane 
a in the case of cattle,calves,horses,mules,sheep,swine,and other livestock,all animals are rendered insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical,chemical or other means that is rapid and effective,before being shackled,hoisted,thrown,cast,or cut or 
b by slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument.
id.emphasis added.congress provided an enforcement provision,but only in the form of generally prohibiting the federal government from purchasing livestock products where the animals were slaughtered by methods other than those designated and approved by the secretary.see,stat,codified at repealed the following year,usda prescribed humane slaughter methods for those species expressly identified in the statute in addition to goats see,to be codified at pt.
the hmsa of did not define the terms livestock or other livestock.congressional debate revealed views favoring both interpretations advanced that would include chickens,turkeys and other domestic fowl within its expanse and one that would preclude such inclusiveness.see,cong.rec.numerous versions of the legislation were advanced,some specifically including the term poultry and some including the one eventually adopted which excluded use of that specific term.see,cong.rec,sec.g,cong.one provision now repealed of the hmsa of itself separately referred to livestock growers and the poultry industry in connection with the formation of an advisory committee designed to consult with the secretary and usda officials in the course of carrying out the mandates set forth elsewhere in the legislation.see,stat,codified at repealed.in addition,in the prior year,the same congress had passed the poultry products inspection act ppia which,among other things,gave usda authority to inspect poultry producers for compliance with health and sanitary requirements,required inspection of poultry after slaughter,established labeling requirements for poultry products,and allowed for withdrawal of inspections for noncompliance and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the sale of adulterated products.see.
in,in legislation also termed a humane methods of slaughter act hmsa of,congress repealed along with certain other sections the only enforcement provision contained within the hmsa of,the prohibition on federal government purchases of inhumanely slaughtered livestock products previously found in,and,at the same time,incorporated humane slaughter provisions into the federal meat inspection act fmia,which had originally been enacted in.see,stat.unlike the hmsa of,however,the fmia imposed inspection requirements only for cattle,sheep,swine,goats,horses,mules,and other equines.id,stat.at see also a.as a result,if,upon inspection of the slaughtering of those animals,the slaughtering practices were not in accord with those established pursuant to the promulgated regulations,the usda could suspend mandatory inspection in effect cutting off those slaughterhouses from the commercial marketplace and the consuming public,and could impose criminal penalties.see b.usda then issued regulations implementing the amendments,which replaced the regulations issued pursuant to the hmsa of and covered only those animals listed in the fmia.see.june.nevertheless,in enacting the hmsa of,congress did not repeal those provisions of the hmsa of a,b which set forth the specific list of species for purposes of that earlier statute,included the terms other livestock and livestock,and authorized and directed the secretary to designate compliant methods of slaughter.
in,congress deleted the specific list of animals from the fmia and replaced it with the term amenable species.see agriculture,rural development,food and drug administration,and related agencies appropriations act,title vii,stat.amenable species was defined to include those species subject to the provisions of this chapter on the day before november,as well as any additional species of livestock that the secretary considers appropriate.w 
history of usda position 
in the same month that congress passed the hmsa of,usda itself gave some indication that it considered c hicken eggs,commercial broilers,chickens,and turkeys as l ivestock and livestock products.see changes in farm production and efficiency,usda statistical bulletin,at.in,however,regulations were issued which defined livestock products for purposes of the hmsa of to mean any article intended for or capable of being used as food for either human or animals which is derived from slaughtered cattle,calves,horses,mules,sheep,swine,or goats,and specifying further that the term do es not include poultry.usda reiterated that position in in response to inquiries as to whether any humane slaughtering requirements covered chickens following the amendments see.on september,usda food safety and inspection service issued a federal register notice the notice entitled treatment of live poultry before slaughter.the notice indicated that it was in response to considerable congressional and public interest in the humane treatment of animals,including poultry.id.in the notice,the usda announced that t he hmsa of requires that humane methods be used for handling and slaughtering livestock but does not include comparable provisions concerning the handling and slaughter of poultry.id.at citation omitted.while it remind ed all poultry slaughter establishments that live poultry must be handled in a manner that is consistent with good commercial practices,which means they should be treated humanely and that compliance with the ppia incidentally promoted humane slaughter,it also indicated that there is no specific federal humane handling and slaughter statute for poultry.id.at.
procedural history 
levine filed suit on november,claiming that inhumane methods of poultry slaughter increased the risk of illnesses to the plaintiff consumers and health and safety dangers plus aesthetic injury to the plaintiff poultry workers.in the operative second amended complaint sac,levine asserted that,in issuing the notice,usda had violated the hmsa of,abused its discretion,and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the administrative procedure act apa.in the sac request for relief,levine sought an order declaring usda decision to exclude chickens,turkeys,and other poultry species from the protections provided by the humane methods of slaughter act of to be not in accordance with the hmsa of and the apa declaring unlawful and setting aside usda september,federal register notice containing the agency policy statement that the humane methods of slaughter act of does not require humane handling and slaughter for poultry and enjoining usda from excluding chickens,turkeys,and other poultry species from the protections provided by the humane methods of slaughter act of 
on september,the district court denied usda motion to dismiss,concluding that levine had standing because the alleged injuries were redressable,and that the notice constituted final agency action and thus was subject to judicial review.on february,in connection with for summary judgment,the district court ruled in usda favor on the merits pursuant to an analysis under chevron,natural res.def.council,d.the district court entered a judgment dismissing the action that same day.

this court may affirm on any ground supported by the record.see pritikin dep t of energy,cir,cert.denied,d.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,before addressing the substantive merits of the case,usda resurrected its contention that levine lacked article iii standing.usda did not file a,but it need not have done so in order to argue that issue here.see biggs best,best krieger,it is our obligation to be sure that standing exists quoting san francisco drydock,dalton,cir.
levine had the burden below of establishing the three elements of article iii standing that plaintiffs had suffered an injury in fact that was concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and that the injury was likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.see salmon spawning recovery alliance gutierrez,cir see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d defenders of wildlife.on appeal,usda challenges only the district court redressability determination.here,a key to assessing the redressability issue is the fact that the only enforcement mechanism contained within the hmsa of was repealed in.
the district court relied upon the rule that a plaintiff must show only that a favorable decision is likely to redress his injury,not that a favorable decision will inevitably redress his injury,citing beno shalala,cir emphasis in beno.levine also stresses that point on appeal.the difficulty with the district court standing analysis,however,is that the likely standard is altered somewhat when third parties not before the court must change their behavior in order for any injury suffered to be redressed.as the supreme court put it in defenders of wildlife 
when the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or inaction,the nature and extent of facts that must be averred at the summary judgment stage or proved at the trial stage in order to establish standing depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the action or forgone action at issue.if he is,there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.when,however,as in this case,a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else,much more is needed.in that circumstance,causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated or regulable third party to the government action or perhaps on the response of others as well.the existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts can not presume either to control or to predict,and it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury.thus,when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges,standing is not precluded,but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.

though it obviously recognized that the redressability element herein relied upon the actions of third parties not before the court,poultry processors and slaughterhouses and that the hmsa of presently contains no statutory enforcement mechanisms,the district court nevertheless concluded that redressability was likely because of the availability of an alternative method of enforcement.the district court believed that the secretary likely humane slaughter requirements through the fmia and that legislation grant of authority to the secretary to include whatever additional species of livestock he or she consider ed appropriate within the scope of the humane slaughter requirements set forth in the fmia and the hmsa of.see.see also w.of course,in defenders of wildlife,the supreme court rejected speculation,even when it took the form of confiden t speculation.defenders of wildlife,at.
while it is true that the would be the only technical third parties necessary for redressability here,the secretary actions under the fmia are equally outside the scope of this lawsuit which seeks relief solely as to the hmsa of,and therefore subject to some significant measure of speculation.in this regard,the district court and the parties appear to have overlooked fernandez brock,cir,a case which admittedly preceded defenders of wildlife by four years.though dealing with a quite different subject matter,that case is instructive,and arguably determinative,here.
in fernandez,this court concluded that it was speculative at best whether a court order compelling the secretary of treasury and other federal officials and agencies to promulgate regulations under erisa would enlarge farmworkers pension benefits and thus give the plaintiffs standing.id.at.it reached that conclusion because of the multiple unknown questions such a course would raise whether the regulations would have eligibility thresholds meaningfully lower than the present standard whether the employer would continue to maintain a pension plan at all under such new regulations where he was not required to do so and no one could predict what the regulations might require and whether the farmworkers would meet whatever eligibility standard the employer would set in connection with such unknown regulations.see id.at see also al
