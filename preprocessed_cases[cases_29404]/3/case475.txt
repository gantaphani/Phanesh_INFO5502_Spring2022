factual and procedural background 
pfe is a chain of pet stores.pfe bought some flea prevention products made by european drug companies and imported through a british distributor,abbeyvet,until the department advised pfe in august that the products were not properly registered under california law the food and agricultural code.
in,in response to a written request by the department,pfe provided copies of its invoices of purchases of foreign products from abbeyvet.
in february,the department issued a notice of proposed action nopa under food and agricultural code section proposing to levy penalties against pfe in the amount of,as follows 
as early as september,pfe began purchasing foreign advantage and frontline flea control pesticides from abbeyvet and continued to purchase them until august.the department has information and belief that pfe sold a minimum of one foreign advantage frontline flea control pesticide product a week for the time period beginning at least as early as october,and ending at least as late as august.the sales were in violation of fac food and agricultural code sections and as the flea control pesticide product labels did not conform to the department registered labels and were not registered by the department.each violation constitutes a separate offense food and agricultural code section.the proposed fine is based upon a proposed fine of per sale per week for weeks,the number of weeks from october,through august.
the nopa advised pfe of its right to request an administrative hearing food,fn,ante.pfe says it objected to the nopa but the department has not set a hearing.pfe fails to substantiate this assertion with a cite to the record but,in any event,for our purposes it does not matter whether pfe requested an administrative hearing.
in june,the department issued an administrative subpoena duces tecum,requesting information about pfe sales as opposed to pfe purchases.pfe did not respond to the subpoena.
on january,the department issued another,identical administrative subpoena duces tecum to pfe,captioned,in the matter of the investigation of sales of unregistered pesticide products,and sales of misbranded pesticide products,stating in part 
the department,having reasonable belief that food and agricultural code sections and have been violated with respect to sales of bayer advantage flea control products and merial frontline and frontline plus flea control products into and within california,and pursuant to the power conferred by sections and and food and agricultural code section,has authority to conduct the above entitled investigation.
pfe has produced documentation to the department showing purchases in excess of million of unlawful foreign bayer advantage flea control pesticide products and merial frontline and frontline plus flea control pesticide products.
you are hereby commanded to produce copies of the following records 
all records or documents from january,until the present day that refer or relate to sales of specified foreign bayer advantage and merial frontline and frontline plus flea control products 
specifically,with respect to foreign bayer advantage and merial frontline and frontline plus flea control products listed in attachment a,provide such documents that show the following date for each sale 
for all sales,such documents as show 
a dollar amount and unit volume of sales from january,to february.
b date of sale.
c exact identification of product sold.
d quantity sold.
e unit price at which each item sold.
in the absence of transaction records,provide such documents that show volume of product sold and the price at which each product was sold.
this request shall include all documents to the extent that they show any or all of the information.
pfe did not respond to the subpoena.
the attorney general office sent letters in february and march,seeking compliance with the subpoena.pfe responded with a letter on may,questioning the department need for the information sought in the subpoena.
on may,the department,pursuant to statutory authorization,initiated a petition in the superior court for an order directing pfe to comply with the administrative subpoena.the department filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause osc regarding compliance with the investigatory subpoena,and a petition for an osc.
pfe did not contest the ex parte application.the trial court issued an osc and set a hearing date.the hearing was rescheduled after pfe claimed it was not served with the osc.
pfe filed a response to the osc,challenging the subpoena on the ground of administrative burden and questioning whether there was a need for pfe sales data,since pfe had already provided its purchase data upon a representation the department was not likely to seek an administrative fine against pfe.a declaration of a pfe vice president attested,i do not know if we have the retail sales data that the department now seeks we have no records at all on the subject products after august,since there were no sales and if even if sic we do it will take a lot of to mine and copy it.pfe argued the subpoena was an arbitrary exercise of police power in violation of the due process clause and violation of the fourth amendment.in the course of making these arguments in the trial court,pfe stated the records sought by the department dating back to would be difficult to mine,but pfe did not raise the statute of limitations issue it now seeks to raise on appeal.
the trial court in august issued an order compelling pfe to comply with the administrative subpoena by september,and retaining jurisdiction to insure compliance.
pfe filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
appealability 
we first dispose of the department motion to dismiss the appeal due to nonappealability of the order.
it is settled that the right of appeal is statutory and that a judgment or order is not appealable unless expressly made so by statute.people mazurette cal th,d.people totari cal th,d.
we shall conclude the order is made appealable by code of civil procedure section,subdivision a 
confusion exists regarding appealability of orders enforcing administrative subpoenas,as stated in club superior court d at pages through,footnote.some cases assume appealability without discussion.citations.other cases conclude that a government code section order is directly appealable as a final judgment in a special proceeding.citations.still others have concluded that such orders are reviewable only by writ.citations.in craib bulmash cal d,the supreme court declined to resolve the confusion.the court of appeal had discussed the appealability problem with citations to both sides of the debate.the supreme court opinion does not discuss the question of appealability.club concluded that,even if the order were not directly appealable,the court would treat it as a writ in the interests of judicial economy and expediency.id.at,fn.
the california supreme court has still not resolved the issue.thus,in reviewing a court of appeal decision concerning an administrative subpoena,the california supreme court said in arnett dal cielo cal th,d,that the court of appeal held that the better view is that an order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena is appealable as a final order in a special proceeding,following millan restaurant enterprises group,th at pages through,d,and cases cited.the parties do not question that holding here,and it is therefore not before us for review.arnett dal cielo,supra,cal th at,d.
the california supreme court deflection of the issue is perplexing,because appealability is a jurisdictional question that must be addressed by the reviewing court,even if the parties do not question it.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.moreover,the millan case millan restaurant enterprises group,th,d cited by the supreme court in turn cited the supreme court failure to decide the issue as an additional basis for the millan decision.numerous cases,including cases from our supreme court,have decided appeals taken from similar orders on the merits without discussion of the appealability issue.citations.inasmuch as the supreme court is among those courts which have assumed the appealability of such orders,we conclude such an order is appealable millan,supra,th at,d.
in city of santa cruz patel th,d patel,the court of appeal for the sixth appellate district held that analogous orders compelling compliance with legislative subpoenas must be deemed final judgments,appealable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.patel,supra,th at,d.we apply the same reasoning to the administrative subpoenas at issue in this case.
thus,a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ.the statutory scheme et provides for an original proceeding in the superior court,which results in an order directing the respondent to comply with the administrative subpoena,fns.and,ante.the court order enforcing the administrative subpoena is tantamount to a superior court judgment in mandamus which,with limited exceptions,is appealable under code of civil procedure section.patel,supra,th at,d.whether the matter is properly characterized as an action code civ,or a special proceeding code civ,it is a final determination of the parties rights.it is final because it leaves nothing for further judicial determination between the parties except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with its terms.patel,supra,th at,d.the fact that an intransigent respondent may be subject to a contempt order does not mean the court order is not final,because the same possibility exists with injunctions and final judgments which form the basis for contempt citations.the purpose of any judicial order which commands or prohibits specific conduct is to make the sanction of contempt available for disobedience.this fact does not render such an order nonfinal.indeed,the contempt judgment is not appealable but must be reviewed,if at all,by writ,and therefore review of the underlying order can reliably be had only if that order is appealable.ibid.
like the legislative subpoena in patel,supra,th at page,d,the trial court order in this case concerning an administrative subpoena determined all of the parties rights and liabilities at issue in the proceeding the only determination left was the question of future compliance,which is present in every judgment.
the department argues the reasoning of patel is faulty for several reasons.
first,says the department,the sixth appellate district comparison of a compliance order to a judgment in mandamus is flawed,because a judgment in mandamus is expressly made appealable by code of civil procedure section.the department point is not persuasive,given the totality of the patel court reasoning.
second,says the department,the sixth appellate district did not adequately explain its point that the potential for a contempt order for noncompliance with the compliance order did not render the compliance order nonfinal.the department urges us instead to follow the second appellate district which held,most recently in bishop merging capital,th,d,that because an order compelling compliance with an administrative subpoena is not expressly made appealable by code of civil procedure section and has no adverse impact in and of itself,it is not final and not appealable.we find the reasoning of patel,supra,th,d,more persuasive.
we also reject the department further argument that we should analogize to discovery orders in civil litigation,which are not considered final,appealable orders.such discovery orders,however,are made in connection with pending lawsuits which have yet to be resolved.a discovery order does not determine all of the parties rights and liabilities at issue in the litigation.the department argues the same applies here,because even with the documents,the department can not impose administrative penalties unless an administrative hearing is held if such a hearing is requested.however,it is possible an administrative hearing may not be requested and,even if it is requested,it will not necessarily end up in court in contrast to this case,pending civil litigation in which a discovery order occurs already involves the court and will continue to do so.
finally,the department disagrees with the statement in patel,supra,th,d,that appealability of the compliance order assures reliable review,since a contempt judgment is nonappealable and is reviewable,if at all,by writ petition to the appellate court.the department argues appellate writ review of a compliance order is good enough though the department suggests pfe appeal should not be treated as a writ petition.however,unlike an appeal,a writ petition may be summarily denied without a written opinion.cal,art.vi,appellate court decisions that determine causes shall be in writing with reasons stated people kelly cal th,fn,d,summary denial of writ petition does not determine a cause for purposes of written opinion requirement.a written opinion may be valuable to a party challenging an administrative subpoena.as is the case here,a written opinion may help the parties resolve issues such as application of the statute of limitations.
we conclude the order enforcing the administrative subpoena must be deemed a final judgment,appealable under code of civil procedure,section,subdivision a.fn,ante.
the department motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.
ii.pfe fails to show grounds for reversal 
pfe contends the trial court erred in issuing the order compelling compliance with the administrative subpoena because,according to pfe,the subpoena imposed an oppressive burden on pfe by seeking duplicative documents which in any event related to a claim barred by the statute of limitations.we shall conclude pfe fails to show grounds for reversal.
as indicated,sections and authorized the department to issue the administrative subpoena in furtherance of its investigation,and sections and fns.and,ante authorized the department to petition the superior court for an order compelling pfe to comply with the administrative subpoena.
there is no constitutional objection to a system under which the heads of departments of government may compel the production of evidence for purposes of investigation,without instituting formal proceedings against the one from whom the evidence is sought or filing any charges against him.as has been said by the united states supreme court,the power to make administrative inquiry is not derived from a judicial function but is more analogous to the power of a grand jury,which does not depend on a case or controversy in order to get evidence but can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated,or even just because it wants assurance that it is not.citation.of course,department heads can not compel the production of evidence in disregard of the privilege against or the constitutional provisions prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.it should be pointed out,however,in this connection that where,as here,the records of a corporation are the object of a subpena sic,the situation differs from one where the private papers of an individual are sought.neither the corporation nor a person having custody of its records can refuse to produce them on the basis of the privilege against.citations.insofar as the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures can be said to apply at all it requires only that the inquiry be one which the agency demanding production is authorized to make,that the demand be not too indefinite,and that the information sought be reasonably relevant.citations.brovelli superior court cal d.
we review de novo the question whether the subpoena meets the standards for enforce
