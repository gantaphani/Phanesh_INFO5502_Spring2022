in barshop medina county underground water conservation district,we upheld the edwards aquifer act over a number of constitutional challenges.we now consider whether certain actions of the entity created to carry out the legislature conservation mandate as expressed in the edwards aquifer act violate provisions of the private real property rights preservation act.see.gov t code.
plaintiffs glenn and jolynn bragg sued the edwards aquifer authority and its general manager,gregory ellis,claiming that the authority violated the property rights act by failing to prepare takings impact assessments tias before issuing its rules and applying those rules to the braggs applications for two well permits.see.gov t code.the trial court agreed that the authority did not comply with the tia requirement,and declared void the proposed actions on the braggs permit applications as well as parts of the authority rules.see.gov t code a.it also awarded the braggs attorney fees.see id.c.concluding that the authority need not prepare tias under the circumstances presented,the court of appeals vacated in part and reversed and rendered in part.
we agree that the property rights act does not require the authority to prepare tias before adopting rules and applying those rules to the braggs permit applications,but for different reasons than those the court of appeals expressed.we hold that the authority adoption of rules falls within the exception to the property rights act for actions taken under a political subdivision statutory authority to prevent waste or protect rights of owners of interest in groundwater.see.gov t code b c.we also conclude that the authority proposed actions on the braggs permit applications constitute enforcement of a governmental action,to which the tia requirement does not apply.see id.a,a.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
the braggs own two commercial pecan orchards in medina county.the first orchard is located on approximately sixty acres of land,along with the braggs residence and pecan processing facility.that orchard is known as the home place orchard.the second orchard,known as the orchard,is located on approximately acres.the braggs drilled a well into the edwards aquifer on the home place orchard in.they began drilling a well on the orchard in december,and completed it in february.
as we explained in barshop,in the legislature enacted the edwards aquifer act to manage the aquifer and to sustain the diverse economic and social interests dependent on the aquifer.act,barshop,at.to carry out its conservation mandate in the face of anticipated increases in withdrawal of water from the aquifer and the potentially devastating effects of a drought,the legislature created the edwards aquifer authority.see act barshop,at.the authority is a conservation and reclamation district authorized by texas constitution article xvi,section.act b.the legislature has charged the authority with regulating groundwater withdrawals from the aquifer.see act barshop,at.the legislature further directed the authority to manage groundwater withdrawals from the aquifer by a permit system.act.
the authority adoption of rules governing that permit system is the focus of the dispute in this case.in the act,the legislature established an cap on water withdrawals by nonexempt wells of of water per year through and per year thereafter.id.b,c.it authorized the authority to review and increase the cap if after appropriate study,implementation of water management and drought planning strategies,and consultation with state and federal agencies,the authority determines that additional water is safely available from the aquifer.id.d see barshop,at.the permit system established by the legislature gives preference to existing users,which the act defines as people who have withdrawn and beneficially used underground water from the aquifer on or before june.act barshop,at.under the act,the authority may grant initial regular permits only to existing users who properly file a declaration of historical use,and who can establish,by convincing evidence,beneficial use of underground water withdrawn between june,and may.act a,b,d.
the act entitles an existing user to a permit allowing the user to withdraw an amount of water equal to the user maximum beneficial use of water without waste during any one calendar year of the historical period,unless the aggregate total of such use throughout the aquifer exceeds the cap.id.e.if this occurs,the legislature has directed that the authority proportionately adjust the amount of water authorized for withdrawal under the permits to meet the cap.id.this downward adjustment is limited in two circumstances,the first of which is relevant here an existing irrigation user must receive a permit of not less than two a year for each acre of land the user actually irrigated in any one calendar year during the historical period and an existing user who operated a well for three or more years during the historical period must receive a permit for at least the average amount of water withdrawn annually during the historical period.id.subject to certain restrictions,permitted water rights may also be sold or leased.id.
following our decision in barshop upholding the constitutionality of the edwards aquifer act,the authority promulgated rules governing the permitting process,as section of the act requires.see id.at issue in this case is the second of three sets of permitting rules.the authority repealed its first set of rules.see.reg.it proposed and partially adopted a third set after another court invalidated the second set of rules on grounds unrelated to compliance with the property rights act.see living waters artesian springs,edwards aquifer,dist,travis county,invalidating second set based on failure to comply with texas government code administrative procedure act.reg,adopted.reg.third set.the second set of rules followed in relevant part the language of the edwards aquifer act in outlining when and in what amounts initial regular permits would be issued.see edwards aquifer auth.rules e i.
in the braggs applied to the authority for an initial regular permit to withdraw water from each of their wells to irrigate their orchards.the application form,which was provided by the authority,included a section entitled declaration of historical use.that section requested the applicant to list on a separate line for each year the total amount of water withdrawn and the total number of acres irrigated each year of the statutory historical period,june,through may.in their application for the home place well,the braggs listed amounts withdrawn beginning in and continuing through the end of the historical period in.they added lines for water withdrawn in,and.as the braggs did not drill the well until after the historical use period,they left blank the lines corresponding to the historical period,but added their own lines for amounts withdrawn in and.the braggs also reported on the home place application that they irrigated acres each year from through,and also from through.they reported on the application that they irrigated acres for the years and.
the authority general manager ellis recommended denying a permit for the well because no water was reported withdrawn during the historical use period.for the home place well,he recommended granting an initial regular permit of based on the guaranteed irrigator minimum of two of water for each of the acres irrigated.the braggs explain that this proposed allocation is undisputedly insufficient to grow pecans in commercial quantities.
before the authority board of directors could act on ellis recommendations,the braggs sued the authority and ellis.they sought a judgment invalidating the proposed actions on their permit applications and the authority rules,requirements,policies,and guidelines for the process as they pertain to the braggs applications,for failure to prepare tias under the property rights act.see.gov t code a.the authority answered that tias were not required based on four exceptions to the property rights act.see.gov t code b,c.following a bench trial,the trial court declared void for failure to prepare tias the authority rules found in the texas administrative code,title,chs,and and the proposed actions on the braggs permit applications.see.gov t code a.the trial court also awarded the braggs their attorney fees and court costs.see id.c.the authority and ellis appealed.
the court of appeals vacated in part,and reversed and rendered in part.it concluded that the authority adopting rules fell within the exception to the property rights act for actions reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated by state law.id.at citing.gov t code b.the court explained that the edwards aquifer act directs the authority to adopt rules necessary to carry out its duties and specifically requires the authority to regulate and ensure compliance with the permitting system.id.citing act a,b.it rejected the braggs argument that all rulemaking is expressly subject to the property rights act requirements,see.gov t code a,concluding that although the statute does encompass rulemaking by governmental entities in general,it provides an exception for action,including rulemaking,by a political subdivision that is reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated by state law.at citing.gov t code b.
finally,the court of appeals concluded that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the braggs claims concerning the authority proposed action on their permit applications because those claims were not yet ripe for judicial review.id.at.nonetheless,the court recognized the futility of a remand because the authority has unequivocally stated that it will act in conformity with the general manager recommendations without preparing a tia.id.at.then,construing the braggs pleadings broadly to request a declaratory judgment that the authority must prepare a tia before acting on the applications,the court held that authority did not have to prepare tias before acting on the applications.id.it concluded that the recommended actions were mandated by the language of the edwards aquifer act and thus fell within the same exception to the property rights act for actions reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated by state law.id.citing.gov t code b mcmillan northwest harris county mun.util.dist,dist,pet.denied.the court of appeals accordingly vacated the trial court judgment on the permit applications,and reversed and rendered judgment that the braggs take nothing on the other claims.id.at.we granted the braggs petition for review on motion for rehearing 
as a preliminary matter we consider whether this action is moot.as noted above,the braggs challenge the authority second set of permitting rules,which are no longer in effect.these rules were invalidated by another court on grounds unrelated to compliance with the property rights act.see living waters artesian springs,edwards aquifer,dist,travis county.the authority did not appeal that judgment,but instead repealed the rules and proposed and partially adopted new ones the authority did not prepare a tia before adopting the third set of rules or before processing the braggs same permit applications under those new rules.the general manager has recommended the same action on the braggs permit applications under the new rules as he did under the second set of rules.
both parties argue that the case is not moot because the braggs claim for attorney fees presents a live issue for judicial resolution.see camarena texas employment comm n.they further urge that if the case is moot,several possible exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply,including that the underlying dispute is capable of repetition yet evading review that the public interest demands review and that a defendants voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a court of jurisdiction to determine the legality of that practice.
we agree with the parties that this case is not moot.we are presented with a live controversy in that even though new rules are in place,the authority did not perform a tia before adopting those rules,still refuses to perform a tia before acting on the braggs permit applications,and has recommended the same action on those applications as under the previous rules.although the new rules differ in some substantive respects from the old rules and the parties disagree about the significance of those differences,none of the changes to the rules highlighted by the parties affects the legal analysis of whether the property rights act requires the authority to prepare tias before adopting rules or acting on individual permit applications.thus the live issues in this case have not changed,and our decision will resolve whether the authority should have prepared a tia before adopting its rules or must prepare a tia before applying the rules to the braggs pending applications.under these circumstances,we conclude that this case is not moot,and proceed to examine the merits of the braggs challenge to the authority actions.
turning to the question of whether the property rights act requires the authority to prepare a tia before adopting rules,a question of statutory interpretation that we review de novo,see city of garland dallas morning news,we begin as always with the plain language of the legislature enactment.see.gov t code kroger keng,fitzgerald advanced spine fixation.the property rights act creates two causes of action in favor of real property owners a statutory cause of action for taking and a cause of action based on governmental action taken without preparing a tia,if the property rights act requires a tia.gov t code.the property rights act applies to governmental entities,including political subdivisions such as the authority.see.gov t code b edwards aquifer act clear lake city water auth.clear lake util.thus the authority actions are generally subject to the requirements of the property rights act unless an exception to that act coverage applies.see.gov t code b e excepting certain governmental actions id.a requiring tia only for governmental actions described in sections a.
as an initial matter,we agree with the braggs that adopting rules is clearly a governmental action within the scope of the property rights act,see.gov t code a,and that rulemaking in general is one of the types of proposed governmental action for which a governmental entity must prepare a tia.see id.a.but just as rulemaking is a covered governmental action for purposes of section a,which sets out when a tia is required,rulemaking is likewise a covered governmental action for purposes of the exceptions to the property rights act,specifically those enumerated in section b.id.b this chapter does not apply to the following governmental actions.thus we conclude,as did the court of appeals,that the property rights act applies to rulemaking by governmental entities in general,but contains exceptions for actions,including rulemaking under certain circumstances,when those actions fall within the enumerated exceptions to that act.see at.we further agree with the court of appeals that the authority adoption of rules is outside the ambit of the property rights act,but for a different reason.
the authority argues that its adoption of rules was done pursuant to its statutory authority to prevent waste or protect the rights of owners of interest in groundwater,and thus that action is excepted from the property rights act under the express terms of section b c,which excepts actions taken under a political subdivision statutory authority to prevent waste or protect rights of owners of interest in groundwater.gov t code b c.the braggs respond that whether they waste water is a question of fact,and that they produced undisputed evidence at trial that they use conservative water management practices,have never been cited by any governmental authority for waste,and have never committed waste as defined in edwards aquifer act and corresponding edwards aquifer authority rule.they further disagree that the permitting rules were adopted to protect the rights of owners of interests in groundwater because they claim the authority has denied over thirty percent of the permit applications without investigating whether it could raise the cap on total withdrawal
