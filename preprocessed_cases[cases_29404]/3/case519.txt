in this appeal,we explore the contours of the right to farm act affirmative defense against claims that agricultural operations are a nuisance.the act provides that n o nuisance action may be brought against an agricultural operation that has been in lawful operation for more than a year if the conditions or circumstances complained of as constituting the basis for the nuisance action have existed substantially unchanged since the established date of operation.agric.code a.the petitioners here are agricultural operators who complain that a defective jury charge denied them the protection of this defense.they also complain that the court of appeals erred in holding that they waived their complaints of charge error.they finally complain that no evidence or pleadings support the permanent injunction issued by the trial court and affirmed by the court of appeals.because we conclude that the jury charge in this case is erroneous and that this error is harmful and has been preserved,we reverse the court of appeals judgment,dissolve the injunction,and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
david and mary holubec own a ranch in mcculloch county,texas,on which they have conducted a sheep operation for well over a decade.in addition to this ranch,they own or lease an additional acres on which they farm and raise sheep.the remainder of their livelihood comes from operating a fertilizer and seed business.
since,robin lee and his mother laverne have owned the property to the south and west of the holubec ranch.near the eastern boundary of the lees property is the home of their ranch foreman,carl brandenberger,who has lived there with his wife and children since the lees purchased the property.
at the end of,the holubecs began clearing land to construct a feedlot on the western boundary of their ranch.the new feedlot contained twenty sheep pens and other improvements to accommodate about lambs.the holubecs began using the new feedlot in march,by which time most of the improvements had been completed.the nearest pen is about feet from the brandenbergers home.
the feedlot ten acres were taken from a area of fenced pasture the holubecs had used since to wean lambs and fatten them for sale.before being cleared,this pasture was thick with mesquite and brush,although lanes had been cut to permit the sheep to reach feeders placed on the property.while the holubecs kept no written records of how many sheep they fed on this tract,they testified variously that it was as few as a thousand to as many as three thousand.after the feedlot was completed,however,the numbers definitely increased.within a year of completing the improvements,the holubecs had about sheep on the feedlot.
by august,the brandenbergers began noticing foul odors.about this same time,they also began experiencing swarms of flies,increased dust,and noise from bleating lambs being weaned from their mothers.robin lee complained to the holubecs about these problems to no avail.in february,the holubecs added elevated lights to the feedlot to permit night work.the brandenbergers claim that these lights illuminated their home and disturbed their sleep.
on july,the brandenbergers and lees filed suit,complaining that the foul odors,flies,dust,noise,and light constituted a nuisance.the lees sought damages for the diminished market value of their property,while the brandenbergers sought damages for their costs,medical expenses,and pain and suffering.both families also sought permanent injunctive relief against the continued operation of the feedlot.the holubecs denied all allegations and asserted section a of the texas agriculture code as a bar to all the plaintiffs claims.the trial court denied their motion for summary judgment on the statutory defense.
the case proceeded to trial before a jury,which found that the feedlot was a nuisance and that the holubecs were negligent in its operation or construction.the jury awarded damages to the lees for loss of market value to their ranch,but it awarded no personal damages to the brandenbergers.after the verdict,the plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment,seeking injunctive relief rather than damages.the trial court signed a judgment conforming to this motion,granting only a permanent injunction which enjoined the holubecs from 
operating a sheep feedlot or stabling,confining,feeding or maintaining on the acres any animals in confinement areas that do not sustain such animals on the crops,vegetation,forage growth,or post harvest residues produced in such areas in the normal growing season 
feeding hay or other feed within feet of the brandenbergers residence 
weaning lambs or other livestock in areas within feet of the brandenbergers residence during the period of time that such livestock is bleating or bawling because of the weaning process 
maintaining lights on the acres that shine directly on the brandenbergers property 
disposing of dead animals on the acres.
the injunction also directed the holubecs to dismantle their feedlot and clean up the area.the holubecs appealed,and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment.we granted the holubecs petition to consider how the right to farm act applies to these facts.
in order to conserve,protect,and encourage the development and improvement of texas agricultural land for the production of food and other agricultural products,the legislature passed the right to farm act in limiting the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be regulated or considered to be a nuisance.agric.code.to further this policy,the legislature in section a of the act shortened the period for bringing a nuisance action against an agricultural operation to one year.that section provides 
no nuisance action may be brought against an agricultural operation that has lawfully been in operation for one year or more prior to the date on which the action is brought,if the conditions or circumstances complained of as constituting the basis for the nuisance action have existed substantially unchanged since the established date of operation.this subsection does not restrict or impede the authority of this state to protect the public health,safety,and welfare or the authority of a municipality to enforce state law.
agric.code a.the act defines agricultural operation to include raising or keeping livestock.id.the established date of operation means the date on which an agricultural operation commenced operation.id.if the physical facilities of an agricultural operation are subsequently expanded,the expanded operation acquires a separate and independent established date of operation,which is the date the expanded operation commences.id.the commencement of an expanded operation,however,does not divest the agricultural operation of a previously established date of operation.id.
at different times in this litigation,the holubecs took varying positions about when they commenced sheep feeding operations.in their original answer,the holubecs maintained that they commenced operations in when they first began feeding sheep on the twenty acres.a few days before trial,however,they amended their pleadings to suggest a second commencement date,asserting that the nuisance action was barred because it had been filed more than ten years after defendants operation was begun and more than one year after defendants remodeled their physical facilities.by the charge conference,the holubecs had concluded that their defense should be tied solely to the commencement of operations at the new feedlot in early.while the new feedlot arguably used less acreage than before,it expanded the physical facilities of the agricultural operation.agric.code,by adding twenty sheep pens and other improvements.the court of appeals concluded that march,was the undisputed date on which the holubecs commenced operations at their new feedlot.at.
the parties principal disagreement in this case is about how to calculate the statute bar.this disagreement is based on conflicting interpretations of the statute proviso highlighted below 
no nuisance action may be brought against an agricultural operation that has lawfully been in operation for one year or more
