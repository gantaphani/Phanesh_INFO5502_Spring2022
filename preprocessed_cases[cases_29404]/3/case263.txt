in this appeal we consider whether the district court appropriately entered summary judgment against four farm workers who brought suit under the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,after being discharged in the context of a seasonal slowdown in agricultural activity.applying the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,d,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for trial on one worker claim of age discrimination.
background 
phoenix agro invest,and sam management,are general partners in eagle produce limited partnership eagle produce,which operates a commercial broccoli and melon farm in aguila,arizona.the seasonal nature of farming these crops creates a fluctuating need for laborers that corresponds with periods of soil preparation,crop planting,and harvest.eagle produce hires new workers or transfers existing employees to satisfy its labor needs during periods of increased activity.conversely,it lays off workers or transfers them to other operations when its need for labor decreases.because work on the farm generally slows down each year between the melon harvest in the fall and planting in the spring,layoffs and transfers tend to occur in the winter.reflecting this trend,the number of workers employed by eagle produce was in july,but only in february of the same year.
abel ruiz diaz,ubaldo moreno,piedad renteria,and alejandro mancilla collectively,plaintiffs were laborers at eagle produce aguila farm.with the exception of alejandro mancilla,they were members of a tractor crew known as crew that was responsible for preparing the soil for planting.plaintiffs were supervised exclusively by chet daffern until may,when eagle produce hired owen brandt to work as.brandt became the sole supervisor of crew when daffern quit at the end of december.one of brandt responsibilities was to make crew personnel decisions.
the work available at the farm became particularly scarce in the winter of.this was at least partly due to the farm increased use of plastic mulching,a technique that involves placing a thin layer of plastic over the soil to protect it from the effects of the local climate.fields covered with plastic mulch,as opposed to other forms of mulch,require significantly fewer hours to prepare.even less preparation is required for fields that use plastic mulch,or plastic mulch laid down the previous year.from to,the use of plastic mulch on eagle produce cantaloupe fields increased from acres to acres.within those totals,the acreage of plastic mulch increased from to acres.the use of plastic mulch for eagle produce honeydew and mixed melon crops similarly increased from acres in to acres in.the efficiency gained through the expanded use of this technique allowed crew to prepare the same amount of land with fewer hours of labor.the improved efficiency in turn reduced crew combined total work hours from hours in january and february to only for the same period in.
brandt laid off several workers during this period.he claims that in deciding whose employment to terminate,he did not consider the extent of the employee experience with a tractor,how many years the employee had been working at eagle produce,or the employee age or wage.brandt did,however,consider job performance,attitude,attendance,work ethic,and the individual ability to work with others.plaintiffs were among those whose employment was terminated.the circumstances pertaining to each plaintiff are as follows 
abel ruiz diaz 
diaz began working for eagle produce in august at the age of.at the time,he had approximately seven years of farm work experience.he drove a tractor at aguila and,during harvest season,drove a truck from which he sprayed water onto the ground to reduce dust problems.diaz was not qualified to drive a planting tractor,a responsibility that requires a certain level of technical expertise.other than missing work approximately once a month due to a drinking problem,diaz adequately fulfilled his duties at the farm.
on january,brandt informed diaz that he no longer had any work available.he offered diaz a temporary transfer to the harvest tractor crew,but diaz declined the offer because he was unfamiliar with that job,it was temporary,it involved fewer hours,and,in his view,it would be difficult to perform in light of a medical condition that precluded him from lifting objects heavier than fifty pounds.shortly thereafter,diaz was laid off.he was years old at the time.an eagle produce notice states that he was laid off due to reduction of work.
ubaldo moreno 
moreno began working for crew as a tractor and watertruck driver in june,at the age of.he was a dependable worker,but had a history of damaging eagle produce property,including an irrigation ditch in june and a disc and tractor in march.he also allowed unauthorized persons to drive eagle produce equipment in october.on february,a tractor broke down while he was driving it,necessitating approximately in repairs.eagle produce laid off moreno the next day due to reduction of work.he was years old.moreno history of damaging eagle produce property was considered in selecting him as one of the workers to lose his job.
piedad renteria 
renteria worked as a tractor driver for crew and as a driver he also operated his own business at the farm in violation of a company policy that prohibited solicitation on eagle produce property.on paydays,he would park his truck in front of the farm office and cash his coworkers paychecks in exchange for a small fee.he maintained this business for several years without ever being reprimanded or told to stop.once brandt became aware of the business,he warned renteria to stop.brandt gave the warning orally with the assistance of a translator to ensure that renteria understood.renteria indicated that he understood the warning,but nevertheless promptly resumed his business.brandt dismissed him on february.renteria was years old at the time.eagle produce explains that renteria was laid off due to a seasonal work slow down,reduction in work and repeated violations of rules established in the company handbook.renteria was not the only employee who cashed checks on eagle produce property,but,to his knowledge,he was the only one disciplined for doing so.
alejandro mancilla 
eagle produce hired mancilla when he was in october to test gps equipment on farm tractors.after that task was completed,brandt hired mancilla to work as a driver.in that capacity,mancilla accidentally broke the bottom of a chemical trailer on january,and once received a verbal warning for failure to wear safety equipment.as work became unavailable at the end of the melon harvest,brandt laid him off on february.mancilla was years old at the time.the notice states that he was laid off due to reduction of work,but eagle produce also considered the damage that mancilla caused to the trailer and his failure to wear safety equipment in deciding to terminate his employment.mancilla never worked for crew when brandt was the supervisor and was not qualified for planting.eagle produce has indicated that mancilla is eligible for rehire when more work becomes available.
plaintiffs filed an action in district court seeking declaratory relief and damages on the theory that their terminations violated the adea,the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act,et,and the americans with disabilities act,et.the district court granted motion for summary judgment on all claims.the workers appeal only the disposition of their adea claim.
ii.standard of review and jurisdiction 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.buono norton,cir.rule c provides that summary judgment is warranted when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a genuine issue of material fact will be absent if,upon viewing the evidence and inferences which may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the adverse party,the movant is clearly entitled to prevail as a matter of law.jones halekulani hotel,cir.summary judgment is inappropriate if reasonable jurors,drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,could return a verdict in the nonmoving party favor.united states shumway,cir.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
iii.discussion 
the adea makes it unlawful to discharge any individual because of such individual age.a.we evaluate adea claims that are based on circumstantial evidence of discrimination by using the framework laid out in mcdonnell douglas green,d.enlow yellow cab,cir.under this framework,the employee must first establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.coleman quaker oats,cir.if the employee has justified a presumption of discrimination,the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,reason for its adverse employment action.id.if the employer satisfies its burden,the employee must then prove that the reason advanced by the employer constitutes mere pretext for unlawful discrimination.id.as a general matter,the plaintiff in an employment discrimination action need produce very little evidence in order to overcome an employer motion for summary judgment.chuang of cal.davis,bd.of,cir.
a.the prima facie cases 
each plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment by demonstrating that he was at least forty years old,performing his job satisfactorily,discharged,and either replaced by substantially younger employees with equal or inferior qualifications or discharged under circumstances otherwise giving rise to an inference of age discrimination.coleman,at an inference of discrimination can be established by showing the employer had a continuing need for the employees skills and services in that their various duties were still being performed or by showing that others not in their protected class were treated more favorably.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.
plaintiffs were each over forty years old and were discharged after the commencement of their protected status.eagle produce does not dispute that these elements of the workers prima facie cases have been satisfied.the only questions,then,are whether plaintiffs were performing their jobs satisfactorily and whether they were discharged under circumstances giving rise to an inference of age discrimination.
for the reasons explained below,we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment against renteria because he failed to create a triable issue concerning whether his job performance was satisfactory.we also conclude,however,that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against diaz,moreno,and mancilla based on the first stage of the mcdonnell douglas analysis.those plaintiffs provided evidence of satisfactory job performance and an accumulation of circumstantial evidence that,taken together,could lead reasonable jurors to draw an inference of age discrimination.
whether the workers job performances were satisfactory 
diaz,mancilla,and moreno have each established a triable issue of fact regarding the second element of the prima facie case.diaz and mancilla generally performed dependably and without incident.deficiencies in their performance were relatively minor and infrequent.the issue is closer for moreno because he damaged eagle produce property three times over the course of approximately four years and once violated a company safety rule,but those incidents were also relatively infrequent.moreover,there is no evidence that moreno caused any of the damage intentionally or recklessly,and his supervisor generally found him to be dependable.
the same can not be said of renteria,who over an extended period openly violated eagle produce policy against solicitation on company property and continued to do so even after receiving a warning from brandt.considering that behavior,no reasonable juror could find that renteria performance was satisfactory.see mungro giant food,d,citing cases for the proposition that a plaintiff who violates company policy and fails to improve his performance despite a warning has not demonstrated satisfactory performance.because renteria has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,we do not complete the remainder of the mcdonnell douglas analysis with respect to his claim.
whether the circumstances give rise to an inference of discrimination 
although it is a close question,we conclude that diaz,mancilla,and moreno have also created a triable issue of fact concerning the fourth and final requirement for a prima facie case.this conclusion draws support from a variety of circumstantial evidence.
statistical evidence 
including plaintiffs,the average age of the sixteen workers laid off or discharged from crew in and is three of those workers were,and years old,respectively.while the majority fell within the age category protected by the adea,most were also hired after the age of forty.one was hired at years of age,only a year and a half before the disputed layoffs.another was hired in july at age.several others were hired when they were in their mid to.
sixteen other workers were hired for crew in and and not subsequently discharged.their average age at the time of hiring was.nearly half of them were or more years old,including one who was and two who were.
on its own,this evidence would suggest that an inference of discrimination is not warranted.eagle produce laid off many of the crew employees,including plaintiffs,only shortly after hiring them at what were already relatively advanced ages.diaz was hired at and laid off four years later at.moreno was hired at and laid off at.mancilla was hired at and laid off at.if eagle produce was biased against older workers,it presumably would not have hired plaintiffs in the first place.the temporal proximity between each plaintiff hiring and layoff also makes it unlikely that age later developed as the reason for the discharges.the difference in physical and mental capacity between an average and an average,or between a and a,is not significant enough to warrant an inference of anything but the most arbitrary bias.see bradley harcourt,brace,cir w here the same actor is responsible for both the hiring and the firing of a discrimination plaintiff,and both actions occur within a short period of time,a strong inference arises that there was no discriminatory motive.
that the average age of the workers hired during the period is approximately nine and a half years younger than the average age of those laid versus fails to justify an inference of age discrimination.the disparity is not so stark as to suggest bias rather than pure chance.see consol.coin caterers,d in the age discrimination context an inference of discriminatory intent can not be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger.hartley.bell,cir holding that replacement employees must be at least ten years younger than their predecessors to justify a presumption of age discrimination.this is particularly true because the two data sets of sixteen workers are too small to form a reliable basis for analysis.see palmer,at finding certain statistical evidence of employment discrimination unpersuasive because the sample size was too small.
a different picture emerges,however,when we consider the data with brandt in mind.he first began to make personnel decisions for crew when he was hired as a supervisor in may.the average age of the workers hired before that date was.for the period of may to january,during which daffern and brandt both made personnel decisions,the average age of crew hirees dropped to.once brandt took over as the sole hiring authority,the average age dropped still further to.by contrast,the average age of workers laid off from crew increased slightly from during the period of daffern and brandt joint supervision to after brandt became the sole supervisor.in short,the disparity between the average age of those hired and those laid off increased from slightly less than two years to nearly years once brandt started to make personnel decisions.this evidence suggests that although eagle produce was not responsible for discriminatory hiring practices prior to brandt advent,brandt used his authority to replace older workers with younger counterparts.
reasonable jurors could find that this interpretation of the data supports an inference of discrimination.viewing the statistical evidence with brandt in mind helps to explain how eagle produce could both hire plaintiffs without regard to age and also terminate their employment because of age shortly thereafter.because brandt did not work at eagle produce until may,he could not preclude the hiring of mancilla in approximately,diaz in,and moreno in.however,he could lay off these workers because of their ages in the winter of.
ii.knowledge of the workers ages 
the inference of discrimination also draws support from brandt knowledge that his hirees were on average substantially younger than the workers he laid off.brandt did not know the precise ages of diaz,moreno,and mancilla,but he must have possessed a general sense that these individuals were relatively advanced in age because he personally observed them at the farm on a regular basis.see woodman,cir contact is sufficient to warrant an inference of an employer knowledge of age.because of his final position as the sole hiring authority for crew,the crew moderate size,and his daily contact with its workers,brandt also must have known that the individuals he hired in were younger than those he laid off.id.in concluding otherwise,the district court failed to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.see jones,at.
iii.the decision not to fire several younger,less experienced workers 
reasonable jurors could find that brandt decision not to lay off several substantially younger workers with less experience than diaz,moreno,and mancilla also supports an inference of discrimination.one worker was years old and had approximately five months of experience in crew at the time plaintiffs lost their jobs.another was years old and had approximately two years of experience in crew.another was and possessed about years of experience.still another was and had two months of experience.at the very least,these individuals had no more experience at the aguila farm than diaz,moreno,and mancilla,who worked there for,and years,respectively.nevertheless,brandt chose not to fire any of these younger workers during the seasonal slowdown.
iv.the qualifications of plaintiffs relative to their replacements 
evidence concerning the job experience of diaz and moreno relative to that of their replacements provides additional support for an inference of discrimination.seven individuals were hired around or shortly after the dates on which plaintiffs lost their jobs.due to a lack of evidence,the qualifications of three of those hired can not be determined.two others were hired successively to operate a grading machine with which diaz,moreno,and mancilla had no experience.accordingly,they can not be viewed as replacements.the remaining two workers were javier gastelum and jesus valdez.gastelum purportedly had years of experience driving a tractor at the time he was hired.valdez had around five years of experience with a tractor and knew a little about that line of work.
this evidence creates a triable issue of fact as to whether diaz and moreno were at least as qualified as their successors.diaz had driven tractors and performed general farm labor for eleven years.valdez was no more qualified in terms of length of experience.gastelum had driven a tractor longer than either diaz or moreno,but it is unlikely that this difference made gastelum more qualified in any meaningful sense.the parties do not dispute that the job did not require specialized training,and the learning curve was not such that years of experience were required for mastery.
the district court erred in weighing against plaintiffs the absence of evidence that particular,younger workers were hired in their steads.it is true that,due to high turnover in crew,plaintiffs are unable to identify their individual replacements.however,we treat the last element of the prima facie case with flexibility.nidds schindler elevator,cir.to support an inference of discrimination an employee need not demonstrate that one particular individual was designated as his replacement evidence that a group of younger and comparably or employees assumed the plaintiff responsibilities is sufficient.see caribbean forms,cir.it is therefore enough that diaz and moreno identified gastelum and valdez as their collective replacements 
facial legitimacy of the explanations for the layoffs 
moving to the next stage of the analysis,we conclude that eagle produce did not offer a legitimate,explanation for the layoff of diaz.to suffice under mcdonnell douglas,an employer explanation must explain why the plaintiff in particular was laid off.davis team electric,cir see also mcdonnell douglas,at.concluding that the satisfied its burden at this stage by specifying the employee participation in unlawful conduct as the cause for his rejection.on its own,the explanation that diaz was discharged as part of a general reduction in force fails this requirement.workforce reduction explains why eagle produce laid off a group of its workers,but it does not explain why diaz was chosen to be part of that group.because no other explanation was given with respect to diaz,eagle produce failed to satisfy its burden at stage two on his claim,and summary judgment was inappropriate 
eagle produce did,however,provide legitimate,explanations for the layoffs of moreno and mancilla by stating that they were each chosen to be part of the reduction in force because of damage caused to company property.those explanations were individualized,unlike the explanation given to diaz,and reflected concerns about job performance unrelated to the workers protected status.see pottenger potlatch,cir concerns satisfied stage two under the mcdonnell douglas framework.the presumption of discrimination that was created by the prima facie cases accordingly disappears with respect to moreno and mancilla.wallis,at.
the final stage of the mcdonnell douglas analysis requires moreno and mancilla to raise a genuine issue of fact concerning whether the facially legitimate reasons proffered by eagle produce are pretextual.coleman,at.the workers may demonstrate pretext either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason likely motivated eagle produce or indirectly by showing that the company proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.snead metro.prop.cas.ins,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
plaintiffs argue that the explanations for their layoffs lack credibility for three reasons.first,they contend that a seasonal slowdown did not reduce eagle produce need for tractor workers.second,they argue that eagle produce offered inconsistent explanations for the layoffs.finally,they contend that the explanations lack credibility because brandt violated the company handbook by terminating workers without considering the lengths of their employment.we address these arguments in turn.
the seasonal slowdown 
there is no dispute that eagle produce need for tractor workers decreased in the winter of.the total number of employees at the aguila farm in february,including workers,was less than half of the number employed in july of the same year.according to john redmond,the vice president of phoenix agro invest,the efficiency gained by the increased use of plastic mulch reduced crew total work hours from in january and february to only for the same period in.daffern corroborated this testimony.
brandt continued to hire new workers during the slowdown,but that does not suggest that the slowdown did not occur.he hired two workers for crew in december and four more in the first two months of,but the evidence clearly suggests that the hires were necessitated by the decisions of five other workers to quit during the same period.there is no evidence that crew operations ceased altogether in the winter.brandt needed to make some hires to sustain a minimum operational level even during the slowdown.
evidence that eagle produce need for tractor drivers does not decline during the winter similarly fails to create a genuine issue of fact.daffern testified that tractor drivers perform a c
