following the panel decision in this case,see united states johnson,cir,appellants moved for rehearing en banc,noting the supreme court grant of certiorari in united states rapanos,cir.we held their petition in abeyance pending a decision in that case.following the decision in rapanos united states,d,appellants supplemented their previous petition.they request that we grant rehearing en banc to resolve the conflict between the panel decision and rapanos,or,alternately,that we vacate the decision with prejudice on the ground that the evidence in the record supports a judgment in their favor.the government filed a response requesting that we vacate our previous decision and remand to the district court.after careful consideration,we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with rapanos,as described below.
i.the panel decision 
this case began when the united states filed a civil action alleging that defendants now appellants,a group of cranberry farmers in carver,massachusetts,had discharged pollutants into waters without a permit in violation of and of the clean water act cwa.in response,appellants contended that the united states lacked jurisdiction over the three properties in question the cross street site the fosdick street site and the street site collectively,the target sites.
in separate rulings on liability and remedy,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.the district court denied appellants motion for reconsideration,stating that there is a sufficient basis for the united states to exercise jurisdiction because the undisputed evidence shows that the three wetlands are hydrologically connected to the navigable weweantic river by nonnavigable tributaries.
in an appeal to this court,appellants challenged the district court judgment that the jurisdiction of the cwa extends to the target sites.first,they asserted that their property is not covered by the environmental protection agency epa regulation promulgated to carry out the cwa.in the alternative,appellants argued that,if their property is covered by the regulation,either the regulation exceeds the authority granted by the cwa,or the cwa exceeds congress authority under the commerce clause.
we affirmed the trial court judgment in a divided decision,with two members of the panel concurring in the judgment for different reasons,and one member dissenting.one member of the majority concluded that the hydrological connection between the target sites and the weweantic river establishes a significant nexus between the sites and the river,sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the cwa without creating constitutional issues under the commerce clause.for two of the target sites,in the view of this judge,the hydrological connection depended on diffusion of water through wetlands.see at.
the other member of the majority read the record differently to conclude that the hydrological connection was a system of tributaries,some of which happened to flow through wetlands or other bogs.see id.at.the concurring panelist thus concluded that it was unnecessary to decide whether the diffusion of water through wetlands was a sufficient hydrological connection to support a significant nexus.id.
the dissent concluded that the united states may not constitutionally regulate wetlands that are neither themselves navigable nor truly adjacent to navigable waters.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.moreover,even if the epa assertion of jurisdiction was constitutional,the dissent would have held that the government attempt to assert jurisdiction over appellants wetlands is inconsistent with its own regulations because the system of tributaries linking the target sites to the weweantic includes other wetlands.because the regulations explicitly exclude wetlands adjacent to waters that are themselves wetlands,the dissent argued that the government lacked jurisdiction under its own regulations.id.at 
ii.response to the panel decision 
as noted,appellants filed a petition for rehearing en banc pursuant to rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,arguing that the case should be reheard following the supreme court decision in rapanos.we ordered appellants petition held in abeyance pending the supreme court decision in rapanos.we further stated that appellants could file a supplemental petition for rehearing en banc within fourteen days after the decision in rapanos was issued,and the government could then respond.
iii.rapanos united states 
the decision in rapanos united states,d,resolved two consolidated cases from the sixth circuit.in one case,the united states brought an enforcement action alleging that property owners and their affiliated businesses deposited fill materials into wetlands without a permit,in violation of the cwa.id.at.in the other,property owners were denied a permit to deposit fill material in a wetland approximately one mile from a lake and,after exhausting their administrative appeals,they filed suit.id.
in both cases,the district court found that there was federal regulatory jurisdiction over the sites in question,and the sixth circuit affirmed.the supreme court then consolidated the cases and granted certiorari to decide whether these wetlands constitute waters of the united states under the cwa,and,if so,whether the cwa is constitutional.see id.at.
the court issued a split decision construing the phrase waters of the united states as used in the cwa.the plurality concluded that the phrase waters of the united states includes only relatively permanent,standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographic features that are described in ordinary parlance as streams,oceans,rivers,and lakes.id.at.thus,for purposes of determining federal regulatory jurisdiction,only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the united states in their own right,so that there is no clear demarcation between waters and wetlands,are adjacent to such waters and covered by the act.id.at emphasis in original.the plurality vacated the decision of the sixth circuit in both cases and,noting the paucity of the record,remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
justice kennedy concurred in the judgment,but rejected the plurality rationale.instead,he concluded that jurisdiction extends to wetlands that possess a significant nexus to waters that are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made.id.at.justice kennedy further found that wetlands possess the requisite nexus if either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region,they significantly affect the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as navigable.id.at.where the wetlands in question are adjacent to waters,the government may rely on adjacency to establish its jurisdiction.id.at.where the wetlands are adjacent to nonnavigable tributaries,a bsent more specific regulations the government must establish a significant nexus on a basis.id.at.
justice stevens authored a dissent joined by three other justices.in the view of the dissenters,to the extent that the cwa includes a significant nexus requirement,this requirement is categorically satisfied as to wetlands adjacent to navigable waters or their tributaries.id.at.the dissent concluded by noting specifically that all four justices who have joined this opinion would uphold the corps jurisdiction in all other cases in which either the plurality or justice kennedy test is satisfied id.at.
iv.subsequent motions 
following the supreme court decision in rapanos,appellants filed a supplemental petition for rehearing en banc challenging the view in one of the panel opinions that a hydrological connection constitutes a jurisdictionally sufficient significant nexus.appellants contend that rehearing is necessary to resolve the tension between the panel opinion and rapanos.they argue that under either the plurality opinion or justice kennedy concurrence,a hydrological connection is insufficient to establish jurisdiction,although they also argue strenuously that the plurality test alone should apply.alternatively,appellants contend that the evidence in the record is sufficient to support a finding in their favor under the standards in rapanos,and urge that we vacate the decision and direct the district court to enter judgment for them.
the united states opposes the petition for en banc review and urges us instead to vacate the panel decision and remand the case to the district court.the government argues that additional factfinding is necessary before the legal principles articulated in rapanos can be applied in this case.moreover,the government asserts that on remand it should be allowed to establish cwa jurisdiction under either the rapanos plurality test or justice kennedy test.
remand to the district court 
we agree with the government that remand to the district court for application of the rapanos standards is appropriate.the parties presented their cases in the district court without any awareness of the standards that now apply.they should now have an opportunity to develop their positions in the district court with an awareness of these standards.however,the question of what legal standard to apply is one of some complexity,and other courts have taken varying approaches to the issue.we conclude that the united states may assert jurisdiction over the target sites if it meets either justice kennedy legal standard or that of the plurality.we explain our reasoning.
a.other courts application of rapanos 
in the months since rapanos,four courts have applied its legal district courts and two courts of appeals.
decisions of district courts 
in united states evans,wl,the middle district of florida adopted justice stevens suggestion to apply either the plurality or justice kennedy standard.that court cited the supreme court decision in marks united states for the proposition that w hen a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.evans at citing marks united states,d.the court noted that narrowest grounds is understood as the less common ground,evans at citing johnson bd.of regents of the of,cir,but found that because the plurality and justice kennedy articulated different standards for application on remand it was unclear which would control.hence,the court adopted justice stevens approach.evans at.
the northern district of texas used a sharply contrasting approach in united states chevron pipe line,d,determining that because of the lack of a clear legal standard in rapanos,it would instead rely on precedent within its own circuit.the court noted that the supreme court failed to reach a consensus of a majority as to the jurisdictional boundary of the cwa.it added that justice kennedy advanced an ambiguous a significant nexus exists to waters that be navigable.this test leaves no guidance on how to implement its vague,subjective centerpiece.that is,exactly what is significant and how is a nexus determined id.at internal citation omitted.the court then concluded 
because justice kennedy failed to elaborate on the significant nexus required,this court will look to the prior reasoning in this circuit.the fifth circuit,as discussed above,has interpreted the waters of the united states narrowly under the opa.without any clear direction on determining a significant nexus,this court will do exactly as chief justice roberts declared feel its way on a basis.
id.the court did not discuss justice stevens instruction.
decisions of courts of appeals 
the ninth circuit,the first circuit court to apply rapanos,concluded without analysis that justice kennedy concurrence provides the controlling test.cal.river watch city of healdsburg,cir.the court stated 
justice kennedy,constituting the fifth vote for reversal,concurred only in the judgment and,therefore,provides the controlling rule of law.see marks united states,d explaining that w hen a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.
id.at.without further discussion,the ninth circuit applied justice kennedy test.the court did not acknowledge justice stevens instruction.
most recently,in united states gerke excavating,cir,the seventh circuit also found that justice kennedy test is controlling without discussing justice stevens instruction.the court paraphrases marks united states 
when a majority of the supreme court agrees only on the outcome of a case and not on the ground for that outcome,judges are to follow the narrowest ground to which a majority of the justices would have assented if forced to choose.in rapanos,that is justice kennedy ground.
id.at citing marks,at.curiously,without explanation,the court equates the narrowest opinion with the one least restrictive of federal authority to regulate.it states 
the plurality justices thought that justice kennedy ground for reversing was narrower than their own,because they concluded their extensive and in places harsh criticism of the concurrence by saying that justice kennedy tips a wink at the agency,the corps of engineers,inviting it to try its same expansive reading again.
justice kennedy test is narrower so far as reining in federal authority is concerned than the plurality in most cases,though not in all because justice kennedy also said that by saying the act covers wetlands however remote possessing a connection with a continuously flowing stream however small,the plurality reading would permit applications of the statute as far from traditional federal authority as are the waters it deems beyond the statute reach.
id.at,quoting rapanos.at emphasis added.gerke concludes by acknowledging the following anomaly if justice kennedy finds federal jurisdiction over a particular site using the significant nexus test the four dissenters would also find jurisdiction.however,if justice kennedy does not find federal jurisdiction,there could be instances where both the plurality and the dissent disagree with his conclusion.id.at.in other words,there could be a case in which justice kennedy 
would vote against federal authority only to be outvoted the four dissenting justices plus the members of the rapanos plurality because there was a slight surface hydrological connection.the plurality insistence that the issue of federal authority be governed by strict rules will on occasion align the justices in the plurality with the rapanos dissenters when the balancing approach of justice kennedy favors the landowner.
id.however,gerke writes off this rare case,concluding that as a practical matter the kennedy concurrence is the least common denominator.id.
interpretation of marks 
the marks directive that w hen a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds,marks,at.internal citation omitted,has proven troublesome in application for the supreme court itself and for the lower courts.therefore,the genesis of that directive and its application require scrutiny.
in marks,the defendant raised a due process challenge to his obscenity conviction on the grounds that he had been punished retroactively under a definition of obscenity laid out in miller california,d,when he had actually engaged in the punished conduct prior to the miller decision.the narrowest grounds approach emerged when the court examined miller predecessor,memoirs attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts,d,to determine whether the law had provided fair warning at the time of the defendant conduct.marks,at.in memoirs,a majority of the supreme court found that a lower court erred in finding a book obscene and thus unprotected by the first amendment.however,three justices felt that materials would not be protected by the first amendment if they were deemed obscene,memoirs,at.brennan,while two other justices insisted that th
