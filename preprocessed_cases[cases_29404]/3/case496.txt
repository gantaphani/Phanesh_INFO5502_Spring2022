upset because their neighbor cattle come onto their property,eating the vegetation,defecating,and trampling the ground and sensitive creek beds,plaintiffs sued their neighbors the wemples,the county of plumas,and the board of supervisors of the county of plumas county for trespass,nuisance,injunctive relief,taxpayer relief,declaratory relief,inverse condemnation,violation of civil rights and preemption by state law.only plaintiffs action against the county is at issue in this appeal.on appeal plaintiffs claim the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the county after sustaining the county demurrer to each of the six causes of action alleged against the county without leave to amend.we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on march,the board of supervisors of plumas county adopted ordinance,amending title of the plumas county municipal code by adding chapter regarding open range lands the ordinance.the ordinance created two areas of open range land,the bucks lake area open range and the last chance creek open range.plumas county.pursuant to its authority under food and agriculture code section,the county declared such areas of land to be areas devoted chiefly to the grazing of livestock and within those areas,no owner or rightful possessor of land had the right to take up an estray animal found upon his or her land,unless the land was entirely enclosed with a lawful fence the ordinance also gave the owner or rightful possessor of unfenced land within the designated open range the right to a reasonable rental fee from any person who pastures livestock thereon,subd.a.the term reasonable rental was defined as at least aum values used for williamson act contracts in the area or forest service lease fees in the allotment area,whichever is higher.ibid.
in,plaintiffs bought a parcel of land known as the cottonwood property located within the last chance creek open range designation of the ordinance from to and again in,the wemples received forest service permits to lease land adjacent to plaintiffs cottonwood property and they grazed their cattle,including four bulls,on or near plaintiffs property.plaintiffs property was physically damaged trampled and defecated upon as the result of the wemples cattle trespassing on their property.the wemples did not pay plaintiffs for the use of plaintiffs land and plaintiffs attempts to contact the wemples for payment went unanswered.
on april,plaintiffs filed their complaint against the wemples and the county.plaintiffs sued the wemples for trespass and nuisance.plaintiffs sought injunctive relief against both the wemples and the county.as to the county only,the plaintiffs alleged five additional causes of relief,declaratory relief,inverse condemnation,violation of civil rights and preemption by state law.
plaintiffs generally alleged the ordinance improperly shifted the burden of animal grazing from cattle ranchers to private property owners falling within the open ranges.specifically,plaintiffs property had been trampled,defecated upon,and damaged by the freely roaming cattle.the burden of figuring out to whom the cattle belonged,collecting a reasonable rental fee,and erecting a lawful fence if the owner wanted to keep the cattle out,fell on the owner.plaintiffs also alleged the value of their property was significantly diminished subsequent to the enactment of the ordinance.
as to the county,plaintiffs alleged the ordinance was an unconstitutional taking of their property under the fifth amendment to the united states constitution and section of article i of the california constitution,deprived the plaintiffs of the privileges and immunities owed to them under the federal constitution,deprived plaintiffs of substantive and procedural due process under the code of civil procedure,the state and the federal constitutions,violated plaintiffs constitutional rights to equal protection,and was preempted by state law prohibiting the enactment of any measure constituting commercial rent control.
the county demurred to the complaint on the ground that each cause of action failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the county.code civ.
the trial court agreed with the county and sustained the county demurrer to the third through eighth causes of action without leave to amend.a signed written order,constituting a judgment,was subsequently entered and filed dismissing the county from the action.code civ.plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
background to california fencing out and fencing in laws 
at common law,every unwarrantable entry on another soil the law entitles a trespass by breaking his close,citation.and this was true whether the land was inclosed or uninclosed blevins mullally,original italics.under the common law rule,the party was answerable not only for his own trespass,but that of his cattle.ibid.
this rule of common law requiring owners of cattle to keep them confined to their own close was,however,abrogated in the first session of the california legislature in by an enactment commonly referred to as a fencing out statute limiting the right to take up livestock estrays to plaintiffs who maintain a proper fence around their land.stats,ch,waters moss cal,shively dye creek cattle th,fn,d williams goodwin d.davis blasingame,blevins mullally,supra.at,before the discovery of the gold mines california was exclusively a grazing country its only wealth consisting in vast herds of cattle,which were pastured exclusively upon uninclosed lands.this custom continued to prevail after the acquisition of the country by the united states waters moss,supra,at.traditional open range grazing allowed the moving of cattle to and from summer and winter pasturage.ellickson,of coase and cattle dispute resolution among neighbors in shasta county.for a time,the fencing out rule the landowner builds a fence to keep the cattle out,and not the common law fencing in rule the cattle owner builds a fence to keep his cattle in,applied to all the land in california.davis blasingame,supra,at.
starting in,as conditions within the state changed from a pastoral to an agricultural or horticultural use of the land,the common law rule of fencing in cattle began to be restored to particular areas and counties within california.williams goodwin,supra,d at.davis blasingame,supra.at.eventually the common law rule exceptions became so numerous a comprehensive legislative response was triggered.ellickson,of coase and cattle dispute resolution among neighbors in shasta county,supra.at.the estray act of stats,ch,repealed all fencing out laws and restored the common law requiring fencing in for all but the six northernmost counties of del norte,lassen,modoc,shasta,siskiyou,and trinity.montezuma improv.simmerly cal.the county of del norte was dropped from the fencing out counties in.stats,ch.
the california legislature continued the existing estray provisions when it adopted the agriculture code in.stats,ch.however,the legislature added at the same time a provision allowing voters of a supervisorial district to optionally adopt the fencing out laws.stats,ch.in,the authority to optionally declare an area of land to be devoted chiefly to grazing was transferred to the county board of supervisors.stats,ch.at that time,the county board of supervisors authority to declare an area to be grazing land became food and agriculture code section.stats,ch.the ordinance in this case was adopted by the county board of supervisors in pursuant to this statutory authority.
the right to recover trespass damages has been consistently linked to the right to seize estrays governed by fencing laws.hahn garratt cal,williams goodwin,supra,d at.therefore,if fencing out laws apply,the person in possession of unfenced land may neither seize estrays nor sue for trespass or injunctive relief,supra,at.an exception may exist,however,if animals are affirmatively herded onto the other person unfenced property,that is,a person has intentionally driven them to and collected them upon such land.logan gedney cal,cramer jenkins,see light united states,elquist rasmussen cir.a trespass action may still be available for such deliberate incursion onto another property 
an uncodified statute is applicable in plumas county to the question of whether a person in possession of unfenced land may sue for intentional,as opposed to negligent,trespass in the california legislature enacted a statute entitled an act to prevent trespass upon real estate by live stock providing,in relevant part it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to herd or graze any live stock upon the lands of another in the counties of plumas,lassen and modoc without having first obtained the consent of the owner or owners of the land so to do.stats,ch,italics added.if livestock is herded or grazed on another person property in violation of this statute,the owner of the livestock is liable for all damages done by said live stock together with costs of suit,and said live stock may be seized as estrays.stats,ch.
section of this statute provides the act is not applicable to any live stock running at large on the ranges or commons.stats,ch.it has been held that when herders are in charge of animals,those animals are not considered to be running at large.spect arnold cal,cramer jenkins,supra.to put it a different way,animals are running at large when they are moving onto or across property on their own and not as the result of some human intentional conduct.
although this statute was never codified,it has never been repealed or amended.nor has the statute been repealed by implication since it can be read consistently together with the fencing out laws.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,the presumption against implied repeal is so strong that,t o overcome the presumption the two acts must be irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.the courts are bound,if possible,to maintain the integrity of both statutes if the two may stand together.the uncodified statute remains good law therefore,as to the named counties at a minimum,fencing out laws do not limit the right to sue for damages from the intentional herding or grazing of livestock without the consent of the owner.stats,ch,cramer jenkins,supra.at.
it is in the context of these laws plaintiffs dispute with their neighbors and the county arose.
standard of review 
our review of the trial court actions in sustaining the county demurrer without leave to amend is governed by principles.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,quoting blank kirwan cal d.our review of the legal sufficiency of the complaint is de novo,we exercise our independent judgment about whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citation.montclair parkowners city of montclair th,d.
we are concerned in this appeal only with the causes of action stated against the county.accordingly,we consider only the arguments concerning those causes of action which are stated against the county the third,fourth,fifth,sixth,seventh,and eighth.the remaining allegations,not alleged against the county,do not state causes of action upon which relief may be granted against the county as a matter of law.code civ,subd.e.

both the state and federal constitutions guarantee real property owners just compensation when their land is taken for public use cal,art.i,amend.the fifth amendment takings clause is made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment.palazzolo rhode island,d,kavanau santa monica rent control bd.cal th,d,kavanau.the california constitution also requires just compensation when private property is damaged for public use.cal,art.i.by virtue of including damage to property as well as its taking,the california clause protects a somewhat broader range of property values than does the corresponding federal provision.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cal th,d.apart from that difference,however,the california supreme court has construed the state clause congruently with the federal clause.ibid.
it has been recognized e ven the wisest lawyers would have to acknowledge great uncertainty about the scope of the united states supreme court takings jurisprudence.nollan california coastal comm,d,dis.opn.of stevens,nollan.nevertheless,some general rules have taken shape in recent years and have just been clarified by the united states supreme court.
when the government physically takes possession of an interest in property or authorizes a physical invasion of property by a third party for a public purpose,the united states supreme court has indicated the government has a categorical duty to compensate the owner for a taking.brown legal foundation of,d,accord,lingle chevron,d,lingle loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d,loretto.this per se rule recognizes an owner right to exclude others as one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.kaiser aetna united states,d.a continuous right to traverse property is a physical occupation of the property for purposes of this rule.nollan,supra,at.at,d at.
where the government action does not result in any physical invasion of property,the action will be considered a taking of property if the regulation deprives the owner of all economically beneficial or productive use of the land.lucas south carolina coastal council,d,lucas lingle,supra,d.t he government must pay just compensation for such total regulatory takings,except to the extent that background principles of nuisance and property law independently restrict the owner intended use of the property.lingle,supra,at.at,d at.
in the special context of exactions lingle,supra,at.at,d at,where the government requires a dedication of the property to public use as a condition of a discretionary permit,the government can demand the easement without paying compensation if the exaction of the easement will substantially advance the same governmental interest that would furnish a valid ground for denial of the permit.nollan,supra,at.at,d at.the adjudicative exaction imposed by the government must be roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development.lingle,supra,at.at,d at see dolan city of tigard,d,dolan see san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th,d.
otherwise,resolving whether the government action works a taking involves what the united states supreme court has described as essentially ad hoc,factual inquiries.penn central transp.new york city,d,penn central see lingle,supra,at.at,d at.several factors have particular significance.specifically,the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations,and the character of the governmental action are relevant considerations.penn central,supra,at.at,d at.these three inquiries aim to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.accordingly,each of these tests focuses directly upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon private property rights.lingle,supra,at.at,d at.t he penn central inquiry turns in large part,albeit not exclusively,upon the magnitude of a regulation economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.id.at.at,d at.
the california supreme court has enumerated a number of other additional,nonexclusive factors,taken from united states supreme court cases,which might be relevant considerations in a particular case of alleged penn central regulatory taking.these include whether the regulation interfere s with interests that are sufficiently bound up with the reasonable expectations of the claimant to constitute property for fifth amendment purposes citation whether the regulation affects the existing or traditional use of the property and thus interferes with the property owner primary expectation citation the nature of the state interest in the regulation citations and,particularly,whether the regulation is reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial public purpose citation whether the property owner holding is limited to the specific interest the regulation abrogates or is broader citation whether the government is acquiring resources to permit or facilitate uniquely public functions,such as government entrepreneurial operations citation whether the regulation permit s the property owner to profit and to obtain a reasonable return on investment citation whether the regulation provides the property owner benefits or rights that mitigate whatever financial burdens the law has imposed citations whether the regulation prevent s the best use of the land citation whether the regulation extinguish es a fundamental attribute of ownership citation and whether the government is demanding the property as a condition for the granting of a permit citations.kavanau,supra,cal th,d.the factors should not be used as checklist,but applied only as appropriate.id.at,d.there is no set formula for identifying a taking.lucas south carolina coastal council,supra,d,loretto,supra,d.
we keep in mind t hese inquiries are informed by the purpose of the takings clause,which is to prevent the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.citation.palazzolo rhode island,supra,at.at,d at see yee city of escondido,d.
sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations of a taking 
in a patchwork of allegations throughout their complaint plaintiffs allege an unconstitutional taking without just compensation by the county.we find plaintiffs specific allegations of a taking in the third,sixth,and a portion of the seventh causes of action.
the plaintiffs third cause of action seeks injunctive relief against the county unlawful actions.the complaint alleges a number of actions and inactions by the county,but principally alleges the county is unlawfully violating the united states supreme court decisions in loretto,supra,d,nollan,supra,d,and dolan,supra,d,all cases involving the physical occupation of property or the special context of land use exactions requiring the dedication of an easement allowing physical invasions of property in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.the third cause of action incorporates all the other allegations of the complaint,including the factual allegations described above in the factual and procedural background.
plaintiffs sixth cause of action for inverse condemnation alleges the actions of the county have damaged plaintiffs private property and so constitute an unlawful taking of property in violation of article i,section of the california constitution.plaintiffs allege,d efendants sacrificed the economic interests of plantiffs to benefit defendants.these actions constitute a direct,substantial,and peculiar burden on the plaintiffs property interests.further,defendants failed to advance a legitimate state interest,imposed burdens on plaintiffs that more fairly should be placed on the public at large,deprived plaintiffs of viable use and value of their property interests,and caused the damages alleged herein.the cause of action incorporates all the other allegations of the complaint as before.
plaintiffs seventh cause of action alleges a civil rights violation under section of title of the united states code section.plaintiffs allege defendant actions were unreasonable,arbitrary,capricious,and irrational exercises of defendant police power in violation of the takings,privileges and immunities,due process,and equal protection clauses of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments.with respect to the takings clause,plaintiffs specifically allege the county actions have damaged plaintiffs private property interests while no public use is served by such conduct.plaintiffs repeat the allegations from their sixth cause of action regarding defendants sacrificing plaintiffs economic interest,causing a direct,substantial,and peculiar burden on plaintiffs property interests,failing to advance a legitimate state or public interest,causing the imposition of burdens on plaintiffs that should be borne by the public,and depriving plaintiffs of the viable use and value of their property.plaintiffs add in their seventh cause of action that the unlawful conduct by defendants lacks the essential nexus to,and is not roughly proportional to,any necessary environmental mitigation or to any adverse impact on the public interest.the prohibitions and limitations on plaintiffs use and enjoyment of their property do not substantially advance or have any nexus with any legitimate government interest.
in their opposition to the county demurrer and here on appeal,plaintiffs contend their complaint sufficiently alleges an unconstitutional taking based on the ordinance forcing plaintiffs to accept the physical invasion of their property by their neighbor cattle.
discussion of plaintiff allegations of a taking 
the government effects a physical taking only where it requires the landowner to submit to the physical occupation of his land.yee city of escondido,supra,d.plaintiffs are not required by the ordinance to allow cattle onto their property.see moerman california th,d.plaintiffs may fence out the cattle with a lawful fence as defined in section of the ordinance.
such a fence itself would not be,as plaintiffs contend,a physical occupation of their land equivalent to the installed cable box at issue in loretto.unlike the situation in loretto,any fence,should plaintiffs decide to fence the property,would be erected by plaintiffs,its placement controlled by plaintiffs and would be owned and maintained as part of plaintiffs property.providing such fencing alternative is not,as plaintiffs argue,an unconstitutional prescription of their use of their property,manipulating their right as owners to exclusive possession within the meaning of loretto,supra,d.in loretto,the supreme court rejected the argument that owners could avoid having the cable equipment at issue installed simply by not renting their property.id.at,fn.at,fn,d at,fn.the supreme court stated,a landlord ability to rent his property may not be conditioned on his forfeiting the right to compensation for a physical occupation.ibid.no similar use restriction or condition is involved here.
plaintiffs also cite smith bivens fed.for support of their claim that requiring a fence to keep livestock out deprives them of their right to exclusive possession.that case involved the state of south carolina adoption of a type of fencing out statute for certain territory in colleton county,the effect of which was to essentially deprive the contesting owner of the only economically viable use of his property.the circuit court not surprisingly found an unconstitutional taking and granted an injunction,basing the decision on a south carolina supreme court case decision fort goodwin,finding another state statute that created a public pasture from a section of private lands and required the construction of a fence around all of it was an unconstitutional taking.smith bivens,supra,at.the facts,statutes,and historical use of the property before these courts was materially different to what is before us.their decisions are neither binding nor applicable here 
this case does not involve any land use permit sought by plaintiffs on which the county seeks to impose a condition requiring the dedication of any property interest for public use or other exaction.lingle,supra,at.at,d at,nollan,supra,d dolan,supra,d san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th,d.
nor does the county ordinance deprive plaintiffs of all economically beneficial or productive use of their land.lucas south carolina coastal council,supra,d.
what remains is plaintiffs allegation of or ability to adequately plead,if granted leave to amend,an unconstitutional regulatory taking under the ad hoc analysis courts have traditionally employed.penn central,supra,d,kavanau,supra,cal th,d.although ordinarily this analysis requires a factual inquiry,which may preclude a ruling on demurrer cwynar city and county of san francisco th,d,we conclude the trial court here properly concluded plaintiffs have not and could not plead a regulatory taking as a matter of law.see,long beach equities,county of ventura d.
the fencing out ordinance of the county recognizes and substantially fosters the important historic,traditional and economic use of rural property in california for open grazing land,a legitimate governmental purpose.penn central,supra,at.at,d at kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,requiring purpose and character of government action be considered.the ordinance directly authorizes this traditional use to continue within the designated areas identified as devoted chiefly to grazing.plaintiffs do not allege or suggest this effects a change in the actual existing use of the land in the designated areas,which apparently have continued to be primarily grazing land despite the adoption of the general fencing in rule for the county at large.kavanau,supra,cal th,d,factor two regarding existing or traditional use of the property.
the fencing out ordinance does not require property owners to fence their property,although it directs them to do so if they decide they do not want other people cattle on their land at all.if owners choose not to fence because of the expense,aesthetics,or other personal reasons,the owners are not forced to accept any intentional herding or grazing of other people cattle on their land,as we have explained above.they are only precluded from seizing livestock wandering at large or suing for negligent trespass damages.they can still try to move the cattle off their property.they can still contact the cattle owners,if known,to ask them to move their cattle along.if the cattle are still persistently and regularly present on the property after notification to the owners,a cause of action for intentional trespass and injunction may eventually ripen the landowners may thereby prevent the acquisition of any prescriptive rights.in the alternative,the landowners may choose,under the terms of section of the ordinance,to allow the intentional pasturing of cattle on their property in exchange for a reasonable rental fee.
therefore,the only potential economic burden of this ordinance is the occasional use of and damage to property caused by wandering cattle as they move on.plaintiffs have not shown,nor can we perceive how plaintiffs could show,this limited burden interferes with their reasonable expectations in buying this particular property within a traditional open grazing area when plaintiffs can always avoid it by fencing their property.penn central,supra,at.at,d at.
to the extent property owners within the last chance creek open range choose not to fence their property and to bear the occasional burden of cattle on their property,such owners have reciprocal rights with respect to all the other unfenced land in the area if they choose to raise cattle and obtain any applicable permits.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,factor seven regarding rights and benefits that mitigate the financial burden of the regulation.the ordinance does not itself limit plaintiffs best,or any,use of their property.ibid factor eight regarding whether the regulation prevents the best use of the land.nor does it extinguish any fundamental attribute of ownership.ibid factor nine.
the county fencing out ordinance simply does not unconstitutionally forc e some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.palazzolo rhode island,supra,at.at,d at citing armstrong united states,d.
the ordinance is not a taking under either the state or federal constitutions.the trial court did not err in sustaining the county demurrer to plaintiffs third,sixth,and the takings portion of plaintiffs seventh causes of action without leave to amend.
allegations of violation of civil rights under remainder of seventh cause of action privileges and immunities clause 
in their seventh cause of action for violation of their civil rights under section,plaintiffs briefly allege,in addition to their takings claim,that the county additional actions deprived them of the privileges and immunities owed to them under section of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.
plaintiffs did not oppose the county demurrer to this portion of their seventh cause of action and have submitted no argument on the issue in their briefs on appeal.accordingly,we deem plaintiffs to have abandoned the issue.arnold dow chemical th,d.
due process 
in their seventh cause of action for violation of their civil rights under section,plaintiffs also briefly allege,in addition to their takings claim,that the county further actions deprived the plaintiffs of substantive and procedural due process protection,including the right to be heard,under the code of civil procedure,the california constitution,and the united states constitution.on appeal plaintiffs only argue they have adequately stated a procedural due process claim.plaintiffs have,therefore,abandoned their claim regarding substantive due process.arnold dow chemical,supra,th at,d.
with respect to their procedural due process claim,plaintiffs contend they have adequately alleged their property has been unconstitutionally taken and that they have never been granted a hearing or right to be heard regarding the encroachment upon their property rights.
we have previously concluded the county ordinance is not an unconstitutional taking of plaintiffs property under either the fifth amendment or the california constitution and plaintiffs do not allege how the county has denied them a right to be heard regarding the ordinance.plaintiffs have not challenged the ordinance as improperly adopted by the county without public notice or opportunity for the public to be heard.see,et we conclude plaintiffs have not adequately stated a claim for violation of their procedural due process rights.
equal protection 
plaintiffs next allege,as part of their seventh cause of action for violation of their civil rights under section,that the county additional activities treated the plaintiffs differently from others similarly situated thus denying plaintiffs equal protection under the california constitution and united states constitution and favored defendants own interests over those of the plaintiffs.
plaintiffs contend on appeal,as they did below,the county has treated them differently from others similarly situated because of the operation of the ordinance with section,subdivision b section b specifically,section b requires plaintiffs as owners of property zoned to obtain a special use permit if they wish to conduct commercial animal husbandry upon their property.commercial animal husbandry is defined by section to mean the care and raising of hoofed livestock.if plaintiffs raise cattle on their property without a special permit,plaintiffs would be in violation of section b,an infraction at least under section.according to plaintiffs,however,neighboring cattle ranchers could conduct commercial animal husbandry on plaintiffs property without a special permit because of the operation of the ordinance allowing other people cattle to graze on plaintiffs property.plaintiffs might even be held liable for violating section b by reason of other people cattle being on their property.plaintiffs reason this is a denial of equal protection because there
