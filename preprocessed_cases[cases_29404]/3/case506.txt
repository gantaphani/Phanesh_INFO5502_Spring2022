because of a miscalculation,the feather river air quality management district the district banked and issued the jopson ranch jopson tons of marketable pollution credits more than it actually had earned for reducing agricultural burning.
section of the government code section grants the government the following immunity a public entity is not liable for an injury caused by misrepresentation by an employee of the public entity,whether or not such misrepresentation be negligent or intentional.the trial court concluded that the misrepresentation immunity provided by section protected the district from any liability to jopson arising from the miscalculation.the court therefore granted the district motion for summary adjudication.we affirm.
in california,the right to pollute the air can be bought and sold.air quality management districts have created a valuable commodity,the erc.the erc is evidenced by transferable certificates approved,banked,and issued by the districts.simply put,a polluter who pollutes less can sell the erc to allow the purchaser to pollute more.because burning of rice straw generates tons of airborne pollutants,the rice straw burning reduction act of the act provides erc to farmers in an attempt to reduce emissions.health.
on february,jopson applied for erc for reducing wheat,rice straw,and weed burning on six parcels of land in sutter county.under the act,the district is responsible for calculating,issuing,and registering the erc.the erc calculation involves a number of factors,including fuel loading factors.the loading factor reflects the quantity of refuse burned per unit of land area and must match the type of vegetation that is the subject of the erc application.the district calculated jopson erc,gave the required notices,and,after receiving no objections,banked the erc on behalf of jopson.
by september,jopson had agreed to sell its erc for million.shortly thereafter,the district reduced the number of erc at jopson request,with a commensurate reduction in price.the prospective buyer applied to the california air resources board carb to use the erc.carb concluded the district had either misidentified the type of vegetation on the property or applied an incorrect loading factor and notified the district of the calculation error.
the district recalculated the erc using the weeds rather than the wildland loading factor.as a result of correcting the district calculation errors by utilizing appropriate loading factors for weeds,jopson total erc were reduced from tons to tons,a total reduction of tons,or more than percent.the reduction meant a reduction in the purchase price of.
the district rules allow erc certificates to be changed,after notice and public hearing,to adjust the quantity of banked erc without the owner consent.the district,after recalculating the erc,asked jopson to voluntarily surrender its erc certificate.jopson complied,completed the sale,and then sued the district for negligence.
the parties filed for summary adjudication.the trial court granted the district motion on the sole ground that the governmental misrepresentation immunity affirmative defense disposed of jopson single cause of action for negligence.we independently review the application of the immunity law to the undisputed facts presented in the motion for summary adjudication.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d.
discussion 
section grants public entities immunity for negligent misrepresentation but not for negligence.distinguishing between the two torts has spawned an eclectic assortment of state and federal cases.jopson directs us to review the gravamen of the complaint to determine whether the essence of the claim is for misrepresentation or for negligence.while jopson insists that assessing the gravamen of the complaint test has been impliedly adopted by california courts,it urges us to expressly adopt the federal standard.moreover,jopson maintains that the district calculation of erc involved an operational task giving rise to a cause of action in negligence and not the communication of information,which would have involved a misrepresentation claim.
the district,however,argues that the gravamen of the complaint and operational task tests are mere euphemisms for negligence,and while both have been utilized in federal cases,they create a distinction so ephemeral that liability would swallow the immunity.the district insists that neither approach is,or should be,the law in california.
the term misrepresentation,as used in section,potentially lends itself to extremely expansive and elusive interpretations.johnson state of california cal d,johnson.the cases cited by both sides simply reflect the elasticity of the term and the somewhat line of demarcation between a claim of negligence,for which there is no immunity,and a claim of negligent misrepresentation,for which there is.
in johnson,the california supreme court avoided the potential quagmire posed by too broad a definition of misrepresentation by focusing on the legislature goal to exempt public entities in those cases in which private defendants typically face liability for misrepresentation.in short,misrepresentation,as a tort distinct from the general milieu of negligent and intentional wrongs,applies to interferences with financial or commercial interest.the legislature designed section to exempt the governmental entity from this type of liability.johnson,supra,cal d at.
in united states neustadt,d neustadt,the united states supreme court rejected the notion that the federal immunity statute h did not apply when the gist of the claim lies in negligence underlying the inaccurate representation neustadt,supra,at,d at.to say,as the fourth circuit did,that a claim arises out of negligence,rather than misrepresentation,when the loss suffered by the injured party is caused by the breach of a specific duty owed by the government to him,the duty to use due care in obtaining and communicating information upon which that party may reasonably be expected to rely in the conduct of his economic affairs,is only to state the traditional and commonly understood legal definition of the tort of negligent misrepresentation,id.at,d at.
yet,as jopson emphasizes,the united states supreme court later distinguished neustadt in block neal,d block by undertaking a review of the gravamen of the complaint.as we recognized in neustadt,the essence of an action for misrepresentation,whether negligent or intentional,is the communication of misinformation on which the recipient relies.the gravamen of the action against the government in neustadt was that the plaintiff was misled by a statement of fha appraisal prepared by the government.neustadt alleged no injury that he would have suffered independently of his reliance on the erroneous appraisal in this case,unlike neustadt,the government misstatements are not essential to plaintiff negligence claim.id.at,d at.
similarly,a state court of appeal also considered the gravamen of the action in finding that immunity shielded the government in tokeshi state of california d.tokeshi.regardless of the way plaintiffs couch their allegations,the gravamen of their action,pure and simply,is that they suffered injuries purportedly caused by their reliance on the government misinformation.id.at.
thus,misrepresentation does indeed lend itself to expansive and elusive interpretations.but the problem is more academic than real.the district vehemently resists scrutiny of the gravamen of the complaint as utilized in the federal cases.we,however,do not see a significant chasm between the state and federal cases,nor do we find that a gravamen test makes the misrepresentation immunity any less elusive to define.jopson,on the other hand,suggests that distinguishing operational tasks from communication of information clarifies the scope of the immunity.we disagree.
obviously,every tort of negligent misrepresentation involves both negligence and misrepresentation.in guild united states cir guild,the ninth circuit held that the key distinction in this area is between the performance of operational tasks and the communication of information.the government is liable f
