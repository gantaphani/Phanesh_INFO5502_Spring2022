the klamath river originates in eastern oregon and empties into the pacific ocean at crescent city,california.the klamath river fall chinook,an anadromous salmon species,begin life in the river upper reaches and tributaries,either in hatcheries or in the wild.as juveniles the klamath chinook migrate to sea and spend much of their lives in the klamath management zone,an area off the coasts of california and oregon.at age,or,they return,usually to their natal tributaries or hatcheries,to spawn and die.
in early,the national marine fisheries service nmfs projected that a critically low number of klamath chinook would escape that season harvest to survive and to spawn in the wild.to increase the projected number of klamath chinook,the nmfs adopted fishery management measures that substantially limited commercial and,to a lesser extent,recreational fishing in the klamath management zone for.
plaintiffs,who include fishermen,businesses,and fishing organizations,filed this action against the nmfs and other governmental entities to challenge the management measures.plaintiffs allege that the measures conflict with a number of substantive and procedural requirements set forth in the fishery conservation and management act magnuson act,et.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants,and we affirm.
introduction 
the events at issue in this dispute unfolded in early against a complicated regulatory backdrop.we first describe in general terms the regulation of pacific fisheries under the magnuson act.we then turn to the specific facts of this case.
regulatory background 
the magnuson act and fishery management plans 
congress passed the magnuson act in in order to take immediate action to conserve and manage the fishery resources found off the coasts of the united states b.the statute established eight regional fishery management councils,including the pacific fishery management council pfmc or the council.id.a f.the councils,composed of federal and state officials as well as private experts appointed by the nmfs,draft fishery management plans fmps,id.h,that are designed to achieve and maintain,on a continuing basis,the optimum yield from each fishery.id.b.the councils also propose regulations implementing these fmps to the secretary of commerce.id.c.acting through the nmfs,the secretary reviews fmps and their implementing regulations for consistency with the magnuson act,solicits public comment,and publishes final regulations in the federal register.id.a b,b.
the pacific coast salmon plan 
in,the nmfs approved the pacific coast salmon plan pacific plan,an fmp for the pacific salmon fisheries.see pacific plan revised,available at from through,the council recommended annual amendments to the pacific plan based on yearly salmon abundance estimates and social and economic factors affecting the fisheries.this process,which required and other procedures,proved too cumbersome to allow for timely implementation of the annual regulations and efficient fishery management.pacific plan at.in,the council therefore proposed a comprehensive framework amendment to the nmfs.pacific plan at.the amendment established consistent terms for salmon regulation that would apply every year,and it provided a mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments in the regulations without annual amendments to the fmp.at.shortly thereafter,the nmfs approved the amended pacific plan and promulgated implementing regulations,now codified at.
the amended pacific plan includes fixed measures,which can only be changed through formal rulemaking,and allows for flexible measures,which change from based on fishery conservation and management needs.see nw.envtl.def.ctr.gordon,cir.fixed measures include the procedures and schedules for making preseason and inseason adjustments to the regulations.flexible measures include determinations of the annual allowable levels of ocean harvests,proposed rule.
one of the most important features of the pacific plan management of klamath chinook is its spawning escapement goal.for natural stocks,the escapement goal is defined as the number of spawning adults needed to produce the maximum number of juvenile salmon that,after incubation and freshwater rearing,will to the sea for hatchery stocks,the escapement goal is that number of spawners needed to meet a hatchery artificial production plan.united states washington,cir.the nmfs first adopted a spawning escapement goal for the klamath chinook in.it required the agency to design annual management measures such that,by,klamath chinook,including natural spawners,would escape to spawn.see.
in december,the council,f aced with declining run sizes,proposed an amendment to the pacific plan that would set the escapement goal at percent of the potential adults from each brood of natural spawners,but no fewer than naturally spawning adults in any given year.hatchery spawners would not count toward this goal.the nmfs adopted this amendment to the pacific plan and implemented it in a regulation promulgated on may.the regulation has remained in effect,with minor adjustments,since then.see,may,may,lowering the percentage to.
annual management measures 
the process for setting the flexible annual management measures for pacific salmon fisheries begins in january,when the council releases a report describing abundance levels for the previous year salmon stocks.see pfmc,council operating procedure preseason mgmt.process.in february,the council drafts preseason report i,which makes stock abundance forecasts and harvest and escapement estimates for the coming season when recent regulatory regimes are projected on current year abundance.id.in early march,the council meets in public to discuss various management options for the coming season in that year.it then releases preseason report ii,which proposes not more than three alternative regulatory options to meet fmp management objectives.id.the council holds public meetings on the proposed salmon management options in late march.after receiving comments from the public,the council chooses from among the options at its early april meeting.most of that meeting is open to the public.see pacific plan at.the council then forwards its proposed management measures to the nmfs for final approval.annual management measures for the pacific salmon fisheries are published in final form in the federal register in early may.
klamath chinook and management measures 
klamath river salmon have suffered dramatically in recent years.in the spring of,thousands of juvenile salmon died in the river before reaching the ocean.that fall,mature chinook,coho,and steelhead died in the river lower miles as they tried to swim upstream.the proliferation of a salmon parasite,exacerbated by low water levels caused by drought and irrigation use,may have caused this mass fish kill.see fish wildlife,klamath river fish september causative factors of mortality,exec.summary at ii,available at.
problems continued in and.in its review of ocean salmon fisheries,published in early review,the council reported that the klamath river run after the fishing season consisted of returning adult chinook,or about fewer than its preseason estimate.of these,only were natural spawners.review at.predictions for the postseason run,when juvenile salmon that had survived the would return to spawn,were even more dire.preseason report i,released in february,concluded that a repeat of the management measures would be expected to result in fewer than natural area adult spawners,and thus,fail to meet the minimum spawner requirement.preseason report i at.
the council met from march to,to develop proposed options for annual management measures under the pacific plan.these proposals appeared in preseason report ii.each proposal recommended drastically restricted fishing in the klamath management zone.
after public hearings in late march,the council met in early april to adopt its final recommendations.on the table was a proposal to lower the natural spawner escapement floor for klamath chinook by fish in order to spare fishermen a highly restricted season.the proposal was seriously considered by the council.one councilmember observed that m anaging below the floor could result in overfishing and would require an emergency rule.another insisted that the risk of reducing the escapement by fish was minimal,while a third stated that,in his view,the risk was worth the potential economic benefit to the fisheries.a fourth councilmember responded that the management doctrine for the klamath system was based on the council salmon fmp.i f the council moved away from its mandates,he argued,it would contribute to the problems in the klamath system,which was not in the interest of the council and the fishermen.the motion to recommend a lowered escapement floor for klamath chinook natural spawners from the number established in failed by a vote of to.
the council formally proposed its management measures in preseason report iii,released shortly after the april meeting.the report acknowledged that its recommended commercial fishery measures for the klamath management zone are substantially more restrictive than in.preseason report iii at.for example,commercial fishing in the oregon portion of the klamath management zone would be closed for all of may,june,july,and august.id.at.the report also acknowledged that recommended recreational fishery measures are somewhat more restrictive than in.id.
the council forwarded its proposed management measures to the nmfs.an april nmfs memorandum observed that during the process of developing final management recommendations for there was controversy relating to achievement of the klamath river fall chinook escapement floor of it noted that some commercial fishermen had appeared at the april council meeting to propose that it consider increasing harvest beyond what was developed in preseason report ii.the memorandum recognized that approval of this proposal would have resulted in returning klamath river chinook natural spawners below the fish floor,and stated that an emergency rule would have been required to allow for this deviation from the regulation amending the pacific plan.another nmfs memorandum observed that the restricted season recommended by the council would yield an expected million in income for pacific salmon fisheries,down from the value of million,and below the average.
declaring that projected shortfalls in numbers of returning salmon made certain reductions necessary in order to achieve the conservation objective of natural klamath river fall chinook adult spawners,the nmfs adopted the council recommendations without change in an action published in the federal register on may,may.the nmfs did not open a public comment period before publishing its action.rather,it invoked the administrative procedure act apa good cause exception based on the need to get the action finalized before opening of the fishing season.see b b.
there is little doubt that the restricted salmon fishing season under the management measures imposed significant hardship on pacific fishing communities.one estimate pegged the loss caused to commercial fishermen and related businesses at million.see stacy finz glen martin,imagine a year without local salmon,at.several of the individual plaintiffs in this suit attested to the threats the management measures posed to their livelihoods.
proceedings below 
plaintiffs commenced this suit within days of the publication of the management measures in the federal register.their suit has two parts.first,and most important,they object to the regulation establishing the natural spawner escapement floor for klamath chinook,under which the action was taken.second,they object to the action on several bases that are independent of the regulation.
the hoopa valley and yurok tribes,whose reservations straddle the klamath river and its tributaries,intervened in support of the nmfs.in a thorough and carefully reasoned opinion,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.see generally oregon trollers ass gutierrez,civ,wl,dist.lexis.the court concluded that plaintiffs attacks on the regulation establishing the natural spawner escapement floor were barred by the limitations period of the magnuson act.see f.in the alternative,the district court rejected plaintiffs claims on the merits,holding that the escapement floor reflected an eminently reasonable consideration when managing a fishery to maintain its viability.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also upheld the management measures against plaintiffs other objections.
on appeal,plaintiffs challenge every aspect of the district court decision.we disagree with the district court conclusion that the plaintiffs attack on the regulation is barred by the statute of limitations contained in f.however,we agree with the district court on the merits.we therefore affirm.
ii.statute of limitations 
we review a district court statute of limitations determination de novo.oja army corps of eng rs,cir.as originally drafted,the magnuson act provided that a plaintiff was required to bring suit to challenge a regulation within days of its promulgation,title iii,d,stat.congress amended this limitations period in.as now set forth in f,it reads as follows 
regulations promulgated by the secretary under this chapter and actions described in paragraph shall be subject to judicial review if a petition for such review is filed within days after the date on which the regulations are promulgated or the action is published in the federal register 
the actions referred to in paragraph are actions that are taken by the secretary under regulations which implement a fishery management plan,including but not limited to actions that establish the date of closure of a fishery to commercial or recreational fishing.
f emphasis added to indicate language added by amendment.
three of plaintiffs six causes of action challenge the natural spawner escapement floor as inconsistent with the magnuson act.the nmfs added the escapement floor to the pacific plan and its implementing regulations in.defendants contend that under f plaintiffs should have filed their challenge within thirty days of the promulgation of that regulation,and that their suit is therefore sixteen years too late.plaintiffs in response argue,inter alia,that the amendment to f renders their challenge to the regulation timely.for the reasons given below,we agree with plaintiffs.
before,the magnuson act only allowed judicial review of regulations.a challenge to a regulation had to be filed within thirty days of its promulgation.if f were still in its original form,plaintiffs claim,brought in june,would be clearly because the nmfs promulgated the regulation implementing the natural spawner escapement floor on may.see.at.
the fourth circuit addressed the version of f in kramer mosbacher,cir.there,the secretary of commerce promulgated a regulation establishing a million pound limit for the king mackerel season on july.on october,the secretary declared that king mackerel were overfished and announced that he would close the recreational fishing season on october.on november,he announced that the commercial fishing season would close on november.on november,plaintiffs sued to compel the secretary to double the total allowable catch of million pounds for the season.id.at.they argued that the limitations period for challenging million pound limit did not commence until october,when the secretary announced his intention to close the fishery,rather than on july,when he adopted the underlying regulation setting the total catch limit.id.at.
the fourth circuit concluded that the thirty day limit commences at the time the regulations are published and that this limit is to be strictly construed.at.the court held that the secretary is required by the regulations to close a fishery when its quota is reached as a result,catch limits are in fact put into operation on the date of the regulation publication,and not at some later time.id.citation omitted emphasis in original.because the suit was filed four months after the regulation promulgation on july,the court concluded that it was untimely.id.
our case mirrors kramer.if we were to apply f as it existed before its amendment,we would conclude that the statute of limitations for challenging the regulation establishing the natural spawner escapement floor expired in june of,thirty days after the promulgation of that regulation.however,congress amended f in specifically in order to change the result in kramer.see fishery conservation amendments of,stat.the house report makes this intention plain,stating that the amendment is a direct response to a portion of the decision of the fourth circuit court of appeals in kramer,at.
the text of the amended f provides that a plaintiff may challenge both an action and a regulation under which the action is taken so long as the suit is filed within thirty days of the action publication in the federal register.section f states that r egulations and actions shall be subject to judicial review if a petition for review is filed within days after the date on which the regulations are promulgated or the action is published in the federal register.the conjunctive and italicized that both regulations and actions are reviewable in a timely filed petition.see dawson city of seattle,cir describing the plain meaning of and.the disjunctive or also italicized that a petition is timely if it is filed within thirty days of either promulgation of the regulation or publication of the action.see united states tucor int l,cir interpreting the plain meaning of or.thus,as a straightforward textual matter,a petition filed within days of the publication of an action may challenge both the action and the regulation under which the action is taken.
if additional evidence were needed,the legislative history of the amendment makes clear that this reading reflects the intent of congress.the senate report accompanying the amendment stated that an affected party is unlikely to challenge a regulation until the regulation has a discernable practical is,until the agency takes an action under the regulation that has a material adverse effect on that party.the short limitations period in the statute,however,made such challenges untimely 
a substantial period may lapse between the time a regulation to implement a fishery management plan is published and the time action is taken by the secretary pursuant to the regulation.in many instances,it is only when such an action is taken that participants in the fishery can assess whether a petition for judicial review is necessary.the time lapse between publication o f a regulation and secretarial action may deny individuals the opportunity to challenge regulations at the point in time when they can determine that such a challenge is necessary.
reprinted in,emphasis added.according to the report,the amendment would remedy this problem by allow ing a challenge within days of the time that a secretarial action is published.id.
the house report made the same point 
under current law,a management plan or regulation can only be challenged in court within days after publication in the federal register.since some management regulations are prospective,this prevents interested parties from challenging those regulations at the time they are actually implemented.the amendments made by this subsection will allow a challenge within days of the time that a regulation is implemented.
at.the amendment sponsor in the house,representative jones,added his voice to this chorus.he stated that the amendment would permit suit to challenge a regulation either when initial management plan regulations are issued or when implementing actions are put into effect.cong.rec,statement of jones.
plaintiffs filed suit within thirty days of the publication of the management measures.under our reading of f as amended,the publication of these measures was an action within the meaning of the statute.therefore,plaintiffs had thirty days to attack both the action and the regulation under which the action was taken.the government makes three arguments to avoid this result.none is persuasive.
first,the government argues that plaintiffs waived an argument based on the amendment to f because they never raised it in the district court.this is not,strictly speaking,true.plaintiffs did raise this argument,although they did so only during oral argument on summary judgment.to the extent that we need to exercise our discretion to address this otherwise tardy argument,we are willing to exercise it in this case.because plaintiffs argument raises a purely legal issue whose resolution requires no further factual development,and because the issue would otherwise reappear in identical form the next time plaintiffs challenge annual management measures,we believe it appropriate to address this issue now.see ambulance,county of monterey,cir.
second,the government argues that our earlier holding in norbird fisheries,marine fisheries,cir,compels us to hold that plaintiffs challenge to the regulation is untimely.the government has misread our analysis in norbird.the entirety of our analysis of f in that case was as follows 
regulations promulgated by the secretary under the magnuson act are subject to judicial review in accordance with the administrative procedure act,et,if a petition for such review is filed within days after the date on which the regulations are promulgated.f.a separate section of the magnuson act confers jurisdiction on the district court over any case or controversy arising under the provisions of this chapter.d.this latter provision is to be read in conjunction with the provision governing judicial review of the regulations.that provision,f,deprives the district court of jurisdiction to hear an attack on the regulations if review is not sought within days of their promulgation.kramer mosbacher,cir.
at.as this passage shows,our analysis in norbird focused only on a challenge brought to a regulation under f.it did not address a challenge brought to an action,as distinct from a regulation.our citation to kramer underscores this exclusive focus on a regulation.the amendment to f,specifically designed to overrule the fourth circuit decision in kramer,relaxed the statute of limitations by allowing a challenge to an action taken under a regulation.we did not analyze in norbird the new provision in f allowing challenges to an action.
third,and finally,the government argues that plaintiffs challenge to the management measures is a challenge to a regulation,not to an action.the government has misunderstood the meaning of action as that term is used in f and defined in f.actions are defined in f as actions that are taken by the secretary under regulations which implement a fishery management plan,including but not limited to actions that establish the date of closure of a fishery to commercial or recreational fishing.there can hardly be a better fit between the management measures and this definition.
the management measures establish the date of closure of a fishery to commercial or recreational fishing by closing both commercial and recreational fishing for specified periods in specified areas in the klamath management zone.moreover,the management measures are taken under a regulation which implement s a fishery management plan.the regulations implementing the pacific plan are set forth at.the regulation in amendment to the pacific plan adding the escapement initially and for several years thereafter expressly included in the code of federal regulations.see appx.pt.iv a a.in,the express mention of the natural spawner escapement floor was removed from the code,see,but it remains incorporated by reference.a providing that conservation objectives are summarized in table of the pacific coast salmon plan pacific plan at table,describing natural spawner escapement floor.thus,the escapement goal is part of the regulations that implement the fmp at issue.
the nmfs adopted the management measures by following the process the pacific plan implementing regulations prescribes for actions.section,entitled annual actions,provides that the nmfs will annually establish management specifications by publishing the action in the federal register under.a emphasis added.that section further states that m anagement specifications are set forth in paragraphs b through n of this section.id.paragraph h is entitled seasons and provides,in part,that c ommercial seasons will be established or modified taking into account protection of depressed stocks present in the fishing areas.id.h.thus,management measures that set a season length are management specifications,which in turn are actions.
finally,the nmfs finalized and published the management measures pursuant to,the mechanism specified in for the publication of actions.section states that a nnual and certain other actions will be implemented by an action published in the federal register a emphasis added.the regulation sets forth a good cause exception to the requirement that otherwise applies to any action.id.b.when it published the management measures in the federal register,the nmfs invoked and its good cause exception.see.at.
it is not our job to determine whether the statute of limitations,as it now operates under f,is unwise,unfair,or unworkable.that job belongs to congress.our task is to interpret the statute.applying our reading of its plain terms,the management measures publication triggered a period during which plaintiffs could challenge the regulation establishing the natural spawner escapement floor.
iii.merits 
standard of review 
we now turn to the merits of plaintiffs claims.we review the nmfs construction of the magnuson act under the familiar test set forth in chevron,nrdc,d.see nrdc,marine fisheries,cir.we first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.so long as the agency construction is reasonably consistent with the statute,we defer to it.see also pronsolino nastri,cir.this test is satisfied if the agency interpretation reflects a plausible construction of the statute plain language and does not otherwise conflict with congress expressed intent.rust sullivan,d.
the magnuson act adopts the apa standard for judicial review of agency action set forth in a.f.we set aside an agency regulations if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.t he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation omitted.
attacks on the regulation 
three of plaintiffs six claims attack the regulation establishing the natural spawner escapement floor.plaintiffs claim that the regulation is inconsistent with the magnuson act definition of a stock of fish under that it is inconsistent with the national standard under a requiring that management measures be based upon the best scientific information available and that it is inconsistent with the national standard under a requiring that,t o the extent practicable,an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit.we address these claims in turn.
stock of fish under the magnuson act 
plaintiffs primary claim is that the magnuson act forbids the nmfs to distinguish between natural and hatchery spawners for the purposes of klamath chinook management and conservation.in the view of plaintiffs,the nmfs must count hatchery spawners towards any escapement goal for klamath chinook.if this were required,an escapement goal would be satisfied much more easily with less restrictive management measures.the practical impact of their argument,plaintiffs hope,is that fishermen would be allowed to catch more salmon in the klamath management zone.
the regulation,setting a natural spawner escapement floor,is designed to ensure that a certain number of naturally spawning fish survive,not that a certain number of naturally spawned fish survive.there is substantial overlap between the categories of salmon spawning in the wild naturally spawning and salmon born in the wild naturally spawned,but the categories are not identical.some salmon will spawn in the wild,and some salmon born in the wild will spawn in a hatchery.consistent with the regulation,the council defines natural spawners as or older fall chinook that spawn outside of the hatchery environment,regardless of their origin.ocean abundance projections and prospective harvest levels for klamath river fall chinook,season,at,available at.
plaintiffs contend that the categories of naturally spawning and hatchery spawning klamath chinook are part of the same stock of fish under the magnuson act.in their view,the nmfs may not manage members of the same stock of fish separately,or treat them differently for conservation purposes.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
a fishery is defined under the magnuson act as 
a one or more stocks of fish which can be treated as a unit for purposes of conservation and management and which are identified on the basis of geographical,scientific,technical,recreational,and economic characteristics and 
b any fishing for such stocks.
emphasis added.a stock of fish is a species,subspecies,geographical grouping or other category of fish capable of management as a unit.id.emphasis added.
plaintiffs make two arguments why naturally spawning klamath chinook are not a separate stock of fish within the meaning of.first,they point out that natural and hatchery spawners swim in the years between their departure from the river as juveniles and their return as adults.they also point out that the management measures,in their effort to meet the natural spawner escapement floor,limit the overall catch of chinook without distinguishing between natural and hatchery spawners.they argue from these two undisputed facts that natural spawning klamath chinook are not a category of fish capable of being managed as a unit within the meaning of and are hence not a stock of fish.
we see nothing in the magnuson act to compel this understanding of the term stock.a category is any of several fundamental and distinct classes to which entities or concepts belong,or a division within a system of classification.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed see also aid ass for lutherans usps,considering dictionary definition to determine if agency interpretation of a statute is reasonable.there is nothing in the act to suggest that natural spawners are not a division or distinct class,and hence a category,of klamath chinook.
the term stock is commonly used and generally understood in fisheries management to allow a distinction between natural and hatchery spawners.the nmfs routinely distinguishes between natural and hatchery stocks in other regulatory contexts.see,june,adopting hatchery policy under esa.similarly,a nonpartisan group of scientists established by congress to propose hatchery policy differentiates between hatchery stock and natural stock on a regular basis.see,hatchery scientific review group,hatchery reform principles and recommendations,at hatchery scientific review group,hatchery reform report to congress,at hatchery scientific review group,hatchery reform in washington state principles and emerging issues,fisheries magazine,june,at.
nor does the phrase capable of management as a unit preclude a distinction between natural and hatchery spawners.the nmfs has determined that the choice of a management unit may be decided on a number of different grounds it depends on the focus of the fmp objectives,and may be organized around biological,geographic,economic,technical,social,or ecological perspectives.d.this host of possible bases for choosing a management unit indicates the term flexibility.even assuming that the nmfs managed natural and hatchery spawners separately,plaintiffs do not identify anything in the statute or related regulations that would draw the line for the purposes of defining the appropriate unit at the distinction between natural and hatchery spawners.
we also note that although the magnuson act does not expressly distinguish between natural and hatchery spawners,a closely related statute does.the trinity river basin fish and wildlife management reauthorization act of,stat,a statute that regulates fisheries in one of the klamath river main tributaries,refers to naturally reproducing anadromous fish stocks.id,stat.the senate report on the statute,discussing a trinity river hatchery,noted that support for the hatchery should not impair efforts to restore and maintain naturally reproducing anadramous sic fish stocks,at.this clear intent to distinguish between natural and hatchery fish sheds light on congress wishes for the magnuson act.see jett dallas indep.sch,d scalia,concurring declaring that it is a rudimentary principle of construction that statutes dealing with similar subjects should be interpreted harmoniously.
in short,we see nothing in the act to prevent the nmfs from regarding naturally spawning klamath chinook as a stock of salmon within the meaning of,and to prevent the agency from adopting protective measures in an fmp to conserve this stock.even without the assistance of chevron deference,we would read the act in this way.our obligation to give chevron deference to the nmfs interpretation of the act that it is charged to administer removes any possible doubt.
second,plaintiffs rely on a district court decision interpreting the term species in the endangered species act esa as a basis for interpreting the term stock in the magnuson act.the esa requires the nmfs to protect endangered or threatened species.b.a species under the esa includes any distinct population segment of any species of fish which interbreeds when mature.id.in alsea valley alliance evans,d,the plaintiffs challenged the nmfs decision to list naturally spawning coho salmon as threatened.in making this determination,the agency ignored coho.see.the district court held that the listing of naturally spawning coho as threatened without regard to coho was arbitrary and capricious.in the view of the district court,coho populations are part of the same distinct population segment as natural coho populations,and l isting distinctions below that of a distinct population segment of a species are not allowed.d at.
we did not review the district court decision in alsea on the merits.see alsea valley alliance dep t of commerce,cir dismissing appeal on jurisdictional grounds.but even if the district court in alsea was correct in its interpretation of the esa which we do not decide,its decision is not relevant to the question before us.the esa and the magnuson act use different terminologies.the esa refers to species,while the magnuson act refers to stock.there is nothing in the esa,or in the district court decision in alsea,that even remotely suggests that species and stock have the same definition.
best scientific information available 
fishery management plans and their implementing regulations must be consistent with national standards for fishery management set forth in a.a regulation implementing a fmp will be upheld under a unless the secretary has acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner promulgating such regulations.alliance against ifqs brown,cir internal quotation omitted.stated another way,we will uphold a regulation against a claim of inconsistency with a national standard under if the secretary had a rational basis for it.see also yakutat,gutierrez,cir.
national standard requires that c onservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available.a.plaintiffs argue that there is no scientific basis to support an escapement goal that counts only natural spawners as relevant for conservation purposes.however,plaintiffs frame their argument purely in terms of statutory interpretation.they did not introduce any evidence to dispute the scientific basis for the escapement goal.in effect,plaintiffs would have us construe national standard to require as a matter of law that all klamath chinook must receive the same consideration for management and conservation.but the statute regulates fisheries,see,b,a,and fisheries include one or more stocks of fish.id.as we have just held,a stock may reasonably include only natural spawners.
even if plaintiffs had attacked the evidentiary basis for the escapement goal established in the regulation,the distinction between natural and hatchery spawners would pass muster on the record before us.where scientific and technical expertise is necessarily involved in agency,a reviewing court must be highly deferential to the judgment of the agency.wildlife fed army corps of eng rs,cir.the relevant administrative record for these purposes is the record compiled in to support the fmp amendment that established the escapement goal.see b providing that an fmp must take into account the best scientific information available at the time of preparation.while the nmfs did not file the record in this case,the record contains enough excerpts of that record to allow us to defer to the agency decisionmaking.
a lengthy analysis conducted in concluded that the natural spawner floor is needed to protect the production potential of the resource in the event of several consecutive years of adverse environmental conditions.in,the council found that a n evaluation of available information on the production potential of klamath river fall chinook indicates that a minimum escapement goal of naturally spawning adults must be protected in all years in order to prevent extended periods of low juvenile production.after a time series modeling test,the council deemed the natural spawner escapement floor sufficient to protect the stock and reduce the risk of prolonged depressed production,and to provide a high probability of attaining sufficient escapement for hatchery production needs.
there is no evidence in the record that the council and studies are outdated or flawed.bereft of any contrary science,plaintiffs bare allegation that the agency distinction conflicts with the best scientific evidence available fails.see nw.envtl.def.ctr.brennen,cir rejecting a best scientific information available claim because the challenger has not pointed to any scientific evidence inconsistent with the secretary decision see also massachusetts daley,cir observing that the challenger may have forfeited its challenge by not proposing any better science.midwater trawlers coop.dep t of commerce,cir affirming regulation based on best scientific evidence available when no new information contradicted the agency data.
managed as a unit 
national standard provides that,t o the extent practicable,an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit throughout its range,and interrelated stocks of fish shall be managed as a unit or in close coordination.a.the purpose of this standard is to induce a comprehensive approach to fishery management that is not jeopardized when fish live in the waters of more than one jurisdiction.b.as a senate committee report on the magnuson act explained,unity of management,or at least close cooper at ion,is vital to prevent jurisdictional differences from adversely affecting conservation practices.commerce comm,reprinted in a legislative history of the fishery conservation and management act of,at a legislative history.to further this goal,t he geographic scope of the fishery,for planning purposes,should cover the entire range of the stocks s of fish,and not be overly constrained by political boundaries.b.
the senate report used the klamath salmon to illustrate the problem addressed by national standard 
a separation of power is not reflective of the migratory habits of fish stocks,but is due to historic and political factors.as a result,inconsistent regulations have often developed.for example,the state of oregon maintains a salmon hatchery program.salmon reared in the oregon program de s cend oregon rivers and later may be found in california waters.these same salmon may then be caught legally under the california fishing regulations,but earlier in the season and at a smaller size than it would be legal to catch these fish under oregon fishing code.consequently,management of fishery resources from the national or regional perspective is important to sound conservation practices.
