introduction 
pursuant to code of civil procedure section hereafter ccp section authorizing taxpayer actions attacking government waste,appellants humane society and several individual california taxpayers filed this action seeking to bar,in part,the implementation of a amendment to revenue and taxation code,section that statute provides an exemption from california sales and use taxes for the gross receipts for farm equipment and machinery used primarily in producing and harvesting agricultural products,subd.a.appellants complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief that such exemptions should not apply to battery cage chicken coops,containers which allegedly provide chickens with inadequate space and hence violate animal cruelty laws.the superior court sustained respondents demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend.we affirm.
ii.factual and procedural background 
part of division of the revenue and taxation code,starting with section,relates to the imposition of sales and use taxes in california.chapter of that part,which starts with section,deals with exemptions from those taxes,exemptions mandated by federal law or the constitution,dealing with gross receipts from the sale or furnishing of electricity,gas,water,or with sales of gold medallions,m onetized bullion.
in,the legislature added several exemptions to the preexisting list.via assembly bill,passed by both houses of the legislature as an urgency measure and signed by the governor and becoming effective august,exemptions were extended to the taxes imposed by this part on the gross receipts from the sale of,and the storage and use of,or other consumption in this state of,farm equipment and machinery purchased for use by a qualified person to be used primarily in producing and harvesting agricultural products,subd.a.thereafter,definitions are provided for the terms q ualified person and f arm equipment and machinery,subd.b.the latter term is defined to include implements of husbandry which in turn is defined in a statute as including any tool,machine,equipment,appliance,device or apparatus used in the conduct of agricultural operations,subd.b.
by section,subdivision d,respondent state board of equalization sbe was charged with implementing this exemption,which it did via california code of regulations,title,section,effective july,tit,hereafter sometimes the sbe regulation.that regulation,entitled farm equipment and machinery,provides that included in that description are structures utilized for the purposes of housing,raising and feeding of livestock for the commercial production of plants.an egg production or poultry brooding facility is specifically included within this description.see,tit,subd.b a.
on february,appellants the humane society and four individuals alleged to be california taxpayers filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief in san francisco superior court as noted above,the complaint was filed pursuant to ccp section.it named as defendants respondents sbe and controller steve westly and alleged,among other things,that the implementation of section by the sbe violated penal code sections,subdivision b and,inasmuch as they allegedly allowed tax exemptions to poultry producers who kept hens in containers with inadequate exercise areas.these contentions are summarized via the allegations that sbe has wasted and unlawfully used public funds,and injured the public threatens to continue wasting and unlawfully using public funds,and injuring the public choosing not to collect tax revenue on purchases of battery cages that are both designed and used to criminally harm animals and that the alleged expenditures of state funds either cause,or threaten to cause,violations of the state cruelty code because they make battery cages more affordable and thereby increase the number of hens who can be confined.
in support of these general allegations,appellants alleged more specifically that approximately of hens in california are raised in conventional confinement systems.appellants complaint defined battery cages to mean a cage with a floor area of approximately inches by inches,providing square inches of floor space in which three to ten hens are continuously confined for nearly their entire lives and that the majority of hens in california are confined in battery cages at approximately weeks of age and thereafter until they are removed once their egg production slows,typically at to months of age appellants further alleged that the average california shed confines hens and that about million hens were so confined in california in.
the complaint went on to allege that guidelines issued by an egg producers trade organization allow hens to be confined in cages allowing each hen square inches of cage space it continued by noting that other publications had criticized this space allowance as inadequate,because it may cause hens to develop various health problems,and thus hens confined in battery cages suffer unnecessarily due to inherent flaws in the system.as a result,per the complaint,poultry systems have been criticized by several national and international governmental bodies and recently eliminated or dramatically reduced by several california egg producers.
on information and belief,appellants alleged that some california poultry and egg producers using battery cage systems claimed the farm equipment tax exemption provided by section starting in,and did so via the process detailed in the sbe regulation,including preparing and submitting a partial exemption certificate to the retailer selling the equipment.appellants note that such a certificate requires only that the person requesting the tax exemption state that he or she is engaged in the agricultural business,describe the type of farm equipment purchased or leased,and certify that the property purchased or leased will be used primarily in producing and harvesting agricultural products in accordance with s ection.regs,tit,appen.because of the tax exemption granted by the statute,appellants alleged,purchasers and users of such cages are currently exempt from of california sales or use tax,and in one alleged instance,a purchaser of such equipment was able to avoid to for the purchase of battery cages.
on march,respondents demurrered to the complaint,challenging both appellants standing as taxpayers and whether their complaint alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under section.both parties filed further memoranda of points and authorities in the case,which was argued to the lower court on march.during the course of oral argument,the lower court indicated its strong inclination toward sustaining the demurrer noting,among other things,that appellants were effectively asking it for a determination that needs to be made by the legislature.
although,toward the conclusion of the oral argument,counsel for appellants requested they be given leave to amend,the court indicated it was not inclined to do so.on april,the court issued its order sustaining respondents demurrer without leave to amend.a judgment of dismissal was entered on may.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
iii.discussion 
code of civil procedure section its purpose and limitations 
section has been the subject of considerable litigation in this state since its enactment almost a century ago.our colleagues in the third district recently summarized its intent thusly the purpose of this statute,which applies to citizen and corporate taxpayers alike,is to permit a large body of persons to challenge wasteful government action that otherwise would go unchallenged because of the standing requirement.citation.to this end,the statute has been construed liberally.citation.therefore,although by its terms the statute applies to local governments,it has been judicially extended to all state and local agencies and officials.citations.while the statute speaks of injunctive relief,taxpayer standing has been extended to actions for declaratory relief,mandamus and,in some circumstances,damages.citation.regardless of liberal construction,the essence of a taxpayer action remains an illegal or wasteful expenditure of public funds or damage to public property.citation.the taxpayer action must involve an actual or threatened expenditure of public funds.citation.general allegations,innuendo,and legal conclusions are not sufficient citation rather,the plaintiff must cite specific facts and reasons for a belief that some illegal expenditure or injury to the public fisc is occurring or will occur.citations.waste management of alameda county,county of alameda th,d waste management see also,to the same general effect,california for safety education brown th,d brown fort emory cove boatowners cowett d.cowett.and,in a case decided the following year,the same court declared that suits under section provide a general citizen remedy for controlling illegal governmental activity.connerly state personnel bd.th,d connerly.
the cases have,however,been careful to note that section has its limits.in particular,the courts have stressed that the statute should not be applied to principally political issues or issues involving the exercise of the discretion of either the legislative or executive branches of government.thus,in sagaser mccarthy d,the fifth district held that t he term waste as used in section means something more than an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or discretion.citations.appellants must cite specific facts and reasons supporting a belief that the state may be guilty of illegally spending public funds.to present such a case successfully,specific facts alleging a waste of public funds must be supported in the record.citation.otherwise,public officials performing their duties would be harassed constantly.citation.without more facts than found in this record,courts could risk trespassing into the domain of legislative or executive discretion.citation.sagaser,supra,d at.
but probably the precedent articulating these limits is sundance municipal court cal d,sundance.in that case,four public inebriates id.at,and one taxpayer brought an action in los angeles superior court challenging the enforcement of penal code section,subdivision f,the drunk in public statute their attack was based on various and sundry legal grounds ibid,but included among them was the allegation by the that criminal enforcement of that statute constitute s a waste of public funds and was hence enjoinable under section.both the trial court and our supreme court rejected this argument.interestingly,the supreme court started its discussion of this issue by directly,and obviously approvingly,citing the words of the trial judge in the case regarding why section was inapplicable to the facts before him section does not allow the judiciary to exercise a veto over the legislative branch of government merely because the judge may believe that the expenditures are unwise,that the results are not worth the expenditure,or that the underlying theory of the legislature involves bad judgment.sundance,supra,cal d at.
the court then went on to quote,again approvingly,a appellate case which had defined the concept of waste as used in t he term waste as used in section means something more than an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion.to hold otherwise would invite constant harassment of city and county officers by disgruntled citizens and could seriously hamper our representative form of government at the local level.thus,the courts should not take judicial cognizance of disputes which are primarily political in nature,nor should they attempt to enjoin every expenditure which does not meet with a taxpayer approval.sundance,supra,cal d at,quoting city of ceres city of modesto d.ceres.
the sundance court held that,under this rationale,criminal enforcement of the penal code section at issue there could not be considered waste plaintiff allegations and the trial court findings do not indicate that criminal enforcement of section f provides no public benefit.they demonstrate only that the civil detoxification alternative would be a more prudent allocation of funds.therefore,the county decision to continue arresting and detaining chronic alcoholics does not constitute waste,but merely an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion.citation.this court should not interfere with the county legislative judgment on the ground that the county funds could be spent more efficiently.sundance,supra,cal d at.
since sundance,three appellate courts have discussed and applied the limitations on the use of section noted there and in ceres.the first was brown,supra,where the court affirmed a trial court ruling that state funds held in the drivers training penalty assessment fund dtpaf were not required to be used to pay for public high school driver training.one of the theories of the plaintiffs in that case was that the transfer of those fund monies to the state general fund constitutes an illegal expenditure of funds under section.our colleagues in the sixth district unanimously disagreed,saying a taxpayer suit is authorized only if the governing body has a duty to act and has refused to do so.if the governing body has discretion and decided not to act,then the court is prohibited from substituting its discretion for the discretion of the governing body.citations.in this case,appellants allege that the state had a duty to use dtpaf funds to pay driver training expenses for high school districts.in deciding this question,we must determine whether the statutory scheme reflects a continuing appropriation by the legislature or whether the availability of driver training funding is subject to legislative discretion.brown,supra,th at,d.
the brown court then examined the legislative background of the dtpaf program and determined that it did not establish a continuous appropriation.nor,the court continued,could it order the legislature to appropriate monies for the public school program endorsed by the plaintiffs,as such an exercise is a legislative function.brown,supra,th at,d.
the year after brown was decided,a panel of the second district affirmed an order of the santa barbara county superior court which had denied an attempt,brought under section,to void an employment contract entered into between a public airport district and its general manager on the ground that a five year employment contract with the manager,coupled with a five percent pay raise and other benefits,was unnecessary to retain that employee and hence a waste of funds.quoting the language noted above from sundance and ceres,the court added as the plaintiff concedes,the contract at issue here is legal.assuming it is true that the airport manager at some time stated he did not feel the need for an express,written contract,the district may have decided that it was in the best interests of the district and the public to retain him under a contract providing good benefits and a severance pay provision.such provisions are often necessary to retain high level professional and managerial employees.this is a decision which lies within the sound discretion of the agency,pursuant to statutory authority.we may not disturb it.lucas santa maria public airport dist.th,d lucas.
finally,just a few years ago a panel of the fourth district rejected a taxpayer claim that the use of hydrofluorosilicic acid to fluoridate public drinking water was,among other things,an illegal expenditure of public funds because it violates penal code section,a statute which creates criminal penalties for any person who knowingly causes any hazardous substance to be deposited into the waters of the state.citation.coshow city of escondido th,d coshow.again quoting from sundance and also citing lucas,supra,th,d,the court held a cause of action under code of civil procedure section will not lie where the challenged governmental conduct is legal.citation.further,a taxpayer is not entitled to injunctive relief under code of civil procedure section where the real issue is a disagreement with the manner in which government has chosen to address a problem because a successful claim requires more than an alleged mistake by public officials in matters involving the exercise of judgment or wide discretion.citation.coshow,supra,th at,d,quoting sundance,supra,cal d at.
in sum,the appellate courts have made clear that,although in general section should be interpreted liberally,it should not be used to invade,supersede,or even intrude upon the discretion invested in the legislative and executive branches of government.
b.the penal code sections at issue 
as noted above,appellants complaint specifically alleges that the granting of the tax exemptions by the statute at issue,and also the expenditure of public money by paying state employees for time spent evaluating,approving,and enforcing tax exemptions for battery cages violates penal code sections,subdivision b and.a brief description of those statutes is therefore warranted.
the first,penal code section,subdivision b,provides,insofar as pertinent here,that every person who deprives of necessary shelter or causes or procures any animal to be so deprived of necessary sustenance,drink,shelter and whoever,having the charge or custody of any animal,either as owner or otherwise,subjects any animal to needless suffering or fails to provide the animal with proper food,drink,or shelter is,for every such offense,guilty of a crime 
penal code section is entitled mistreatment of confined animals and is much more succinct and focused than the earlier section.it provides,again as pertinent here every person who keeps an animal confined in an enclosed area shall provide it with an adequate exercise area.the provision explicitly excepts animals in transit.
there are apparently no published appellate cases citing the latter statute.there are,however,quite a few citing penal code section,subdivision b.not only do those numerous citations suggest that that statute is regularly enforced by california prosecutors,one author has stated california has one of the nation toughest anticruelty laws,and enforcement of the law appears to be more rigorous than in many other states.francione,animals,property,and the law temple university press,see also mo,unhappy cows and unfair competition.
finally on this subject,just a few years ago the third district affirmed the felony convictions of two defendants for staging cockfights in rural sacramento county.in the course of so ruling,that court held that the word animal as used in penal code section,subdivisions a and b,unambiguously includes a rooster or other bird.people baniqued th,d.
c.the demurrer was properly sustained 
an initial word is in order about the relevant standards of review.in measuring the validity of the complaint itself,although we assume the truth of the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,schifando,we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.moore regents of the university of california cal d.further,although,of course,we review de novo a lower court ruling that a complaint does not state a cause of action,we review its refusal to allow an amendment to the complaint under an abuse of discretion standard.put another way,if there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment,we must conclude the trial court abused its discretion in disallowing such an amendment.schifando,supra,cal th at,d.
in their briefs to us,appellants reiterate,indeed several times,the allegations of their the use of the tax exemption by one or more poultry and egg producers in california and why,in their opinion,the use of that exemption to enable those producers to place chickens into battery cages violates the two penal code provisions just cited and discussed.appellants sum up this part of their argument by contending that the sbe has made an unauthorized and unlawful decision to allow egg producers to enjoy a reduction in the portion of the sales tax otherwise due for the purchase and use of these cages.the result,again per appellants briefs to us,is that the sbe is effectively allowing a tax exemption for the purchase of devices that have an exclusively criminal application,which is wrong as a matter of law and public policy because the sbe is restrained by the limits imposed by the penal code and other laws.
respondents,represented of course by the attorney general,argue in their reply to these contentions that appellants do not challenge the constitutionality or the validity by any other measurement of either section itself or the sbe implementing regulation,the statute neither authorizes nor hints at an authorization of the sbe to deny farm equipment exemption claims on the basis of some abstract administration determination about the legality of the taxpayer farming operations,and thus appellants complaint seeks to have the courts impose on the sbe the new,additional duty to make determinations about whether some farm equipment is used in a manner that may violate criminal animal cruelty laws.
we agree with respondents regarding the failure of the complaint to allege a valid cause of action first of all,the fundamental problem with appellants attempt to use section to stop the improper use of battery cages is that any such use is a significant step removed from any implicated governmental action,the passage and subsequent implementation and administration of section.put another way,the improper conduct alleged by appellants involves not the actions of public officials regarding that statute but,rather,those of some alleged beneficiaries of the tax relief it provides.
as noted in our discussion of the limitations placed by the appellate courts,section is properly used where some illegal expenditure or injury to the public fisc is occurring or will occur.waste management,supra,th at,d.other appellate courts have phrased the necessary predicate for the application of the statute as being when the state is guilty of illegally spending public funds sagaser,supra,d at.or where the complaint endeavors to control illegal governmental activity connerly,supra,th at,d or attack an alleged illegal expenditure of funds.brown,supra,th at,d see also cowett,supra,d at.put another way,a section action will not lie where the challenged governmental conduct is legal.coshow,supra,th at,d.
but even a cursory examination of appellants complaint makes clear that it is not government conduct that is at issue here but,rather,the conduct of some what number,approximate number,percentage,or approximate percentage,we are not told poultry and egg producers that is at issue,the actions of some such operators in putting too many chickens into a single battery cage,a cage which they were perhaps able to purchase without paying the regular sales or use tax.the only government action at all involved in this process is sbe alleged failure to deny the percent sales tax exemption to those battery cage purchasers who put too many chickens into one battery cage.but,again,this is one very significant step removed from governmental action,which is what section is clearly directed at.
further,what appellants obviously seek,albeit seemingly without recognizing it,is to transform the sbe into some sort of a police agency with regard to chicken coops.manifestly,that is not the function of that,if it is,it is the job of the legislature,and not the judicial branch,to so state.
even more significantly,appellants proposition raises several ancillary questions,none of which are addressed in their briefs either to us,nor were they apparently addressed in the lower court why did they not seek some sort of criminal or civil relief in those counties where poultry and egg producers are using,at least according to appellants,overcrowded battery cages for example,have appellants ever approached a district attorney in a rural county where such battery cages are being used and asked that office to investigate and enforce the penal code sections they rely on if not,why not if there is,as appellants allege especially in their third cause of action,waste by paying state employees for time spent evaluating,approving,and enforcing tax exemptions for battery cages that may violate the named penal code sections,how many more such employees will there be if the sbe is
