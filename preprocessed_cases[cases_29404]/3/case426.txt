augustus garrett,jerome paulk,faye paulk,and pullum collectively the members are individual members of the peanut quota holders association.the members individually appeal the final decision of the united states court of federal claims the trial court awarding summary judgment to the united states the government on the ground that the members possessed no compensable property interest in the peanut quota allocated to them under the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of,stat,the fair act.members of the peanut quota holders ass united states.peanut quota holders ass n.
the members are all individuals who owned farms to which peanut quotas had been allocated under the former statutory provisions and who had leased their quotas to other farmers since at least.the peanut quotas allowed the members to obtain favorable loan rates for their peanut crop.the loan rates effectively maintained an artificial minimum price for a quota holder peanut crop.under the former statutory provisions,the loan rates could also be sold or leased 
the statute granting the peanut quotas was amended in.farm security and rural investment act of,stat,the act.the act made peanut quotas available only to those who actually farm peanuts and thereby share in the risk of production.since the members had leased their quotas,they were not eligible to receive a peanut quota under the new statutory provisions.the members claim that the loss of price support for the crop and their loss of eligibility for future peanut quotas have led to financial losses.the gravamen of their complaint is that the new statute effectuated a regulatory taking of the loan rate they would have received in as well as their eligibility to obtain future peanut quotas.
upon review,we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that the statutorily created peanut quota is not a property interest.nonetheless,we agree with the trial court that this property right is not compensable under the fifth amendment.consequently,the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
background 
a.the history of the peanut quota 
in order to assess whether the members have a property interest in the peanut quota,it is necessary to understand the statutory evolution of the peanut quota program.in the the united states economic depression particularly affected the agricultural community.congress,in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the depression on agricultural products,enacted the agricultural adjustment act of aaa,ch.tit.iii,et,stat,which regulated the production and sale of tobacco and wheat within the united states.the statute instituted acreage allotments to prevent oversupply of the targeted agricultural commodities.in,the aaa was amended to include farm acreage allotments for peanuts.the agricultural adjustment act of,as amended,ch,tit.iii,stat,the act.the act sought to regulate the production of peanuts to avoid severe fluctuations in price caused by rapid changes in market demand and the lag in response to that demand caused by crop growing cycles.act,stat.at.since,congress has regulated peanut production primarily through quotas set by the secretary of agriculture secretary,but the nature and reach of the quota system has not remained constant.
under the act,the secretary was required to proclaim annually the total quantity of peanuts that would be made available for marketing the following year this was known as the national marketing quota.this quota was to be equal to the average amount of peanuts harvested during the five years prior to the year of the proclamation,adjusted for trends in production and prospective demand.to apportion the national marketing quota among the producing peanut farms,it was converted to a national acreage allotment.this allotment was derived by dividing the national marketing quota by the normal yield per acre 
the national acreage allotment was divided proportionally among states based on the average relative peanut production per state for the five years immediately preceding the proclamation year,adjusted for trends in yields and abnormal conditions of production.each state acreage allotment was subsequently apportioned among farms in that state.the farms that obtained allotments were farms on which peanuts were grown in any of the three years immediately preceding the year for which the allotment was determined.the state allotments were apportioned on the basis of the tillable acreage available for the production of peanuts and the past acreage of peanuts grown on the farm.the actual amount of peanuts produced on the acreage allotment equaled the marketing quota for the farm.act,stat.at.
a farmer with an allotment was subject to financial penalties if he marketed peanuts in excess of his farm marketing quota.any farmer who grew peanuts without an allotment was also subject to financial penalties 
under the act,the secretary of agriculture was directed to make loans available to farmers with marketing quotas for peanuts.the secretary of agriculture provided the loans through the commodity credit corporation ccc.the ccc offered loans to farmers at rates between fifty and percent of the parity price of peanuts.act,stat.at.these loans provided farmers with operating capital.the loans were,such that if the farmer was unable to sell his crop at a profit and repay the loan with interest before it matured,the ccc accepted the actual peanut crop sales revenue as full repayment of the loan.
the agricultural act of,ch,tit.i,stat.the act,instituted the price support program.the act increased loan rates overall.it also tied the loan rates into an inverse relationship with the amount of overproduction of peanuts for the year.
the aaa was amended again in to allow peanut farm owners and operators to sell or lease all or any part of the right to all or any part of their peanut acreage allotment,stat.the act.the act also permitted an owner of a farm with an acreage allotment to transfer the allotment to his other farms.transfers were restricted such that they were only permitted between farms within the county in which the peanut acreage allotment was apportioned.other restrictions further limited the transferability of the allotments.
by,the introduction of new seed varieties,new fertilizers,and new farm management techniques had substantially increased the yield of peanuts per acre.as a result,there was an oversupply of peanuts.these conditions prompted congress to revamp the peanut program in the food and agriculture act of,stat,the act.the act temporarily suspended much of the aaa and its subsequent amendments and,in its place,instituted poundage quotas based on the weight of peanuts produced by the quota holders.the new poundage quotas applied only to peanuts destined for domestic edible use the poundage quota system was used in conjunction with the acreage allotment system a poundage quota was established for each farm that possessed an acreage allotment under the aaa.
the act also amended the price support program to provide different support levels for quota peanuts and additional peanuts.quota peanuts were any peanuts that were eligible for domestic edible use and that did not exceed the poundage quota of the farm.additional peanuts were any peanuts that were in excess of a farm poundage quota but not in excess of the actual production of the acreage allotment.this differentiation continued to discourage overproduction because the price support provided for additional peanuts was substantially lower than that provided for quota peanuts 
in,congress passed yet another law that temporarily suspended the aaa.the agriculture and food act of,stat,the act.the act terminated acreage allocations and marked the end of a four year transition to the poundage quota system that began with the act.the act retained the system of quota peanuts and additional peanuts based on poundage.it also enlarged the definition of additional peanuts to include any peanuts that were not covered by a poundage quota,irrespective of whether the peanuts were grown by a farm that possessed a poundage quota.thus,under the act,the peanut quota no longer restricted the production of peanuts.poundage quota holders simply received more generous support from the government than holders.
in,to mitigate the ever increasing costs to the public of maintaining the price support programs,congress enacted the fair act.the fair act,like the,and acts before it,suspended most provisions of the aaa.the fair act,in large part,continued the system created in with minor modifications.the price support for peanut producers under the fair act took the form of marketing assistance loans.the department of agriculture usda set loan rates and extended these loans to marketing associations,which,in turn,made loans to peanut producers.the loans were again represented by notes,such that if the revenue from the sale of the peanuts did not cover the full amount of the loan,the marketing association and,by default,the usda made up the difference.if the revenue from the sale of the peanut crop covered the loan amount,the producer repaid the loan in full.
the fair act established marketing loan rates through the marketing year the fair act set the loan rate for quota peanuts at per ton.fair act,a.by comparison,the loan rate set by the secretary for peanuts in was per ton the loan rate differential,combined with restrictions on importation,gave quota holders a considerable financial advantage in the peanut market by setting a floor on the price they would receive for their crop.
the fair act specifically allowed quota holders to sell or lease their quotas to other producers with a farm in the same state.fair act,i a.the act also amended the aaa to specifically protect transferors from a subsequent reduction of their quotas any farm poundage quota transferred under this paragraph shall not result in any reduction in the farm poundage quota for the transferring farm if the transferred quota is produced or considered produced on the receiving farm.fair act,i d.
in,congress amended the peanut quota program by repealing the marketing quota program,establishing a buyout of quota holders,and creating a new price support program.the buyout provision authorized a payment to quota holders of per pound,which equated to a payment of per pound for five years.act,b.
to have been eligible for the new quota,one must have been a producer on a farm in the united states that produced or was prevented from planting peanuts during any or all of the through crop years.act.thus,the new quota was available to an owner,operator,landlord,tenant,or sharecropper that shares in the risk of producing a crop on a farm and is entitled to share in the crop available for marketing from the farm.act.this definition of producer marks a distinct departure from the definition used in previous statutes,including the act,because it excludes from consideration farmers who leased or transferred their quotas to other producers.m.prior to the act,farmers were considered producers even if they had leased their quotas and,as a consequence,could have a quota even if they did not share in the risk of producing a crop.
b.the proceedings before the court of federal claims 
the trial court determined that the primary issue before it was whether the fair act created a property interest vested in a peanut quota holder that was eliminated by the act.the members asserted a regulatory taking of their alleged property right in the peanut quota created by the fair act they argued that the act rendered valueless expenditures made in reliance on their peanut quotas for the growing season that by establishing a program of marketing loans open to peanut producers who actually grew peanuts,the statutory changes deprived them of their entitlement to price supports under the fair act and that the buyout payments established under the act did not approximate the fair market value of the repealed peanut quota.
the trial court determined that while the members hold protected property interests in farm land and equipment,those property interests do not extend to the crop marketing quotas established by the fair act.the trial court reasoned that a citizen does not possess the right to exclude when he voluntarily enters an area subject to government control.peanut quota holders ass n.at.the trial court found support for this conclusion from our holding in mitchell arms,united states.relying on mitchell arms,the trial court reasoned that the expectation of a poundage quota share was merely a collateral interest incident to the members ownership of farm land.peanut quota holders ass n.at.the trial court concluded that b ecause congress has the right to modify or terminate a federal program,the benefits of such a program do not constitute a property interest protected by the fifth amendment.id.accordingly,the trial court awarded summary judgment in favor of the government.the members appeal the trial court decision.

discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.cl.c anderson liberty lobby,d.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether the trial court correctly applied this standard.see cienega gardens united states.
whether a compensable taking has occurred is a question of law based on factual underpinnings.wyatt united states.to evaluate whether a governmental action effects a taking of private property without just compensation,this court must first determine whether the claimant has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.conti united states.once a property right has been established,the court must then determine whether a part or a whole of that interest has been appropriated by the government for the benefit of the public.id.while a taking often occurs as a result of a physical invasion or confiscation,the supreme court has long recognized that if a regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.pennsylvania coal mahon.the issue in this case is whether,in amending the statute that created the peanut quota,the government effected a compensable taking of a property interest under the fifth amendment.
definition of a property right 
the fifth amendment provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.const.amend.v,cl.the purpose of the fifth amendment,as delineated in the cases interpreting it,is to prohibit the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.armstrong united states,d.
the constitution neither creates nor defines the scope of property interests compensable under the fifth amendment.conti,at citing bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.the parameters of a protected property interest are delimited by the law that creates the interest,see roth,at,and by existing rules and understandings and background principles derived from independent sources,such as state,federal,or common law,lucas coastal council,d maritrans united states.these background principles and rules and understandings focus on the nature of the citizen relationship to the alleged property,such as whether the citizen had the rights to exclude,use,transfer,or dispose of the property.see united states motors.to have a property interest in a benefit,a person must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.roth,at.
on the basis of these principles,the supreme court and this circuit have evaluated various regulatory schemes to determine whether intangible property such as government issued permits and licenses give rise to property interests protected by the fifth amendment.specifically,the supreme court has found that express statutory language can prevent the formation of a protectable property interest.see united states fuller,d.in the absence of express statutory language,this court has looked to whether or not the alleged property had the hallmark rights of transferability and excludability,which indicia are part of an individual bundle of property rights.loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d describing the right to dispose of property as part of an individual bundle of property rights see,am.pelagic fishing united states,conti,at mitchell arms,at.
in fuller,the supreme court refused to recognize a property interest in grazing permits issued under the taylor grazing act.in determining whether a property right existed,the supreme court focused on the revocability of the grazing permits and the clear congressional expression in that the issuance of a permit under the act shall not create any right,title,interest,or estate in or to the lands.the court noted that makes clear the congressional intent that no compensable property be created in the permit lands themselves as a result of the permit.fuller,at.
in mitchell arms,this court declined to recognize a property interest in a contract entered in accordance with the terms of a firearm import permit issued pursuant to and suspended before the contract could be performed.mitchell arms,at.mitchell arms held that when a citizen voluntarily enters a market subject to pervasive government control he can not be said to possess the right to exclude.id.specifically,this court concluded that the relevant right to exclude that the plaintiff lacked was the ability to exclude others from the market for the sale of firearms.id.
in conti,this court failed to find a compensable property interest in the petitioner fishing permit,relying on the petitioner inability to assign,sell,or otherwise transfer the permit the petitioner lack of authority to exclude others from the atlantic swordfish fishery and the government retained right to revoke,suspend,or modify the permit under a.conti,at.the absence of crucial indicia of a property right,coupled with the government irrefutable retention of the right to suspend,revoke,or modify conti swordfishing permit,compels the conclusion that the permit bestowed a revocable license,instead of a property right.id.at.
in american pelagic,we held that there was no protectable property interest in fishery permits and authorizations on the grounds that the petitioner did not have the authority to assign,sell,or transfer its permit and authorization letter and that those legal instruments did not grant the petitioner exclusive privileges to fish for atlantic mackerel and herring.at.this court reasoned that since nothing in the language of the regulations precluded the sanction or denial of a permit for reasons unrelated to enforcement,the government had preserved these rights with respect to the permits and authorization letters issued under the regulation.id.
in sum,the decisions by both the supreme court and this court imply that a compensable interest is indicated by the absence of express statutory language precluding the formation of a property right in combination with the presence of the right to transfer and the right to exclude.see,fuller,at.am.pelagic,at conti,at mitchell arms,at.
peanut quota as property 
the dimensions of any property interest the members may have in peanut quota allotments are defined by the fair act,which created the peanut quotas at issue.the act created a right to plant and produce a certain amount of peanuts for a guaranteed minimum price.the government argues that this is no more a property right than government issued licenses or permits.the members contend that this right is a property right because,unlike the permits and licenses discussed in conti and american pelagic,the provisions of the fair act and state case law establish that a peanut quota allotment was transferable and exclusive.we agree with the members.
transferability 
the right to transfer is a traditional hallmark of property.see loretto,at.describing the right to dispose of property as part of an individual bundle of property rights.the members have established that the peanut quota was transferable.
the fair act specifically allowed the peanut quota to be transferred,a,albeit subject to certain limiting conditions.the fair act provides,in relevant part 
transfers under this section shall be subject to the following conditions no allotment shall be transferred to a farm in another county no transfer of an allotment from a farm subject to a mortgage or other lien shall be permitted unless the transfer is agreed to by the no sale of a farm allotment from a farm shall be permitted if any sale of allotment to the same farm has been made within the three immediately preceding crop years no transfer of allotment shall be effective until a record thereof is filed with the county committee of the county in which such transfer is made and such committee determines that the transfer complies with the provisions of this section and if the normal yield established by the county committee for the farm to which the allotment is transferred does not exceed the normal yield established by the county committee for the farm from which the allotment is transferred by more than per centum,the lease or sale and transfer shall be approved acre for acre 
transferal of an allotment was historically subject to approval by the local branch of the agricultural stabilization and conservation service ascs.see in re williams.ascs approval was constrained by federal law,which only allowed transfers to farms within the same or an adjacent county.see shepard fed.land bank of columbia.
these restrictions on a quota holder ability to transfer his or her quota do not distinguish quotas from other transferable goods that are inarguably property,alcohol and firearms.the mere fact that transfers of allotments are not unrestricted does not undermine the importance of transferability to the characterization of quotas as a form of property.
further,the members point out that peanut quotas were long regarded under state law to be personal assets,in part because of their transferable nature.in support of their claims,the members cite a series of state court decisions that have held a peanut quota to be a personal asset.see,mills davis,so d noting that peanut quotas are personal property subject to payment of debts,but ultimately dismissing appeal as untimely mckim kauffman,holding peanut quotas to be property such that a failure to convey a quota under a contract constitutes breach.the government argues that these cases do not stand for the proposition that quotas are compensable property interests,but only illustrate that,in some circumstances,quotas are treated like property.the members counter that the treatment of quotas as property implies that they are property for all intents and purposes.
the cases addressing the issue of whether an agricultural allotment is property are less than straightforward in their conclusions courts have arrived at different conclusions,compare walker miller,an allotment under the aaa has been recognized as intangible personal property,subject to devise,inheritance,transfers and sales,division by a district court in divorce proceedings,and to treatment as property in bankruptcy proceedings.it is recognized that an allotment has a market value,and the statutory restrictions on transfer to not negate the possibility of transfer.with callaway block,cir appellants have no protected property interest in quotas per se nor in the specific quotas they had in or any other price year,and even the holdings of individual courts are muddled,seeming to come down on both sides of the issue,see,in re jackson,c ourts have stated that an allotment is a type of intangible personal property however,allotments can not be considered as ordinary intangible property in isolation from the statutes and regulations which control their transfer.
nonetheless,to the extent that the government argument relies on the notion that quotas are not transferable,we must disagree.despite their apparent ambivalence about whether or not quotas are property,courts across the peanut growing states have held consistently that quotas are transferable,subject to statutory restrictions.see,smith smith,so d holding transferable in divorce mckim,at recognizing transferable through sale in re williams,holding transferable in bankruptcy.in this case,the transferability of the quotas supports the conclusion that th
