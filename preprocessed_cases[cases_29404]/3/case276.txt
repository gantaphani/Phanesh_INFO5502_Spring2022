the fitzgerald living trust challenges the district court summary judgment in favor of the secretary of the united states department of agriculture,the united states forest service and individual forest service officials the forest service.we must decide the nature of the trust right of access over a national forest road,and whether the forest service proposed statutory easement,providing the trust with access over the road,is reasonable.
in,raymond and nancy fitzgerald purchased the cabins ranch,a acre cattle ranch located in northern arizona approximately fifty miles southwest of winslow.the fitzgeralds maintain a residence on the property and have used and continue to use the ranch as a base camp for their cattle grazing operations in the adjacent sitgreaves national forest the property contains a house,with no electricity or generator,and a water source.
in,president wilson granted the cabin ranch property to stelzer tillman pursuant to the homestead act.act of may,ch,stat.codified at repealed.the patent transferred the tract of land with the appurtenances thereof.when the property was surveyed in,it contained simple log dwelling,a log and dirt root cellar,two pole corrals,and a well.the survey also noted the existence of a rough trail from the property leading to a wagon road to winslow.at the time the united states granted the cabins ranch to tillman,the property was surrounded by the sitgreaves national forest or by lands owned by third parties.when tillman obtained the property,he accessed it by crossing the national forest or land owned by third parties.
when the fitzgeralds purchased the cabins ranch in,the property was completely surrounded by the sitgreaves national forest.there were several access routes to the property through the national forest.after the fitzgeralds purchased the ranch,the forest service closed all motorized access to the property except for the primary access route,forest development road fdr.prior to the spring of,the forest service never attempted to restrict the fitzgeralds or their use of fdr.in the spring of,however,the forest service asked the fitzgeralds to apply for a special use permit under the federal land policy management act flpma,to continue using the road the request was made pursuant to the forest service determination that fdr was no longer needed for public use and pursuant to its program of having all uses under permit.the fitzgeralds applied for the permit but refused to accept it because they felt that they had a legal right to access their property without executing any permit.
in,based on a policy change,the forest service offered the fitzgeralds a private road easement under flpma in lieu of the special use permit.the fitzgeralds refused the statutory easement as well.the regional forester closed fdr to motorized vehicles,and,in,the chief of the forest service upheld the road closure decision.the fitzgeralds filed an earlier lawsuit challenging the road closure and seeking to quiet title to a common law easement over fdr,but the case was dismissed as moot when the proposed easement expired 
in january,the fitzgeralds submitted a new application to the forest service for use of fdr.the forest service prepared a private road easement with the following notable conditions 
the fitzgeralds were required to pay the fair market value for the easement,set at annually 
the forest service reserved the right to terminate the easement if it decided that the road would not remain private,provided it replace the easement with a comparable easement and 
the forest service reserved the right to suspend,revoke,or terminate the easement pursuant to the rules of practice governing formal adjudicatory administrative proceedings instituted by the secretary of agriculture 
the fitzgeralds did not accept this easement and instead filed suit under the quiet title act,and the administrative procedure act apa.in their complaint,the fitzgeralds alleged,inter alia,the following they have an easement by necessity,an implied easement under the homestead act,and an express easement over fdr and the forest service issuance of the flpma easement is arbitrary and capricious because it restricts their common law rights of access and it deprives them of their statutory right of access under the alaska national interest lands conservation act,a anilca and their right to a permanent easement under the national forest roads and trails act nfrta.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service,holding that the forest service has the statutory authority under flpma and anilca to impose restrictions on a private landowner ingress and egress over national forest land and that the unrestricted use of fdr for many years did not trump this authority.the district court concluded that the easement restrictions were reasonable,and that the forest service did not abuse its discretion by offering the fitzgeralds an easement under flpma and not pursuant to nfrta.
while the district court held that any common law rights to an easement were preempted by statute,citing to adams united states adams ii,cir holding that common law easement claims are preempted by anilca and flpma where the united states owns the servient estate for the benefit of the public,it also reached the merits of the fitzgeralds common law claims.the court concluded that an easement by necessity did not exist because flpma and anilca grant the fitzgeralds access to their property,obviating the necessity requirement for such an easement.moreover,it held that an implied easement did not exist because the fitzgeralds right of access was clearly expressed in those statutes,and,assuming arguendo that an express easement was granted based on the patent language,it would still be subject to forest service regulation.
the fitzgeralds appealed we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.buono norton,cir universal health servs.thompson,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
the fitzgeralds argue that they have a common law easement by necessity over fdr,an easement implied from the language contained in the homestead act,and an express easement granted by the language of the land patent,and because these easements establish preexisting rights of access,they do not need to accept the forest service flpma easement to gain access to their property.particularly,the fitzgeralds object to the revocable nature of the flpma easement and the annual fee imposed for its fair market value because these conditions would fundamentally change the nature of any common law interest they own over fdr.
flpma and anilca clearly subject the fitzgeralds access over forest service land to the statutory permitting process.adams ii,at.while the forest service is correct to note that it has the authority under adams ii to impose some regulations on the use of fdr regardless of any common law easement held by the fitzgeralds,this still leaves open the question of whether the regulations imposed are reasonable.for such an inquiry,whether the fitzgeralds have a common law easement is relevant.for instance,government counsel acknowledged at oral argument that the fee provision of the flpma easement would be unreasonable under the apa if the fitzgeralds owned a preexisting easement because the forest service would be imposing a fee for something the fitzgeralds already owned.accordingly,we will review the fitzgeralds quiet title claims to determine whether the proposed flpma easement is reasonable.
skranak castenada,cir,supports our conclusion that a determination of common law rights is relevant to the reasonableness of the flpma easement.in skranak,the owners of mining claims filed complaints in the district court under the quiet title act and the apa after the forest service denied them unconditional special use permits to access their claims.id.at.they challenged the forest service failure
