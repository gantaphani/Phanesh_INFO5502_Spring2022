valley view angus ranch valley view appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of duke energy field services duke.the court concluded valley view federal claims were precluded by the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion due to a defense it raised in related state litigation brought by duke.preclusion is generally a knotty issue,and particularly so in this case.in resolving the issue the district judge issued a thorough and reasoned opinion.nevertheless,and most reluctantly,we must reverse.
background 
duke owns and operates a gas pipeline which runs through valley view ranch in oklahoma.in october,otis culpepper,president of valley view,observed a pipeline leak and notified duke.according to valley view,the leak polluted the soils and groundwater.in january,after obtaining the appropriate permits to conduct a subsurface investigation,duke notified valley view it intended to install monitoring wells on the property pursuant to a claimed easement interest.however,valley view would not grant duke permission to enter the property and on january,it denied duke contractors access.
the next day,duke filed an action in the district court of grady county,oklahoma the state suit seeking injunctive relief.duke obtained a temporary restraining order tro against valley view preventing valley view from interfering with duke intended operations on the property 
on february,prior to answering the state court complaint,valley view filed an action in federal district court the federal suit against duke seeking damages based on the gas line leak under the theories of trespass,nuisance and unjust enrichment.two days later,valley view filed answers in the state suit but did not assert any counterclaims.the same day valley view filed its answers,duke amended its complaint in the state suit to seek damages against valley view in the amount of for interference with its easement.
while the state matter was pending trial,duke filed a motion for partial summary judgment.the state court granted partial summary judgment to duke based on its conclusion duke held an easement interest in the property.the state case then went to trial to determine whether valley view violated its duties under the easement by refusing duke access to the property,and,if so,the amount of damages.the jury found against valley view and awarded damages.valley view did not appeal and the verdict became final.
thereafter,duke filed a motion for summary judgment in the federal district court contending valley view federal claims were barred by the doctrines of issue and claim preclusion.the district court agreed and granted duke summary judgment motion.valley view appeals.
ii.discussion 
valley view asserts the district court erroneously applied the doctrines of issue and claim preclusion in granting summary judgment to duke.duke disagrees,claiming both doctrines bar valley view federal claims.in the alternative,it asserts valley view claims are barred by oklahoma compulsory counterclaim statute.we address each argument.

res preclusion 
claim preclusion,formerly known at common law as res judicata,teaches that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from not only the adjudicated claim,but also any theories or issues that were actually decided,or could have been decided,in that action.state of ex rel.dep t of transp.little,accord veiser armstrong.generally,claim preclusion applies where the parties and the two causes of action are the same.wabaunsee harris,accord state of ex rel.bar ass giger,state of ex rel.wilson blankenship,cir.
the district court based its ruling,in part,on the determination valley view could have raised the claim for damages in the state court action but did not do so.app.at.on appeal,valley view and duke frame the issue as whether the state and federal court causes of actions are the same.while these approaches are correct in typical claim preclusion situations,they do not apply here.
the typical claim preclusion scenario unfolds as follows a plaintiff files suit against a defendant based on a particular transaction and the suit proceeds to a judgment.the plaintiff then files a second action against the same defendant based on the same transaction.the plaintiff second action would be barred under claim preclusion regardless of the theories raised in the second lawsuit see retherford halliburton,t his jurisdiction is committed to the wrongful act or transactional definition of a cause of action.thus,no matter how many rights of a potential plaintiff are violated in the course of a single wrong or occurrence,damages flowing therefrom must be sought in one suit or stand barred by the prior adjudication.
these rules do not apply to the situation where,as here,a plaintiff duke files suit against a defendant valley view based on a particular transaction the refusal to allow duke entry to its easement.the defendant valley view raises a defense duke breached the easement first and the suit proceeds to judgment.the defendant valley view then files an action against the plaintiff duke based on the same facts forming the basis of its defense in the prior suit.in such a situation,the defendant claims in the subsequent action are not precluded unless the defendant success in the latter action would nullify the original judgment or impair the rights established in the original action or a statute required the defendant to bring his claims in the original action.see meyer vance,applying the common law rule that a defendant is not precluded from bringing a separate action by failing to bring a claim in the first action mitchell williamson,barring claim in a latter action which could have asserted in the former action as a counterclaim where the plaintiff success in the latter action would,in effect,nullify the initial judgment or would impair rights established in the initial action see also martino mcdonald,cir a defendant need not raise an affirmative claim arising from the same facts as an asserted defense,unless a counterclaim statute bars the claim or res judicata itself bars the claim because its prosecution would nullify rights established by the prior action restatement second of judgments restatement charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure apart from compulsory counterclaim rules,the traditional conclusion has been that purely defensive use of a theory does not preclude a later action for affirmative recovery on the same theory.the rationale for the general rule applying to defendants who elected not to assert a counterclaim in the prior action is that the defendant should not be required to assert his claim in the forum or the proceeding chosen by the plaintiff but should be allowed to bring suit at a time and place of his own selection.restatement cmt.
thus,the proper analysis is whether valley view success in its federal action would nullify the state judgment or impair the rights established in the state action or a statute required valley view to bring its federal claims in the state action as counterclaims.
nullification of prior judgment 
although the corpus juris is not entirely clear about the exact scope of claim preclusion as applied to former defendants,all that can be said with confidence is that a judgment will be protected against the most obvious assaults of former defendants.wright miller,federal practice and procedure citing restatement second of judgments b.such obvious assault s include subsequent actions to enjoin the prior judgment and requests for declaratory relief on the validity of the prior judgment.see albano norwest fin.hawaii,cir applying hawaii law,concluding prior state court judgment declaring mortgage valid precluded subsequent claim to rescind under a federal statute rein providian fin,cir former defendants precluded from claiming former judgment was void and unenforceable due to violations of the federal bankruptcy code wright miller,federal practice and procedure collecting cases.
valley view federal action does not present an obvious assault on the state court judgment in favor of duke valley view success in the federal action,recovery for duke alleged tortious maintenance of the pipeline,would not void,render unenforceable or otherwise impair duke rights established by the state court judgment,the determination duke holds a valid easement interest and an award of damages for valley view wrongful exclusion of duke contractors.thus,valley view claims are not barred by the nullification exception.
effect of compulsory counterclaim statute 
duke also argues valley view is barred from raising its federal claims because,under oklahoma compulsory counterclaim statute,they should have been raised as counterclaims in the state court action.under oklahoma statute,a pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party,if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court can not acquire jurisdiction.stat.ann.tit,a failure to plead a compulsory counterclaim prevents a party from bringing a later independent action on that claim.gas dist.court,fifteenth judicial,cherokee county.
in wabaunsee harris,the oklahoma supreme court stated the general rule w here the two causes of action are different,the litigants are estopped by judgment to deny only those matters which are common to both suits.at.duke argues valley view reliance on wabaunsee is misplaced because it was decided before the passage of the compulsive counterclaim statute.duke quotes a later oklahoma supreme court case which stated 
the compulsory counterclaim statute changes previous oklahoma law by requiring a defendant to assert any claim he has against any opposing party that arises out of the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the opposing party claim.committee comment to.see,johnson southwestern battery,and meyer vance,in the absence of a compulsory counterclaim statute,the defendant failure to assert the counterclaim did not preclude a separate action against plaintiff on a claim which could have been asserted as a counterclaim.
the counterclaim statute does not,as duke claims,undermine wabaunsee on claim preclusion rather,it merely adds a step to the analysis.after the passage of oklahoma counterclaim statute,even if claim preclusion does not operate to bar a defendant subsequent claim,the statute might nevertheless bar it.see restatement generally,a defendant is not precluded from asserting his claim,unless the successful prosecution of that action would nullify the original judgment or the interposition of the claim is required by statute.
for a counterclaim to be compulsory under a,it must arise out of the same transaction and occurrence as the subject matter of the opposing party claim.gas,at.thus,in order for valley view claim to be considered compulsory,valley view nuisance and trespass claims must arise out of the same transaction and occurrence as duke breach of easement claim.rather than attempt to define the terms transaction and occurrence precisely,most courts have preferred to suggest standards by which the compulsory or permissive nature of specific counterclaims may be determined fox,at interpreting oklahoma law.such factors include are the issues of fact and law raised by the claim and counterclaim largely the same would res judicata bar a subsequent suit on defendants claim absent the compulsory counterclaim rule will substantially the same evidence support or refute plaintiffs claims as well as defendants counterclaim and is there a logical relation between the claim and the counterclaim accord driver music,commercial union ins,cir applying these factors under.a see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure listing same factors.
prior to entering its summary judgment order,the district court previously decided whether valley view claims were compulsory,albeit it in a different context applying the fox factors,the district court decided the claims did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.the court opined as follows 
the transaction or occurrence out of which the state court claim of defendant duke energy field services,lp,for breach of a agreement arose is duke alleged attempted entry onto valley view property and valley view obstruction or prohibition on that attempted entry whereas plaintiff claims arise out of the alleged occurrence of the leakage of hydrocarbons from duke pipeline across plaintiffs property.in any event,however,if the court applies the test adopted by the tenth circuit for determining whether the purported counterclaims in question the claims of plaintiffs in this case are compulsory counterclaims in the pending state court action brought by defendant herein,it is clear that the counterclaims are not compulsory.the issues of fact and law raised by the principal claim the state court claim of defendant and the purported counterclaims the plaintiffs claims herein are not largely the same.indeed,they are very different.res judicata would not bar a subsequent suit on the purported counterclaims plaintiffs claims herein,with or without a compulsory counterclaim rule,because they do not involve the same evidence,factual issues and legal issues.the same evidence does not support or refute the principal claim and the purported counterclaims.there is some logical relation between the claim and the purported counterclaims simply because duke alleges in the state court action that it entered plaintiffs property for the purpose of determining whether there was a hydrocarbon leak and plaintiffs claims herein are based on an alleged hydrocarbon leak,but this logical connection is attenuated.thus,defendant premise for its conclusion that the state court proceedings are parallel to these federal plaintiffs claims herein are compulsory counterclaims in the state court wrong.
the district court reached the correct conclusion on its first pass of the issue.what matters is whether valley view federal claims,that is,the trespass and nuisance claims,arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as duke claim in the state suit,that is,the breach of easement claim.the fox factors weigh heavily against the conclusion valley view federal claims were compulsory counterclaims in the state court action.first,as discussed above,valley view claims are not barred by claim preclusion.second,the issues of fact and law are likely to be very different the development of fact and law on valley view claims would focus on the cause and extent of the leak and whether the alleged pollution resulting therefrom exceeded the norms established by nuisance and trespass law,whereas the development of fact and law on duke claim would focus on the existence of an easement and how duke was denied access.duke argument on this operative event underlying both actions was duke causing the pipeline the significance of a single factual similarity.finally,the only logical connection between the parties claims is they concern events namely,the alleged damages caused by the pipeline leak and the subsequent denial of access to the pipeline to fix that leak occurring at the same place,albeit at different times.this nexus,however,is too attenuated.for subst
