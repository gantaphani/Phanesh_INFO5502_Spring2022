the hass avocado promotion,research,and information act,authorizes the department of agriculture to collect assessments from avocado growers and importers and to transfer the assessments to a board charged with promoting domestic consumption of avocados of the hass variety.two importers of avocados and two importers of avocado products sued in district court alleging that the act violated their first amendment right to be free of compelled speech the district court dismissed the complaint because the importers had not exhausted the administrative remedies the act provides.
the avocado act,one of more than a dozen federal statutes aimed at promoting the sale of various agricultural commodities,requires the secretary of agriculture to issue an implementing order that takes effect if the majority of affected growers and importers approve it in a referendum.the order establishes a hass avocado board consisting of industry representatives.the function of the board is to administer the order,c,develop budgets for the implementation of the order,c,and develop and implement plans and projects for hass avocado promotion,industry information,consumer information,or related research.c.the board may not implement any budget,plan or project without the prior approval of the secretary,but these are deemed to be approved if the secretary does not act within days.d.
the act also requires the secretary to impose assessments on growers and importers to pay for the board activities.h.the board must pay percent of a grower assessments to its state grower organization,if such an organization exists.h.if an importer belongs to an importers association,the board must pay percent of its assessment to that group.h.the board must also reimburse the secretary for expenses incurred conducting the referendum and supervising the board.i.the rest of the money pays for board programs,although at least some of it must fund a promotion program conducted by the california avocado commission.see e requiring board to enter contract with avocado organization in a state with the majority of hass avocado production in the united states a stating that virtually all domestically produced avocados for the commercial market are grown in the state of california.
under the of the act,any person subject to an order may file a petition with the secretary stating that the order,any provision of the order,or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption from the order.a.the secretary must rule on the petition after a hearing.a.the act further provides that the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction to review the ruling of the secretary on the petition,b,and must remand it if it is not in accordance with law.b.
rather than invoking,the importers filed a complaint in district court claiming that the mandatory assessments were unconstitutional and seeking an injunction against enforcement of the act the importers relied principally on united states united foods,d,in which the supreme court ruled that an identical provision in the mushroom promotion,research,and consumer information act,violated the free speech rights of mushroom growers by forcing them to pay for speech with which they disagreed.
the government had argued in united foods that the mushroom promotion program was government speech,and that the government therefore could force growers to pay for it.the supreme court refused to consider the argument because the government had not raised it in the court of appeals.at.at.united foods triggered a series of challenges against other agricultural commodity promotion programs.in each case the government relied on the government speech defense and in each case the court of appeals rejected it.see cochran veneman,cir dairy michigan pork producers ass veneman,cir pork livestock mktg.ass usda,cir,cert.granted,wl may,beef see also pelts skins,llc landreneau,cir striking down state alligator products promotion program but see charter usda,d sustaining beef program as government speech.
the avocado importers moved for a preliminary injunction.the government opposed the motion,arguing that the avocado program was government speech.the government also moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.the district court initially addressed the importers first amendment claims,holding that they were not required to exhaust the administrative remedy provided in.then,in response to a government motion,the court reconsidered its decision,ruled that importers must exhaust their administrative remedy,and dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the word exhaustion now describes two distinct legal concepts.the first is a judicially created doctrine requiring parties who seek to challenge agency action to exhaust available administrative remedies before bringing their case to court.see generally richard pierce,administrative law treatise ed.we will call this doctrine exhaustion.exhaustion serves three functions giving agencies the opportunity to correct their own errors,affording parties and courts the benefits of agencies expertise,and compiling a record adequate for judicial review.marine mammal conservancy,dep t of,mccarthy madigan,d.
occasionally,exhaustion will not fulfill these ends.there may be no facts in dispute,see mckart united states,d,the disputed issue may be outside the agency expertise,see id.at.at,or the agency may not have the authority to change its decision in a way that would satisfy the challenger objections,see mccarthy,at.at.also,requiring resort to the administrative process may prejudice the litigants court action,see id.at.at,or may be inadequate because of agency bias,see id.at.at.in these circumstances,the district court may,in its discretion,excuse exhaustion if the litigant interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to further.id.at.at quoting west bergland,cir.
the second form of exhaustion arises when congress requires resort to the administrative process as a predicate to judicial review.this jurisdictional exhaustion is rooted,not in prudential principles,but in congress power to control the jurisdiction of the federal courts.see eeoc lutheran soc.whether a statute requires exhaustion is purely a question of statutory interpretation.see mccarthy,at.at.if the statute does mandate exhaustion,a court can not excuse it.see shalala illinois council on long term care,d 
while the existence of an administrative remedy automatically triggers a exhaustion inquiry,jurisdictional exhaustion requires much more.in order to mandate exhaustion,a statute must contain s weeping and direct statutory language indicating that there is no federal jurisdiction prior to exhaustion,or the exhaustion requirement is treated as an element of the underlying claim.weinberger salfi,d pierce,administrative law treatise,at.we presume exhaustion is unless congress states in clear,unequivocal terms that the judiciary is barred from hearing an action until the administrative agency has come to a decision,pension fund benefit plan c stockton tri.
for example,the supreme court decided that the social security act mandated exhaustion in light of this statutory language no findings of fact or decision of the commissioner of social security shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.no action against the united states,the commissioner of social security,or any officer or employer thereof shall be brought under section or of title to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.h.see salfi,at.at.similarly,we found jurisdictional exhaustion in the following language from the federal power act no proceeding to review any order of the commission shall be brought by any person unless such person shall have made application to the commission for a rehearing thereon no objection to the order of the commission shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have bee
