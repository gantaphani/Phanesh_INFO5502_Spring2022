background 
as explained in greater detail in mcfarling,monsanto developed and patented recombinant gene sequences that can be inserted into plant seeds to protect them against the effects of herbicides,enabling farmers to spray herbicides such as monsanto roundup over their fields to kill weeds and other undesirable plants without killing the desired crops that grow from those seeds.monsanto also developed and patented recombinant gene sequences encoding proteins that are toxic to certain insects that commonly cause significant damage to host plants.when those sequences are incorporated into seeds,the resulting plants produce,in effect,their own insecticide.monsanto provides nonexclusive,licenses to various seed companies,which manufacture seed containing the two patented technologies described above and sell those seeds under the and bollgard brand names,respectively.monsanto additionally requires retailers to execute standardized contracts with growers before selling or bollgard seed to them.
ralph is a farmer who resides in western tennessee.together with his brother roger,he operates ralph brothers farms,a partnership that grows cotton,soybeans,and corn in tennessee tipton,shelby,and haywood counties.in,ralph purchased bags of soybean seed containing the patented biotechnology.in,he purchased bags of cottonseed,containing both the biotechnology and the bollgard biotechnology hereinafter,cottonseed.according to the contract that was in use at the time that ralph purchased the soybean seed and cottonseed,the technology agreement,the farmer,or grower,was required,in exchange for the opportunity to purchase and plant seed containing the bollgard technology,to agree,inter alia 
to use the seed containing monsanto gene technologies for planting a commercial crop only in a single season.
to not supply any of this seed to any other person or entity for planting,and to not save any crop produced from this seed for replanting,or supply saved seed to anyone for replanting.
to not use this seed or provide it to anyone for crop breeding,research,generation of herbicide registration data or seed production.
the technology agreement also contained a clause,conferring personal jurisdiction over the grower in the eastern district of missouri,and a clause specifying damages in the event of breach by the grower.the latter clause reads as follows 
in the event that the grower saves,supplies,sells or acquires seed for replant in violation of this agreement and license restriction,in addition to other remedies available to the technology provider s,the grower agrees that damages will include a claim for liquidated damages,which will be based on times the applicable technology fee.
at the time ralph purchased the aforementioned seeds,the technology fee,which was built into the price of each seed bag,was bag for soybean seed and bag for cottonseed.
the district court found that ralph saved bags of soybean seeds and bags of cottonseed at the end of the harvest for planting in the growing season,in contravention of the technology agreement.according to the court,ralph again illicitly saved seed in for planting in bags of soybean seeds and bags of cottonseed.
after an investigation indicated that ralph might have saved and patented seeds,monsanto filed suit against ralph in the district court on january,asserting claims for,inter alia,willful infringement of monsanto patents,and,and breach of contract.on february,ralph filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue,in which he asserted that he had no contacts with missouri and should not be required to defend a case there.monsanto ralph,rws,slip op.at,order.the court found that assertion to be untrue,as it was discovered thereafter that ralph had been doing business with sinkers corporation in kennett,missouri,for over twenty years in matters directly related to the underlying claims in this case.monsanto ralph,rws,slip op.at,sanction hearing transcript.
that same month,when monsanto arrived to sample ralph crops,to which ralph had previously consented,ralph revoked his consent,forcing monsanto to obtain an order from the district court permitting it to enter.order,slip op.at.the court granted the order on february,and,based on ralph misrepresentation that he would need to plant his seed by march the court order gave monsanto until that date to investigate.ralph initially represented under oath that he had not stored any seed,but the district court found that,after being confronted with evidence from sinkers that he had stored cottonseed there,he admitted that the seed had existed.sanction hearing transcript,slip op.at.however,according to the court,ralph testified that he had violated the court order and burned all of the stored seed.id.he offered to stipulate that those bags all contained monsanto patented cottonseed.order,slip op.at.monsanto rejected that offer,apparently suspecting that ralph may again have been lying and that he may have sold or transferred some of those bags to other farmers.id.at.in fact,after deposing kem and roger ralph and filing a motion for sanctions for their misconduct,monsanto deposed the operator of the dump where ralph allegedly burned the seed,who stated that it appeared to him that ralph had burned only about a hundred bags and that ralph told him he had burned bags,id.at,out of the more than bags of seed that the court found that ralph had stored at sinkers,sanction hearing transcript,slip op.at.monsanto also deposed three other farmers,norman kelly,david bradshaw,and dewayne hendrix,all of whom declared under oath that ralph had sold or given cottonseed to them.order,slip op.at.monsanto then renewed its motion for sanctions.the court found that ralph had engaged in additional,intentional obstruction of the discovery process by,inter alia,failing to inform monsanto of his complete land holdings and failing to disclose the stored cottonseed at sinkers in response to monsanto interrogatories,and by requiring monsanto to take depositions of witnesses that would not have been necessary if it had not been for ralph refusal to cooperate.id.at.
at a hearing held on october,the court exercised its discretion under.b to sanction ralph by striking all of his pleadings in the case as a penalty for,inter alia,intentionally violating court orders and repeatedly lying under oath.sanction hearing transcript,slip op.at.the court concluded that that was the only appropriate remedy,because monsanto,like the court,will never have any comfort that it knows the truth,and that it can properly prepare this case for trial the integrity of this court and our judicial system has been undermined by almost every aspect of the ralph brothers sic conduct in this case.id.the court entered judgment for monsanto on liability and ordered the case to trial on damages only.the court additionally asked monsanto to brief its costs and expenses incurred as a result of ralph deceptive conduct,refusal to comply with the court orders,and lying about those refusals.id.at.on february,the court ordered ralph to reimburse monsanto for its expenses.order,slip op.at.
on december,after hearing monsanto witnesses,the jury returned a verdict for monsanto for what it deemed to be a reasonable royalty for ralph infringement,bag for the bags of soybean seed that ralph saved for planting in,bag for the bags of cottonseed that he saved for,bag for the bags of soybean seed he saved for,bag for the bags of cottonseed he saved for,and bag for bags of cottonseed that he transferred to kelly,for a total of.the court trebled that amount for willfulness and added for prejudgment interest,for costs,and for attorney fees,resulting in a total award of for patent infringement.the jury also awarded monsanto,in the alternative,in liquidated damages under the technology agreement,times the technology fee for each of the bags of soybean seed that ralph purchased,plus times the technology fee for each of the bags of cottonseed that he purchased.after adding prejudgment interest,costs,and attorney fees,the court granted a total award of for the breach of contract.because the patent infringement and breach of contract claims were filed in the alternative,the court concluded that satisfaction of the higher patent infringement award would extinguish the lesser breach of contract award.judgment,slip op.at.finally,the court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting ralph current and future purchase,acquisition,making,use,sale,offers to sell,brokering,transfer,cleaning,reconditioning of any seed containing monsanto patented biotechnology or planting,moving,collecting transferring,or obtaining,in any manner,any patented biotechnology in his possession,or under his control,wherever situated,and ordering him to inventory and produce all patented biotechnology in his possession to monsanto.id.at.
ralph timely appealed the court judgment we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
on appeal,ralph argues that the district court abused its discretion by striking his pleadings and entering judgment for monsanto on liability.according to ralph,if kem ralph has been less than completely forthcoming in some of his responses,it was because he realized that complete answers would get his friend hendrix in trouble.ralph apparently asserts that such a display of loyalty should have mitigated his sanctions,stating that t he desire to protect a friend is never a justification for telling less that sic the complete truth in response to questions properly put in a judicial proceeding.but it certainly does go to good faith and the question of what price the party must pay.ralph further contends that his attempt to keep monsanto from finding out about the seed was in any event ineffectual,because monsanto was ultimately able to unearth all of the facts on its own.he also argues that he did not actually violate an order to provide or permit discovery.b,because,he claims,the only order arguably sufficient by its own terms had expired on march,the day before he burned the seed.he contends that the appropriate sanction for intentional spoliation of evidence would have been simply to declare a rebuttable presumption that all of the cottonseed contained the patented traits,just as he had offered to stipulate.further,according to ralph,the truth regarding three out of monsanto four claims,those with regard to saved soybean seed and cottonseed planted in and saved soybean seed planted in,was never in doubt,as any concealment related only to cottonseed saved for planting in.ralph argues that the court should have considered his defenses,especially those purporting to show that the patent is invalid for failure to disclose the best mode of the invention,that his signature was forged on the technology agreement,and that he never sold any seed to kelly.ralph also argues that there are strong public policy reasons why he should be allowed to pursue patent misuse and conduct affirmative defenses and counterclaims.
monsanto responds by arguing that the district court sanction was commensurate with ralph deliberate and abuses.according to monsanto,no lesser sanction would have served the purposes of punishment and deterrence.in particular,monsanto asserts,a spoliation instruction would have improved ralph position,rather than sanctioning him,because it would have covered up the fact that ralph actually sold transferred some seed.monsanto further argues that the district court selection of sanction is entitled to substantial deference and the court did not abuse its discretion by striking ralph pleadings.
in reviewing sanction orders,this court applies the law of the regional circuit from which the case arose,in this case the eighth circuit.transclean bridgewood.w hether the extent of a sanction is appropriate is a question peculiarly committed to the district court.dillon nissan motor,cir.district courts have wide latitude in fashioning an appropriate sanction,aziz wright,cir,and,in particular,the eighth circuit has held in a case involving less egregious discovery abuses than at issue here that 
striking a party pleadings under rule is within the range of appropriate sanctions when a party demonstrates a blatant disregard of the court orders and the discovery rules,engaging in a pattern of deceit by presenting false and misleading answers and testimony under oath in order to prevent their opponent from fairly presenting its case.

we agree with monsanto that there was reasonable basis for the court sanctions.the spoliation instruction that ralph argues should have been given as a sanction instead would simply have created a presumption that all bags of seed contained the patented traits and were burned.that sanction would have trivialized the magnitude of the harm caused by ralph behavior,because if the seed had simply been burned,there would have been little basis for monsanto to argue that it would suffer any continuing harm as a result of ralph saving of that seed,and monsanto might not have been adequately compensated.however,most of those bags are unaccounted for and there is evidence that at least some of that seed was transferred to others.the potential risk to monsanto business from such a transfer goes far beyond any harm that would have come from ralph burning seed,because of the exponential growth rate of the seeds.for example,the environmental protection agency requires monitoring of bollgard cottonseed to control environmental impact and ensure efficacy.violation of the restriction set forth in the technology agreement could have caused monsanto to lose control over the technology,because a single bollgard cottonseed produces a plant that yields to patented seeds.even a single bag of the cottonseed transferred to another farmer could therefore,by a conservative estimate,produce hundreds of thousands of bags of seed,x x over the course of just three growing seasons.
although ralph has cited several cases in which the eighth circuit reversed dismissal sanctions,including edgar slaughter,cir,baker general motors,cir,rev on other grounds,d,and heartland bank heartland home finance,cir,those cases did not involve findings of willful violation of court orders,destruction of evidence,or subornation of perjury,as were present in this case.as the eighth circuit explained in denton v.swiss of missouri,cir,t he judicial system can not tolerate litigants who flagrantly refuse to comply with the orders of the court and who refuse to make discovery,for delay and evasion are added burdens on litigation,causing waste of judicial and legal time,are unfair to the litigants and offend the administration of justice.id.at.
as for ralph argument that the court order that the district court found that he had violated had already expired when he supposedly burned the seed,we agree with monsanto that ralph was not entitled to the benefit of the march date set by the court because that date was based on ralph perjurious affidavit regarding the date on which he intended to prepare his fields.moreover,ralph has not shown that he did not transfer any seed prior to that date,and he certainly di
