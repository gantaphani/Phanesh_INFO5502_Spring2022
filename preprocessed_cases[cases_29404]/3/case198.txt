this tax refund case involves the interpretation of section l a of the internal revenue code the or the code.this is a case of first impression in both this and other federal courts of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
a nebraska corporation,is a subchapter s corporation that manufactures,sells,and leases farm equipment,including center pivot irrigation systems.in and,the years at issue in this case,sold these irrigation systems either through a network of dealers or directly to farmers.if necessary,financing for these direct sales to farmers was provided through several internal divisions of.the terms of the sales and security agreements that governed these sales called for at least one payment to be made after the close of the taxable year in which the sale occurred.under this scenario,reported these direct sales to the irs using the installment method of accounting.on the returns form filed in and,reported ordinary taxable income of and,respectively.
following an audit of the for the tax years in question,the irs disallowed the use of the installment method of accounting for reporting the gain from the direct sales of the center pivot irrigation systems.as a result,ordinary taxable income increased by and,respectively.because this increase flowed through to taxpayers,the irs determined that taxpayers were liable for additional taxes for the tax years in question.
after having paid the requisite amounts,taxpayers timely filed requests for a refund claiming that sales of the center pivot irrigation systems to various farmers qualified for the installment method of reporting.as authority for this assertion,taxpayers relied on l a,which permits the use of the installment method of accounting in certain circumstances.generally speaking,any sale classified as a dealer disposition can not be reported using the installment method.however,section l a exempts from the definition of dealer dispositions any property used or produced in the trade or business of farming within the meaning of section e or.the irs rejected taxpayers claim.consequently,taxpayers brought suit in the district court seeking a refund of taxes and statutory interest.the government filed a motion for summary judgment,which taxpayers opposed.
in its opinion,the district court rebuked taxpayers claim that sales of center pivot irrigation systems qualified for the use of the installment method of accounting under section l a for dispositions of any property used or produced in the trade or business of farming.in rejecting this claim,the district court held that section l a is limited to farmers not merchants dispositions of property used or produced in the business of farming.thom,d at.accordingly,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment.on april,taxpayers filed a timely notice of appeal.this appeal follows.

as a general rule,businesses that deal in personal property are not permitted to utilize the installment method of accounting.section of the code,however,allows certain taxpayers to report their earnings under the installment method.it permits the proceeds of a installment sale contract to be spread out over the period of time corresponding to the duration of the payments,rather than being reported as a lump sum in the year of the sale.section defines the installment method as an accounting 
under which the income recognized for any taxable year from a disposition is that proportion of the payments received in that year which the gross profit realized or to be realized when payment is completed bears to the total contract price.
c.such a method of accounting is usually available for reporting the proceeds of a sale where at least payment is to be received after the close of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs.b.under the installment method,sale proceeds guaranteed today,while not paid today,do not become taxable until they are actually obtained.the purpose of allowing this method of accounting is to relieve taxpayers who adopted it from having to pay an income tax in the year of sale based on the full amount of anticipated profits when in fact they had received in cash only a small portion of the sales price.comm r of internal revenue.lumber.
this method can not be used,however,to report proceeds from a sale of personal property by a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property of the same type on the installment plan,or dealer dispositions.b a,l a after reviewing these provisions,we are left with the impression that congress has clearly stated a preference against permitting businesses from utilizing the installment method of accounting.there are,however,two exceptions to this general rule.see l a b.
taxpayers argument relies on the first such exception.their primary argument is that sales of center pivot irrigation systems to farmers are not dealer dispositions because,under section l a,the term dealer disposition does not include a disposition of any property used or produced in the trade or business of farming within the meaning of section e or.not surprisingly,the irs disagrees.the primary disagreement before us is the proper definition of the word used in section l a.taxpayers argue that the term used should be read expansively to mean any and all property which has been,or will be,used for farming.the irs,however,reads the word used in a much more restrictive fashion.it argues that section l a only applies to dispositions of property that are actually used in farming by farmers.under the irs view,the benefits from this exception flow solely to farmers and not to dealers who sell goods to farmers.this is a question of first impression in this or any other circuit 
in determining whether a statutory exception applies,we look first to the statute plain language.if the statutory language is unambiguous,and there is no clear congressional intent to the contrary,we must regard that statutory language as conclusive.reves ernst young,d citations omitted.in our view,the plain language of the statute supports both the irs and the district court interpretation of section l a.under its plain terms,the statute grants an exception for the disposition of property that is either used or produced in farming.there is no contention that the irrigation systems are produced in farming,so this case turns on the meaning of the word used.
here,the juxtaposition of the word used with the word produced is instructive.surely,the word produced is in the past tense and most likely applies to such things as crops and livestock.if this is true,we do not understand why the word used should be read any differently.estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d noting that similar words within the same statute should have similar meanings.that is,the word used should also be read in the past tense.if read in the past tense,then the government is correct when it asserts that this section does not apply to sales of the center pivot irrigation systems because taxpayers do not contend that any of their equipment has actually been used in farming.rather,they only assert that such equipment will be used in farming,at some unspecified time in the futu
