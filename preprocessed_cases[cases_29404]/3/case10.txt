this appeal arises from the settlement of the litigation concerning the regulation of puerto rico milk industry.the intervenor puerto rico dairy farmers association prdfa appeals from the district court approval of a comprehensive settlement agreement the agreement reached by the original parties the government defendants,including the office of the milk industry regulatory administration for the commonwealth of puerto rico spanish acronym oril,and the plaintiff milk processors,vaquería tres monjitas,vtm and suiza dairy,suiza.
prdfa argues that the district court denied it an appropriate hearing to object to the approval of the agreement,and attacks the merits of the agreement itself.because prdfa had an adequate hearing to air its grievances while the agreement was stayed from going into effect,and because the district court held that prdfa remains free to challenge in its companion case the constitutionality of the agreement as implemented,we reject prdfa due process arguments.we also find there was no abuse of discretion in the district court approval of the agreement,and affirm.
an account of the litigation origins is found in our previous opinion in this case.see vaquería tres monjitas,irizarry,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir,cert.denied.
the milk industry is heavily regulated in puerto rico,and is under the purview of oril,a subdivision of the department of agriculture.id.at.before this case began,oril set both a maximum price for milk sold to consumers and a minimum price for the processors purchase of raw milk from the dairy farmers,effectively squeezing the processors profit margins between the two ends of the market.id.at.
vtm and suiza are the only private fresh milk processors in puerto rico.they purchase raw milk from local dairy farmers,convert it to drinkable fresh milk,and sell it to consumers.id.at.the only other milk processor is industria lechera de puerto rico,indulac,an entity created by statute to promote the commonwealth milk industry.indulac is currently the only entity authorized to process temperature milk uht milk,a product that does not need to be refrigerated before it is opened.id.appellant prdfa is an organization that represents puerto rico dairy farmers,who sell their milk to all three processing entities.it initially intervened in in order to support the government defendants.
procedural background 
in,suiza and vtm brought a constitutional challenge to the regulatory structure of the milk industry.id.at.suiza and vtm contended that oril regulatory structure precluded them from making a reasonable profit in their milk business and constituted a confiscation of property in violation of the takings clause.see const.amend.prdfa entered the milk litigation in as a alongside oril.indulac also entered the litigation as a.
on july,the district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering remedies in favor of suiza and vtm.vaquería tres monjitas,laboy,wl,at july.that preliminary injunction ordered,among other things,that the administrator of oril develop and implement nondiscriminatory,rational and scientific regulatory standards that will allow him to determine costs and fair profits return for all the participants in the puerto rico regulated milk market.id.emphasis added.in its initial attempt to satisfy this portion of the injunction,oril filed price order and regulation regulation with the court on july.
the filing of regulation started a new chapter.on one track,suiza and vtm both filed prompt objections to regulation,arguing that it did not constitute full compliance with the preliminary injunction.those objections led to a series of compliance hearings that focused on the substance of oril calculations underlying regulation.
immediately after oril filed regulation in july,prdfa also objected to the regulation,though on different grounds than suiza and vtm.in doing so it altered its posture and no longer supported oril position.specifically,prdfa argued that regulation was arbitrary and capricious in that it forced the dairy farmers to sell their raw milk at an unfairly low price,and that it discriminated against the dairy farmers in favor of other players in the milk industry.in light of suiza and vtm objections,the government asked the district court to stay its consideration of prdfa objections the district court granted the government motion and instructed prdfa to file their own constitutional claims as to the proposed regulation in a separate case.
as proposed,prdfa filed a separate complaint as a plaintiff against oril in october,alleging that regulation constituted a violation of its rights under both the due process and the takings clause.on may,the district court ruled that it would proceed with prdfa case only after the original case,this case,was in the permanent injunction phase.prdfa has amended its complaint twice,adapting its allegations as regulation was amended following various court actions and committee recommendations.the prdfa first amended complaint was filed on december,and the second on december.that case,remains pending before the district court.
settlement agreement and related events 
for several years after oril first filed regulation,the parties continued to dispute whether the regulation complied with the preliminary injunction.the district court held dozens of hearings on the matter,considering a variety of technical regulatory issues,and ultimately rejected a total of nineteen calculation proposals offered by oril.at several points,the district court evinced frustration with what it believed were the government efforts to evade compliance with the previously ordered injunctive relief.
in september,the long period of compliance hearings and filings regarding regulation came to a head.on september,the district court issued an opinion and order which,among other things,held the government defendants in contempt for continued attempts to evade compliance with the preliminary injunction.vaquería tres monjitas,comas,d,wl.the order set a date for a hearing on the matter of a contempt fine and related matters,as well as a date for a permanent injunction hearing.id.at.in a footnote,the court strongly recommend ed that the parties utilize the time between the instant opinion and order and the permanent injunction hearing to reach an extrajudicial resolution to the instant controversy.id.at.
at the scheduled contempt hearing on october,counsel for suiza announced that the parties had,in principle,reached a settlement agreement late the night before.the agreement purported to resolve all of the pending disputes between suiza,vtm,and oril.the parties requested that the hearing be continued until the next day so that they could finalize and sign the agreement before filing it with the court for its review.the court granted that request,and the very next day,october,the court held a hearing at which oril,suiza,and vtm filed the agreement in open court for the court approval.at that hearing,the district court noted that it thought that the solution to the litigation should have been made by the parties,and noted approvingly that the parties have the agreement,and it is not a agreement.
prdfa was not involved in the negotiations that led to the agreement,nor had prdfa counsel even seen it at the time it was filed in the district court.during the october hearing,prdfa counsel informed the court that he believed prdfa companion case would move forward following the approval of the agreement,but that he could not take a full position until he had read the agreement.the court instructed prdfa counsel to review the agreement to determine to what extent it affected prdfa pending case,and to advise the court of what wa s left in that case.prdfa counsel agreed.
the district court then stated this agreement will be filed tonight,and the court will examine it,and potentially produce a sentence based on all of the covenants stated herein.all of them.all.this is my judgment t he court will incorporate as a judgment all the terms and conditions that are stated herein.the court then allowed both prdfa and indulac fifteen days to advise the court as to how the agreement would affect them it also expressly stated that those entities can not nullify this agreement.
on november,prdfa filed a motion to reject the final settlement agreement,raising takings and due process objections.that motion was never addressed directly by the district court.
on november,the district court issued an amended order and judgment,accepting and incorporating the entire agreement into a judgment.the order expressly noted that the agreement does not include prdfa,and that prdfa accordingly may proceed with their litigation filed under civil.
later that same day,prdfa filed a motion to stay the judgment,which was granted in part.specifically,the court granted a stay only as to the portions of the agreement that altered the milk pricing formula,which altered the dairy farmers previous compensation.the court ordered that the pricing status was at the heart of prdfa be preserved until prdfa was granted a hearing on the matter,and then scheduled that hearing for november.while the stay was in place,prdfa filed at least two motions challenging the agreement and opposing suiza arguments in favor of lifting the stay.
at the november hearing,prdfa voiced its objections to the agreement at length.its primary argument,also advanced in an earlier motion opposing the agreement,was that the agreement would lower the dairy farmers profit margins by at least per quart of milk,from to per quart,and that reduction would constitute an unconstitutional taking and a violation of procedural and substantive due process.
second,prdfa argued that the way the agreement was structured would bar the district court from granting prdfa relief even if it prevailed as plaintiff on the merits in its pending case.more specifically,prdfa second argument asserted three propositions.first,the agreement provides that the price of milk paid by consumers will not increase for the next four years unless the present market conditions change substantially.second,suiza and vtm profit margins are inversely related to those of the dairy farmers without a rise in prices at the consumer level,prdfa argued,it is unavoidable that as suiza and vtm margins increase,the farmers margins will decrease.finally,the agreement provides that any later changes to regulation and,accordingly,to suiza and vtm profit margins require the unanimous vote of designated industry representatives from all industry sectors.emphasis added.the combined effect of these three conditions,prdfa argued,was that even if prdfa were able to show constitutional violations in its companion case,the district court would be unable to grant it relief via restored higher profit margins in light of the agreement restriction on amending regulation without unanimous consent from industry actors.
at the november hearing,the district court flatly rejected the contention that the agreement so limited its power to grant relief in the companion case.the court told prdfa counsel that the companion case is going to be heard on the merits,and if the court finds that you warrant a remedy,the court gives you the remedy,whether it is in a subsidy or whether it is in dollars and cents.after the hearing,the court lifted the partial stay,having concluded that the farmers will not be losing,at this time,the egregious amounts alleged as a consequence of the settlement agreement.the court went on to note that it would provide expedited hearings as soon as the parties are ready in prdfa companion case.
in the days and weeks following the hearing,prdfa and the other parties continued to submit informative motions as to the actual effects of certain portions of the agreement.in particular,the district court ordered oril to provide additional briefing to confirm that under the agreement the dairy farmers would in fact receive cents per quart of milk.this order arose because prdfa continued to allege to the court that under the agreement,the farmers per quart compensation would drop precipitously.
on december,the district court issued an order denying a series of pending motions the order specifically denied indulac motion to amend or alter the judgment,and in a footnote,it noted that indulac mirrors arguments also alleged by the prdfa.the order also noted that it would deal with prdfa substantive objections separately in prdfa companion case.the district court did not disturb its approval of the agreement.
while this appeal was pending,prdfa filed another motion to stay the district court judgment.on february,before the march oral argument before this court,the district court issued an order denying that motion.in that order,the district court referred back to the november,hearing,and noted that the agreement posed no irreparable harm to the dairy farmers.the court held 
because the final settlement agreement ending the instant case guarantees a net payment of per quart of milk to the farmers,and the governor has agreed to finance any deficiency short of per quart of milk,the prdfa has no irreparable damages warranting a stay pending appeal.
finally,there is no likelihood of success as there are no damages.nken holder.
the court went on to hold that the government public policy regarding the milk industry is reasonable.
prdfa argument before us has two primary components the first is procedural prdfa argues that the district court did not grant it a fair opportunity to be heard on its objections to the agreement.second,prdfa reiterates its substantive objections to the approval of the agreement on takings and due process grounds.
to be clear,this is not a class action,and there are no specific requirements here as to hearings,as there are in federal rule of civil procedure e.nonetheless,third party intervenors who object that they are adversely affected by a settlement between a government entity and a private party should be provided with adequate notice and an opportunity to have these objections heard.see united states comunidades unidas contra la contaminacion cucco,cir.an intervenor lacks the power to block a consent decree merely by withholding its consent.local,int l ass of firefighters,afl cio city of cleveland.an objecting intervenor is entitled to present evidence and have its objections heard.id.

it is true that the district court entered the agreement on november without first hearing prdfa objections.but it is also true that the court immediately stayed its order in light of the objections and gave prdfa and indulac ample opportunity to review the agreement and to be heard.the court accepted an affidavit from prdfa held a hearing.the november hearing,along with the several motions prdfa filed in the district court in the weeks before,was adequate.
prdfa argues to us it was entitled to a live hearing to present witnesses,but it did not expressly request an evidentiary hearing before the district court and the court had no obligation to hold one in any event.see cucco,at concluding that there can be no unconditional right to an evidentiary hearing as to the merits of a settlement agreement demanded by a third party intervenor,because to allow evidentiary hearings on the call of any party allowed to intervene would delay,complicate,and perhaps jeopardize the timely resolution of the issues.the district court was equipped with the evidence contained in prdfa filings at the november hearing.prdfa procedural rights as an objecting intervenor were not violated here.
we turn to prdfa second argument,that the district court erred in its approval of the agreement.approval of a consent decree is committed to the trial court informed discretion,cannons eng g,at,and our review is accordingly deferential
