background 
rice is a farmer in greene county,iowa.in early,rice applied for a loan from the farm service agency fsa,an agency of the department of agriculture that administers loans to farmers.fsa rejected rice initial application.in june,rice sought reconsideration of fsa decision.as part of his renewed loan application,in july,rice submitted a farm and home plan to fsa.in the plan,rice declared his assets,debts,crop plans for,anticipated income and debt repayment plan.based upon rice farm and home plan,as well as his subsequent agreement to pledge certain collateral including his crop year soybeans to ensure repayment,fsa approved his application and loaned rice.
although rice disputed the testimony,a government witness testified at trial that,during an october loan closing attended by rice and fsa employees,rice told fsa that his financial circumstances had not materially changed since he executed his july farm and home plan,even though rice sold and disposed of his crop year soybeans either the day before,or on the day of,the loan closing.fsa employees testified that fsa would not have closed the loan had it known that rice had liquidated his soybeans before closing.based upon his representation that his financial circumstances had not materially changed,the government charged rice with making a false statement in violation of.
as part of his agreement with fsa,the proceeds of rice loan were also pledged to fsa as security for the loan and placed in a supervised account from which funds could be withdrawn only with written fsa approval.beginning in october,rice made approved withdrawals of over from the supervised account.each time,rice obtained the countersignature of an fsa representative to authorize the withdrawal.however,in,rice attempted to withdraw the remaining funds from the supervised account without fsa approval.rice initially attempted to withdraw the funds from a bank in fort dodge,iowa,but the fort dodge branch refused to give rice the funds.when denying rice request,employees of the fort dodge branch told rice he needed fsa approval.rather than seek fsa authorization for the withdrawal,rice tried another branch of the same bank in west des moines,iowa.this time,the bank allowed rice to withdraw the remaining from the account.rice then deposited the funds into a personal account at another bank.despite subsequent requests from fsa and the bank,rice failed to return the pledged funds.based upon his unapproved withdrawal of pledged funds from the supervised account,the government charged rice with converting property pledged to fsa in violation of.
the jury convicted rice on both counts.rice moved orally for a judgment of acquittal,but his motion was denied.rice later moved in writing for a new trial,claiming that the jury verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence.following complete briefing,the district court denied rice motion.rice then moved to vacate and set aside the jury verdicts and requested a hearing in nature of coram nobis.rice motion to vacate claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.the district court held an evidentiary hearing concerning rice ineffective assistance of counsel claim at which only rice testified.after the hearing and additional briefing,the district court also denied rice motion to set aside the verdict.the district court subsequently entered judgment against rice,ordering restitution and sentencing rice to months probation on each count to be served concurrently.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,rice contends that i the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict,requiring a judgment of acquittal,or,alternatively,the verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence,requiring a new trial ii the district court plainly erred with respect to several evidentiary rulings and jury instructions and iii his counsel was ineffective.we address each argument in turn.
sufficiency and weight of the evidence 
we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal.united states funchess,cir.we will overturn a jury verdict based upon insufficiency of the evidence only if it is clear that no reasonable jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states lee,cir united states surratt,cir.in evaluating the evidence sufficiency,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,resolving evidentiary conflicts in favor of the government,and accepting all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence that support the jury verdict.united states sanders,cir.under this stringent standard,a verdict will be overturned only in rare cases.lee,at.
to establish a violation of,the government must prove that the defendant made a statement the statement was false,fictitious or fraudulent as the defendant knew the defendant made the statement knowingly and willfully the statement was within the jurisdiction of a federal agency and the statement was material.united states johnson,cir.to establish a violation of,the government must prove that the defendant knowingly concealed,removed,disposed of or converted the property described in the indictment the described property was mortgaged or pledged to,or held by,the farmers home administration or a successor agency and the defendant acted with intent to defraud the agency see also united states porter,cir.
with respect to the count,rice contends that there was insufficient evidence that he knew to be false his representation that there had been no material changes to his financial condition however,having reviewed the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict,it is clear that a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that rice knew his statement to be false.the evidence showed that rice knew that fsa willingness to loan him money was a close question from the beginning.consequently,even minor changes to rice financial condition were likely to constitute a material change to his financial circumstances.in support of his renewed loan application,rice submitted documentation listing his crop year soybeans as an asset.rice also granted fsa a security interest in the soybeans and promised fsa that it would receive some of the proceeds of the sale of the soybeans in partial repayment of the loan.nevertheless,despite having sold over of the crop year soybeans the day before or morning of the loan closing,rice told fsa employees that his financial condition had not materially changed since july.having sold of that collateral,rice at a minimum placed outside of the agreements pledging his soybeans as collateral.thus,we believe a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that rice knew his statement concerning changes to his financial condition was false.
with respect to the count,rice contends that there was insufficient evidence proving that he removed or converted the pledged funds with any intent to defraud the government.we disagree.the evidence showed that rice unilaterally withdrew and used pledged funds that were purposely placed in a supervised account that required fsa authorization before withdrawing those funds.rice knew he had to obtain fsa authorization because he was involved in the negotiations over the supervised account because he executed a deposit agreement that specifically provided that n o part of such deposit s,account or money shall be withdrawn by rice except on the order of rice and the of a duly authorized representative of the government because he had four withdrawals approved previously and because the first branch bank from which he sought to withdraw funds without approval told rice he needed fsa approval.in a clear attempt to sidestep the requirement,rice nevertheless sought out a different bank branch and withdrew the pledged funds.moreover,rice failed to return the funds after fsa and the bank told him he was legally proscribed from withdrawing the funds in the first place and requested their return.based upon this evidence,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that rice knowingly removed the funds pledged to fsa with the intent to defraud fsa.
rice arguments reduce to a contention that he acted in good faith,and he advances his argument largely by relying on his own testimony from trial.the jury heard rice testimony and apparently chose not to believe him.in light of the sufficient evidence presented by the government,we will not disturb the jury findings.see united states cook,cir these arguments did not persuade the jury,and are similarly unconvincing on appeal.united states espino,cir the jury is always the ultimate arbiter of a witness credibility,and this court will not disturb the jury findings in this regard.
we also affirm the district court denial of rice motion for a new trial based upon his argument that the verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence.we review a district court denial of a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion.united states zuazo,cir.motions for new trials are generally disfavored,united states campos,cir,and will be granted only where a serious miscarriage of justice may have occurred,united states,cir quotation omitted.in his brief,rice argument that the verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence simply incorporates his arguments regarding his motion for judgment of acquittal.we have addressed those arguments.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of rice motion for new trial.accordingly,the district court properly denied rice motion for new trial.
plain error claims 
rice contends that the district court erred with respect to certain evidentiary rulings and jury instructions,but rice trial counsel failed to object to any of the allegedly erroneous rulings at trial.where trial counsel failed to raise an error at trial,this court can correct the error where there is error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.united states pirani,cir quotation omitted.critically,rice bears the burden of persuasion with respect to proving that his rights were prejudiced,and he normally can meet that requirement only by showing that the alleged error affected the case outcome.united states olano,d.where he has met his burden on the first three prongs,the court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.pirani,at quotation omitted.we are unpersuaded that the district court committed any plain error requiring a new trial.
evidentiary rulings 
rice argues that the district court plainly erred when it admitted alleged prior bad acts evidence consisting of testimony suggesting that rice was abusive toward fsa employees.a review of the record,however,makes it clear that,although the government elicited some testimony on the subject,it was primarily rice who elicited testimony and made arguments about the poor relationship he had with fsa.as rice trial counsel stated in his opening,t he evidence is going to show that there was a long period of conflict between darwin and various people at the fsa.rice trial counsel also elicited testimony that rice was volatile when he dealt with fsa employees and that,because fsa employees were instructed not to contact rice directly due to rice volatility by the attorney that represented rice in the loan process,loan documents were changed without directly discussing the changes with rice.rice trial counsel also explained at sidebar that part of the defense is that the fsa engaged in fraud and that the fsa has not acted properly in this whole transaction and has an ax to grind.in closing argument,rice trial counsel again addressed the subject,stating that this case is about misunderstanding,it about anger,failure to communicate,and all those other problems,personality problems that infect relationships between people.that is what this case is about.
we can not say that admission of such evidence constituted plain error that affected rice substantial rights or that the fairness of the proceeding was seriously affected simply because the district court allowed evidence on a subject that rice repeatedly raised.see,united states tulk,cir holding that plain error review of a prosecutor use of a prior conviction was unavailable because the defendant reference to his prior conviction in his opening statement deliberately waived his right to object united states york,cir per curiam holding that there can be no reversible error where a defendant affirmatively introduced his confession in an effort to bolster his claim of entrapment because his own use of the confession opened the door quotation omitted.
rice also argues that the district court committed plain error when it allowed hearsay evidence involving the activities of rice loan counsel,rice abusive behavior toward fsa employees and bank employees telling rice he was not allowed to withdraw money from the supervised account without fsa consent.having reviewed the record,we find that most of the statements that rice claims were hearsay were not in fact hearsay,and we find no plain error with respect to the admission of any actual hearsay.once again,rice own counsel elicited hearsay concerning rice loan counsel and rice abusive behavior.as such,for the reasons cited above,the admission of evidence on those subjects can not constitute plain error requiring reversal.this is true even though the government also elicited a limited amount of testimony on the same subjects.tulk,at.moreover,testimony describing the conduct of rice loan counsel and recounting the actual statements made by rice loan counsel do not constitute hearsay.c generally,hearsay consists of an statement.d c d admissions of agents of generally are not hearsay.
finally,to the extent that hearsay was admitted concerning what bank employees told rice,we do not find that its admission constitutes plain error.there was an overwhelming amount of other from fsa employees,agreements signed by rice and cancelled checks reflecting that rice previously obtained approval before withdrawing that rice well knew that he needed fsa approval before withdrawing funds.as such,the introduction of limited hearsay concerning what bank employees told rice did not affect the outcome of the case or rice substantial rights.
jury instructions 
rice contends that the district court erroneously failed to give jury instructions defining knowingly or knowledge and intent to defraud and failed to instruct the jury on a good faith or advice of counsel defense.jury instructions are adequate if,taken as a whole,they adequately advise the jury of the essential elements of the offenses charged and the burden of proof required of the government.united states sherer,cir.we conclude that the instructions were adequate.
it is settled law that a district court failure to define knowledge or knowingly does not constitute error,much less plain error.united states smith,cir holding that there is no need to define knowledge because the word has the meaning assigned it in common usage,and a juror would already understand the word see also united states williams,cir per curiam in the manual of model criminal instructions for the district courts of the eighth circuit,it is stated that the committee believes that in most cases the word knowingly does not need to be defined.clearly,it was not plain error to omit such a definition.
nor was it plain error to omit an instruction defining intent to defraud with respect to the charge as rice claims.in united states williams,cir,this court held that failure to instruct the jury that intent to defraud was an essential element of a charge under was error but not plain error.despite the omission of the intent to defraud element in its
