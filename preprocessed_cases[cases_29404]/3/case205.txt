plaintiffs submitted similar rulemaking petitions to the fda,ftc,ams,and fsis requesting that each agency take regulatory action to revise the current labeling requirements for eggs at,to promulgate new regulations that would require all egg cartons to identify the conditions in which the hens were kept during production.the petitions specifically proposed that each agency develop regulations that would require all egg cartons to bear the labels eggs,eggs,or eggs from caged hens,consistent with the living conditions of the hens.in support of the proposed regulations,plaintiffs argued that there is a strong consumer interest in buying eggs that are produced in environments.plaintiffs also argued that,without the proposed regulations,consumers are being misled by certain statements and images on egg cartons that imply that the hens are being raised in environments.plaintiffs provided several examples of various egg labels that present images of uncaged hens and contain phrases such as all natural or animal friendly,arguing that these images and phrases likely mislead a consumer to believe that the hens are not being raised in cages.plaintiffs also maintained that their proposed regulations are necessary because eggs from caged hens are nutritionally inferior to and carry a greater risk of salmonella contamination than eggs from hens.
each agency denied plaintiffs petition for rulemaking.the fsis and ams explained that they could not promulgate the proposed regulations because they lacked the authority to take the requested action.the ftc explained that,based on the information plaintiffs provided in the petition,it could not conclude that current practices were either unfair or deceptive.the ftc also concluded that the petition had not sufficiently demonstrated that any misleading practice was prevalent,as statutorily required for rulemaking.lastly,the ftc explained that the agency resources would be better used by combating any potentially deceptive practices through individual enforcement actions,rather than by promulgating new regulations.
the fda denied plaintiffs request for rulemaking because it determined that plaintiffs had failed to show that current egg labels omitted a material fact by not indicating the living conditions of the hens.the fda specifically explained that it could not determine that this information was material because plaintiffs had not provided persuasive evidence that eggs from caged hens are either less nutritious or more likely to be contaminated with salmonella than eggs from uncaged hens.the fda also explained that consumer interest in the hens living conditions,alone,is insufficient to establish that methods are a material fact that would permit the fda to issue the requested regulations.lastly,the fda stated that it declined to promulgate the proposed labeling regulations because it could bring individual enforcement actions against any misbranded eggs,and it would choose to use its limited resources on rulemakings of higher priority,such as those that are of greatest public health significance or are.

plaintiffs argue that the fsis acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying their rulemaking petition based on the agency conclusion that it lacks the authority to promulgate the proposed regulations.plaintiffs specifically argue that the fsis has the authority to regulate the labeling of shell eggs under the egg products inspection act epia.
the fsis correctly concluded that it lacks the authority to promulgate plaintiffs proposed labeling regulations for shell eggs.the epia expressly distinguishes between the terms egg products and eggs,and grants broad authority to the fsis to regulate the labeling only of egg products.see a stating that the fsis may promulgate regulations mandating the disclosure of information to assure that egg products will not have false or misleading labeling see also id.f defining egg product as any dried,frozen,or liquid eggs,with or without added ingredients,excepting products which contain eggs only in a relatively small proportion id.g defining egg as the shell egg of the domesticated chicken,turkey,duck,goose,or guinea.because plaintiffs proposed labeling regulations concern only shell eggs,they fall outside of the fsis labeling jurisdiction under the epia.accordingly,we conclude that th
