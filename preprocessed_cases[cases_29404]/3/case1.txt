the agricultural marketing agreement act of amaa,which was enacted to stabilize prices for agricultural commodities,regulates only handlers,processors,associations of producers,and others engaged in the handling of covered agricultural commodities.any handler that violates the secretary of agriculture marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penalties,and.one such order,the california raisin marketing order marketing order or order,established a raisin administrative committee rac,which recommends setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the open domestic market,and which recommends what portion of a particular year production should be included in the pool.the order also requires handlers to pay assessments to help cover the rac administrative costs.
petitioners,california raisin growers,started a business that processed more than million pounds of raisins from their farm and other farms during the two crop years.when they refused to surrender the requisite portions of raisins to the reserve,the united states department of agriculture usda began administrative proceedings,alleging that petitioners were handlers who were required to retain raisins in reserve and pay assessments.petitioners countered that as producers,they were not subject to the order.they also raised an affirmative defense that the order violated the fifth amendment prohibition against taking property without just compensation.an administrative law judge found that petitioners were handlers,found that they had violated the amaa and the marketing order,and rejected their takings defense.on appeal,a judicial officer agreed that petitioners were handlers who had violated the marketing order,imposed fines and civil penalties,and declined to address the takings claim.petitioners sought review in the federal district court.granting summary judgment to the usda,it found that substantial evidence supported the agency determination that petitioners were handlers rather than producers,and it rejected petitioners takings claim.the ninth circuit affirmed.it agreed that petitioners were handlers subject to the marketing order,but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve the takings claim,which they should have raised in the court of federal claims.it recognized that when a handler raises a takings defense,court of federal claims tucker act jurisdiction gives way to the amaa comprehensive remedial scheme,see,but found that petitioners had brought the takings claim in their capacity as producers.
held the ninth circuit has jurisdiction to decide petitioners takings claim.
a that court incorrectly determined that petitioners brought their takings claim as producers rather than handlers.petitioners argued that they were producers and thus not subject to the amaa or the marketing order but both the usda and the district court concluded that they were handlers.and the fines and civil penalties for failure to reserve raisins were levied on them in that capacity.because the marketing order imposes duties on petitioners only in their capacity as handlers,their takings claim raised as a defense against those duties is necessarily raised in that same capacity.in finding otherwise,the ninth circuit confused petitioners statutory argument that they were producers with their constitutional argument that,assuming they were handlers,their fine violated the fifth amendment.the relevant question is whether a federal court has jurisdiction to adjudicate a takings defense raised by a handler seeking review of a final agency order.
b the government claim that petitioners defense was rightly dismissed on ripeness grounds is unpersuasive,and its reliance on williamson county regional planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,is misplaced.there,a plaintiff claim that a zoning decision effected a taking without just compensation was not ripe.but the claim failed because the plaintiff could not show that it had been injured by the government action when there had been no final decision.here,petitioners were subject to a final agency order imposing concrete fines and penalties.the takings claim in williamson county was also not yet ripe because the plaintiff had not sought compensation through the procedures provided by the state.at.the government argues that petitioners takings claim is premature because the tucker act affords a remedy,but,in fact,the amaa provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws tucker act jurisdiction over a handler takings claim.as a result,there is no alternative remedy.
c a defense may be raised by a handler in the context of an enforcement proceeding initiated by the usda under.the provision text does not bar handlers from raising constitutional defenses to the usda enforcement action.allowing handlers to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenges to marketing orders under a,for a handler who refuses to comply with a marketing order and waits for an enforcement action will be liable for significant monetary penalties if the constitutional challenge fails.it would also make little sense to force a party to pay an assessed fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for recovery of that same money in another proceeding.see eastern enterprises apfel.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
under the agricultural marketing agreement act of amaa and the california raisin marketing order marketing order or order promulgated by the secretary of agriculture,raisin growers are frequently required to turn over a percentage of their crop to the federal government.the amaa and the marketing order were adopted to stabilize prices by limiting the supply of raisins on the market.petitioners are california raisin growers who believe that this regulatory scheme violates the fifth amendment.after petitioners refused to surrender the requisite portion of their raisins,the united states department of agriculture usda began administrative against petitioners that led to the imposition of more than in fines and civil penalties.petitioners sought judicial review,claiming that the monetary sanctions were an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation.the ninth circuit held that petitioners were required to bring their takings claim in the court of federal claims and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to review petitioners claim.we disagree.petitioners takings claim,raised as an affirmative defense to the agency enforcement action,was properly before the court because the amaa provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws tucker act jurisdiction over takings claims brought by raisin handlers.accordingly,we reverse and remand to the ninth circuit.
congress enacted the amaa during the great depression in an effort to insulate farmers from competitive market forces that it believed caused unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices.ch,stat,as amended.to achieve this goal,congress declared a national policy of stabilizing prices for agricultural commodities.ibid.the amaa authorizes the secretary of agriculture to promulgate marketing that regulate the sale and delivery of agricultural goods.see also block community nutrition institute,the act contemplates a cooperative venture among the secretary,handlers,and producers the principal purposes of which are to raise the price of agricultural products and to establish an orderly system for marketing them the secretary may delegate to industry committees the authority to administer marketing orders.c.
the amaa does not directly regulate the producer s who grow agricultural commodities,b it only regulates handlers,which the amaa defines as processors,associations of producers,and others engaged in the handling of covered agricultural commodities.handlers who violate the secretary marketing orders may be subject to civil and criminal penalties,and.
the secretary promulgated a marketing order for california raisins in see fed.reg.codified,as amended,at cfr pt.in particular,t he raisin marketing order,like other fruit and vegetable orders adopted under the amaa,sought to stabilize producer returns by limiting the quantity of raisins sold by handlers in the domestic competitive market.lion raisins,united states,ca fed.the marketing order defines a raisin handler as a a ny processor or packer b a ny person who places raisins in the current of commerce from within california to any point outside thereof c a ny person who delivers raisins into any eligible outlet or d a ny person who blends raisins subject to certain exceptions.cfr.
the marketing order also established the raisin administrative committee rac,which consists of members,with representing producers,ten representing handlers,one representing the cooperative bargaining associations,and one member of the public.see.the marketing order authorizes the rac to recommend setting up annual reserve pools of raisins that are not to be sold on the open domestic market.see e cfr d and.each year,the rac reviews crop yield,inventories,and shipments and makes recommendations to the secretary whether or not there should be a reserve pool.if the rac recommends a reserve pool,it also recommends what portion of that year production should be included in the pool the rest of that year production remains available for sale on the open market d,a.the secretary approves the recommendation if he determines that the would effectuate the declared policy of the act.the,calculated as a percentage of a producer crop,varies from year to year 
under the marketing order reserve requirements,a producer is only paid for the raisins.the raisins,on the other hand,must be held by the handler in segregated bins for the account of the rac.f.the rac may then sell the raisins to handlers for resale in overseas markets,or may alternatively direct that they be sold or given at no cost to secondary,noncompetitive domestic markets,such as school lunch programs.b.the reserve pool sales proceeds are used to finance the rac administrative costs.a.in the event that there are any remaining funds,the producers receive a pro rata share.e cfr h.as a result,even though producers do not receive payment for raisins at the time of delivery to a handler,they retain a limited interest in the net proceeds of the rac disposition of the reserve pool.
handlers have other duties beyond managing the rac reserve pool.the marketing order requires them to file certain reports with the rac,such as reports concerning the quantity of raisins that they hold or acquire.they are also required to allow the rac access to their premises,raisins,and business records to verify the of the handlers reports,to obtain inspections of raisins acquired,d,and to pay certain assessments,which help cover the rac administrative costs.a handler who violates any provision of the order or its implementing regulations is subject to a civil penalty of up to per day.b cfr b vii.a handler who does not comply with the reserve requirement must compensate the rac for the amount of the loss resulting from his failure to deliver the requisite raisins.c.
petitioners marvin and laura horne have been producing raisins in two california counties fresno and madera since.the hornes do business as raisin valley farms,a general partnership.for more than years,the hornes operated only as raisin producers.but,after becoming disillusioned with the amaa regulatory scheme they began looking for ways to avoid the mandatory reserve program.since the amaa applies only to handlers,the hornes devised a plan to bring their raisins to market without going through a traditional handler.to this end,the hornes entered into a partnership with horne parents called lassen vineyards.in addition to its activities,lassen vineyards purchased equipment to clean,stem,sort,and package the raisins from raisin valley farms and lassen vineyards.it also contracted with more than other raisin growers to clean,stem,sort,and,in some cases,box and stack their raisins for a fee.the hornes facilities processed more than million pounds of raisins in toto during the and crop years.during these two crop years,the hornes produced and of the raisins they processed,respectively.
although the usda informed the hornes in that their proposed operations made them handlers under the amaa,the hornes paid no assessments to the rac during the and crop years.nor did they set aside raisins from those produced and owned by the more than other farmers who contracted with lassen vineyards for packing services.they also declined to arrange for rac inspection of the raisins they received for processing,denied the rac access to their records,and held none of their own raisins in reserve.
on april,the administrator of the agriculture marketing service administrator initiated an enforcement action against the hornes,raisin valley farms,and lassen vineyards petitioners.the complaint alleged that petitioners were handlers of california raisins during the and crop years.it also alleged that petitioners violated the amaa and the marketing order by submitting inaccurate forms to the rac and failing to hold inspections of incoming raisins,retain raisins in reserve,pay assessments,and allow access to their records.petitioners denied the allegations,countering that they were not handlers and asserting that they did not acquire physical possession of the other producers raisins within the meaning of the regulations.petitioners also raised several affirmative defenses,including a claim that the marketing order violated the fifth prohibition against taking property without just compensation.
an administrative law judge alj concluded in that petitioners were handlers of raisins and thus subject to the marketing order.the alj also concluded that petitioners violated the amaa and the marketing order and rejected petitioners takings defense based on its view that handlers no longer have a property right that permits them to market their crop free of regulatory control.app.citing,united states,fed.cl.
petitioners appealed to a judicial officer who,like the alj,also found that petitioners were handlers and that they had violated the marketing order.the judicial imposed in civil penalties under b in assessments for the two crop years under cfr a and for the value of the california raisins that petitioners failed to hold in reserve for the two crop years under c.the judicial officer believed that he lacked authority to judge the constitutionality of the various statutes administered by the usda,app,and declined to adjudicate petitioners takings claim.
petitioners filed a complaint in federal district court seeking judicial review of the usda decision.see b.the district court granted summary judgment to the usda.the court held that substantial evidence supported the agency determination that petitioners were handlers subject to the marketing order,and rejected petitioners argument that they were exempt from the marketing order due to their status as producers under b.no.ljo sms,wl,ed.petitioners renewed their fifth amendment argument,asserting that the requirement a physical taking.though the district court found that the rac takes title to a significant portion of a california raisin producer crop through the reserve requirement,the court held that the transfer of title to the rac did not constitute a physical taking.see,at i n essence,petitioners are paying an admissions fee or toll admittedly a steep one for marketing raisins.the government does not force plaintiffs to grow raisins or to market the raisins rather,it directs that if they grow and market raisins,then passing title to their reserve tonnage raisins to the rac is the admissions ticket evans united states,fed.cl.
