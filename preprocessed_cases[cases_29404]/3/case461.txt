in two cases,animal control officers seized horses they believed to be at risk.the proceedings leading to the consolidated appeals now before us are convoluted.
penal code section provides when an animal control officer has reasonable grounds to believe that very prompt action is required to protect the health or safety of the animal or the health or safety of others,the officer shall immediately seize the animal and comply with subdivision f providing for a hearing.in all other cases,the officer shall comply with the provisions of subdivision g providing for notice in lieu of seizure,and a hearing,subd.a.
penal code section fn.is a regulatory scheme covering treatment of animals.it provides that the failure to provide animals with proper care and attention is a misdemeanor.subd.a.it covers the authority of animal control officers over sick,injured,straying,or abandoned animals in nonemergency situations.it further provides that animals may be seized or impounded when such an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that very prompt action is required to protect the health or safety of the animals.subds.a b.animals that were properly seized are to receive care and treatment,the costs of which shall constitute a lien on the animal that the owner must pay before the animal is returned.subds.a b.the owner of a seized or impounded animal is entitled to a postseizure hearing to determine the validity of the seizure or impoundment,return of the animals,and liability for costs.subds.f j.broden marin humane society th,broden.
the county of butte,acting via its animal control department hereafter collectively the county,seized horses on separate occasions from plaintiffs ellen frye and marlene schultz collectively frye except as context otherwise indicates and each sought a hearing to contest the propriety of those seizures.separate administrative hearing officers sustained the seizures in each case.
frye then filed a mandamus petition butte,the first petition.the trial court roberts,the first trial court issued a document captioned statement of decision holding that the administrative findings did not adequately justify the county election of remedies,and remanding both cases for new administrative hearings.long after those new hearings were completed,the first trial court issued a document captioned judgment,from which the county appealed,and frye.
in civil no,we hold the county appeal and frye are untimely,because the statement of decision was a judgment,albeit a judgment,and therefore the purported j udgment arising much later out of the same case was a nullity and did not extend the time in which to file a notice of appeal.accordingly,we dismiss the untimely appeal and from that purported judgment.
the new administrative hearings resulted in findings again sustaining the county seizures of the horses.frye filed a new mandamus petition challenging those findings butte,the second petition,and filed a timely appeal civ.no.from the judgment denying that petition.we shall affirm that judgment.
discussion 
ithe first petitiona.procedural background 
on february,frye filed a second amended petition seeking a writ of administrative mandate and declaratory relief,later characterized by frye as a review petition.frye alleged various defects in the initial administrative hearings,including inadequate discovery,lack of neutral hearing officers,lack of evidence to support the decisions,and imposition of excessive administrative costs.
on september,the first trial court issued a document captioned as a statement of decision finding the administrative decisions were deficient because the record is devoid of any findings as to the proper procedure to be used,therefore these cases must be remanded to first determine whether or not hearings should have been implemented before seizing the animals and proceeding with the hearing.to allow the agency to proceed with a hearing only would deprive the party of any remedy to address whether a hearing would have been more appropriate in each circumstance.the cases are remanded to the agency to conduct a hearing on the proper procedure that should have been used in these cases.
in november and december,the respective hearing officers upheld the process used by the county in each case,after the hearings on remand ordered by the trial court.
on january,the first trial court issued an order stating new administrative hearings had been conducted and if the parties wanted to challenge the new findings,they had to file a new petition that could be heard before a different judge.
on march,frye filed an original petition for writ of mandate in this court frye superior court,civ.no,complaining that the first trial court has refused to enter any judgment in the matter.
on april,we disposed of frye original petition as follows 
inasmuch as code of civil procedure section does not permit remand before the writ issues,but instead specifies that the writ shall issue and the reviewing court may then remand sierra club.contra costa county th,sierra club,respondent court inartfully worded statement of decision issued september,was in fact intended by respondent court as a final judgment setting aside the administrative decision and directing reconsideration of the matter as specified in the statement of decision.as a result,and as noted by respondent court in its order of january,any challenge to the most recent administrative decision must be based on a new petition for writ of mandate.accordingly,the instant petition for writ of mandate is denied.
on april,frye moved to have the first trial court enter a judgment commanding the county to set aside the first administrative decisions,compelling return of the horses,returning costs already paid for seizing and caring for frye horses,and awarding court costs.frye points and authorities acknowledged we had ruled that the first trial court had issued a final judgment,but argued further issues remained to be decided and therefore the interlocutory order was not a final judgment in effect arguing to the trial court that we had erred and it should disregard our ruling.the county did not oppose entry of a final judgment,but sought a more limited judgment that merely remanded the matters for further hearings.because those hearings had already taken place,the county argued the proper vehicle for frye to obtain any additional relief was by filing a new petition for writ of mandate.
the first trial court signed a document captioned judgment on august,issuing a writ of mandate commanding the agency to set aside the first administrative decisions,remanding for new hearings,and awarding frye court costs according to proof.notice of entry of this purported judgment was made on august.
on october,the county filed an appeal from that purported judgment.on october,frye filed a from it.
timeliness of the appeal 
the parties briefed the validity and adequacy of the purported judgment signed on august.we do not reach those issues here instead,we resolve this appeal and based on supplemental briefing we ordered.we confirm our earlier view that the document captioned statement of decision filed on september,was a final judgment remanding for further administrative proceedings this triggered the time in which to file a notice of appeal,and the later document captioned as a judgment did not extend that time it was a nullity.because the notices of appeal and from that void judgment were untimely as measured from the date of the true albeit miscaptioned judgment,this appeal must be dismissed.
the statement of decision was a final judgment.
at the time the statement of decision was filed,a trial court could not issue an interlocutory administrative remand order.see sierra club,supra,th at resource defense fund local agency formation com.d,resource defense fund.because we normally presume a trial court acts according to extant law see ross superior court cal d in re fred d,we reasoned that the first trial court issued a final writ when we denied frye original petition.
as frye emphasizes,several months after we denied frye original writ petition,our supreme court disapproved of the rule stated in sierra club and resource defense fund,and held there was no blanket prohibition on the appropriate use,in an administrative mandamus action,of a prejudgment remand for agency reconsideration of one or more issues pertinent to the agency decision.voice of the wetlands state water resources control bd.cal th,voice of the wetlands.but this does not change the fact that,at the time it acted,the first trial court was bound to follow the prior rule see auto equity sales,superior court cal d,auto equity sales witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction,pp.witkin,and therefore intended at that time that its statement of decision function as a final judgment,as we previously concluded,following law 
accordingly,we confirm the view we previously expressed in the prior original writ proceeding in this court,namely,that the document captioned as a statement of decision filed on september,was a final judgment.
frye contends that the statement of decision did not resolve all of the pleaded issues between the parties,specifically,claims for monetary damages and return of the horses.generally speaking,the county agrees.frye argues that this,too,shows the statement of decision was not a judgment.
we disagree.as we explain,the statement of decision resolved all issues necessary to resolve at that time.it would have been premature to order return of the horses or restitution of amounts paid to the county to care for them,before the legality of the seizure had been determined via the new administrative hearings in the first instance.
generally,a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ,see morehart county of santa barbara cal th,no appeal from purported judgment that fails to dispose of all causes of action.this case was not an action,but was a special proceeding.code civ,see witkin,supra,actions.however,the rule defining a judgment is the same a judgment in a special proceeding is the final determination of the rights of the parties therein.code civ.
it has been correctly stated that the general test for determining whether the judgment is final is that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree,that decree is final,but where anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties,the decree is interlocutory.meehan hopps cal d,see dana point safe harbor collective superior court cal th,people whaley th.
the first cause of action in the first petition alleges the administrative hearing regarding the frye seizure was invalid for various reasons.the second cause of action alleges the administrative hearing regarding the schultz seizure was invalid for various reasons.the third cause of action sought a declaration regarding the validity of the county practices regarding choosing a preas opposed to remedy.the fourth cause of action sought a declaration that section was unconstitutional on its face and as applied.
the judgment as set forth in the statement of decision ordered new administrative hearings to determine the validity of the county exercise of discretion to elect between pre and remedies.the first trial court therefore agreed the first through third causes of action merited relief in the form of new administrative hearings.that judgment impliedly rejected the claim in the fourth cause of action that section was facially unconstitutional,because the new hearings were designed in part to determine the lawfulness of the county actions in these particular cases.thus,the judgment adequately disposed of the first petition and frye or the county could have appealed therefrom.see griset fair political practices com.cal th,under one final judgment rule,denial of petition for writ of mandate in a prior appeal effectively resolved claims seeking to declare a statute unconstitutional,to enjoin an administrative fine,and to prohibit future enforcement,and therefore was a final determination of the rights of the parties in the action,because the superior court ruling disposed of all causes of action framed by the pleadings,leaving no substantive issue for future determination,it was an appealable judgment.
certain remedies sought by the first petition remained unresolved,but that is only because they were not yet ripe,pending the outcome of the new administrative hearings.although frye points to the alleged illegal retention of the horses and money damages based on the county improper charges,until new administrative hearings were completed,such remedies would be premature therefore,by ordering new administrative hearings,the first trial court resolved all the issues in the petition that were proper to resolve at that time 
no timely appeal from the judgment was filed.
the county was clearly aggrieved by having to undergo new administrative hearings,and therefore could have appealed from the judgment ordering a remand.see witkin,supra,extraordinary writs.
the time to appeal from the judgment signed september,expired no later than days after it was signed.cal.rules of court,rule a c see witkin,supra,appeal.the notice of appeal filed by the county and the notice of filed by frye in october were filed more than days later,and therefore were not timely,as the county concedes assuming we treat the statement of decision as a judgment,which we do frye declined to brief this issue,forfeiting the point.see people anderson th,a point not argued or supported by citation to authority is forfeited.
we are aware that between the time the statement of decision issued and the time the purported judgment was entered,the parties engaged in dialogue with the first trial court on the confusion caused by the miscaptioning,and also participated in further administrative hearings but they failed to file a timely notice of appeal.
although notices of appeal are construed broadly,and may be deemed to refer to a different order or judgment than specified,a timely notice of appeal is an absolute prerequisite to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.hollister convalescent,rico cal d,see maynard brandon cal th,maynard cal.rules of court,rules d appellate court may not relieve a party from the failure to file a timely notice of appeal,b appellate court must dismiss the appeal if the notice of appeal is filed late witkin,supra,appeal,see also in re baycol cases i ii cal th,fn.california follows a one shot rule under which,if an order is appealable,appeal must be taken or the right to appellate review is forfeited.

once the judgment on the first petition became final due to the lack of a timely appeal,the trial court jurisdiction to act on that petition was exhausted.as we have said before,judgments are parceled out at the ration of one per lawsuit.paterno state of california th,paterno.thus,the judgment filed on august,was a nullity.see,moore city county of san francisco d,moore second judgment invalid on its face.this second judgment in the same action could not trigger a new period in which to file a notice of appeal.therefore,we dismiss the appeal and in civil no,as untimely.
the second petitiona.procedural background 
in the new round of administrative hearings,the county tendered the record of the earlier hearings.each of the hearing officers again sustained the respective seizures of frye and schultz horses.
on april,frye filed the second mandamus petition butte,partly contending that the hearing officers failed to explain why the remedy was not appropriate in either case.
on september,the trial court mclean,the second trial court issued a statement of decision rejecting frye due process claims,concluding in the critical portion as follows 
both hearing officers described the testimony upon which they relied in reaching their respective decisions.these decisions were both based upon sufficient and substantial evidence to reach the conclusion that the animals were seized because they were in dire need of assistance.this court finds that the county acted within the scope of its discretionary power and not in excess of that power.
the next question before the court is whether penal code section f or g applies to this matter.based on the findings of the two hearing officers and the testimony at the hearings this court finds that sufficient evidence existed to authorize the county to seize the animals pursuant to penal code f.this court finds that the county acted within its jurisdiction under the butte county code and the laws of the state of california and did not act in excess of its powers.thus the procedures of g are not at issue in this matter.
on october,the second trial court issued a judgment denying the second petition,and frye timely appealed therefrom.
frye faults the hearing officers for not complying with the first trial court order,because they did not compel the county to demonstrate why it seized the horses under section,subdivision f,instead of providing notice of the claimed violation and granting frye a hearing,under section,subdivision g,and faults the second trial court for not adhering to the first trial court view of the law.frye briefs raise three arguments in advance of this general view.we reject each argument.
law of the case 
frye asserts that under the law of the case doctrine,the hearing officers had to determine whether the county election to seize the horses was more appropriate than electing the remedy of notice to the owners and a hearing,and that the second trial court,in ruling on the second petition,was bound to review the new decisions by the standards set by the first trial court in its ruling on the first petition.
the law of the case doctrine provides generally that a prior appellate court ruling on the law generally governs further proceedings in the case,whether that ruling was right or wrong.see people stanley cal th,people dutra th.but the doctrine does not apply to prior trial court rulings therefore the ruling by the first trial court was not law of the case.see lawrence ballou cal,provience valley clerks trust fund d.
frye relies on three cases involving administrative hearings for the contrary proposition.in each of those cases,the law of the case doctrine was applied following a prior appellate decision.george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.cal d george arakelian farms nielsen industrial acc.com.cal.united dredging indust.acc.com.cal.nothing in any of these cases detracts from the settled rule that law of the case does not apply to prior trial court decisions.
frye argues that the rise of administrative review under code of civil procedure section somehow alters the scope of law of the case,by casting the superior court,in ruling on a petition for writ of mandate,in the role of an appellate court,for purposes of law of the case.this contention departs from supreme court precedent.see george arakelian farms,supra,cal d at the doctrine of the law of the case serves to promote finality of litigation by preventing a party from relitigating questions previously decided by a reviewing court emphasis added.thus we can not expand the doctrine,even were we inclined to do so.see auto equity sales,supra,cal d at.
scope of the administrative hearings on remand 
frye argues the new hearings did not comply with the remand order contained within the first trial court statement of decision,and therefore the new hearings were not conducted according to law.this contention is forfeited because it is not separately headed as an argument.see in re th,opdyk california horse racing bd.th,fn.
moreover,we find no due process violation.in each case,the hearing officer on remand found the evidence showed reasonable cause to believe very prompt action by animal control was necessary to protect the horses.contrary to frye argument,if the facts show objectively reasonable cause to believe very prompt action was necessary,the statutory scheme authorizes immediate seizure,followed by a hearing,consistent with due process.indeed,when an animal control officer has reasonable grounds to believe that very prompt action is necessary,the statute commands that that officer shall immediately seize the animal s that are in danger or pose a danger to the public,subd.a.the county was not required to show,in hindsight,that giving notice would have been feasible or could have been used or would have been more appropriate than taking immediate,lawful,action,as frye contends carrera bertaini d carrera,relying in part on fuentes shevin,d,fuentes,provided examples of the need for very prompt action in the context of animal seizures 
i t is clear that at times the summary seizure of farm animals must be permitted to protect the personal safety and property rights of our citizens.for example,where an animal has strayed onto a public highway,it must be removed from the highway to avoid injury to motorists and others using the highway.also,if an animal with dangerous propensities has escaped from its enclosure,it must be returned to its enclosure to avoid injury to others.so too,an injured,sick,or starving animal must be cared for in a humane way,if possible.in these situations,if after a reasonable investigation the officer is unable to locate the owner or person entitled to the possession of the animal for the purpose of giving him the opportunity of recapturing the animal or of caring for the animal as the situation may demand,then the officer must have the power summarily to take possession of the animal.here,the governmental interest in protecting the person and property of others must be deemed to override the property right of the owner.carrera,supra,d at.
the term very prompt action as used in section was taken from fuentes 
only in a few limited situations has this court allowed outright seizure fn.without opportunity for a prior hearing.first in each case,the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest.second,there has been special need for very prompt action.third,the state has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining,under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute,that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance.thus,the court has allowed summary seizure of property to collect the internal revenue of the united states,fn.to meet the needs of a national war effort,fn.to protect against the economic disaster of a bank failure,fn.and to protect the public from misbranded drugs fn.and contaminated food.fn.fuentes,supra,at pp.d at,emphasis added see carrera,supra,d at.
whether special circumstances warrant summary seizure depend upon the nature of the governmental interest,the need for very prompt action,and the duty of the seizing official under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute.phillips san luis obispo county.regulation d,menefee son of food agriculture d.t he statutory language authorizing immediate seizure when an animal control officer has reasonable grounds to believe that very prompt action is required to protect the health or safety of others is the equivalent of the exigent circumstances exception familiar to search and seizure law there is no litmus test for emergencies every case must be explained in light of what was known to the officer at the time of entry.broden,supra,th at see conway pasadena humane society th.
thus,the findings by the hearing officers that the information known to the animal control officers at the time of the respective seizures gave reasonable grounds to believe very prompt action was needed to protect the horses was sufficient to show that those officers acted lawfully.no additional findings were necessary to uphold the seizures.
nor do we agree with frye view that new evidence was re
