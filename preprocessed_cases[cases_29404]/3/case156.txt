hercules,hercules and crompton cie uniroyal raise constitutional claims and argue that the district court erred in assigning and apportioning liability for environmental cleanup costs pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,stat.we affirm.
background 
this case involves years of litigation and numerous district court and appellate opinions,both published and unpublished.at issue is the cost the united states has incurred in its environmental cleanup efforts at the vertac chemical plant site in jacksonville,arkansas the jacksonville site or the site.the full procedural and factual history of this case has been discussed in several previous decisions.this opinion will address the relevant portions of each.
factual history 
the jacksonville site was originally developed by the federal government in the as a munitions factory.in the late,the site was sold to corporation,a company.first manufactured various pesticides,but began manufacturing phenoxy herbicides in.these herbicides included dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and trichlorophenoxyacetic acid,synthetic hormones that kill weeds or brush by accelerating growth to the point of natural death.although these herbicides biodegrade into harmless substances,the manufacture of but not creates a toxic byproduct that is now viewed as hazardous to humans,dioxin.while operated the site,an unknown quantity of these and other untreated chemical wastes from the production processes flowed through cooling ponds on the west side of the plant into a nearby stream,rocky branch creek.other wastes were stored in drums stacked in a field on the site.
in,hercules bought the site and continued to manufacture herbicides,including and,at the plant until.during this period,hercules sold the bulk of its product to the united states department of defense as the defoliant agent orange,a herbicide made from a mixture of and that was used in vietnam to clear jungle undergrowth.
soon after hercules took over the site,it buried the deteriorating drums left by in unlined trenches in the southeast corner of the site.until late,hercules continued practice of discharging untreated waste water directly into rocky branch creek.hercules then constructed a waste water pretreatment system,but the system did not remove dioxin.it consisted of a neutralization trench designed to reduce the acidity of the water,an equalization basin designed to stabilize the rate of flow into the city of jacksonville sewage system,and a pump and pipe to deliver the treated water to the sewage system.the system equalization basin frequently overflowed during heavy rainfalls,and it leaked.
after it learned of the toxicity of dioxin in,hercules instituted a toluene extraction process designed to remove organic impurities from products.this process yielded residue stillbottoms containing extremely high levels of dioxin.hercules placed this residue in drums,some of which it buried at the site and some of which it disposed of at a nearby landfill.hercules acknowledges that numerous leaks and spills occurred during its operation of the site.when the drums leaked in the process area before being transported to the drum burial pit,hercules practice was to place any contaminated soil into the drum.
in,hercules ceased production at the site.hercules cleaned out all of its equipment and production vessels,buried its waste,and shipped empty drums.in,it leased the facility to transvaal,which later became vertac chemical vertac 
vertac continued to manufacture and and followed hercules practice of burying most of the waste.in,however,vertac began shipping its waste to landfills and began to store its stillbottoms above ground with the hope that the waste would someday be recycled.in,vertac purchased the site from hercules.vertac voluntarily ceased manufacturing and on march.
on february,the united states environmental protection agency epa issued a proposed rule under the toxic substances control act to prevent vertac from disposing of the dioxin from the jacksonville site.this rule,known as the vertac rule,became final later that year and prohibited the disposal of wastes that contained dioxin.if vertac could show that a batch of produced waste that was free of dioxins,it could dispose of that waste and all subsequent waste.
according to testimony at the hearing on the proposed rule,vertac had approximately drums of wastes resulting from the production of.the first set of samples taken from seven hundred drums of waste resulting from the initial production of revealed dioxin levels of approximately twenty parts per billion ppb.the samples were later sent to wright state university and monsanto company for testing.monsanto could not detect any dioxin with its analytical equipment,but wright state detected ppb.in a second sampling of drums,it detected ppb and the next sampling showed ppb.because the waste contained dioxin,vertac stopped analyzing samples of the waste and allowed the drums to accumulate.later testing by the state of arkansas,as well as the results of trial burns,revealed the presence of dioxin in the drums.
vertac continued its operations until.in,it abandoned the site,and the site went into receivership.by then,there were nearly drums at the site that contained waste materials including,and dioxin.some drums were labeled t waste,some d waste,some were marked t and d,and some were not marked at all.many of these markings were indistinguishable or unreadable.more than drums were stored outside and exposed to the elements.the drums were stacked three high on deteriorating pallets and were failing at a rate of between five to three hundred drums per week.
many of the drums had corroded and leaked,contaminating the soil,groundwater,and buildings at the site.contamination was found in other areas of the site,at the landfills,in nearby neighborhoods,and in the grounds adjacent to the site.after vertac abandoned the plant,the epa took over the site,closed down all operations,and assumed cleanup responsibilities that have cost well over million to date.
to carry out its response measures,the epa divided the site into five units areas,operable units,and,and the incineration response action.several removal actions addressed the immediate threat posed by the drummed waste left on the site when it was abandoned.four remedial actions addressed the long term solutions for the rest of the site and the surrounding area affected by the site.for each of the remedial actions,the national contingency plan required the epa to conduct a remedial investigation of the site conditions,including an endangerment assessment of the threats posed by the contamination at the site perform a feasibility study examining the various technical alternatives for remediating the site take public comment on the epa proposed remedial action plan based on the alternatives discussed in the feasibility study compile an administrative record for remedial action decision making and issue a written record of decision rod explaining the regional administrator reasoning in selecting the final remedial action plan and responding to the public comments received.
uniroyal was one of vertac customers and purchased and other products from vertac in the.in,vertac informed uniroyal that it lacked the funds to purchase enough tcb,a key ingredient in the manufacture of,to fulfill its contractual obligations to uniroyal.uniroyal agreed to supply vertac with enough tcb to create some million pounds of that was to be shipped back to uniroyal.vertac did not purchase the tcb directly from uniroyal,but instead reduced the amount it charged uniroyal for the to reflect the value of the tcb that uniroyal had supplied.this arrangement was embodied in two separate contracts and was carried out between march and march.the that was produced with uniroyal tcb represents less than one percent of the more than million pounds of and that were manufactured at the site over the course of its operation.
procedural history 
on october,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment,holding that hercules was jointly and severally liable under cercla sections a and for the response costs incurred by the united states with regard to the jacksonville site.a and united states vertac chem.hercules moved for reconsideration,arguing that disputed issues of fact existed regarding divisibility.on november,the district court denied hercules motion,finding that hercules had failed to present evidence in support of its divisibility of harm defense.
hercules appealed that decision,and we reversed and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider hercules claim of divisibility in light of the legal standards enunciated in our april,opinion united states hercules,cir vertac xi.in october and december,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on hercules divisibility of harm defense,resulting in a transcript of some pages in length.the parties submitted briefs,together with a voluminous record that included documents,exhibits,transcripts,depositions,and the administrative record.the district court considered the entire record,applied the law as stated in vertac xi,and held that hercules had failed to establish its divisibility of harm defense,with the exception of one landfill,the rogers road landfill a divisibility finding that the government does not challenge.united states vertac chem,d vertac xii.
in its final judgment following its march,memorandum opinion and order,the district court held that hercules and uniroyal were jointly and severally liable to the united states for the following amounts hercules,in the amount of,plus any additional response costs,and uniroyal,in the amount of,plus any additional costs.the district court had previously allocated the amount of contribution of the total response costs for which each entity was jointly and severally liable.to the extent that the united states enforces its judgment,hercules is entitled to contribution from uniroyal in an amount equal to percent of,and uniroyal is entitled to contribution from hercules in an amount equal to percent of.
on appeal,hercules argues that the district court erred in apportioning liability.uniroyal argues that we should overturn our holding in vertac xi that affirmed the district court holding that uniroyal was liable.hercules and uniroyal further argue that the district court imposition of retroactive liability was unconstitutional.
ii.hercules liability 
hercules challenges the district court liability determination on both legal and factual grounds.we will first address hercules contention that the district court applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether hercules established its divisibility of harm defense.we will then turn to hercules argument that the drummed waste,the stillbottoms,operable unit,the jacksonville landfill,the soils,and the groundwater are each separate sites capable of further apportionment.
we review de novo the district court legal conclusions.richardson sugg,cir.we review its factual findings for clear error.id.using this standard,we will overturn a factual finding only if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,if it is based on an erroneous view of the law,or if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that an error was made.id.we give due regard to the district court opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.id.a district court choice between two permissible views of evidence can not be clearly erroneous.tadlock powell,cir.
legal standard 
hercules contends that the district court erred in concluding that the site could not be separated into divisible geographic units.as to the drums,hercules argues that the district court failed to consider whether there existed a single,divisible harm and addressed only whether there existed distinct harms.the thrust of hercules arguments is factual,however,and the district court applied the appropriate legal standard.
in vertac xi we held that a defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there exists a reasonable basis for divisibility.vertac xi,at.
the proper standard for determining divisibility is that the defendant show either distinct harms or a reasonable basis for apportioning causation for a single harm.a defendant need not prove that its waste did not,or could not,contribute to any of the harm at a cercla site in order to establish divisibility,because it is also possible to prove divisibility of single harms based on volumetric,chronological or other types of evidence.a site may also be divisible if a defendant can establish that it consists of areas of contamination.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.we noted that proving divisibility is a very difficult proposition and that where the harms are incapable of division,the district court should not make an arbitrary apportionment.id.at.
in its opinion,the district court applied the standard for determining divisibility as set forth in vertac xi.the district court first considered whether hercules established a reasonable basis for divisibility by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the site could be divisible on a geographical basis under its geographical apportionment theory,hercules argued that each operable unit within the jacksonville site is a separate site for purposes of divisibility.in considering and ultimately rejecting hercules argument,the district court found that the epa divided the site into operable units for the purposes of remediation and that the operable units did not solely address geographical portions of the site.vertac xii,d at.
with regard to the drums,hercules argues that the district court erroneously held that and commingling of dioxin prevented hercules from establishing a reasonable basis for divisibility.in vertac xi,we held that a single harm may be treated as divisible when it is possible to discern the degree to which different parties contributed to the damage.single harms may also be treated as divisible in terms of degree,based,for example on the relative quantities of waste discharged into the stream.divisibility of this type may be provable even where wastes have become and commingled.at internal quotations omitted.hercules,however,did not argue that the drums caused a single,divisible harm that could be apportioned based on relative quantities of waste or volumetric evidence.as the government points out,this argument would have been inconsistent with hercules argument that it should not be held liable for any of the drummed waste.
drummed waste 
the drums contained and stillbottom wastes,dioxin,and other hazardous and toxic substances.when the site went into receivership,the drums were leaking,corroding,and failing.by february,the failed drums had been placed inside new,larger drums overpacked.because the drums contained corrosive materials,maintenance of the drums was an ongoing process.the epa determined that the wastes on the site posed a threat to public health and welfare and the environment.the drummed material was considered acutely hazardous waste,and the epa chose to dispose of the wastes by incineration.the arkansas department of pollution control and ecology adpc e managed the incineration from until june,when the epa took over the incineration of the drums.
hercules argues that the district court clearly erred in finding the following the epa and the adpc e decided to incinerate the waste drums because of the dioxin contained therein hercules was responsible for the of the plant equipment causing waste drums to contain dioxin and hercules was responsible for the commingling of the waste and the dioxin contaminated soil,causing the drums to contain dioxin.
hercules first argues that it should not be held liable for the cost of incinerating the waste drums because those drums would have been incinerated regardless of whether they were contaminated with dioxin.the district court concluded that hercules argument did not withstand scrutiny and found that the epa and arkansas were concerned that a potential fire,explosion,or tornado could spread dioxin into the environment.vertac xii,d at.thus,the district court determined that i t was not,as hercules argues,the dirt in the drums that drove the incineration rather it was the dioxin in the dirt that drove the incineration of the drums.id.
as the district court noted in the factual background of the case,the vertac rule permitted vertac to landfill the waste drums only after showing that the drums contained no dioxin.this was never shown,and phyllis moore,the former director of the adpc e,and randall mathis,her successor,testified that time was of the essence,that further testing was expensive and time consuming,that the drums were corroding and failing,and that the drums posed an imminent risk of fire and explosion.
moore was involved in the initial decision to incinerate the waste drums.although she stated that the issue of dirt did not influence her decision,moore testified that a primary concern was the presence of dioxin in the waste drums,regardless of whether it was transmitted to the drums by at the production facility or by the overpacking of the drums with contaminated soil.at.she further testified that it was important that the method of incineration satisfy the requirements of the adpc e and the epa for destruction of dioxin.regarding the ultimate decision to incinerate,moore testified that the state would have looked at other options if there had been no dioxin in any of the drums.at.we thus reject hercules argument that the incineration of the drums was in no way attributable to dioxin.
hercules next argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the equipment at the plant contaminated waste with dioxin after hercules had cleaned the production vessels in.the district court found that the cleanup of the equipment was not as thorough as portrayed by hercules,and that the plant equipment was with,and dioxin.vertac xii,d at.the district court rejected hercules theory that vertac chemical production flushed the dioxin out of the production vessels.
in its brief,hercules recites portions of arthur treisback affidavit,which was excluded as hearsay at trial and is not part of the record on appeal,and relies primarily on treisback deposition testimony,portions of which were read into evidence by richard karkkainen during his testimony.treisback was hercules plant manager in charge of the plant cleanup,and karkkainen was vertac director of environment and safety from to.karkkainen testified that treisback deposition testimony described the common practice of cleaning plant equipment and,although karkkainen had no personal knowledge of the cleaning,that it was likely that hercules followed the common practice.at.karkkainen further testified that there was no indication that the cleaning process was successful.at.
the district court also heard the testimony of reeddie ray and stephen quigley.ray worked for hercules from to and was involved in the plant cleanup.ray testified extensively about how the equipment was cleaned.to clean the tanks,w e washed them out with a water hose only time we heated the water if there was sediment in the bottom of the tank.regarding the process lines,process lines were cleaned with steam we had to disassemble the lines to get water out of the tank.ray did not recall using any solvents the only time we used solvent is where we wanted to take the sediment and circulate and dissolve something in it,but i do think we used solvent.i think we just used water and steam,that all.at.quigley,uniroyal expert,testified that it was unlikely that solvents were used to clean the equipment and even if they were,it is likely that some contamination would remain in the equipment.at.given the evidence before the district court,we conclude that it did not err in finding that dioxin remained in the plant after hercules cleaning.
hercules contends that the district court clearly erred in rejecting its flushing theory.according to this theory,after vertac shifted plant production exclusively to products that do not generate dioxin,about ten production runs would have flushed out any significant amount of dioxin remaining in the plant equipment.because vertac stopped producing in march,three years after hercules sold the plant to vertac,hercules argued that there could be no detectable dioxin in the waste in late,when vertac began to accumulate the waste drums.the district court disregarded the flushing theory as,just theory and noted that a fter nearly eight years of only production,dioxin and were present in plant equipment.vertac xii,d at.
we conclude that the district court did not err in rejecting hercules flushing theory the district court stated that,because the plant equipment contained dioxin and after nearly eight years of production,the evidence basically disproves the theory.the finding that dioxin was present in the plant equipment is supported by the evidence.an epa inventory of the process vessels and tanks in the central process area of the jacksonville site showed that of the process vessels contained chemical material including,and dioxin.at.of the vessels sampled,more than half were contaminated with dioxin at levels greater than ppb.at.hercules argues that the data showing contamination of the plant equipment was untrustworthy,but hercules has failed to show that the epa or the district court relied on that evidence.hercules expert witness,randal maud,served as the project manager for hercules at the jacksonville site to assess the environmental consequences of the site.he testified that the unreliable data,would likely not be used because of the quality assurance problems.at.
finally,with regard to the drummed waste,hercules argues that the district court erred in holding hercules liable for the waste that was placed in the drums during overpacking.hercules contends that either the placement of the soil into the drums constituted a second disposal under cercla,for which it is not liable,or that the overpacking by vertac or the epa constituted a superseding cause,thereby relieving hercules of liability.hercules does not dispute,however,that it contaminated the soil with dioxin at the jacksonville site.
as the district court recited in its decision,disposal under cercla is defined as the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water so that such waste may enter the environment.hercules caused dioxin to enter the environment,thereby disposing of the waste.that vertac and the epa overpacked leaking drums in an effort to contain the further contamination of the site does not absolve hercules of cercla liability.accordingly,hercules remains responsible for the ongoing contamination caused by the dioxin,for that contamination was not solely caused by the act of a third party.
stillbottoms 
hercules argues that the stillbottom waste was not disposed of until after hercules sold the plant and that thus it is not responsible for any of the costs related to that disposal.vertac began accumulating stillbottom drums in,and it bought the plant from hercules in.hercules claims that vertac merely stored the waste for the purpose of later recycling,and thus did not dispose of the waste until,when the registration for was suspended.accordingly,hercules claims that the stillbottom drums constituted a distinct harm and that it should not be liable for their incineration.
section a of cercla holds liable any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.u.a.the term facility includes,any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited,stored,disposed of,or placed.finally,as we recounted above,disposal includes placing hazardous waste in a manner that allows the waste to enter the environment.simply stated,the district court found that hercules owned a facility at which hazardous waste was allowed to enter the environment.specifically,it found that the stillbottoms leaked onto the ground when hercules owned the plant.this finding is supported by quigley expert testimony w hen the wastes stillbottoms were put into drums for disposal,they were put into recycle drums,and those recycle drums did leak,some of them instantaneously upon having the waste
