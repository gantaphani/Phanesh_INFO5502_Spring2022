thomas whiting and lyle johnston are the president and,respectively,of whiting farms,collectively defendants.defendants raise chickens for feathers.defendants breed,raise,euthanize,and processes chickens for their pelts or hackle.hackle consists of feathers still attached to the skin pelts of the chickens.hackle is eventually used to tie.
from conception to compost,the chickens raised and euthanized at whiting farms never leave defendants property.processing the chickens essentially involves euthanizing the chickens,removing the chickens pelts,drying the pelts to remove moisture and fat,and trimming the pelts into the desired shape the pelt is next graded to determine its value.after grading,the pelt is sent to the packaging department.packaging employees then separate the pelts according to their previously assigned grade and color,stamp the back of the pelt with its grade designation,and make a record of the pelt.depending on demand,the pelt is then either placed in bulk storage or packaged.
a pelt goes to storage if it is not needed to fill a current order.the pelt is stored in its natural state,not in a box.the pelt is perishable if exposed to water or insect infestation however,if the pelt is stored in a safe and reasonably cool environment it will last years.conversely,the pelt is packaged immediately if it is needed to fill an order.to package a pelt,an employee staples the pelt onto a board and places it into a bag.next,the packaging employee places a computer generated on the bag and scans the,which places the product into a computer operated inventory system.the packaged pelt is then taken to the shipping department.ups picks up the pelts from the shipping department and delivers them to retailers.
plaintiff began working in defendants packaging department in.plaintiff position did not require any specialized training or experience.in august,defendants promoted plaintiff to packaging foreperson.as foreperson,plaintiff directed activities of the packaging staff,scheduled days off,ensured packaging inventories were kept at proper levels,and continued to package pelts.defendants implemented a new packaging system shortly after plaintiff promotion,which operated pursuant to a packaging priority report.the report informs packaging employees what products need to be packaged to meet the current market demand.packaging employees then prioritize their duties according to the report.
plaintiff employment relationship with defendants deteriorated after implementation of the packaging priority report system.plaintiff disagreed with how the new system allocated packaging employees duties and often felt the packaging priority report was wrong.in february,defendants met with plaintiff twice because she was not packaging product correctly.after the second meeting,defendants informed plaintiff that further resistance to change would constitute misconduct and could result in disciplinary action.on august,defendants met with plaintiff a third time because she had missed a meeting with her immediate supervisor regarding the allocation of job duties within the packaging department and allegedly started a rumor her supervisors were out to get her.after the meeting,defendants suspended plaintiff for one and days without pay for insubordination and misconduct.defendants also put plaintiff on notice she would be subject to further disciplinary action,including termination,if her unacceptable behavior continued.
around august,plaintiff learned employees in the shipping department received overtime wages.plaintiff regularly worked over per week in the packaging department.defendants paid plaintiff her regular rate of pay for all hours worked,but did not pay her overtime wages for those hours worked in excess of forty.accordingly,plaintiff asked defendant johnston if the packaging department could get overtime like shipping.defendant johnston appeared nervous and shocked upon plaintiff inquiry but nevertheless informed plaintiff he would look into the matter.later that day,defendant johnston explained to plaintiff that packaging employees did not receive overtime wages because they were considered agricultural.defendant johnston further explained shipping employees were not considered agricultural,and thus entitled to overtime wages,because shipping employees worked with products not wholly produced on whiting farms.plaintiff responded okay and went back to work.plaintiff never mentioned overtime wages to defendants again.
in october,plaintiff disregarded her immediate supervisor orders regarding the allocation of job duties within the packaging department.defendant johnston was notified of the situation.upon arriving in the packaging department,defendant johnston observed a large amount of backlogged product and decided plaintiff needed to be disciplined for her insubordination.after reviewing the situation,defendants decided plaintiff termination was in the best interest of the company.defendant whiting made the ultimate decision to terminate plaintiff because her failure to follow reasonable instructions under the packaging priority report system hindered productivity.on october,defendants terminated plaintiff.

flsa prohibits any person from violating the maximum hour provisions of the act.a.flsa maximum hour provisions require,among other things,employers to pay their employees at a rate not less than one and times the employee regular rate of pay for each hour,or fraction thereof,the employee worked over in a workweek.id.a.section b,however,sets forth several exemptions from the act maximum hour provisions.id.b.flsa agricultural exemption provides the act maximum hour provisions shall not apply with respect to any employee employed in agriculture.id.b.the agricultural exemption was meant to apply broadly and to embrace the whole field of agriculture,but it was meant to apply only to agriculture thus the critical issue is what is and what is not included within that term.rodriguez whiting farms,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.flsa provides
