background 
one of the many products that monsanto sells is roundup brand herbicide.herbicides,such as roundup,kill vegetation by inhibiting the metabolic activity of a particular enzyme,common in plants,that is necessary for the conversion of sugars into amino acids.herbicides that have glyphosate as the active ingredient are that is,they kill all types of plants whether the plant is a weed or a crop.
in addition to developing and selling herbicides,monsanto sells other products made using biotechnology.monsanto has developed roundup ready technology,which involves inserting a chimeric gene into a seed that allows the plant to advantageously continue to break down sugars in the presence of glyphosate.crops grown from such seeds are resistant to roundup and other herbicides.when roundup ready seeds are planted and used in conjunction with a herbicide,roundup ready plants will survive,while weeds and other plants lacking the roundup ready gene will be killed.monsanto has claimed this technology in the patent.
roundup ready genes have been introduced into numerous agricultural products,including soybeans,the subject of the present case.monsanto licenses seed companies to incorporate the roundup ready genes into their plants and to sell soybean seeds containing the roundup ready gene.all purchasers of such seeds are required to enter into a technology agreement that grants them the right to use the seeds.the technology agreement stipulates that buyers may use the seeds for the planting of only a single commercial crop,but that no seeds from that crop may be saved for future harvests.the technology agreement assures monsanto that farmers must purchase new roundup ready seeds each harvesting season,rather than simply saving seeds from the prior year harvest,as they normally would with conventional soybean seeds.monsanto also charges a technology fee for each unit of roundup ready soybean seeds sold the technology agreement also contains a clause granting monsanto the full amount of its legal fees and other costs that may have to be expended in enforcing the agreement.
david is a commercial farmer who owns soybean fields in north and south dakota.on may,david executed a monsanto technology agreement.in,david planted the contested soybeans at issue in this case monsanto claims that the seeds that david planted were roundup ready soybeans improperly saved from the previous year harvest,but david claims he did not save any roundup ready seed.it is undisputed that,prior to planting his soybean fields in,david purchased units of roundup ready soybean seeds and it is also undisputed that that amount of seeds alone would have been insufficient to completely plant david soybean fields in.also undisputed is the fact that david purchased over gallons of herbicides in,herbicide that would destroy any plants that did not contain the roundup ready gene,and would therefore have destroyed any conventional soybean seeds david planted.
at some time in,monsanto began to suspect that david had saved soybean seed from his previous year harvest in violation of the technology agreement.in april,after david crop had already been harvested and sold,monsanto obtained samples of the soybean plant material remaining from some of david fields.on the basis of those tests,on april,monsanto filed suit for patent infringement,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and conversion,alleging that david had illicitly saved and planted roundup ready seeds.
a bench trial was held in february during which monsanto presented crop insurance records with planting dates provided by david.in those records,david claimed to have planted nearly all of his soybean fields as of may.monsanto also presented an invoice from red river grain for david purchase of units of roundup ready soybean seed on may,nearly a month after david claimed to have planted the vast majority of his soybean crop for the year.monsanto argued that that purchase was merely david attempt to convince monsanto that he had purchased enough roundup ready seed to plant his crops and that he had not saved any seed.
on april,the district court entered judgment against david.the court found david claim that he purchased and planted the seeds from red river grain more than a month before the date of the invoice to be unreliable.david,d at.furthermore,the court found david testimony regarding his claimed purchase of conventional herbicides not believable.id.the court found david to be unreliable as a witness,and also found that he had failed to overcome the scientific evidence showing that he had planted his soybean fields exclusively with roundup ready seeds,yet he had not purchased sufficient quantities of such seed in to do so.the court,therefore,held that david had willfully infringed the patent and breached the technology agreement by planting saved seed from a prior year crop.a damages award of was entered in favor of monsanto.
after the ruling,monsanto filed four motions for attorney fees,prejudgment interest,costs,and treble damages.on july,the court awarded monsanto an additional in enhanced damages in lieu of treble damages,and found that monsanto was entitled to recover attorney fees in the amount of.the court awarded monsanto costs in the amount of pursuant to the technology agreement,and,alternatively,costs in the amount of pursuant to.lastly,the court awarded monsanto prejudgment interest in the amount of.in sum,david was found liable to monsanto for.david filed two motions to amend the april,judgment,both of which were denied by the court on october.
david timely appealed the district court judgment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
infringement 
the patent claims a gene sequence,not a plant variety or a seed.patent filed.therefore,david argues that the patent can not be infringed merely by saving seeds from plants containing the patented gene sequence.david argues that the written description of the patent lacks the specificity that would be required of a patented plant variety under the utility patent statute thus,the patent is limited to the gene sequence and does not cover the plant containing such a gene.david argues that ag supply,pioneer international,d,stands for the proposition that plants can only receive patent protection under the plant patent act of,the,the plant variety protection act of,the,or under a utility patent on a plant variety.a utility patent on a gene sequence,david claims,does not entitle the holder of that patent to enforce its grant of exclusivity against growers of plant varieties that contain the gene sequence.
monsanto responds by arguing that the holding of is the opposite of what david claims it to be the broad language of relating to patentable subject matter remains unmodified by the existence of the and the moreover,monsanto points to various decisions of this court that have read the patent onto plants and seeds containing the patented gene and holding those who save such seeds liable for infringement.
david brief makes much of the supreme court decision in involved utility patents issued for corn seed products that were held by pioneer international.the petitioner in argued that pioneer patents were invalid because plant varieties were only patentable under the or the.the supreme court disagreed,holding that the existence of statutes specifically authorizing the patenting of plants the and the did not eliminate the availability of utility patent protection covering plants.we disagree also.contrary to david arguments on appeal,nothing in invalidates or limits the patent or any utility patent on a gene sequence in a seed or a plant.in fact,in,the supreme court explicitly refused to limit the extent of patentable subject matter we decline to narrow the reach of where congress has given us no indication that it intends this result,at.the patent covering the gene sequence is infringed by planting a seed containing the gene sequence because the seed contains the gene.the gene itself is being used in the planting,an infringing act.
david real complaint seems to be that he should be able to save seed from his harvest,regardless of monsanto patent.we have dealt with this complaint before.see monsanto mcfarling.in mcfarling,we held that a farmer who saved seed containing a patented gene was liable for patent infringement.id.at citing,at.mcfarling further established that the right to save seed of plants registered under the pvpa does not impart the right to save seed of plants patented under the patent act.id.we note that mcfarling dealt with the very patent at issue in this patent.we may not disregard a prior decision of this court regarding the same matter.
david next argues that the district court finding of infringement was clearly erroneous and that there was no evidence from which to infer that he saved roundup ready soybeans from his harvest for planting in.additionally,he argues that the district court admission of expert testimony and exhibits was an abuse of discretion.
monsanto urges this court to uphold the factual findings of the district court.monsanto also argues that david ignores federal rule of evidence,which allows an expert witness to base his opinion on evidence that itself may be inadmissible.
we review factual findings of the district court for clear error.interspiro usa,figgie int l.decisions concerning the admission of evidence,such as expert testimony,are reviewed for abuse of discretion.jiminez,cir peitzmeier hennessy.when reviewing the evidentiary findings of the district court,we apply the law of the circuit in which the district court sits,micro,lextron,which in this case is the eighth circuit.
we agree with monsanto that the factual findings of the district court were not clearly erroneous.david does not dispute that he planted roundup ready soybean seeds in rather,he claims that the roundup ready seeds that he planted were acquired from authorized dealers.to dispute this claim,monsanto presented scientific field tests demonstrating that david soybean fields had been planted exclusively with roundup ready soybeans,invoices proving that david had purchased large quantities of herbicides,government documents of david planting dates,and evidence that david had not purchased enough roundup ready seeds to fully plant his fields by those dates.in response,david offered inconsistent testimony regarding what he actually planted in.david,d at.david changed his version of events at least three times,including claiming that he planted only the perimeters of his fields with roundup ready seed,while planting the interior of his fields with conventional seed.id.david testimony,and that of his daughter,was the only evidence offered to refute monsanto case.due to his continually changing testimony,the court disregarded much of david testimony.see id.given david unreliability as a witness,and a complete lack of other evidence supporting his claims,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that david planted saved seed.
david also argues that the seed report tests conducted by monsanto and the testimony of monsanto expert koppatschek,which relied on those seed report tests,were improperly admitted at trial.david further argues that had those pieces of evidence been excluded,the court would not have had sufficient evidence from which to find that david saved seed.
david arguments to exclude koppatschek testimony are unpersuasive.rule of the federal rules of evidence allows expert testimony if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.david does not suggest that koppatschek testimony is unreliably applied or based on unreliable methods or insufficient data rather,he challenges koppatschek reliance on the seed report tests that were produced by monsanto scientific team,but not by koppatschek personally.
david challenge fails,however,because the federal rules of evidence establish that an expert need not have obtained the basis for his opinion from personal perception.see,sweet united states,cir data line micro.likewise,numerous courts have held that reliance on scientific test results prepared by others may constitute the type of evidence that is reasonably relied upon by experts for purposes of rule of evidence.see,ratliff schiber truck,cir holding that expert testimony regarding a report prepared by a third party was properly allowed see also gussack realty xerox,cir finding that testimony was properly admitted from an expert who did not conduct his own tests.unlike an ordinary witness,see rule,an expert is permitted wide latitude to offer opinions,including those that are not based on first hand knowledge.daubert merrell dow pharm,d.koppatschek reliance on the scientific reports prepared by his team is therefore the type of reliance that is reasonable for expert witnesses.furthermore,koppatschek testimony is admissible,regardless of the admissibility of the seed report rule expressly authorizes the admission of expert opinion that is based on facts or data that themselves are inadmissible,as long as the evidence relied upon is of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions.the tests conducted in this case are certainly of the type relied upon by experts,and koppatschek testimony was therefore admissible.
david also appeals the district court damages calculation.the district court awarded monsanto a reasonable royalty for david infringing use of the patent,enhanced damages,attorney fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.david challenges the attorney fees and cost awards,as well as the reasonable royalty,but does not challenge the enhanced damages or prejudgment interest.we review the district court damages decision for an erroneous conclusion of law,clearly erroneous factual findings,or a clear error of judgment amounting to an abuse of discretion.golight,stores,citing grain processing am.
attorney fees and costs 
on appeal,david makes four arguments for reducing or eliminating the district court award of attorney fees and costs.first,he argues that this is not an exceptional case as required for the award of attorney fees under.second,he argues that the attorney fee provision in the technology agreement is unenforceable because that provision appears on the reverse side of the agreement,while the signature page is on the front.third,david claims that the amount of the attorney fee award does not bear a reasonable relation to the result achieved as required under perricone medicis pharmaceutical.and fourth,david urges this court to limit the amount of attorney fees awarded under the technology agreement to an amount that would be recoverable under and,b.
in reply,monsanto maintains that the district court had ample reason to conclude that david case was exceptional.according to monsanto,david deceitful litigation tactics prolonged monsanto case and increased its fees and costs,and the district court was within its discretion to award additional fees to monsanto.furthermore,monsanto argues that david legal arguments limiting the attorney fees and costs are without merit.
we review a finding that a case is exceptional for clear error.perricone,at.we review an award of attorney fees in an exceptional case for abuse of discretion.id.
