in this appeal,we consider whether under the agricultural marketing agreement act of amaa or the act,as amended,appellants united dairymen of arizona uda and shamrock farms,two arizona milk producers,have standing to bring a direct suit challenging the exemption.we conclude that appellants can not bring a direct suit challenging the exemption and affirm the district court decision.
background 
demand for milk fluctuates from day to day and from season to season.due to the fluctuating demand and to prevent shortages in the milk supply,the industry must carry a constant surplus.in the,the inherent instability in milk prices together with competition for the fluid milk market prompted congress to include milk price regulation in the amaa.see block community nutrition,d.the federal government has regulated the milk market continuously since.under the amaa,regional raw milk prices are regulated under the federal milk marketing order system.see id.t he essential purpose of this milk market order scheme is to raise producer prices.quoting.the system regulates the milk market primarily through minimum prices and a pooling mechanism known as the fund.to implement this system,the secretary has divided the country into milk marketing areas,each governed by a separate milk order.the particular order at issue in this action is federal order,which governs the vegas marketing area.
under order,milk products are divided into three categories for purposes of price regulations and producers are paid through the mechanism of the fund.each month the secretary sets a minimum price for milk used to produce each class of milk product.class i is fluid milk,and commands the highest price.surplus milk is processed into class ii and iii milk products.class ii includes soft dairy products such as yogurt,cottage cheese,and ice cream.class iii contains the least perishable milk products,such as butter,powdered milk,and some hard cheeses.milk for class iii use receives the lowest price.all businesses that process raw milk into products for the marketplace,or milk handlers,are bound by the class prices.
despite the varying class prices,the pricing regulations guarantee a uniform price to milk producers.this uniformity is accomplished through the computation of blend prices and the pooling mechanisms of funds.each month,each market administrator computes the total value of all milk purchased by all handlers in the marketing area based on the minimum class prices.the administrator then divides this value by the total quantity of raw milk purchased by the handlers to determine a blend price.all milk producers in the marketing area receive this blend price for their raw milk.the uniform pricing for producers must be combined with a pooling system for handlers in order to avoid inequities.
are exempt from the pricing and pooling requirements of the amaa.are vertically integrated dairy businesses that process and market milk products from the raw milk produced by their own dairy herds.may not contribute to or withdraw from a marketing area fund,and they are not subject to the minimum price requirements.therefore,that can process and market most of their milk as class i products have an advantage over producers and handlers.on the production side,they are not limited by the blend price and on the handler side,they do not have to contribute to the settlement fund.on the other hand,bear the burden of managing their surplus and the risks of excess supply.
the exemptions vary from area to area and are set out in each milk marketing order.the orders impose a series of requirements on businesses that seek to qualify for the exemption.since,the secretary has permitted sara farms dairy sara farms to claim exempt status as a.sara farms owns and operates a milk bottling plant located in yuma,arizona at which it receives raw milk for processing and distribution within order.in march of,the appellants filed this action.appellants argue that the exemption is invalid under the amaa and that the exemption violates the equal protection guarantees of the fifth amendment.alternatively,if the exemption is valid,appellants seek declaratory and injunctive relief.
appellants moved for partial summary judgment.the secretary moved to dismiss on the grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction the initiation of an enforcement proceeding under is committed to agency discretion and is not subject to judicial review and the requirements of a were not met.the district court issued an order on may,holding that uda and shamrock farms lacked standing to challenge the promulgation or implementation of the exemption.the court,therefore,lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed their claims.judgment was entered on june.
the district court relied on this court holding in pescosolido block,cir,in reaching its conclusion.the district court read pescosolido as limiting stark wickard,to situations in which producers claim that some definite personal right granted by the statute is being infringed by the secretary acting outside the scope of his delegated authority,with no handler having standing to protest.pescosolido,at.the district court held that the plaintiffs could only invoke the stark exception if they could show the exemption threatens their definite,personal rights in allowing the exemption,the secretary is acting outside the scope of his delegated authority and no handler would have standing to protest the exemption.
the district court did not address the first two prongs because it held that appellants could not meet the third.the district court reasoned that the exemption affects both producers and handlers.it injures producers by reducing the blend price and it injures handlers by providing a competitive advantage to who do not have to contribute to the settlement fund or pay the mandatory minimum prices.consequently,the district court concluded that handlers would have standing to challenge the exemption in an administrative proceeding.therefore,appellants could not show that no handler would have standing as required by pescosolido.

appellants capacity 
we first address appellants argument that under dairylea coop.butz,cir,a cooperative that is both a producer and a handler will be treated as either a producer or a handler depending on the interests the cooperative represent s in the action then pending.id.at.in dairylea the second circuit held that dairylea was acting as a producer because the aspect of the milk order the cooperative was challenging affected the interests of its producers.id.the concern of dairylea in this action is not the money which it paid as a handler into the fund but with the money collected on behalf of its as authorized by b which will increase if the action succeeds.
uda is a cooperative that acts as a handler as well as a producer.uda owns and operates a milk processing plant in tempe,arizona.in this action uda is challenging the exemption because it reduces the uniform blend price paid to producers and gives a competitive advantage over other handlers.unlike in dairylea,uda is not only representing its producers interests but also its handlers interests.therefore,uda may be deemed a handler in suing in its representative capacity.
shamrock farms sells its raw milk to shamrock foods.while the two companies are related,the record shows that the two companies are separate businesses.although the companies appear to be separate,we note that in his declaration norman mcclelland,the president of shamrock farms as well as the chairman of shamrock food,states in paragraph three of his declaration 
the exemption of fluid milk sales of a from the pooling requirements of the order reduces the monthly value of the fund,and,therefore,reduces the monthly uniform blend price paid to the order producers,including shamrock.it also gives,such as sara farms,a com
