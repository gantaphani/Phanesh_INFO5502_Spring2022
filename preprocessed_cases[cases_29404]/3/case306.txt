is a restaurant that buys wholesale quantities of perishable agricultural commodities and uses them in the preparation of meals in the business of buying or selling such commodities,and therefore,a dealer as defined by the perishable agricultural commodities act of we join the two other circuits that have considered this question in holding that it restaurant that buys in the requisite quantities falls within the definition of a dealer even though it does not also sell the commodities in unchanged form.
background 
rjr,a delaware corporation,owned and operated seven tgi friday restaurants in california.from the fall of through,rjr purchased large quantities of perishable produce for these restaurants from royal foods.in,for example,rjr purchased worth of produce from royal in,rjr increased its purchases to approximately.
rjr corporate office controlled the purchases from royal however,the manager of each tgi friday restaurant ordered the kind and quantity of produce needed for his or her particular restaurant.royal delivered the produce to each restaurant and sent invoices to each restaurant.the restaurant then forwarded the invoice to rjr headquarters and rjr issued a check to royal.rjr had one account into which the proceeds from all restaurant sales were deposited,and from which all checks to pay royal were drawn.
rjr failed to pay royal for over of perishable produce that royal had delivered.royal filed a complaint in district court to recover the unpaid balance under the statutory trust provisions of the perishable agriculture commodities act paca,c.paca protects sellers of perishable agricultural commodities by subjecting a merchant,dealer,or retailer of perishable produce to a trust on the proceeds of the sale of perishable produce,and food derived from that produce,for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers therefore,when a seller of perishable agricultural commodities is not paid by a merchant,dealer,or broker as defined by paca,that seller may complain to the secretary of agriculture or bring a civil action.b.here,royal brought a civil action,and the present dispute is whether a restaurant can be a dealer as defined by paca.the statute says 
the term dealer means any engaged in the business of buying or selling in wholesale or jobbing quantities,as defined by the secretary any perishable agricultural commodity in interstate or foreign commerce,except that a no producer shall be considered as a dealer in respect to sales of any such commodity of his own raising b no person buying any such commodity solely for sale at retail shall be considered as a dealer until the invoice cost of his purchases of perishable agricultural commodities in any calendar year are in excess of and c no person buying any commodity other than potatoes for canning processing within the state where grown shall be considered a dealer whether or not the canned or processed product is to be shipped in interstate or foreign commerce,unless such product is frozen or packed in ice,or consists of cherries in brine,within the meaning of paragraph of this section.any person not considered as a dealer under clauses a,b,and c may elect to secure a license under the provisions of section of this title,and in such case and while the license is in effect such person shall be considered as a dealer 
after the lawsuit was filed,rjr initiated insolvency proceedings and thereby assigned its assets to credit managers association of california.royal amended its complaint to include cmac as a defendant.for summary judgment were filed.royal argued that rjr was holding paca trust assets for the benefit of royal in the amount of royal unpaid account.rjr contended that it was not subject to paca trust provisions because it is not a dealer as defined by is not in the business of buying or selling wholesale quantities of perishable commodities,but rather in the business of selling meals to consumers.the district court granted rjr motion,holding as a matter of law that a restaurant can not be a dealer under paca.

iii.discussion 
paca section b definition of dealer is unambiguous and is broad enough to include a restaurant 
the first and most important step in construing a statute is the statutory language itself.chevron usa natural res.def.council,d.we look to the text of the statute to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.if from the plain meaning of the statute congressional intent is clear,that is the end of the matter.chevron,at.however,if the statute is ambiguous as to the question at issue,then we go to the second step and determine the meaning of the statute language by giving deference to the governing agency interpretation of the statute language.id.at.no deference is due to the agency interpretation unless we find that the plain meaning of the statute language is ambiguous with regard to the precise matter at issue.see in re magic,cir,cert.denied,d,quoting estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d.this case turns on whether section b,defining a dealer as a person engaged in the business of buying or selling perishable agricultural commodities,is ambiguous as to its applicability to restaurants.
first,rjr argues that a restaurant does not fit the definition of dealer because a restaurant does not buy and sell such commodities,it only buys such commodities and then turns them into meals.this argument flies in the face of the plain language of the statute.buying or selling means that one only needs to buy or sell,not buy and sell.b.we must give the statutory language its ordinary meaning,malat riddell,d,and w here congress has,as here,intentionally and unambiguously drafted a particularly broad definition,it is not our function to undermine that effort.commodities futures trading comm frankwell bullion,cir applying the broad statutory definition of board of trade encompassed in.
indeed,paca recognizes that a dealer could include a person who buys perishable agricultural items,but does not sell them.see b c.congress explicitly excluded from the definition of dealer a certain type of that purchase perishable agricultural commodities,process them in the same state,and sell items that are not perishable agricultural commodities.id.it did not exclude restaurants.like processors,restaurants buy perishable agricultural commodities,alter them,and sell items,meals,that are no longer perishable agricultural commodities.congress could have excluded restaurants but did not.
rjr also argues that the statute language,engaged in the business of,is ambiguous and does not plainly encompass restaurants because restaurants are not primarily engaged in the business of buying perishable commodities.rjr argues that restaurants are in the business of making meals.this argument also fails to be faithful to the text of the statute.the language of the statute does not require that an entity be engaged primarily in the business of buying or selling.it is undisputed that part of a restaurant business includes the purchase of commodities for use in the preparation of meals.a restaurant does not buy such commodities for personal or other purposes.it buys them solely in the ordinary course of its business.
our court has held that an entity is engaged in the business of where that entity buys or sells to further its commercial enterprise.see united states van buren,cir the ordinary meaning of engaged in the business of means the purchase or exchange that is regularly entered into in expectation of profit.see also donovan s l dev,cir engaged in the business of construction includes a leasing company which merely remodels a single building kaneshiro united states,cir engaged in the business of selling firearms or ammunition,includes a person who sells guns to two people fox citicorp credit servs,cir engaged in the business of debt collection,includes an attorney whose purely legal practice contained collection activities.we agree with our colleagues
