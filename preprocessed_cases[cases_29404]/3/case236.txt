in,the monterey bay unified air pollution control district district adopted and began enforcing rules that regulate engines.in particular,the district regulatory regime requires owners and operators to register and pay fees for certain diesel engines used in agricultural operations,and sets emissions standards for stationary diesel engines within the district.the principal question in this case among other questions is whether the district rules are preempted by the federal clean air act caa,et.we hold that the district rules are not preempted,and affirm the district court judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendants.
jensen family farms,jensen is a agricultural corporation that is incorporated under the laws of california and has its principle place of business in monterey,california.as part of its operations,jensen owns and operates diesel engines,including both stationary and portable diesel engines.jensen uses diesel engines to provide power to irrigation pumps on its farms.
the california air resources board carb is california air pollution control agency.cal.health safety code.under california law,carb is required to adopt airborne toxic control measures atcms for toxic air contaminants emitted from nonvehicular sources.id.a.in,carb determined that particulate matter emissions from engines were a toxic air contaminant.accordingly,in,carb adopted an atcm to address diesel particulate matter emissions.see regs.tit,et.
the district is a political subdivision of the state of california,and comprises monterey,santa cruz,and san benito counties.under state law,the district has primary responsibility for controlling air pollution from all sources other than motor vehicle emissions for its three constituent counties.cal.health safety code.shortly after carb adopts an atcm,the district is required to either implement and enforce the atcm,or adopt and enforce an equally effective or more stringent regulation sometimes referred to as a replacement rule.cal.health safety code d.
in may,the district adopted rules,and collectively,the rules.rule requires owners or operators of diesel engines to register with the district any diesel engine of brake horsepower bhp or larger that is used for agricultural operations.rule imposes application fees and annual registration fees on the owners and operators of engines that are subject to rule registration scheme.in february,jensen registered several engines with the district and paid the required fees.rule the third district rule that jensen challenges sets emissions standards for stationary diesel engines.rule is a replacement rule for carb atcm for diesel particulate matter.see regs.tit,et.
in november,jensen sued the district,alleging that all of the district rules are preempted by the caa rules and violate certain provisions of california law and the rules violate jensen due process rights.after the district filed its answer,jensen moved for summary judgment and a permanent injunction.while jensen motion was pending,the district court granted carb motion to intervene.the district and carb collectively,defendants then filed a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.after hearing argument on both jensen and defendants motions,the court entered a final judgment granting defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings and denying jensen motion for summary judgment and permanent injunctive relief.
the district court first concluded that rules and are not preempted by the caa because rules and are not standards or other requirements relating to the control of emissions.the district court also rejected jensen claim that rules and violate california law.the district court next held that because rule applies only to stationary sources,it is not preempted by the caa.finally,the district court rejected jensen due process challenge after concluding that there was a rational basis for the rules.jensen timely appealed the district court judgment 
ii.analysis 
federal preemption 
we start with an overview of the federal clean air act caa.the caa makes the states and the federal government partners in the struggle against air pollution.general motors united states.the basic structure of this partnership has not changed since the caa inception.engine mfrs.ass epa ema.
the caa governs emissions from both stationary and mobile sources the direct regulation of emissions from stationary sources is primarily left to the states.caa,see also ema,at describing a history of detailed state regulation of stationary sources.on the other hand,the federal government sets nationwide emissions standards for mobile sources the category of mobile sources includes both motor vehicles and nonroad sources.see caa,giving the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa the authority to set emissions standards for new motor vehicles caa,same for nonroad sources.because the regulation of mobile source emissions is a federal responsibility,congress has expressly preempted states from setting emissions standards for mobile sources.caa a,a preempting state regulation of new motor vehicle emissions caa e,e preempting state regulation of emissions from nonroad mobile sources.we consider jensen federal preemption claims against this backdrop.
district rules and 
district rule provides that b efore any bhp or larger diesel engine or engines may be operated,the owner or operator shall register such engine s by submitting registration information to the district rule registration requirements apply only to diesel engine s of brake horsepower or larger utilized at an agricultural operation.district rule provides that e very applicant for a diesel engine registration shall pay a registration fee.
the registration and fee requirements of rules and apply to diesel engines used at agricultural operations,which are nonroad sources.see caa e,e describing as nonroad engines or vehicles used in farm equipment.section e of the caa expressly prohibits states from setting emissions standards for nonroad sources.in particular,section e provides 
prohibition on certain state standards 
no state or any political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard or other requirement relating to the control of emissions from either of the following new nonroad engines or vehicles subject to regulation under this chapter 
a new engines which are used in farm equipment or vehicles and which are smaller than horsepower.
other nonroad engines or vehicles 
a in the case of any nonroad vehicles or engines other than those referred to in paragraph,the administrator shall authorize california to adopt and enforce standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions from such vehicles or engines 
e emphasis added.
critically,the express preemption provision of e applies only to standard s or other requirement s relating to the control of emissions from certain new nonroad engines and vehicles.section e addresses other types of nonroad sources.see ema,at rejecting epa interpretation that e applies only to new nonroad sources cited approvingly in pacific merchant shipping ass goldstene pacific merchant,cir.section e requires california to obtain epa authorization before adopting standards or other requirements relating to the control of emissions from nonroad engines not covered by section e.we have held that section e creates a sphere of implied preemption surrounding those regulations for which california must obtain authorization.pacific merchant,f d at.any such standard or requirement that the epa has not duly authorized,therefore,is impliedly preempted by section e.ass of home builders san joaquin valley unified air pollution control,cir emphasis in original.because the epa has not authorized rules and,our threshold task is to decide whether these rules constitute standards or other requirements relating to the control of emissions from nonroad engines.we conclude that they do not,and therefore are not preempted by e.
t he task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the clause,which necessarily contains the best evidence of con
