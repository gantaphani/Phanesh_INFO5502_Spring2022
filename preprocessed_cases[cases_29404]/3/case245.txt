davisco foods international,davisco here appeals from the district court judgment that it breached express and implied warranties to bill and susie millenkamp the millenkamps and the district court denial of motions that would relieve davisco of the judgment.we conclude that the district court erred in admitting evidence and giving jury instructions concerning idaho milk permeate labeling laws and also abused its discretion in admitting exhibits and.these acts prejudiced davisco.the district judge should have granted davisco motion for a new trial.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of davisco motion for a new trial and remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.because the district court must conduct a new trial,the parties arguments concerning offsets for damages,attorneys fees,and prejudgment interest are moot.
facts and procedural history 
the millenkamps raise bovine calves in idaho.davisco operates the jerome cheese company,which produces milk permeate as a byproduct of its operation.because milk permeate is sometimes used as a source of dietary energy,protein,and minerals in livestock feeding programs,davisco sells milk permeate to several dairies near jerome,idaho.
given the use of milk permeate in other feeding programs,the millenkamps decided to investigate using it as part of their calf feeding operation.they discussed its use in their operation with davisco employee,steven ewing.ewing admits that he provided the millenkamps an analysis sheet that set forth the contents of davisco milk permeate and represented that it had a ph level of at least.the millenkamps also assert that ewing told them that he thought the milk permeate would be good to feed the calves and it should be stored in plastic tanks similar to tanks ewing observed while touring the millenkamps facilities.the millenkamps then consulted nutritionist matt schmitt of cargill.after such investigation,the millenkamps purchased milk permeate from davisco,stored it in plastic tanks,and,beginning on may,incorporated it into the feed for their calves.
within days,bill millenkamp noticed that several calves became sick,so he stopped feeding them milk permeate.soon thereafter,many of the millenkamps calves died or failed to gain weight at a desirable rate.on june and,the millenkamps veterinarian,michael mihlfried,conducted necropsies on three dead calves.he concluded that two of them died from rumen acidosis and the third died from a disease to which acidosis can predispose calves.mihlfried posited that the millenkamps stored the milk permeate at an improper temperature,which allowed lactose to ferment into a harmful lactic acid that caused the calves to fall prey to rumen acidosis.
in october,the millenkamps filed a complaint against davisco alleging breach of express warranties,breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,general negligence,and negligence per se the millenkamps moved for summary judgment on the negligence per se claim davisco moved for summary judgment on all negligence claims.the district court granted summary judgment to davisco,concluding that the idaho economic loss rule barred recovery in negligence,even though davisco may have been negligent per se.
the millenkamps and davisco proceeded to trial on the millenkamps claims for breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.the jury awarded damages to the millenkamps,finding that davisco breached those warranties.davisco subsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial,renewing its objections to several evidentiary rulings,the jury instructions,and the sufficiency of the evidence.davisco also asserted that idaho law required the district court to offset the jury damages award by the amount of the cargill settlement.the district court denied davisco motions and the offset.
the millenkamps subsequently filed a motion requesting prejudgment interest,costs and attorneys fees.the district court denied the millenkamps request for prejudgment interest,but awarded attorneys fees.both parties timely appealed.
davisco argues that the district court a mishandled the issue of cargill involvement by failing to give the jury instructions regarding cargill comparative negligence and the millenkamps potential responsibility for cargill acts under an agency theory.davisco argues that the district court b should not have allowed evidence or instructed the jury concerning idaho statutory requirement to label milk permeate for safe use.davisco argues that c the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings by improperly admitting a alois kertz expert testimony,b exhibit,a letter from davisco responding to the millenkamps settlement request,and c exhibit,a letter from cargill nutritionist to the millenkamps,and erred by a rejecting davisco proposed spoliation of evidence jury instruction and b failing to give the jury a time of delivery jury instruction regarding the millenkamps breach of warranty theories.davisco argues that d the district court erred by failing to offset the jury damages award by the amount of the cargill settlement.finally,davisco challenges the district court award of attorneys fees to the millenkamps.the millenkamps cross appeal the district court decision not to award them prejudgment interest.
davisco argues that the district court erred by ruling that idaho law did not require instructions regarding cargill comparative negligence and failing to instruct the jury that the millenkamps were responsible for cargill acts under idaho agency theory,therefore allowing the jury to compare the millenkamps actions to davisco in determining whether davisco breached the contract.we review these arguments de novo,because davisco challenges the district court interpretation of idaho law while instructing the jury.see fireman fund ins.alaskan pride,cir.we affirm the district court for the reasons set forth below.
based on the evidence that a cargill nutritionist designed the feed mixture that was fed to the calves,and b bill millenkamp blamed cargill for at least some of the calves problems,davisco argues that the district court a should have instructed the jury regarding cargill comparative negligence,because cargill was somewhat responsible for the millenkamps losses and b should have allowed the jury to compare the fault of cargill and davisco.the district court declined a comparative negligence instruction.we affirm the district court decision.
davisco was not entitled to a jury instruction regarding cargill comparative negligence,because negligence is not a defense to liability for breach of warranty claims in idaho.idaho courts allow the defenses of misuse of a product or assumption of the risk to reduce or deny a plaintiff recovery for breach of warranty,but they otherwise deny negligence as a defense.duff bonner.supply,idaho,emphasis added.davisco relies on vannoy uniroyal tire,idaho,to argue that the jury should compare the fault of all parties whose conduct may have contributed to the millenkamps damages.davisco reliance on vannoy is misplaced,because that case involved negligence and strict liability defective design and inadequate warnings,therefore tort claims.see empire lumber towers,idaho,distinguishing vannoy and holding that an affirmative defense is not a defense to contractual liability.
davisco argument that idaho law will develop to require the comparison of fault where a party seeks consequential damages is also unpersuasive.davisco supports its argument by citing cases from other jurisdictions and suggesting that idaho law will develop similar law.we disagree.idaho law does not provide for affirmative defenses in cases involving contractual liability.see empire lumber,at.how idaho law will develop to the contrary in the future is both impossible to determine and irrelevant to our decision.accordingly,we affirm the district court refusal to instruct the jury regarding cargill comparative negligence.
davisco argues,in the alternative,that a the jury should have been instructed that cargill was the millenkamps agent,b the millenkamps were responsible for cargill acts under agency theory,and c the millenkamps actions therefore should have been compared to davisco actions in determining whether davisco breached the agreement.we disagree with davisco argument for giving the instruction.to the extent the instruction would assist the jury in determining davisco liability for breach of contract,it would have been error to give it.
a principal is responsible for its agent tortious acts,so long as the agent has acted within the course and scope of authority delegated by the principal.bailey ness,idaho.this cause of action,however,is grounded in breach of contract,not tort.accordingly,whether the millenkamps by extension,the millenkamps at fault has no bearing on whether davisco is liable for breach of contract.see duff,at empire lumber,at.given idaho law,the extent to which cargill the millenkamps the milk permeate is only relevant to determine whether the millenkamps recovery for the breach should be reduced,potentially down to zero.the district court verdict form and instructions and properly provided davisco with this defense.the district court therefore did not err in rejecting davisco jury instructions regarding the alleged agency relationship.
davisco challenges the district court instruction to the jury that it must consider idaho legal requirement that the milk permeate contain a label that includes directions for use and precautionary statements in determining whether davisco breached its warranty to the millenkamps,and admission of kertz testimony regarding the development of milk permeate labeling requirements.because davisco asserts that the district court misapplied the law of express and implied warranties in instructing the jury,we review that instruction de novo.see fireman fund ins,at.an erroneous ruling that affects the substantial rights of a party is grounds for reversal,unless it affirmatively appears from the whole record that it was not prejudicial.mccandless united states.this is particularly true of an error in jury instructions.cancellier federated stores,cir citing fillippon albion vein slate.accordingly,if the record indicates that davisco was unfairly prejudiced by the district court instructions,we must reverse and remand the case for a new trial.we review the evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion.see tritchler county of lake,cir.
title of the idaho administrative procedures act idapa provides for rules pertaining to the idaho commercial feed law.section of the idapa,titled directions for use and precautionary statements,requires,inter alia,that all commercial feeds must be labeled with a dequate directions for use and precautionary statements for safe and effective use.idapa idaho milk permeate labeling requirement.violations of idaho regulatory scheme may result in a withdrawal from sale order,idapa detained commercial feeds,and civil penalties not to exceed per violation,idapa civil penalties.
the district court instructed the jury regarding idaho milk permeate labeling requirement and its relationship to the millenkamps breach of warranty claims.in effect,the district court told the jury that a violation of idaho milk permeate labeling requirement is a basis to find breach of an express warranty the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.davisco argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that a violation of idaho milk permeate labeling requirement is a breach of these warranties.davisco is correct.
idaho law recognizes that a state statute may,under certain circumstances,create the basis for tort liability and a private cause of action.see obendorf terra hug spray,idaho,it is well established that statutes and administrative regulations may define the applicable standard of care in a negligence action and that violations of such statutes and regulations may constitute negligence per se.there is no statute or case law,however,making the violation of a regulatory or safety statute a breach of the express or implied warranty alleged here 
in duffin idaho crop imp.ass n,idaho,the idaho supreme court determined that compliance with regulatory provisions governing potato seed certification could not be read into a contract without evidence that compliance was a part of the bargain between the parties.id.at.using the same reasoning,we conclude that the legal requirement to label milk permeate had no bearing on the millenkamps breach of express warranty claim,because there was no evidence of an express warranty by davisco that the milk permeate would comply with labeling laws.
as to the implied warranty of fitness claim,the millenkamps argued that davisco was aware of their intended purpose to feed permeate to calves after storing it in unrefrigerated tanks.they also argue it was unfit for that purpose as furnished to them.idaho code section creates an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose and a cause of action against a seller who fails to furnish goods suitable for the intended purpose.however,it does not create a cause of action against a seller who fails to comply with all applicable statutory labeling requirements.evidence of labeling practices may be relevant to the extent that a label could render a product suitable for a particular purpose by instructing an otherwise uninformed buyer as to the product proper use.the legal requirement to label,however,was irrelevant in these circumstances,because it did not affect davisco knowledge of the intended use or the fitness of the milk permeate as delivered.accordingly,compliance with idaho milk permeate labeling requirement does not address whether davisco breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
by instructing the jury that davisco failure to label the milk permeate would cause the breach of an express warranty or the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,the district court erroneously applied idaho law.because this instruction allowed the jury to improperly find davisco liable for breach of warranties here,davisco was unfairly prejudiced by such instructions.see cancellier,at.accordingly,we reverse the district court with respect to its jury instruction regarding idaho milk permeate labeling requirement.we also remand the case to the district court for a new trial that should not include any instruction regarding idaho milk permeate labeling requirement and is otherwise consistent with the remainder of this opinion.
in addition to instructing the jury regarding idaho milk permeate labeling requirement,the district court admitted testimony concerning this same issue from the millenkamps expert,kertz.he testified that the american feed control officials model feed law required sellers to label milk permeate.davisco argues that this was an error.because this testimony,like the jury instruction regarding idaho milk permeate labeling requirement,is not relevant to determine whether davisco breached the warranties alleged here and prejudicial to davisco,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in admitting it.see tritchler,at geurin winston,cir.
davisco also argues that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings by improperly admitting a kertz expert opinion that the milk permeate likely caused the calves illness b exhibit,a letter from davisco responding to the millenkamps settlement request and c exhibit,a letter from cargill nutritionist to millenkamp and erred by a rejecting davisco proposed spoliation of evidence jury instruction and b failing to give the jury a time of delivery jury instruction regarding the millenkamps breach of warranty theories.we affirm the district court with respect to its decisions to allow kertz testimony and reject davisco spoliation of evidence and time of delivery jury instructions.we reverse the district court with respect to its admissions of exhibits and.
pursuant to the standards set forth by daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,and federal rule of evidence,the district court allowed kertz expert opinion that the milk permeate likely caused the calves illness.the district court has discretion whether to hold a daubert hearing in d
