this appeal represents another chapter in the united states department of agriculture usda regulation of roundup ready alfalfa rra.rra is a plant genetically engineered or modified by the monsanto company and forage genetics international to be resistant to the herbicide glyphosate,which monsanto sells under the trade name roundup.farmers do not normally apply an herbicide like roundup to alfalfa fields because the herbicide kills not only the weeds,but also the alfalfa crop.rra tolerance to roundup thus allows farmers to control weeds through herbicide application without harming the alfalfa plant.monsanto markets rra and roundup together as a single crop system.from the outset,monsanto and forage genetics attempts to introduce rra have been met with criticism and lawsuits from environmental groups concerned about the adverse effects that the plant may have on the environment and the organic food industry.an earlier phase of the litigation concerned the scope of an injunction prohibiting the planting of rra pending completion of an environmental impact statement eis by the usda animal plant and health inspection service aphis.monsanto geertson seed farms,d.
here,we consider the record of decision rod issued by aphis,which unconditionally deregulated rra on the ground that rra was not a plant pest within the meaning of the term in the plant protection act ppa.the plaintiffs in this action seek review of aphis deregulation of rra.the plaintiffs are comprised of environmental interest groups and farmer organizations concerned about rra potential harms.their concerns include the possibility that rra will with and alter the genetic structure of conventional alfalfa plants.this phenomenon,referred to as transgenic contamination,contaminates conventional alfalfa plants with the glyphosateresistant gene.the plaintiffs and amici supporting them contend that transgenic contamination will harm the dollar organic food industry.for example,they argue that the threat of transgenic contamination will force ranchers who raise organic meat to spend money testing the alfalfa they feed their animals to ensure that none of the alfalfa is genetically modified.if the ranchers can not show that their animals are fed nonmodified alfalfa,they can not market their meat as organic,which erodes the price premium they are able to charge.the plaintiffs also fear that the contamination of conventional alfalfa plants with the gene could cause other countries to reduce or stop their importation of u.alfalfa.
in addition to transgenic contamination,the plaintiffs in this action also fear that rra deregulation will lead to weeds.the plaintiffs allege that farmers will respond to the weeds increased glyphosate tolerance by applying even greater amounts of glyphosate as well as using mixtures of different herbicides.this increased herbicide use could harm plants and animals living near alfalfa fields,including species listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act esa.
concerned about these environmental harms,the plaintiffs in this appeal argue that aphis unconditional deregulation of rra was improper for three reasons first,aphis violated the ppa and the administrative procedure act apa in concluding that rra was not a plant pest and failing to consider if rra was a noxious weed second,because of these errors in statutory interpretation,aphis violated the esa when it failed to consult with the fish and wildlife service fws about rra effects on endangered and threatened species,see a a and third,aphis also violated the national environmental policy act nepa by unconditionally deregulating rra without considering the option of partially deregulating the crop,an action that the agency had included in the eis.
after the plaintiffs filed this action against the government in the district court,monsanto,forage genetics,the corporate seed manufacturers and industry trade groups intervened as defendants.the district court upheld the agency deregulation decision in a published opinion.ctr.for food safety vilsack,d.it held that rra is not a plant pest within the meaning of the statute,and that the agency deregulation of the plant therefore did not violate the esa or nepa,because the agency jurisdiction did not extend to organisms that are not plant pests.id.at.
we affirm,because the statute does not regulate the types of harms that the plaintiffs complain of,and therefore aphis correctly concluded that rra was not a plant pest under the ppa.once the agency concluded that rra was not a plant pest,it no longer had jurisdiction to continue regulating the plant.aphis lack of jurisdiction over rra obviated the need for the agency to consult with the fws under the esa and to consider alternatives to unconditional deregulation under nepa.see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d.the district court thus properly entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
regulatory structure the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology 
genetically modified plants like rra are regulated by various agencies pursuant to the coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology coordinated framework.the coordinated framework is a policy statement from the office of science and technology policy that describes the comprehensive regulatory policy for ensuring the safety of biotechnology research and products.coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology,june.the goal of this policy statement was to construct a framework that would not impair the competiveness or innovativeness of the united states biotechnology industry.proposal for a coordinated framework for regulation of biotechnology,proposed.pursuant to the coordinated framework,regulation of genetically modified plants is divided among three agencies the food and drug administration fda,the environmental protection agency epa,and the usda,through aphis.none are required to address the environmental or economic harms with which the plaintiffs are concerned.we deal briefly with the fda and epa regulation of genetically modified plants before turning to the scope of aphis regulation under the ppa.
fda regulation of genetically modified plants 
the fda regulation of genetically modified plants is derived from its authority to regulate food safety under the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act ffdca.the fda authority is limited to removing adulterated food from the national food supply,which could include food from genetically modified plants.the ffdca,however,does not contain any provisions that specifically address genetically modified plants.in october,monsanto and forage genetics provided the fda with a summary of information that assessed the safety and nutritional qualities of rra.after assessing this information,the fda concluded in early that rra and foods derived from it were safe for consumption.
epa regulation of genetically modified plants 
the epa indirectly regulates genetically modified plants through the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra.fifra governs the use,sale,and labeling of herbicides like glyphosate.see bates dow agrosciences llc,d.an herbicide must first be registered by the epa before it can be distributed or sold in the united states.a j a f.the epa registration process starts with the herbicide manufacturer providing the epa with information about the herbicide.id.c c,f.the agency then evaluates the effectiveness of the herbicide and the adverse effects it will have on humans and the environment.see id.c headwaters,talent irrigation,cir.on the basis of this evaluation,the epa then determines if it will permit the herbicide use on a given plant,and,if so,how much.
the epa sets the conditions for the herbicide use and places them in labeling instructions that a user must comply with.see a g.the epa reevaluates the herbicide every fifteen years,as part of a process in which the agency determines if it should continue permitting the herbicide use.id.g a iv.the epa originally registered glyphosate in.in and,the epa approved the application of glyphosate to rra after determining that the herbicide would not cause any unreasonable environmental risks so long as it was applied in accordance with its labeling instructions.these labeling instructions contain,among other things,prohibitions on glyphosate use near the habitats of threatened or endangered species.the epa is currently in the process of glyphosate.the agency is scheduled to complete the process in.
because the epa fifra regulation deals with chemicals,the epa exercises only limited jurisdiction over genetically modified crops.such regulation is limited to plants that are modified to produce pesticides.see.the epa therefore does not regulate rra,because the plant itself does not produce or secrete a pesticide.
aphis regulation of plant pests and noxious weeds under the plant protection act 
regulation of plant pests 
the ppa purpose is to prevent the spread of parasitic,diseased,and invasive plants and organisms,and it does so through the regulation of plant pests and noxious weeds.see.the ppa was enacted in and combined aphis prior regulation of plant pests and noxious weeds into a single statute.previously,plant pests and noxious weeds were regulated by different statutes the federal plant pest act of regulated plant pests while the federal noxious weed act of regulated noxious weeds.the ppa made few substantive changes to these statutes.the ppa definition of plant pest is materially the same as the federal plant pest act definition of plant pest.compare federal plant pest act,c,stat,with.
this case turns on the language of the ppa that defines plant pests.aphis has no jurisdiction to regulate a plant or animal unless the organism is a plant pest within the meaning of the statute.see an organism belonging to any taxa that lists as a plant pest is only considered to be a plant pest if the organism can injure,or cause disease,or damage in any plants or parts thereof.the plaintiffs principal contention is that rra is a plant pest under the ppa.they therefore contend that aphis conclusion that rra was not a plant pest was arbitrary and capricious and violative of the ppa and apa.
the ppa defines a plant pest to be 
a ny living stage of any of the following that can directly or indirectly injure,cause damage to,or cause disease in any plant or plant product 
a a protozoan 
b a nonhuman animal 
c a parasitic plant 
d a bacterium 
e a fungus 
f a virus or viroid 
g an infectious agent or other pathogen 
h any article similar to or allied with any of the articles specified in the preceding subparagraphs.
the ppa states that organisms regulated as plant pests must be organisms that cause physical harm to plants through injury,damage,or disease.neither the statute nor the regulations indicate that a genetically engineered plant like rra,which does not itself physically damage plants,can be a plant pest.the regulations echo the statute and define plant pest in as organisms which can directly or indirectly cause diseases or damage.
aphis regulations do not ignore the introduction of organisms or products altered or produced through genetic engineering,however.see.this is because genetically engineered plants are often created using an organism that can itself be a plant pest under aphis regulations.indeed,rra was created by inserting a gene into the genetic structure of the conventional alfalfa plant using a plant pest.the glyphosateresistant gene was transferred to the conventional alfalfa plant using a bacterium agrobacterium that aphis regulations classify as a plant pest.see.the regulations therefore provide that a genetically modified organism is regulated as a plant pest if it is created using an organism that is itself a plant pest.id.defining a regulated article under aphis plant pest regulations as a ny organism which has been altered or produced through genetic engineering,if the donor organism or vector or vector agent belongs to any genera or taxa designated in and meets the definition of plant pest.aphis regulates such a genetically engineered organism,referred to by the parties as a presumptive plant pest,until the agency concludes on the basis of scientific evidence that the modified plant is not a plant pest.see id.
to discontinue regulating a presumptive plant pest,the regulations spell out that any party may petition aphis using the petitioning procedures described in.when such a petition is filed,the agency determines whether a presumptive plant pest is an actual plant pest within the meaning of the term in the ppa by evaluating data that the petitioning party has included in its petition.id.c.such evidence is generally provided by the company that engineered the plant,for the regulations require information that is most easily supplied by such a party.the regulation requires information about the presumptive plant pest biology and any experiments that were conducted on the plant.id.the agency also considers data from field tests in which aphis permits introduction of the presumptive plant pest into the environment on a limited basis to study how it affects other plants.id.c.on the basis of the information submitted,aphis examines whether the genetically modified plant presents a greater risk of plant harm than the nonmodified plant.see id.c requiring that a party petitioning d escribe known and potential differences from the unmodified recipient organism that would substantiate that the regulated article is unlikely to pose a greater plant pest risk than the unmodified organism from which it was derived.if aphis concludes that the presumptive plant pest does not exhibit any risk of plant pest harm,aphis must deregulate it since the agency does not have jurisdiction to regulate organisms that are not plant pests.
regulation of noxious weeds 
the ppa also authorizes aphis to regulate noxious weeds.f.the agency defines noxious weeds as weeds that are likely to be aggressively invasive,have significant negative impacts,and are extremely difficult to manage or control once established,july.
aphis regulates noxious weeds and plant pests under different regulatory frameworks.plant pests are regulated under parts and,while noxious weeds are regulated under part.unlike the plant pest framework,which presumes that some genetically modified plants are plant pests,the ppa noxious weed regulations do not presume that any plant is a noxious weed.thus,aphis classification of a plant as a presumptive plant pest does not trigger any automatic requirement to evaluate it as a noxious weed.rather,under the ppa noxious weed regulations,the agency can sua sponte assess the noxious weed properties of the plant.see.in addition,any party can petition aphis to list or delist a plant as a noxious weed using a process that is similar to the petition process for deregulating plant pests.see id.
aphis has never sua sponte evaluated rra as a noxious weed,and no party has ever petitioned aphis to list rra as a noxious weed.aphis has therefore never designated rra as a noxious weed.
ii.factual background,regulatory history,and prior litigation 
grown on over twenty million acres,alfalfa is the united states fourth most widely grown crop and the third most valuable.alfalfa is typically grown as hay and is one of the primary food sources for ruminants like cattle,goats,and sheep.because many conventional herbicides,like roundup,kill conventional alfalfa plants,monsanto and forage genetics genetically engineered rra in the to be resistant to glyphosate.rra immunity to glyphosate enables farmers to apply significantly greater amounts of the herbicide than is feasible for conventional alfalfa.this allows farmers to control weeds in alfalfa fields through glyphosate application and to expand alfalfa production into areas where weed infestations previously made cultivation of the crop difficult.
monsanto and forage genetics market rra and roundup together as a single crop system.use of glyphosate on alfalfa fields is expected to increase dramatically with rra introduction aphis predicted in its final eis of rra that once marketing of rra takes hold,annual glyphosate usage on alfalfa fields will increase from less than half a million pounds to more than million pounds.
monsanto and forage genetics created rra by transferring a gene from agrobacterium,a naturally occurring bacterium,into the genetic structure of conventional alfalfa.aphis regulations list agrobacterium as a plant pest.the insertion of this gene changes the genetic structure of the alfalfa plant and makes it resistant to glyphosate.because aphis regulations provide that agrobacterium can be a plant pest,aphis regulated rra as a presumptive plant pest.see,june,describing aphis initial regulation of rra as a plant pest.so long as rra was a presumptive plant pest and within aphis scope of regulation,farmers could plant the crop only with the agency consent.see a and.
seeking to end aphis regulation of rra as a presumptive plant pest,monsanto and forage genetics invoked the procedures provided in and petitioned the agency in april for a determination that rra was not a plant pest.see.in response to the petition,aphis assessed whether rra caused any plant pest harms.aphis considered information submitted by monsanto and forage genetics,including data from rra field tests,as well as public comments.aphis,in june,concluded that rra was not a plant pest and therefore should not be regulated.id.at.aphis found that rra presented no greater plant pest harms than conventional alfalfa.id.at.the agency further found that the plant pest properties of the agrobacterium used to engineer rra were disarmed and could not injure or damage other plants.id.aphis stated that the rra plant would not damage other plants,was not a plant pathogen,should not limit a farmer ability to control plant pests in alfalfa and other crops,and would not harm threatened or endangered species that were beneficial to agriculture.id.at.
pursuant to nepa,aphis also conducted an environmental assessment.id.nepa regulations provide that an agency shall conduct an environmental assessment to determine if an agency action will significantly affect the environment.if this initial assessment finds that the agency action may significantly affect the environment,the agency must then prepare an eis.id.if the agency concludes that its action will not significantly impact the environment,the agency issues a finding of no significant impact,and the agency can proceed with its proposed action without preparing an eis.id.in its nepa environmental assessment,aphis issued a finding of no significant impact.at.aphis therefore did not prepare an eis.on june,aphis unconditionally deregulated rra.
a.the geertson litigation and related agency actions 
in early,some of the same farmers and environmental groups who are plaintiffs in this suit responded to aphis june deregulation of rra by suing the agency in the united states district court for the northern district of california.they contended that aphis june deregulation violated the ppa,esa,and nepa.with regard to the plaintiffs nepa claim,the district court ruled in a february unpublished decision that aphis had violated nepa by failing to prepare an eis before it deregulated rra.geertson seed farms johanns,no,wl,at.the district court held that an eis should have addressed the environmental effects of transgenic contamination and weeds.id.at.the district court noted that transgenic contamination could adversely affect the welfare of organic farmers who raise conventional alfalfa.id.accordingly,the district court issued orders vacating aphis deregulation of rra pending completion of an eis that addressed those harms,enjoining aphis from deregulating rra in any manner while the agency prepared the eis,and enjoining further planting of rra.geertson seed farms johanns,wl,at,geertson seed farms johanns,wl,at.may.the district court did not reach the plaintiffs claims under the ppa or the esa.
this court affirmed the district court order.geertson seed farms johanns,cir.the supreme court granted certiorari,however,and remanded.monsanto geertson seed farms,d.the court held that an injunction that prohibited aphis from partially deregulating rra while the agency prepared an eis was overbroad.id.at.it stated that there were situations where aphis could partially deregulate rra without causing the plaintiffs irreparable injury.id.the court noted that the agency could mitigate the dangers of transgenic contamination by limiting the geographic area where farmers could grow rra or imposing isolation distances between fields of rra and conventional alfalfa.id.at.for the same reasons,the court held that the injunction enjoining all rra planting was overbroad.id.at.
the district court original decision in geertson,in,had vacated aphis deregulation of rra and that ruling was not challenged in the appellate courts.id.at.the supreme court noted that we assume without deciding that the district court in geertson acted lawfully in vacating aphis deregulation decision.id.the geertson appellate litigation involved only the scope of the injunction that the district court issued pending aphis preparation of an eis under nepa.see geertson seed farms,at.
aphis released its final eis in december.the final eis listed partial deregulation as one of two preferred alternatives.the other preferred alternative was an action that unconditionally deregulated rra.the agency was required to choose among these two alternatives while still acting within its jurisdiction under the ppa to regulate plant pests.aphis concluded that unconditionally deregulating rra was the alternative consistent with the agency limited statutory mandate.this conclusion necessarily followed from aphis earlier conclusion in june that rra was not a plant pest.see.at.
while aphis was preparing the final eis,the district court order in geertson,vacating aphis deregulation of rra,remained in effect.after completing the final eis in december,the order expired because aphis had fulfilled its obligations under nepa by preparing the eis.
aphis then issued,in january,the rod,unconditionally deregulating rra.the rod relied on aphis june assessment of rra plant pest properties conducted in response to monsanto and forage genetics deregulation petition in which the agency had concluded that rra was not a plant pest.the rod noted that although rra was created using a plant pest the agrobacterium,the genetically modified plant did not present any direct or indirect plant pest risks and therefore should be granted nonregulated status.the rod stated that because rra will not damage or injure other plants,it does not present a greater plant pest risk than conventional alfalfa.
aphis noted in the rod that its final eis had recognized that continued regulation of rra was the environmentally preferred option,but aphis concluded that,as a matter of law,neither the ppa nor the regulations permitted it to continue regulating rra once it concluded that rra was not a plant pest within the regulatory scope of the statute.the agency stated that it would be inconsistent with the ppa,the regulation codified at part,and the biotechnology regulatory policies in the coordinated framework,to prevent the commercial release of rra.
b.this litigation 
almost immediately after the issuance of aphis rod deregulating rra,the plaintiffs filed this action in the district court.the district court held that the dangers of transgenic contamination and increased glyphosate usage are not plant pest harms under the ppa.ctr.for food safety.at.it also ruled that the ppa separate regulatory frameworks for plant pests and noxious weeds did not require aphis to evaluate whether rra was a noxious weed at the time the agency considered whether rra was a plant pest.id.at.the district court also noted that aphis deregulation of rra was not inconsistent with the supreme court decision in monsanto,id.at,in which the supreme court expressly stated that it was not deciding if aphis acted lawfully when it deregulated rra,see monsanto.at.
the district court rejected the plaintiffs other theories as well.citing national association of home builders defenders of wildlife,d,it held that once aphis correctly concluded that it no longer had jurisdiction to regulate rra,the deregulation of rra was a nondiscretionary act that did not obligate the agency to consult with the fws under the esa concerning further action.ctr.for food safety,d at.the district court further held tha
