monsanto company filed an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,seeking a declaratory judgment that its transgenic corn products did not infringe four patents owned by aventis cropscience,a predecessor of appellant bayer bioscience.the patents at issue claim a variety of methods and products relating to the insertion of bacterial dna into plants to give the plants resistance to certain insects.besides contending that it did not infringe any of the four patents,monsanto alleged that the four patents were unenforceable and that various claims of the patents were invalid.aventis counterclaimed,alleging that monsanto infringed certain claims of each of the four patents.
the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt produces a protein that is toxic to certain insects.plant genetic systems,a predecessor of both aventis and bayer,developed a way to genetically engineer plants to produce a truncated version of that protein and obtained the four patents in suit relating to that invention.the first,patent the patent,is directed to chimeric genes having a dna fragment encoding a truncated insecticidal protein.the second,patent the patent,is also directed to chimeric genes as well as plant cells and plants that produce the insecticidal protein.the third,patent the patent,is directed to methods of protecting plants by altering the plants genetic codes so that they produce the insecticidal protein.the fourth,patent the patent,is directed to plants and cells that produce the insecticidal protein.all four patents are related,the first three being the product of divisional applications of the application that ultimately matured into the patent.
as described in the largely overlapping specifications of the four patents,the invention took advantage of a known system for introducing foreign dna into a plant cell genome by using the bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens agrobacterium,which has the natural capacity to transform the genome of certain plants.the specification describes a process starting with plant cells that are susceptible to genetic transformation by agrobacterium.the agrobacterium is then transformed so that its genome contains a chimeric gene comprising a dna fragment that encodes a truncated form of the bt insecticidal protein.the transformed agrobacterium is then used to modify the plant cell genome so that the plant cell will express an amount of the bt polypeptide toxin.
monsanto sells genetically altered corn seeds that produce corn that expresses a bt toxin at insecticidal levels.after monsanto filed this action for declaratory relief and aventis filed its counterclaim,monsanto filed motions for summary judgment requesting that the four patents in suit be held unenforceable,invalid,and not infringed.
the district court granted monsanto summary judgment motions.with respect to the broadest motion,the court held all four of the patents unenforceable because of inequitable conduct during the prosecution of the parent application that led to the issuance of the four patents.in addition,the court held that the collateral estoppel effect of a prior decision on a similar patent required the court to hold that all of the asserted claims of the patent and two of the asserted claims of the patent were invalid,and that monsanto did not infringe any of the asserted claims of the patent.finally,based on its construction of the claim term,the court held that monsanto was entitled to summary judgment of noninfringement as to all of the asserted claims of the patent and one of the asserted claims of the patent.
bayer appeals from each of those three rulings.we hold that the district court improperly granted summary judgment on monsanto inequitable conduct claim,on its collateral estoppel claim,and on its noninfringement claim based on the construction of the claim term.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment against bayer and remand for further proceedings.
the district court granted summary judgment for monsanto on the issue of inequitable conduct based on what the court concluded was a false declaration filed with the patent and trademark office pto during the prosecution of the patent.the court ruled that the false declaration rendered all four of the patents in suit unenforceable.
during prosecution,the examiner rejected certain claims as not being enabled.the examiner pointed out that the claims were directed to a truncated bt gene for an insecticidal protein expressed in any plant,even though in the examiner view the specification enabled the gene only in tobacco plants.to overcome that rejection,the applicants submitted a declaration by entomologist stefan jansens,an employee of bayer predecessor,plant genetic systems,the assignee of each of the applications at issue in this case.in the declaration,jansens attested that any truncated bacillus thuringiensis bt gene could be expressed in generally any plant to provide an insect controlling amount of its encoded bt polypeptide toxin in the plant as disclosed in this application along with his declaration,jansens presented the results of tests conducted under his supervision.in addition,he attested that he knew of no test results which are contrary to or inconsistent with the test results submitted to the pto or which would lead to different conclusions from those expressed in the declaration.
in the district court proceedings,monsanto sought summary judgment on its inequitable conduct claim,arguing that jansens was aware of test results that were inconsistent with the statements in his declaration and that he intentionally withheld those test results from the pto.
bayer responded to monsanto summary judgment motion by submitting an affidavit from jansens in which he explained why he did not submit the allegedly inconsistent test results to the pto.jansens attested that the unsubmitted test results were not inconsistent with his representations during prosecution,because the purportedly negative results in those tests were actually inconclusive for various reasons.with respect to several of the tests,he explained that the data provided an insufficient basis from which to draw any reasonable conclusion as to whether the invention worked in the types of plants being tested.moreover,he asserted that in some of the tests that did not show lethal levels of toxin production,the results showed growth inhibition in the target insects,which was consistent with the representations in his declaration that the invention could be made to work in plants generally and that he was aware of no test results supporting the contrary conclusion.
jansens analyzed each of the test results cited by monsanto and explained why the results in each case were not contrary to his declaration.in the case of the experiments on cotton plants,he explained,the level of mortality and growth inhibition for insects on the control plants was too high to allow a reasonable interpretation of whether there was an amount of bt protein produced in the plants transformed with a bt gene.nonetheless,he added,despite the high background level of mortality in the controls of many of the cotton tests,some of the tests on cotton plants transformed with a truncated bt gene still showed insect growth inhibition,indicating the possible production of amounts of bt toxin.
with respect to the tests on plants of the brassica genus including cabbage,jansens asserted that only a limited number of tests were run on those plants and that most of the results from those tests were insufficient to draw any reasonable general conclusion as to the transformed plants capacity to express the bt toxin.nonetheless,as in the case of the experiments on cotton plants,jansens explained that data from several of the tests on brassica plants showed insect growth inhibition.
jansens further explained that only a limited number of tests were performed with potato and corn plants,and that the data from those tests did not provide a sufficient basis from which to draw any reasonable scientific conclusions.once again,however,he noted that the tests on the transformed potato plants showed insect growth inhibition,indicating the possible production of amounts of bt toxin.as to monsanto allegation that an experiment involving a single transformed tomato plant failed to show that truncated bt genes conferred insect control in tomato plants,jansens stated that other tomato plants transformed with the same truncated bt gene were shown to be lethal to the same target insect.
more generally,jansens explained that to obtain a plant transformed with a truncated bt gene that expresses an or lethal amount of a truncated bt protein,
it is well known that a large number of independently transformed plants must be obtained in some cases using a variety of different gene constructs and analyzed.if sufficient plants are obtained and then evaluated in an insect bioassay,from my experience,some plants might be lethal to the target insect,some might inhibit the growth of the target insect,and some might appear to have no effect on the target insect.
as is understood by persons working in the field,he added,it is not reasonable to draw scientific conclusions from the experimental results on only a limited number of transformed plants,including whether or not a particular truncated bt gene could be expressed in the particular plant to provide an amount of its encoded bt polypeptide toxin in the plant.accordingly,jansens asserted that he believed his pto declaration was accurate and that he had no intention to deceive the examiner or the pto.
notwithstanding jansens affidavit,the district court concluded that the omission of the test results cited by monsanto rendered jansens pto declaration false and misleading.the court further concluded that the false and misleading features of the declaration were material because the omitted test results would have been highly important to a reasonable examiner.finally,the court concluded that the test results were so plainly material that the submission of the declaration by itself provided a sufficient basis for inferring that jansens intended to deceive the pto.accordingly,the court entered summary judgment for monsanto and held that each of the patents in suit was unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.
to hold a patent unenforceable for inequitable conduct,a court must find,by clear and convincing evidence,that the applicant omitted or misrepresented material facts with the intention of misleading or deceiving the patent examiner.see glaxo novopharm,monon stoughton trailers,upjohn mova pharm.once the challenger has shown the requisite levels of materiality and intent,the district court must balance the equities to determine whether the patentee has committed inequitable conduct that warrants holding the patent unenforceable.see roche,promega.
with respect to the issue of falsity,monsanto argues that the district court correctly concluded that monsanto presented overwhelming evidence of negative results for other plant species that jansens did not mention and hence jansens assertion in his declaration that he knew of no contrary test results was false.bayer,on the other hand,relies on jansens district court affidavit as evidence that the omitted test results were not negative with respect to the question that the patent examiner was seeking to answer.instead,according to bayer,the evidence showed that those tests led to no reliable conclusion.for that reason,bayer argues,jansens failure to refer to those tests in his pto declaration was not misleading,and his statement that he knew of no scientific evidence contrary to the assertions in his declaration was not false.
in determining that the omitted test results were contrary to the positive test results bayer experienced with other species,the district court necessarily discounted the affidavit in which jansens explained the nature of those test results and their relationship to the conclusions set forth in his pto declaration.in so doing,the court erred.on summary judgment,t he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.the district court,however,resolved the central dispute over the omitted test results in favor of monsanto,a decision that required the court to reject the explanation provided in jansens affidavit.if the court were to credit jansens affidavit,it could find that the test results withheld from the pto were not negative and that jansens statement to the pto that he knew of no contrary results was true.thus,there is a factual dispute about the truth of the pto declaration that should not have been resolved on summary judgment.
monsanto argues that jansens affidavit does not create a genuine issue of fact as to falsity because it is inconsistent with his deposition testimony.monsanto asserts that at his deposition jansens was asked why he did not submit the omitted test results to the pto,and that he provided no answer.however,it is a disputed question of fact as to whether jansens affidavit and his deposition testimony are inconsistent.at his deposition,jansens was asked whether he submitted the test results in question.he admitted he had not submitted those results.when asked whether he thought he should have submitted them,he replied that as an entomologist it was difficult for him to determine what information the patent office would want.on remand,the district court may consider,in light of all the evidence,whether there is conflict between jansens statements at his deposition and the statements in his affidavit,and if so,whether and to what extent his affidavit should be discounted as a result of the conflict.
citing paragon podiatry laboratory,klm laboratories,monsanto argues that jansens district court affidavit was conclusory and insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to falsity.in paragon podiatry,this court upheld a summary judgment of unenforceability.the court acknowledged that summary judgment of inequitable conduct should be rare,but that it is permissible on inequitable conduct,as on other issues,if there is no genuine issue of material fact.id.at.the court noted that in looking to the record for evidence of a genuine issue all of the circumstances,including those indicative of good faith,must be considered,but that a genuine issue of material fact is not raised by the submission of merely conclusory statements or completely insupportable,specious,or conflicting explanations or excuses.id.
although monsanto urges that we look to paragon podiatry as a template,paragon podiatry is markedly different from this case.in paragon podiatry,there was no question that the submission to the pto was false and that the false representations were material the only issue was whether the false and material representations were submitted with an intent to deceive.as to that issue,the court wrote that the affidavits submitted to explain the representations made to the pto were bare declaration s of lack of intent to mislead and that the explanations provided in the affidavits were either nonresponsive or lacked evidentiary support.at.the court therefore concluded that the affidavits constituted nothing more than a conclusory denial,which is not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.
in this case,by contrast,the parties dispute not only the issue of intent,but also whether the declaration was false or misleading at all.jansens affidavit described in detail each of the allegedly negative test results and explained why those test results,in jansens view,were not inconsistent with the declaration he submitted to the pto.because jansens affidavit sets forth a explanation that could lead a finder of fact to determine that his declaration was not false or misleading,the affidavit created a disputed issue of material fact as to whether the declaration was false or misleading.
even if the court could conclude from the evidence in the summary judgment record that the omitted test results were contrary to the results the applicants achieved with other species,on remand the district court must still determine whether monsanto has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the declaration was submitted with the intent to deceive the pto.see upjohn,at.while intent can sometimes be inferred from misleading conduct itself,see paragon podiatry,at,such an inference is not required in every case,even when the misrepresentation is in affidavit form,glaxo,at.
we have explained that a lthough the intent element of fraud or inequitable conduct may be proven by a showing of acts the natural consequence of which were presumably intended by the actor,this requires the fact finder to evaluate all the facts and circumstances in each case.such an evaluation is rarely enabled in summary proceedings.paragon podiatry,at.in paragon podiatry,it was proper to infer intent when the patentee submitted admittedly false affidavits that convey ed the impression of deliberate artfulness by skirting the truth,and had the natural consequence of deceiving the examiner.id.at.
unlike in paragon podiatry,jansens did not simply offer a conclusory declaration of lack of intent to deceive.his assertion that he did not intend to deceive the pto was based on his detailed explanation of his interpretation of the disputed test results.thus,this case satisfies the requirement described in paragon,that the affiant who seeks to avoid summary judgment must at least state facts supporting a plausible justification or excuse for the misrepresentation.at.it was therefore improper for the district court on summary judgment to infer an intent to deceive based on the court conclusion that the declaration was false and that the explanation for the falsity was unpersuasive.to show intent to mislead,monsanto must show by either direct or indirect evidence that when jansens attested that he knew of no test results which are contrary to or inconsistent with the test results submitted to the pto or which would lead to different conclusions from those expressed in the declaration,he knew the statement was false or misleading.
the district court also found that the circumstances surrounding the declaration provided convincing evidence that jansens declaration was submitted with the intention of misleading the pto.in particular,the court pointed to the threat that without the declaration the examiner would limit the claims to tobacco plants,and focused on aventis status as a small enterprise with limited resources pursuing a survival strategy.the circumstances surrounding the submission of the declaration are certainly relevant to the inquiry into intent,which ordinarily can not be established by direct proof and must be inferred from an assessment of all the surrounding circumstances.see merck danbury pharmacal.but the small size of the applicants company and the applicants presumed incentive to obtain broad patent protection for their inventions did not give rise to such a compelling inference of deceptive intent as to justify the entry of summary judgment on that issue.
in sum,because the parties submissions in the summary judgment proceedings created a genuine issue of fact as to whether jansens declaration was false or misleading and whether jansens intended to mislead the pto,we hold that summary judgment of unenforceability was improper.on remand,the district court must weigh all of the evidence,direct and circumstantial,to determine whether jansens declaration was false or misleading,and whether he intended to deceive the examiner.
the district court entered a second summary judgment order giving collateral estoppel effect to a decision in an earlier case between the predecessors of the parties in this case,plant genetic systems,dekalb genetics,d,aff.the district court viewed the plant genetic systems case as establishing that corn was not susceptible to transformation by agrobacterium as of the priority date for the patents at issue in this case.based on that characterization,the court concluded that collateral estoppel principles required it to hold that the asserted claims of the patent and claims and of the patent were invalid for lack of enablement and that the asserted claims of the patent were not infringed.
the patent in suit in the plant genetic systems case claimed the use of agrobacterium to transform plants by inserting the bar gene,which would increase the plant resistance to certain herbicides,so that a farmer who sprayed a field with the herbicide would be able to kill all the unwanted plants but leave the transformed plants unaffected.the district court in that case held that the patent enabled the transformation of dicotyledonous dicot plants but not monocotyledonous monocot plants,although the claim language was broad enough to cover both.d at.not finding adequate disclosure in the specification,the court examined evidence presented by bayer predecessor concerning the knowledge of one skilled in the art as of,the filing date for the patent in that case.id.at.in particular,the court noted that the evidence at trial revealed that no one was able to use agrobacterium to create a successful transformation method for monocots until several years after.id.at.accordingly,the court ruled that several of the asserted claims were not enabled and that the remainder had to be construed to be limited to dicots,and not to cover monocots such as corn.id.at.
the district court in this case explained that because bayer predecessor had litigated and lost on the question whether corn could be genetically transformed by agrobacterium as of,bayer could not now argue that corn could be genetically transformed by that means as of,the priority date for the patents at issue in this case.because both parties in this case agreed that the asserted claims of the patent and claims and of the patent cover monocots as well as dicots,the court held that bayer was barred from arguing that those claims were fully enabled.moreover,in light of the evidence regarding the state of the art in,the court in the plant genetic systems case construed the phrase susceptible to transformation by agrobacterium as limited to dicots.based on that ruling,the court in this case held that the same phrase in the patent had to be construed in the same way and that,as a consequence,monsanto corn products did not infringe any of the asserted claims of the patent.
what the court decided in plant genetic systems was that the specification of the patent in that case did not enable the insertion of the bar gene into monocots and that the transformation of a monocot was not within the skill of ordinary artisans without the need for undue experimentation as of the filing date of that patent.see,d at in this case,one of the central questions addressed at trial was whether any methodology existed as of this date by which the bar gene could be stably integrated into monocots.id.at in march of,a person skilled in the art who attempted to stably integrate the bar gene into plants cell sic other than dicots would have had to engage in undue that they could have successfully completed the task at all.further,this deficiency is not cured by the specification.id.at the plain import of such evidence is that a significant amount of experimentation was necessary to be able to stably insert a heterologous dna fragment into a monocotylenous sic plant cell in early and the patent itself provided little guidance to others who want to practice the full scope of its inventions.on appeal,this court confirmed that the cell claims of the patent were not enabled by the specification and that practicing stable gene transformation for monocot cells in required undue experimentation.at.accordingly,we upheld the district court ruling that certain claims of the patent at issue were invalid for lack of enablement and others had to be construed as limited to dicot plants.
the two questions that the district court in this case held to be governed by collateral estoppel were whether the specifications of the and patents fail to enable the inventions with respect to monocots,and whether the claims of the patent must be construed to be limited to dicots.those questions are similar to the issues decided in the plant genetic systems case,but they are not the same.
in order to determine whether the specifications of the and patents enable the transformation of monocots through the use of agrobacterium,the district court must consult those speci
