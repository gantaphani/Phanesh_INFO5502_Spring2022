edker and blanche pope owned acres of real property located in the san luis rey river valley in north san diego county,otherwise known as the pope ranch.in or about,the popes explored developing portions of the property into residential lots and a lake a specific plan prepared in or about that time proposed devoting approximately acres of the pope ranch to continued agricultural uses,including acres for avocado production on sloping hills on the eastern boundary of the property.
on december,the popes sold appellant the portion of the pope ranch commonly known as the lake rancho viejo subdivision the lower property.the lower property is largely within a relatively flat alluvial plain and is flanked on the east by lancaster mountain.at the time of the sale,it contained vacant fields and a commercial orange grove with approximately trees.those trees were irrigated and harvested for commercial purposes on a regular basis.the popes retained ownership of the remaining acres situated on a hill located on the eastern boundary of the lower property the upper property.the upper property contained an orange grove as well as an avocado grove consisting of approximately trees that since the had been commercially farmed on a continuous basis.those groves have been irrigated by pumping water uphill from wells containing water from the adjacent san luis rey river.although the upper property is located in a municipal water district,district water is not available to the owners because there is no water meter for the groves.the well water is saltier than metropolitan water,and thus in order to dilute the water salinity,more well water is applied to the trees than if metropolitan water were available.for years,rain water and natural runoff has flowed down from the upper property onto the lower property,as has irrigation water from the upper property and from a grove owned by third parties above the upper property.
in,appellant began preparing the lower property for development.it cut down the orange trees and graded building pads directly beneath the avocado grove on the upper property.appellant excavated cut slopes into the hills along the boundary between the upper and lower properties.during the grading,appellant encountered water seepage on the northeastern section of the property and observed water streams and water in canyons on several lots.the mass grading was completed between april and september of.
in november,the popes sold the upper property to respondent.respondent sole business is commercial avocado farming.it continued to irrigate the upper property in a manner identical to the way it was irrigated before its purchase.in may,appellant discovered water cascading and seeping from the cut slopes in various lots as a result of respondent irrigation of the upper property,causing damage to and destabilization of the slope.it requested respondent solve the problem by either reducing its irrigation or installing water control systems to prevent the runoff.in june,after respondent refused its request,appellant installed an additional subdrain system at its own expense to remedy the runoff.
appellant sued respondent seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief under causes of action for failure to contain irrigation water,trespass and nuisance.respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground section provided a complete defense to appellant causes of action.in response,appellant voluntarily dismissed its nuisance cause of action without prejudice.

a defendant moving for summary judgment based upon an affirmative defense,as here,bears an overall burden of persuasion that there is a complete defense to the plaintiff action,that is,he must persuade the court there is no material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find as to that defense.see aguilar atlantic richfield company cal th,d,fn.aguilar.in meeting its overall burden of persuasion,the defendant has the initial burden of production entailing him to present evidence id.at,d,citing,supporting a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact as to the defense.aguilar,at,d.once the defendant has met that initial burden of production,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to present evidence showing the existence of a triable issue of one or more material facts as to that defense.ibid,subd.o.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleading to show a triable issue of material fact exists,subd.o aguilar,at,d,parsons crown disposal cal th,fn,d,scheiding dinwiddie construction th,d.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof at trial.aguilar,at,d.

ii.section applies to appellant causes of action seeking damages caused by escaping irrigation waters 
section was added in by the enactment of assembly bill reg.sess.hereafter ab.stats,ch.subdivision a of the statute provides no agricultural activity,operation,or facility,or appurtenances thereof,conducted or maintained for commercial purposes,and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards,as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality,shall be or become a nuisance,private or public,due to any changed condition in or about the locality,after it has been in operation for more than three years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began.
based in part on the statute literal language,appellant contends section does not apply to trespasses or other causes of action arising from the discharge of irrigation water onto another land.it focuses on the distinction between the torts of nuisance and trespass,pointing out the former is an interference with the use and enjoyment of land not requiring interference with possession,and the latter an invasion of interest in the exclusive possession of land.appellant maintains the statute legislative history demonstrates the legislature did not intend to confer absolute immunity for agricultural activities it only intended to protect farmers from traditional farming operations causing noise,odors,dust or items otherwise related to the enjoyment of one land as opposed to activities causing an adjoining landowner property damage as a result of a physical invasion.it asserts,thus,while section may bar a claim for nuisance against a farmer for the smell of his cows,it will not shield him from liability if a cow escapes and trespasses onto a neighbor property,thereby destroying or damaging the neighbor property.
appellant argument is based on a misapprehension of nuisance law as well as an overly narrow reading of the statute.our primary aim in construing any law is to determine the legislative intent.citation.in doing so we look first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.committee of seven thousand superior court cal d,souza,supra,th at,d.we need not construe statutory language when it is clear and unambiguous.of fish game irrigation dist.th,d.nevertheless,i t is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.citations.younger superior court cal d.thus,t he intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.lungren deukmejian cal d.
section broadly defines an agricultural activity,operation,or facility,or appurtenances thereof as used in subdivision a.such matters shall include,but not be limited to,the cultivation and tillage of the soil,dairying,the production,cultivation,growing,and harvesting of any agricultural commodity including timber,viticulture,apiculture,or horticulture,the raising of livestock,fur bearing animals,fish,or poultry,and any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as incident to or in conjunction with those farming operations,including preparation for market,delivery to storage or to market,or delivery to carriers for transportation to market,subd.e,emphasis added.by its plain language,section was intended to immunize farmers from nuisance liability for any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm incident to farming operations,subd.e,emphasis added as long as the other conditions of the statute are met.appellant does not,nor could it reasonably,argue that irrigation is not an agricultural activity or operation.rather,it maintains the statute,by expressly limiting its protection to nuisance lawsuits,necessarily excludes such activities if they cause physical damage to adjoining or other properties.
appellant argument is fundamentally flawed because it fails to recognize that a nuisance is not limited to intangible intrusions upon land.see mangini d.mangini numeous cases have sanctioned recovery on a nuisance theory for direct injury to a plaintiff property.as the court pointed out in mangini,california nuisance law is a creature of statute,specifically section,which defines a nuisance in part as a nything which is injurious to health,or is indecent or offensive to the senses,or an obstruction to the free use of property,so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.see mangini,at,citing,emphasis added.further,a person whose property is injuriously affected,or whose personal enjoyment is lessened by a nuisance may sue for damages and abatement under code of civil procedure section.code civ.proc,emphasis added.indeed,t he typical and familiar nuisance claim involves an activity or condition which causes damage or other interference with the enjoyment of adjoining or neighboring land.wilshire westwood associates atlantic richfield th,d.witkin recognizes that a ctual physical interference with land use constitutes the most obvious and common type of nuisance.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.
thus,many activities will give rise to liability both as trespass and a nuisance,if they result in the violation of a person right of exclusive possession of land,and also constitute an unreasonable and substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the land see mangini,supra,d at.citing california cases that recognize invasions of property otherwise amounting to a trespass may also constitute a nuisance under the statutes kfc western,meghrig th,d plaintiffs could state causes of action for both continuing nuisance and continuing trespass against former owners of property based upon soil contamination from underground storage tanks see also resolution trust rossmoor th,d failure to clean up contamination causing ongoing damage to property has been held to constitute such a continuing nuisance.citations.likewise,the same conduct gives rise to an action for continuing trespass d nuisances,rest d torts,com.e,we therefore reject appellant attempt to exclude respondent conduct from the reach of the statute by distinguishing between trespass and nuisance theories on the basis of physical invasion and damage to property.
moreover,appellant interpretation of the statute would frustrate its apparent purpose.we concede that,read literally,the statute immunizes specified agricultural enterprises only as against claims based upon a theory of public or private nuisance and not against claims based on other liability theories,such as trespass.but we can not accept appellant position that the legislature intended by this reference to focus strictly upon the pleaded theory of liability and reject immunity for an accepted and established farming activity amounting to a nuisance,simply because it is pleaded as a trespass.our review of the legislative history provided by appellant demonstrates no such intent.indeed,a letter from the sponsor of ab,assemblyman john thurman,urging the speaker of the assembly to support the measure,indicates an intention contrary to such a narrow reading of the statute.in that letter,assemblyman thurman stated ab is an important step toward eliminating suits by individuals who have moved to a new housing development in the country and find the farm bordering their back fence offends their senses.suits against agricultural operations for dust,wind machine or tractor noise,livestock or poultry smells and other things commonly associated with the operation of an agricultural enterprise are becoming more prevalent as urban development reaches out to meet agricultural areas.ab will stop this dangerous cycle by allowing agriculture to operate without undue pressure from urbanization.keeping agricultural land in agricultural use is the goal.chairman of the assembly committee on agriculture john thurman,letter to speaker of the assembly willie brown,may,emphasis added.assemblyman thurman sought broad protection for traditional farming practices performed in conjunction with commercial operations when neighboring properties are developed into residential or urban use.the history of ab prepared by the senate committee on the judiciary explains the bill purpose is to attempt to forestall some of the loss of prime agricultural land on the outskirts of growing urban areas.it states the source of this bill and its supporters contend that the agricultural industry should be preserved and protected against the threat of nuisance liability,particularly where an agricultural enterprise has been in existence for a number of years,only to become subject to encroachment by a spreading city into the farmer area.
construing the statute in light of its legislative purpose compels us to reject a narrow reading that would turn upon the pleaded theory of liability,and adopt a reading that would further the preservation of ongoing,standard agricultural practices.if commercial agricultural activity qualifies as a nuisance and otherwise falls within section,a plaintiff can not avoid the immunity provided by the statute by simply recharacterizing or relabeling the conduct in the guise of trespass to bring it outside the ambit of the statute.this was implicitly recognized by the court of appeal in souza,supra,th,d,where the trial court treated a complaint alleging causes of action for negligence and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code section et as in fact based on a theory of nuisance because they alleged the violation of a single primary right,plaintiffs right to the unimpaired ownership and undisturbed enjoyment of their premises.souza,at,d.souza involved irrigation,the very agricultural activity involved here,except as to rice crops.for approximately five years,the parties,commercial farmers with bordering farm lands,farmed rice on their land.id.at,d.after the plaintiffs shifted to planting row crops,they noticed when defendants rice fields were flooded,the portion of their land closest to the defendants became so wet that it could not be farmed.ibid.the plaintiffs sued defendants,seeking an injunction and damages for negligence and unfair business practices,and the defendants successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground plaintiffs lawsuit was barred by section.souza,at,d.the issue before the appellate court in souza was whether the statute applied to an action against a commercial entity by another commercial entity as opposed to a plaintiff the court concluded the statute language was unambiguous and broadly applied to such circumstances,at,d.
appellant seeks to distinguish souza on the basis that the invasion,the flooding of rice crops,was continuing in nature whereas here,the water intrusion occurred only when respondent irrigated its land.the distinction is baseless.irrigation is an ongoing operation in commercial farming generally,and was regularly conducted in this case according to the undisputed testimony of respondent irrigation worker,salvador munoz even where the watering is an occasional leaching,it is still a practice that is repeated on a regular basis.as for appellant other attempts to distinguish souza,we agree the case does not address the precise issue before us.but we need not rely upon souza for this aspect of our holding we independently support our conclusion by the undisputed facts of this case revealing that appellant causes of action alleging property damage from irrigation water intrusion fall within the literal language of the statute.
decisions from washington state involving washington act do not compel a different interpretation of california law.appellant assertion that we should follow those courts reasoning is based on the premise that the washington and california statutes are similar,a position we find without merit.in fact,the washington act,rcw is significantly different from california law in that,among other things,it contains an express damages savings clause nothing in this section shall affect or impair any right to sue for damages.buchanan simplot feeders limited partnership,buchanan.in buchanan,the washington supreme court considered the language of the washington act and rejected the plaintiffs contention that the damages clause permitted them to recover damages under a nuisance theory as well as other tort theories,such as trespass.at.further,the court found such an interpretation would fully gut the entire act if urban developers could invade an agricultural area and recover damages for nuisances arising from the normal operation of the farms,those farms would be forced out of operation nearly as quickly as if the farms were legally enjoined from conducting those activities.ibid.however,the court concluded,based on the legislature adoption of the damages clause,the statute did not govern activities that give rise to agricultural activities that interfere with a neighbor actual possession of their property and cause it physical damage.id.at.
california statute does not expressly carve out damage claims.moreover,as indicated,california law defines a nuisance as including those activities that intrude upon and cause physical damage to property.on that basis we would disagree with the reasoning of the washington court to the extent it would give protection to farmers who are being sued for damages based on a nuisance theory,but not those who are being sued for the same damages based on a trespass theory.we decline to apply the reasoning of the washington court to the statute before us.
iii.section on its face applies where appellant initiated changed conditions by eliminating existing orange groves and grading cut slopes 
appellant contends section does not apply to situations where a farmer subdivides his or her land and initiates the urbanization of portions of the property but continues to conduct agricultural activities on the remainder.it maintains the statute was enacted for the purpose of protecting farmers who are innocent victims of urbanization and to stem the removal of land from agricultural uses where residential development moves in next door to a longstanding agricultural activity that given these goals,the statute can not immunize a farmer who profits from urban development on his land yet also seeks to protect his continued agricultural activity.
we need not address the broad question framed by appellant.rather,we limit our assessment of the statute application to the undisputed facts before us.those facts demonstrate that while the popes sold the upper and lower properties cognizant of the lower property possible urbanization,in fact it was the appellant that took the steps to begin mass urban development,initiating the feasibility study for the proposed residential development even before it purchased the lower property.it is further undisputed that it was the appellant who,after purchasing the lower property,removed orange groves that had been present for at least thirty years and excavated the cut slopes.appellant admitted that before excavation,that property was used for the agricultural purpose of a commercial orange grove.by virtue of these acts,appellant changed the condition of the lower property.importantly,it is undisputed that the water intrusion problems occurred at the location of the slopes,and appellant has failed to contradict with any competent evidence the fact that its nuisance cause of damages resulting from the water not accrue until it graded the slopes below the respondent avocado grove.finally,appellant fails to present competent evidence disputing the fact that respondent has not changed the watering practices of the upper property that had been in place since at least 
under the circumstances,appellant claims fall directly within the intent and unambiguous language of section,which broadly immunizes established,traditional farming operations from becoming a nuisance due to any changed condition in or about the locality,subd.a,emphasis added souza,supra,th at,d.in souza,the court of appeal rejected the plaintiff claim that the words any changed condition were uncertain and needed interpretation by resort to legislative history.instead,it found the use of the word any expresses an unambiguous legislative intent to broadly apply the statute.souza,supra,th at,d.thus,the court upheld application of section in instances where a commercial agricultural entity sues another commercial agricultural entity,holding the statutory language did not limit the statute preclusive effect to actions commenced by nonagricultural plaintiffs.souza,at,d.this case does not present such unique circumstances.appellant is a residential developer and respondent a commercial farmer.thus,we confront the very situation that appellant itself admits is the focus of the statute.the statute does not limit its language to specified persons who must initiate the changed condition,nor does it specify the type or nature of the condition that must have changed.as the souza court stated,e ven if,as plaintiffs suggest,the legislature did not have such an application in mind when it enacted section,a different construction is not required because our interpretation of the statute is compelled by the plain meaning of its words,does not frustrate its apparent purpose,and does not result in absurd consequences.souza,at.
nor does our conclusion change by the fact respondent is not the same entity that has been conducting avocado farming on the upper property for over three years.respondent correctly points out that section is predicated on the duration of the agricultural operations,not the duration of the farmland ownership.we would defeat the purpose of section if we found it applied only to farming operations continuously conducted by the same farmer for over three years before occurrence of the changed condition.the statute can not be read to permit developers to enjoin a farming operation as a nuisance simply because the farm was purchased and operated by a new owner appellant argument does not persuade us to reverse the court application of section to its causes of action.
iv.appellant failed to meet its burden to raise issues of material fact as to the elements of section 
for section,subdivision a to apply,defendants must satisfy seven requisites the activity alleged to be a nuisance must be an agricultural activity conducted or maintained for commercial purposes in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality the claim of nuisance arises due to any changed condition in or about the locality after the activity has been in operation for more than three years and the activity was not a nuisance at the time it began.souza,supra,th at,d.
appellant contends that,assuming section governs its causes of action,it raised material factual issues as to whether certain requisites of the statute are satisfied.specifically,appellant maintains its evidence raises disputes as to whether respondent irrigation methods were conducted or maintained in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality whether its claim arose due to a changed condition in or about the locality and whether each parties actions were reasonable.we disagree.
accepted and customary irrigation methods 
in support of its motion,respondent submitted the declaration of expert richard marrocco,who explained that virtually percent of avocado groves in southern california need massive amounts of irrigation to make up for the lack of rainfall because seasonal rainfall is insufficient to sustain the trees.marrocco further explained avocado trees require occasional leaching in addition to regular irrigation to leach out traces of saline in the irrigation water,regardless of whether the water comes from wells or public sources.he opined,based on his decades of experience in the avocado and citrus industries,that respondent agricultural activity and operation is,and has been,conducted and maintained for a commercial purpose in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards,as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality.he concluded,respondent grove has been in compliance with such customs and standards for many more than three years,probably years.
respondent met its burden of producing competent and admissible evidence establishing the customary character of its irrigation methods with marrocco declaration,which set forth marrocco personal knowledge and competency.code civ,c,subd.d,guthrey state of california th,d.appellant does not contest marrocco expertise,and the expert explained that respondent irrigation method was an approved and customary method for avocado growers without access to metropolitan water,and that it had been followed by similar agricultural operations for over three years thus,the burden of production shifted to appellant to present admissible evidence raising a prima facie showing of any triable issue of material fact as to this element.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.appellant failed to meet this burden.
on this element of section,appellant opposition relied on the declaration of agriscience expert james mcdonald.he averred that,based on his investigation of the site,respondent irrigated its avocado groves with water having a very high salt level that if respondent used metropolitan water as do most avocado farmers in riverside and san diego county,its trees would require significantly less water and that large volumes of irrigation water were draining onto appellant property due to respondent application of deep irrigation to its avocado trees as compensation for the salinity levels.but mcdonald did not directly contradict marrocco opinions as to avocado farmers in the locale using well respondent points out,he did not address whether metropolitan water was in fact available for respondent use,nor did he state that respondent was overwatering its groves,or that it uses more well water than other avocado farmers in the locality that also use well water.in short,mcdonald declaration was insufficient to sustain appellant burden of producing competent evidence to contradict respondent showing and raise a disputed issue of material fact on this element.
changed condition in or about the locality 
appellant claims it demonstrated a triable issue as to whether its claim arose due to a changed condition in or about the locality by presenting evidence of the fact it purchased the lower property in december,and respondent purchased the upper property in november.
we have already rejected this argument,which is based on the premise that section does not immunize a new farmer who has purchased and taken over an agricultural operation that had been in place for over three years.as stated,the undisputed evidence from respondent declarants,including munoz and jerome stehly,respondent grove manager,was that commercial avocado farming had occurred on the upper property since the.appellant attempt to dispute this fact through evidence respondent had been conducting its own farming of the groves commercial operations for only approximately a year and a half does not raise a triable issue as to whether these circumstances fall outside the ambit of section.
reasonableness 
appellant contends it raised an issue of material fact as to the reasonableness of the parties respective actions under the civil law rule expressed in keys romley cal d,it argues it acted reasonably because it consulted with engineering specialists to determine the property suitability for development,but respondent has not acted reasonably in the use of its property because it is applying excessive amounts of water to its property,causing surface water to run onto the property of appellant.
reasonableness of the encroaching urban landowner conduct is not an element of section,and therefore whether appellant conduct was reasonable is not material to application of the statute.the pertinent question under the statute is whether the commercial agricultural activity at an accepted and customary practice followed by similar operations in the locale.if respondent watering practices are unreasonable it would tend to show that they are not accepted or customary.but appellant evidence fails to support its assertion.although appellant expert mcdonald may suggest respondent watering with well water is not customary because m ost avocado farmers in the riverside and san diego county customarily use m etropolitan water to irrigate their avocado trees,he did not address or contradict the testimony of respondent grove manager that respondent in fact could not use such water because they have no water meter and could not buy water district water even if they wanted to.as we have pointed out,mcdonald did not address the customary irrigation methods for avocado farmers in the locality who use well water.he simply concluded that respondent used a large volume of irrigation water due to the water high salinity,without opining whether or not use of such a large volume was reasonable.no evidence contradicts respondent expert conclusion that respondent irrigation practices are customary for avocado farmers in the locale who use well water.appellant evidence provides no basis for us to reverse the trial court ruling.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.
