on summary judgment,the united states district court for the district of delaware determined that syngenta seeds,syngenta biotechnology,garst seeds company golden harvest seeds,garwood seed golden seed,llc sokmer.seed company thorp seed and jc robinson seeds,collectively syngenta,did not infringe the asserted claims of patents and the lundquist patents.monsanto syngenta seeds,d.the trial court also held claims,and of patent the patent invalid under for lack of enablement.id.at.finding no error,this court affirms.
this case involves three patents patents the patent,the patent,and the patent.the three involve technologies for producing transgenic corn that is resistant to glyphosate,a nonselective herbicide.the patent,owned by monsanto company,claims a chimeric plant gene dna that confers the glyphosate resistance to plants.the lundquist patents,owned by dekalb genetics corporation dekalb,monsanto wholly owned subsidiary,include methods of producing herbicide resistant transgenic corn zea mays plants and seeds.the patent differs slightly from the patent.specifically,the patent claims the process of producing transgenic herbicide resistant corn and also insect resistant corn the patent claims the process of producing glyphosate resistant transgenic corn having a screenable marker gene.
on may,monsanto company and monsanto technology llc filed a suit against syngenta seeds and syngenta biotechnology,in the district court of delaware alleging infringement of the patent.a few months later,on july,dekalb genetics corporation sued syngenta seeds and syngenta biotechnology,in the northern district of illinois alleging infringement of the lundquist patents on may,the district court in illinois granted syngenta motion to transfer the suit to delaware.
dekalb and monsanto collectively monsanto allege that syngenta used seed acquired from monsanto licensees to produce further progeny containing the trait,thereby infringing the claims of the patent,claims of the patent and claims of the patent.noting dekalb itself performed the three steps of the independent claims of the and patents,syngenta argues it did not infringe the lundquist patents because it did not carry out all the steps of the asserted claimed processes during the term of the patent.syngenta also counterclaims that the patent application did not enable the asserted claims of the patent.
syngenta makes and sells genetically engineered crops.syngenta obtained gab seeds when it acquired two seed companies,garst seed company garst and golden harvest seeds,golden harvest,licensed to sell seed to farmers.monsanto does not dispute that dekalb made the original transgenic corn using a glyphosate resistant gene obtained from bayer ag.nor does monsanto dispute that in making the original transgenic corn,dekalb performed the steps recited in claim of both lundquist patents.indeed,monsanto does not dispute that the original transgenic corn was produced in,before issuance of either of the lundquist patents the patent issued july,the patent january.

the process of claim wherein the progeny obtained are crossed back to the inbred line,to obtain further progeny which comprise said dna.
the process of claim wherein seed are obtained from said further progeny plants and plants comprising said dna are recovered from said seed.
the process of claim wherein said further progeny are crossed back to the inbred line to obtain progeny which comprise said dna.
emphases added.claims of the patent read 
the process of claim further comprising obtaining transgenic glyphosate resistant progeny plants of subsequent generations from said fertile transgenic plant.
the process of claim further comprising obtaining seed from one of said progeny plants.
after claim construction,the delaware district court granted syngenta motions for summary judgment on may,finding the lundquist patents not infringed because the patent holder monsanto through dekalb performed the initial steps of the claimed processes.the trial court also found claims,and of the patent invalid for lack of enablement.monsanto,d at.the district court specifically noted that syngenta lawfully obtained the seeds from monsanto licensees,such as garst and golden harvest.upon obtaining the seeds,syngenta also acquired the right to further produce progenies containing the glyphosate resistance trait.id.at.also,monsanto itself through its subsidiary dekalb made the original plant,at a time before issuance of the lundquist patents.id.
on june,the district court entered a final judgment in favor of syngenta and against monsanto on both monsanto claim of infringement and syngenta counterclaim of invalidity under.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment without deference.johns hopkins cellpro,conroy reebok int l.thus,this court decides for itself if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.in applying this standard,this court draws all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
an infringement analysis entails two steps.the first step is determining the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.the second step is comparing the properly construed claims to the device accused of infringing.markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d citations omitted.the claim construction part of this test receives review as a question of law,see cybor fas techs,en banc,while infringement,whether literal or under the doctrine of equivalents,is a question of fact.optical disc del mar avionics,bai l l wings.

because dekalb performed all the steps of claim of both lundquist patents,monsanto necessarily asserted claims other than claim of the patent and of the patent.monsanto proffers two theories of infringement.first,monsanto argues claim of the patent is an independent claim,thus not requiring an alleged infringer to perform the steps of claim.second,monsanto argues that,even if claim is dependent on claim,syngenta infringes because syngenta performance of the last step of the process of claim resulted in performance of all of the claimed steps of claim,albeit with the first three steps performed by monsanto.
syngenta responds that claim of the patent depends on claim and therefore includes all the steps of claim.thus,claim can only be infringed by the unauthorized performance of all the steps of claims and.consequently,because monsanto the patent holder admittedly performed the steps of claim,syngenta can not infringe as a matter of law.
claim construction 
the district court construed claims of the patent and claims of the patent as dependent from claim of their respective patents.claim of the patent recites a process for generating an original ro fertile transgenic plant containing dna that provides herbicide resistance.the district court construed claim as further adding a fourth step of obtaining progeny from a fertile transgenic plant produced by the process of claim.monsanto,d at.
claims of the patent and claims of the patent fit the traditional dependent format.claim of the patent features a format closely following the traditional dependent format.although suggesting the correctness of the trial court construction,this format,howev
