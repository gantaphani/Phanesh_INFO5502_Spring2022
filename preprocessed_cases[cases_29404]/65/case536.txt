introduction 
in aas superior court cal th,d,aas,the california supreme court concluded that a group of homeowners could not recover damages in negligence from the developer,contractor or subcontractors who built their homes,for existing construction defects that had not yet caused either property damage or personal injury.in reaching this conclusion,the aas court explained that while tort law provides a remedy for construction defects that cause property damage or personal injury id.at,d,the economic loss rule precludes recovery for damages such as the difference between price paid and value received,and deviations from standards of quality that have not resulted in property damage or personal injury.id.at,d.
in response to the holding in aas,the legislature enacted civil code section et the right to repair act or the act.the act establishes a set of building standards pertaining to new residential construction,and provides homeowners with a cause of action against,among others,builders and individual product manufacturers for violation of the standards.the act makes clear that upon a showing of violation of an applicable standard,a homeowner may recover economic losses from a builder without having to show that the violation caused property damage or personal injury.in such an instance,the act abrogates the economic loss rule,thus legislatively superseding aas.
greystone homes,greystone,a home builder,brought this action against midtec,midtec,among others.in its complaint,greystone alleged that various homeowners had made claims against greystone for damage caused by plumbing fittings that midtec manufactured,and that the fittings were defective within the meaning of the act.greystone claimed that it had incurred costs to replace the defective fittings,and alleged claims including negligence and equitable indemnity causes of action against midtec.
midtec brought a motion for summary judgment summary adjudication in which it claimed that greystone could not recover for purely economic losses that it incurred in replacing the fittings.in opposition,greystone claimed that the right to repair act abolished the economic loss rule under the circumstances of this case,and argued that both builders and individual product manufacturers are liable under the act for the costs of repairing construction defects.in reply,midtec contended that the act did not apply to greystone action,and that the economic loss rule precluded greystone from prevailing against midtec on its claims.
the trial court granted midtec motion for summary judgment.the court acknowledged that the act provides an exception to the economic loss rule for actions brought under the act by homeowners.however,the court concluded that greystone is not entitled to pursue the statutorily created cause of action because greystone is not a homeowner.the court ruled that the economic loss rule bars greystone from recovering against midtec on greystone common law claims.
greystone appeal raises two questions of first impression concerning the right to repair act.the first question is whether a builder may recover for economic losses caused by a product manufacturer violations of the act standards,through an equitable indemnity claim against the manufacturer.the second question is whether a builder may recover its economic losses from an individual product manufacturer through a direct negligence claim based on the product manufacturer violation of the act standards.we conclude that a builder may recover from a product manufacturer for economic losses caused by the manufacturer violation of the standards set forth in the act,through an equitable indemnity action,but that a builder may not recover for these losses through a direct negligence claim against the manufacturer.we therefore reverse the trial court summary judgment and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to consider midtec alternative motion for summary adjudication.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
in late or early,radiant technologies,rti,purchased plastic plumbing fittings from midtec.rti used the fittings as a component part in its plumbing system.rti distributed the system to plumbing wholesalers,who in turn sold the system to plumbing subcontractors.
greystone is a merchant home builder.beginning in approximately,greystone developed and built a new home community in chula vista known as willow bend.willow bend is composed of,clustered in buildings.greystone plumbing subcontractor,production plus plumbing,installed the rti system,which contain midtec fittings,in of the willow bend units,between and.
the owners of some of the units that contained the midtec fittings began to complain to greystone about leaks in their plumbing systems.of the units experienced failures of midtec fittings.in some instances,there were multiple failures in a single unit.the midtec fittings failed primarily due to fatigue caused by a molding defect in the manufacturing process.fittings continued to fail during greystone investigation of the homeowners complaints.water leaks associated with the fitting failures presented a health risk to homeowners.
there were a total of approximately midtec fittings in the homes.greystone determined that if it did not replace the midtec fittings,it was highly probable that there would be additional failures.greystone replaced all of the midtec fittings,including those that had not yet actually failed.the total cost to replace all of the fittings was approximately.the cost for repairs related to fittings that had failed was approximately.
while midtec had a contractual relationship with rti,it did not have a contractual relationship with greystone.midtec did not provide a warranty to rti for the fittings.the only warranty that was provided to either greystone or to homeowners in the willow bend project that related to plumbing was rti warranty for the system.
greystone sued rti and midtec.greystone reached a settlement with rti.as part of the settlement,rti paid greystone amount that exceeds greystone costs to repair water damage caused by fittings that actually failed.
procedural background 
in may,greystone filed a complaint against rti,rti insurance company,zurich american insurance company zurich,and midtec.as to midtec,greystone brought a claim for negligence,a separate claim for indemnity and contribution,and requested declaratory relief.greystone subsequently reached a settlement with rti.in february,the trial court found that greystone and rti had entered into the settlement in good faith.the court subsequently dismissed greystone complaint as to rti and zurich.
in april,midtec filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication.in its motion,midtec noted that pursuant to the economic loss rule,a plaintiff may not recover,in tort,economic losses caused by an allegedly defective product when those losses are unrelated to either property damage or bodily injury.midtec argued that greystone had already recovered all of its damages that were related to property damage caused by the allegedly defective fittings,through its settlement with rti,and maintained that the economic loss rule precluded greystone from recovering additional damages from midtec related to the cost of replacing fittings that had not failed or caused property damage.
greystone opposed the motion.in its opposition,greystone argued that the right to repair act had entirely abrogated the economic loss rule in construction defect litigation.specifically,greystone argued that the act imposed liability upon builders and individual product manufactures whose products are defective,even in the absence of any specific property damage or bodily injury.greystone claimed that midtec was thus liable to greystone for greystone costs to replace all of the fittings,including those that had not yet caused property damage.greystone noted that its total cost to repair all of the fittings was approximately million,which far exceed the it received in its settlement with rti.
in its reply to greystone opposition,midtec argued that the right to repair act is completely inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.midtec maintained that only homeowners are authorized to bring an action pursuant to the act midtec also noted that section provides in part,nothing in this title modifies the law pertaining to joint and several liability for builders,general contractors,subcontractors,material suppliers,individual product manufacturer s,and design professionals that contribute to any specific violation of this title.based on this language,midtec argued that s ection alone is dispositive of the issue that s ections et do not apply to this action between the developer and a component part manufacturer.
in july,the trial court held a hearing on midtec motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.after oral argument,the trial court granted midtec motion for summary judgment.in granting the motion,the court reasoned in part 
midtec has met its initial burden of demonstrating each of the claims asserted by greystone seeks to recover the economic losses associated with replacing defective plumbing fittings that had not yet failed,had not yet caused property damage.per separate statement of facts number,its is undisputed that the settlement with rti exceeds the cost of repairing the fittings that actually leaked prior to replacement.therefore midtec has met its burden of demonstrating that the economic loss rule bars any further recovery by greystone,and the burden shifts to greystone.greystone only contention refuting defendant position is that the enactment of senate bill abolishes the economic loss rule.this contention lacks merit.rather than abolish the economic loss rule completely,created an exception to the rule where a homeowner or homeowners association brings a claim to recover damages for enumerated construction defects.see,subd.f,and.arguably,the defective fittings fall within the enumerated construction defects.see,subds.a.however,greystone is not a homeowner or homeowners association,and as a result is not entitled to pursue the statutorily created cause of action.greystone only recourse is a common law claim,and the economic loss rule applies to bar such common law claims.in addition,greystone provides no evidence demonstrating its compliance with the procedural prerequisites of,a notice and opportunity to repair,subd.b.
the trial court subsequently entered judgment in favor of midtec.greystone timely appeals.

in gem developers hallcraft homes of san diego,d.gem developers,this court outlined how the doctrine of equitable indemnity applies in the context of a construction defect case 
t he doctrine of comparative equitable indemnity is designed to do equity among defendants.under the equitable indemnity doctrine,defendants are entitled to seek apportionment of loss between the wrongdoers in proportion to their relative culpability so there will be equitable sharing of loss between multiple tortfeasors.citation.the purpose of equitable indemnification is to avoid the unfairness,under joint and several liability theory,of holding one defendant liable for the plaintiff entire loss while allowing another responsible defendant to escape scot free.citation.it is an extension of the comparative fault doctrine which allowed loss to be apportioned between plaintiff and defendants according to their respective responsibility for the loss.citation.
the gem developers court noted that the doctrine of equitable indemnity is not restricted to cases that involve tortfeasors who are liable in negligence,but rather,that equitable indemnity may also be used to apportion liability where one or more tortfeasors liability rests on the principle of strict liability.gem developers,supra,d at,quoting safeway stores,cal d.further,a defendant may pursue a comparative equitable indemnity claim against other tortfeasors either by filing a in the original tort action or by filing a separate indemnity action after paying more than its proportionate share of the damages through the satisfaction of a judgment or through a payment in settlement.evangelatos superior court cal d.

b.the economic loss rule 
in aas,supra,cal th at page,d,the supreme court considered whether a group of plaintiff homeowners could recover in negligence from the entities that built their homes a money judgment representing the cost to repair,or the diminished value attributable to,construction defects that have not caused property damage.in answering this question in the negative,the aas court relied on the economic loss rule,which it described as settled law limiting the recovery of economic losses in tort actions id.at,d.the aas court noted that in the seminal case of seely white motor cal d,seely,the court explicated the rationale for the economic loss rule 
the distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss,we wrote,is not arbitrary and does not rest on the luck of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury.the distinction rests,rather,on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products.citation a manufacturer can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety,but not for the level of performance of its products unless the manufacturer agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer demands.citation.similarly,a consumer should not be charged at the will of the manufacturer with bearing the risk of physical injury when he buys a product on the market.he can,however,be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will.citation.aas,supra,cal th at,d,quoting seely,supra,cal d at.
the aas court noted that under california tort law,courts had applied the economic loss rule in construction defect cases to preclude the recovery of purely economic losses,those not accompanied by either property damage or physical injuries 
speaking very generally,tort law provides a remedy for construction defects that cause property damage or personal injury.focusing on the conduct of persons involved in the construction process,courts in this state have found such a remedy in the law of negligence.fn.omitted.viewing the home as a product,courts have also found a tort remedy in strict products liability fn.omitted,even when the property damage consists of harm to a sound part of the home caused by another,defective part.fn.omitted.for defective products and negligent services that have caused neither property damage nor personal injury,however,tort remedies have been uncertain.any construction defect can diminish the value of a house.but the difference between price paid and value received,and deviations from standards of quality that have not resulted in property damage or personal injury,are primarily the domain of contract and warranty law or the law of fraud,rather than of negligence.in actions for negligence,a manufacturer liability is limited to damages for physical injuries no recovery is allowed for economic loss alone.citation.this general principle,the economic loss rule,is the primary obstacle to plaintiffs claim.aas,supra,cal th at,d.
the right to repair act 
in response to the holding in aas,the legislature enacted the right to repair act the act establishes a set of standards for residential construction,and provides tort liability for entities that fail to meet the standards.section provides in relevant part 
in any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of,or related to deficiencies in,the residential construction,design,specifications,surveying,planning,supervision,testing,or observation of construction,a builder,and to the extent set forth in chapter commencing with section,a general contractor,subcontractor,material supplier,individual product manufacturer,or design professional,shall,except as specifically set forth in this title,be liable for,and the claimant claims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of,the following standards,except as specifically set forth in this title.
section goes on to provide a list of standards pertaining to residential construction with respect to,among other concerns,water issues,subd.a,and plumbing and sewer issues,subd.e.
chapter of the act,beginning with section,establishes a series of prelitigation procedures that a claimant must pursue before filing an action against any party alleged to have contributed to a violation of the standard.these procedures include a requirement that the claimant provide notice of claim to the builder the builder may elect to respond to the claim by inspecting the alleged violation,offering to repair it,and either repairing the violation,or arranging for a repair to be done.if the builder fails to respond to the claim,or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of the act prelitigation procedures,the claimant may bring an action for a violation of the act standards without further resort to the prelitigation procedures.a claimant may also file an action for a violation of the act standards,alleging an inadequate repair.
among the provisions in chapter of the act that are specifically made applicable to individual product manufacturers is section.section broadly provides that all of the provisions of the act,other than the prelitigation procedures contained in chapter,apply to such manufacturers 
each and every provision of the other chapters of this title apply to general contractors,subcontractors,material suppliers,individual product manufacturers,and design professionals to the extent that the general contractors,subcontractors,material suppliers,individual product manufacturers,and design professionals caused,in whole or in part,a violation of a particular standard as the result of a negligent act or omission or a breach of contract.in addition to the affirmative defenses set forth in section,a general contractor,subcontractor,material supplier,design professional,individual product manufacturer,or other entity may also offer common law and contractual defenses as applicable to any claimed violation of a standard.all actions by a claimant or builder to enforce an express contract,or any provision thereof,against a general contractor,subcontractor,material supplier,individual product manufacturer,or design professional is preserved.nothing in this title modifies the law pertaining to joint and several liability for builders,general contractors,subcontractors,material suppliers,individual product manufacturer,and design professionals that contribute to any specific violation of this title.however,the negligence standard in this section does not apply to any general contractor,subcontractor,material supplier,individual product manufacturer,or design professional with respect to claims for which strict liability would apply.
the act repeals the economic loss rule for claims that allege a violation of the act standards 
in order to make a claim for violation of the standards set forth in chapter commencing with section,a homeowner need only demonstrate,in accordance with the applicable evidentiary standard,that the home does not meet the applicable standard,subject to the affirmative defenses set forth in section.no further showing of causation or damages is required to meet the burden of proof regarding a violation of a standard set forth in chapter commencing with section,provided that the violation arises out of,pertains to,or is related to,the original construction.
accordingly,among the damages that a claimant may recover in an action pursuant to the act are those for the reasonable value of repairing any violation of the standards set forth in the act.
the right to repair act abrogates the economic loss rule in actions brought pursuant to the act by homeowners against individual product manufacturers 
midtec primary argument in seeking affirmance of the trial court judgment is that the act preserves the economic loss rule for claims against product manufacturers that allege a violation of the act standards.midtec acknowledges that,pursuant to the act,a homeowner construction defect claim against a builder is no longer subject to the economic loss doctrine italics added,and further acknowledges that a defendant may seek apportionment of the loss on any theory available to the plaintiff upon which plaintiff would have been successful however,midtec contends that greystone equitable indemnity claim is barred because a product manufacturer is liable to a homeowner for an unmet standard only if there is resultant damage to persons or property italics added.midtec thus claims that it is not obligated to homeowners for economic losses under the act,and that there is therefore no predicate tort upon which greystone,as an indemnitee,may base its equitable indemnity claim.
in determining whether the economic loss rule precludes greystone,as an indemnitee,from recovering economic losses in an indemnity action against midtec,as an indemnitor,we first must address whether the economic loss rule would preclude a homeowner from collecting such damages in an action against midtec,since greystone ability to pursue an indemnity action against midtec under the act is contingent on midtec and greystone sharing a joint legal obligation to the homeowners for economic losses caused by a violation of the act standards.see fieldstone briggs plumbing products,th,d fieldstone applying common law as it existed prior to the enactment of the right to repair act,and concluding that product manufacturers could not be liable to builder for economic losses pursuant to equitable indemnity claim,because manufacturers were not liable to homeowners for economic losses.
section provides that individual product manufacturers shall be liable to homeowners for violations of the act standards to the extent set forth in chapter of the act.section,which is contained within chapter,provides that each and every provision of the other chapters of the act apply to product manufacturers to the extent that the manufacturer caused,in whole or in part,a violation of the act standards as the result of negligence or a breach of contract.among those provisions that apply to individual product manufacturers are sections and,which abrogate the economic loss rule and allow a homeowner who prevails on a claim for a violation of the act standards to recover the costs of repairing the violation.thus,pursuant to the act,a homeowner may recover economic losses from a product manufacturer for a violation of the act standards that is caused by the manufacturer negligence or breach of contract 
midtec arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.at the outset,we reject midtec suggestion,made at various points in its brief,that there are no provisions of the act that attach new statutory liability to product manufacturers.midtec argues,for example,nothing in this section section is directed at product manufacturers.midtec similarly contends,nowhere in the language or the legislative history do we find any purpose other than providing a process for homeowners to obtain easier redress from builders for faulty construction italics added.contrary to midtec assertions,sections and make it clear that product manufacturers face statutory liability for a violation of the act standards 
midtec claims that the primary difference in treatment between builders and other entities in the scope of liability under section is that while other entities may be sued under the act for negligence or breach of contract causing a violation of the standards,common law defenses,such as the economic loss doctrine,are preserved for entities.italics added.midtec bases this argument on the italicized portion of section.
each and every provision of the other chapters of this title apply to individual product manufacturers to the extent that the individual product manufacturers caused,in whole or in part,a violation of a particular standard as the result of a negligent act or omission or a breach of contract.in addition to the affirmative defenses set forth in section,a n individual product manufacturer may also offer common law and contractual defenses as applicable to any claimed violation of a standard.italics added.
we do not find this argument to be persuasive.most importantly,the economic loss rule is not a defense to a cause of action.rather,the existence of damages,other than purely economic loss,is an element of a plaintiff common law cause of action.rosen state farm general ins.cal th,d,under the economic loss rule,appreciable,nonspeculative,present injury is an essential element of a tort cause of action,italics added,quoting aas,supra,cal th at,d,see also aas,supra,cal th at,d,construction defects that have not ripened into property damage,or at least into involuntary losses,do not comfortably fit the definition of appreciable harm an essential element of a negligence claim,italics added.
the necessity that a plaintiff present proof of the existence of damages other than purely economic loss arises from the fact that,rather than being a defense to a tort claim,the economic loss rule provides that entities generally have no duty to prevent purely economic loss to a potential plaintiff.see ott agri,th,d ott.under the common law,it is only where a special relationship exists,giving rise to such a duty,supra,cal d at,that a plaintiff may recover purely economic loss.see aas,supra,cal th at,d,noting that relied on prior case law establishing a test for identifying such a duty accord the ratcliff architects vanir construction management,th,d the ratcliff architects recognition of a duty to manage business affairs so as to prevent purely economic loss to third parties in their financial transactions is the exception,not the rule,in negligence law.
while there is generally no duty to prevent economic loss to third parties in negligence actions at common law the ratcliff architects,supra,th at,d,the right to repair act creates such a duty.the ratcliff architects,supra,th at,d a duty of care may arise through statute,contract,the general character of the activity,or the relationship between the parties,italics added.midtec contends that t he economic loss doctrine is a common law defense to negligence and strict liability claims italics added,and thus,that the provision in section that an individual product manufacturer may offer common law defenses as applicable to any claimed violation of a standard allows midtec to assert the economic loss doctrine as a defense to a claim under the act.however,midtec provides no authority for this assertion,and the contention is contrary to the aas court characterization of the economic loss rule as being an element of a plaintiff cause of action.
even assuming for the sake of argument that the economic loss rule could be characterized as a defense,section expressly provides that an individual product manufacturer may assert only those common law defenses that are applicable to a claim for a violation of the act standards.given that a primary purpose of the act is to abrogate the economic loss rule for a violation of the act standards,and that the first sentence of section states that the provision of the act that abrogates the economic loss rule applies to individual product manufacturers,it would be unreasonable to conclude that the legislature intended,through the second sentence of section,to allow product manufacturers to assert the economic loss rule as a defense to such a claim.both the fact that section does not expressly refer to the economic loss rule,and that midtec can point to nothing in the legislative history that suggests that the legislature intended to preserve the applicability of the rule to entities whose liability under the act is premised on section,provide further support for this conclusion.
a more reasonable interpretation of section follows from the fact that,while under sections and a builder is strictly liable for any violation of the act standards pursuant to the first sentence of section,a product manufacturer is liable only where its negligent act or omission or a breach of contract italics added,caused a violation of the act standards the reference to common law and contractual defenses,in the second sentence of section parallels the scope of duty articulated in the first sentence of the section.thus,for example,in a suit premised on a manufacturer negligent act or omission,the manufacturer may assert traditional common law defenses to negligence actions,such as comparative negligence and primary assumption of risk,to the extent that such defenses are applicable to the plaintiff claim.this interpretation of section is consistent with the act abrogation of the economic loss rule,its reference to common law defenses,and the textual structure of section.we therefore reject midtec argument that an individual product manufacturer may assert the economic loss rule as a common law defense to an action against it under the act.
in addition to rejecting midtec textual arguments,we also reject midtec claim that various public policy rationales require that we interpret the act to preclude homeowners from recovering economic losses in tort actions against product manufacturers.midtec argues that that if this court were to hold that a product manufacturer may be liable for economic losses caused by a defective product,this would eviscerate the line of demarcation between tort and contract law,and would cause there to be no end to litigation,as various component manufacturers would be drawn into construction defect litigation.
the legislature choices in this area are entitled to heightened deference,as the aas court itself recognized 
in our view,the many considerations of social policy this case implicates,rather than justifying the imposition of liability for construction defects that have not caused harm of the sort traditionally compensable in tort citation,serve instead to emphasize that certain choices are better left to the legislature.that body has at its disposal a wider range of options and superior access to information about the social costs and benefits of each.legislatures,in making such policy decisions,have the ability to gather empirical evidence,solicit the advice of experts,and hold hearings at which all interested parties may present evidence and express their views citations.aas,supra,cal th at,d.
we conclude that the right to repair act abrogates the economic loss rule in actions brought by homeowners against individual product manufacturers for a violation of the act standards based upon the manufacturer negligence or breach of contract.
a builder may bring an equitable indemnity action against a product manufacturer under the act,seeking reimbursement for a homeowner economic losses caused by the manufacturer negligence or breach of contract 
the trial court concluded that greystone is not a homeowner or homeowner association,and as a result is not entitled to pursue the statutorily created cause of action.midtec echoes this conclusion in its brief,noting that a builder is not a claimant authorized to bring an action under the act,subd.f,and arguing that greystone is not among those entities that the act is intended to protect.midtec contends,inasmuch as the purpose of the statute was to address the concern over homeowner claims,not commercial transactions,the language of the pertinent statutes must be read in the context of a homeowner claim against a builder.
if the question were whether greystone could bring a direct action on its own behalf under the act see part,post,these contentions would be well taken.however,they are inapposite in determining whether greystone may bring a derivative equitable indemnity action a derivative equitable indemnity action is based on an indemnitee joint legal obligation with an indemnitor to a third party,not the indemnitor direct liability to the indemnitee.see western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital cal th,d,describing derivative nature of action for equitable indemnity accord gem developers,supra,d at.indemnitee may seek apportionment of loss to indemnitor upon any theory that injured third party could have successfully prevailed upon in action against indemnitor.
this court rejected an argument similar to the one midtec advances in gem developers.in that case,an indemnitor hallcraft claimed that the indemnitee gem could not pursue its equitable indemnification strict liability claim on behalf of a homeowners association because the indemnitee would not have been able to pursue a strict liability claim in a direct action against the indemnitor.gem developers,supra,d at.this court rejected the indemnitor claim,reasoning that the indemnitee claim was not premised on the indemnitor underlying liability to the indemnitee,but rather,on the indemnitor liability to an injured third party,a homeowners association.
hallcraft sees gem action for equitable indemnification as being nothing more than a claim by one business against another business for a business loss,a loss which differs from that suffered by a consumer to which strict liability may apply.this reasoning ignores the origin of the loss.gem claim for equitable indemnification derives from the association loss and award of damages.whether a defendant is held directly liable to the for the plaintiff loss or is held indirectly liable through a complaint for equitable indemnity,it is the same loss that is being loss suffered by the.ibid.
the same reasoning applies here.greystone derivative equitable indemnity claim is premised on the homeowners losses.thus,the fact that greystone could not prevail on a direct cause of action against midtec see part,post does not defeat greystone equitable indemnity claim.
there is nothing in the act that suggests that the legislature intended to preclude indemnity claims under the act.in fact,the act expressly contemplates indemnity actions,and also the possibility that an indemnitee will bring,a separate complaint for equitable indemnification gem developers,supra,d at,as has long been available under california common law.see establishing distinct statutes of limitation for an action for indemnity and for a for indemnity.the conclusion that a defendant builder may bring such an indemnity action is further strengthened by the legislature recognition throughout the act that a homeowner loss may be caused by the actions of a number of different entities.see,subd.e i f a builder intends to hold an individual product manufacturer responsible for its contribution to the unmet standard,providing for liability where a product manufacturer caused,in whole or in part,a violation of a particular standard,and stating,nothing in this title modifies the law pertaining to joint and several liability for builders,general contractors,subcontractors,material suppliers,individual product manufacturer,and design professionals that contribute to any specific violation of this title.
there is no language in the act that would support midtec assertion that greystone may assert only an express contractual indemnity claim,as opposed to an equitable indemnity claim.midtec appears to acknowledge that the act statute of limitations provision contemplates the possibility of equitable indemnification actions in referring broadly to an action for indemnity.however,midtec offers a narrow interpretation of section,arguing that a builder may be entitled to implied indemnity,only where a builder has a special relationship with another entity.not only is there nothing in section that would support such a limitation,but the claim is groundless on its face.where a builder has a special relationship with an entity as described in,the builder may pursue a direct action against that entity,and would not be limited to bringing a derivative action for implied equitable indemnification.see part,post.
finally,midtec claims that the fact that a builder is in a better position than a homeowner to protect itself from economic loss via contract and warranty law supports an interpretation of the act that would preclude greystone from bringing an indemnity claim against a product manufacturer.this argument has little persuasive force in view of the fact that a builder equitable indemnity claim is,as discussed above,wholly derivative,and is based on the homeowners losses.in any event,as with midtec other policy arguments,this argument is better addressed to the legislature,not the courts.as the act now stands,not only does it not preclude indemnity actions,but it expressly contemplates such claims.see,subd.e.
c.this court may not affirm the judgment on alternative grounds 
on appeal,we are concerned with the validity of the summary judgment ruling,not its reasoning.united services automobile baggett d.accordingly,we address whether this court may affirm the trial court summary judgment in favor of midtec on alternative grounds.
the standards in section are not limited to claims based on the faulty installation of plumbing products 
midtec claims that the standards for plumbing systems outlined in section refer only to the installation of plumbing products.midtec further argues 
as is evident by the language of section,the focus of liability is directed to the builder as the with ultimate liability for the proper design and installation of a plumbing system.nothing in this section is directed at product manufacturers.
midtec arguments are contrary to the plain text of the act.included among the standards that are set forth in section are the following 
the lines and components of the plumbing system,sewer system,and utility systems shall not leak,subd.a.
plumbing lines,sewer lines,and utility lines shall not corrode so as to impede the useful life of the systems,subd.a.
plumbing and sewer systems shall not materially impair the use of the structure by its inhabitants,subd.e.
thus,the standards identified in section,subdivisions a,and e do not,as midtec contends,refer only to the installation of plumbing products.
midtec has not established that there is no triable issue of material fact as to whether it caused a violation of the standards set forth in section 
we requested that the parties submit supplemental briefs addressing whether this court may affirm the judgment on the ground that greystone is precluded from recovering damages for the replacement of fittings that had not yet failed,because such fittings did not,as a matter of law,violate the standards in section.having reviewed the parties supplemental briefs,we conclude that we may not affirm the judgment on this alternative ground.
midtec motion for summary was premised solely on its contention that the economic loss rule precludes greystone action.thus,in opposing the motion,greystone was not called upon,nor required,to present evidence regarding the degree to which fittings were defective,and whether such defects present a material issue of fact with respect to whether midtec violated one or more of the section standards.see code civ.proc,subd.p defining burdens of production with respect to summary judgment motions.in its supplemental briefing,greystone maintains that this court may not affirm the judgment on this alternative ground because greystone would provide more evidence if the factual issue was ever properly put before a trier of fact or the court.
we agree with greystone that in view of the undeveloped factual record on this issue,it would not be appropriate for this court to affirm the judgment on this alternative ground.deveny entropin,th,d although we may affirm a ruling on a ground not adopted by the trial court,we decline to do so when,as in the present case,the alternative ground presents fact issues that the opposing party and trial court did not have an opportunity to address accord code civ.proc,subd.m specifying procedures by which a reviewing court may affirm a summary judgment on an alternative ground and noting that party opposing affirmance may argue that additional evidence relating to that ground exists,but that the party has not had an adequate opportunity to present the evidence or to conduct discovery on the issue.
section,subdivision g e 
midtec also claims that the act specifically excludes from the entire title product liability claims that are based solely on a claim of a defective product,and maintains that greystone claim against midtec constitutes such a claim.midtec notes that section,subdivision g e states this title does not apply in any action seeking recovery solely for a defect in a manufactured product located within or adjacent to a structure.in connection with this issue,midtec requests that this court take judicial notice of a letter drafted by john burton,the author of senate bill,regarding section,subdivision g e,that was printed in the august,edition of the senate daily journal.the letter states as follows 
the honorable gregory schmidt chief executive officer 
there has been a request for clarification of section g e of sb.under that section,if a homeowner brings a claim solely for a defect in a manufactured product and the homeowner includes the builder in the claim,the right to repair provisions apply to the claim against the builder.otherwise,the statute does not apply in any action seeking recovery solely for a defect in a manufactured product located within or adjacent to a structure.
peace and friendship,

a as greystone equitable indemnity a defect in a manufactured product constitutes a violation of the standards established in section is not an action seeking recovery solely for a defect in a manufactured product,subd.g e,italics added compare with to the extent that a function or component of a structure is not addressed by these standards,it shall be actionable if it causes damage.we conclude that section,subdivision g e is intended to bar actions in which the claimant seeks to recover for a defect in a product that does not violate one of the standards set forth in section.thus,the plain meaning of the act defeats midtec argument that section,subdivision g e precludes greystone action.
notwithstanding our conclusion that the plain meaning of section,subdivision g e governs,we grant midtec unopposed request that we take judicial notice of the burton letter.see avila citrus community college dist.cal th,d,in the absence of an unambiguous plain meaning,we must look to extrinsic sources such as legislative history to determine the statute meaning.assuming for the sake of argument that senator burton letter is entitled to interpretative weight see people bautista th,d intention of the bill author is not necessarily indicative of the intention of the legislature as a whole in passing the bill,the letter provides no support for midtec argument.in his letter,senator burton tracks the language of section,subdivision g e in stating that the act does not apply to actions solely involving a manufactured product in or near a structure.senator burton does suggest in the letter that the right to repair provisions of the act might apply to an action solely for a defect in a manufactured product if the homeowner included a builder in its claim.however,this statement does not support midtec claim that section,subdivision g e broadly precludes all claims based on an alleged defect in a manufactured product.we therefore conclude that section,subdivision g e does not preclude the application of the act to greystone claims.
sections,and,subdivision b 
as noted previously see part,ante,in the trial court,midtec moved for summary judgment on only one the economic loss rule bars greystone claims.the trial granted midtec motion on this ground,concluding that greystone may not pursue a statutorily created cause of action,and that the economic loss rule bars greystone common law claims.however,the trial court also stated in its order,greystone provides no evidence demonstrating its compliance with the procedural prerequisites of,a notice and opportunity to repair,subd.b.
on appeal,greystone claims that this court may not affirm the trial court order granting summary judgment on this alternative ground.greystone correctly notes that the parties did not brief in the trial court whether greystone,as a builder,was legally required to comply with the act prelitigation requirements.further,even assuming for the sake of argument that these provisions do apply to this action,because neither the parties nor the trial court raised this issue prior to the trial court ruling,greystone was not required to present any evidence on the issue in opposing midtec motion for summary judgment.code civ.proc,subd.p.
midtec concedes on appeal that the trial court statement concerning the lack of evidence of greystone compliance with the procedural prerequisites of the act,did not have any effect on the basis for the ruling,and asserts that the court comment was irrelevant to the basis for its ruling.further,midtec does not contend that this court may affirm the court judgment on this alternative ground.
accordingly,we conclude that we may not affirm the judgment on the ground that greystone failed to comply with the act procedural prerequisites,as stated by the trial court.
section,subdivision e 
section,subdivision e provides in relevant part 
if a builder intends to hold a n individual product manufacturer,or material supplier,including an insurance carrier,warranty company,or service company,responsible for its contribution to the unmet standard,the builder shall provide notice to that person or entity sufficiently in advance to allow them to attend the initial,or if requested,second inspection of any alleged unmet standard and to participate in the repair process.
in its respondent brief,midtec acknowledges,whether or not greystone complied with th e mandatory provision in section,subdivision e is irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal because the summary judgment motion was based on the application of the economic loss doctrine,not the application of the notice provision.
having received and considered supplemental briefing from the parties regarding the effect of section,subdivision e,if any,on the proper disposition of this case,we agree with midtec implicit concession in its respondent brief that we may not affirm the summary judgment on any ground related to this provision,in light of the fact that midtec motion for summary judgment was based solely on the applicability of the economic loss rule to greystone action.see deveny entropin,supra,th at,d code civ,subd.m.
proceedings on remand 
in view of our conclusion that the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of midtec on greystone indemnity cause of action,we must remand the matter to the trial court.see wall street network,new york times th,d a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail,italics added.
in its motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication,midtec stated,if,for any reason,this court believes that it can not grant summary judgment,midtec respectfully requests that this court grant summary adjudication as to each of greystone causes of action against midtec because the trial court granted midtec motion for summary judgment,it did not rule on midtec alternative motion for summary adjudication.on remand,the trial court must rule on midtec alternative motion for summary adjudication.
we express no view on the merits of greystone procedural objection to midtec motion for summary adjudication,or on the propriety of granting summary adjudication on greystone declaratory relief action 
in its opposition to midtec alternative motion for summary adjudication,greystone argued that midtec alternative motion is procedurally defective because it does not comply with former california rules of court,rule b current cal.rules of court,rule b,in that midtec has not provided a separate statement of undisputed facts pertaining to each of greystone causes of action.in light of its ruling granting summary judgment,the trial court did not rule on this claim.neither party has addressed this issue on appeal.for these reasons,we express no opinion on its merits.
the trial court also did not rule on midtec alternative motion for summary adjudication as it pertains to greystone declaratory relief claim.neither party has raised any arguments as to this claim,and we therefore express no opinion as to the merits of this claim,either.
on remand,we direct the trial court to address these issues in ruling on midtec motion for summary adjudication.
to the extent that the trial court determines that it may consider midtec motion for summary adjudication of greystone negligence claim,midtec is entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
greystone claims on appeal that the trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of midtec on greystone negligence claim.to the extent that the trial court rejects greystone argument that the court must deny midtec alternative motion for summary adjudication as procedurally improper see part,ante,we conclude that the trial court must grant summary adjudication in midtec favor on greystone negligence claim 
greystone argues that it may pursue its negligence claim against midtec,without regard to the economic loss rule,under two separate theories.greystone first contends that midtec negligent violation of the standards contained in the right to repair act constitutes negligence per se,and that greystone may recover its economic losses caused by such negligence by way of a direct claim for negligence.greystone also argues that,in the wake of the enactment of the right to repair act,it may now pursue a negligence cause of action in which it may recover economic losses,pursuant to the special relationship theory of negligence liability provided in,supra,cal d.we reject both arguments.
greystone may not pursue a claim of negligence per se against midtec 
the doctrine of negligence per se is based on the rule that a presumption of negligence arises from the violation of a statute which was enacted to protect a class of persons of which the plaintiff is a member against the type of harm that the plaintiff suffered as a result of the violation.quiroz seventh center th,d quiroz.therefore,a party who seeks to prevail on a cause of action premised on the negligence per se doctrine must establish,among other elements,that the party is one of the class of persons for whose protection the statute,ordinance,or regulation was adopted.ibid.the court determines this element as a matter of law.ibid.
as noted previously see fns,ante,section,subdivision f provides,claimant or homeowner includes the individual owners of homes,individual unit owners of attached dwellings and,in the case of a common interest development,any association as defined in subdivision a of section.section establishes a cause of action in which such claimants may allege a violation of the act standards.
throughout the right to repair act,there are references to the action that a claimant or a homeowner may bring for a violation of the standards adopted therein.see,prior to filing an action against any party alleged to have contributed to a violation of the standards set forth in chapter commencing with section,the claimant shall initiate the following prelitigation procedures italics added if the builder fails to make an offer to repair or otherwise strictly comply with this chapter within the times specified,the claimant is released from the requirements of this chapter and may proceed with the filing of an action italics added in order to make a claim for violation of the standards set forth in chapter commencing with section,a homeowner need only demonstrate,in accordance with the applicable evidentiary standard,that the home does not meet the applicable standard,subject to the affirmative defenses set forth in section italics added if a claim for damages is made under this title,the homeowner is only entitled to damages for listing types of damages italics added.
in contrast,there is not a single instance in which the right to repair act refers to a direct action brought by a builder against an entity of any kind.there is nothing in the language of the right to repair act that suggests that the act was intended to protect the class of persons of which greystone is a member against the type of harm that greystone suffered as a result of midtec alleged violation.see quiroz,supra,th at,d.
greystone argues that the provisions within the right to repair act that specify certain prelitigation procedures that a claimant must follow prior to bringing an action,and the law reference to indemnity actions,indicate that builders are among those the law meant to be protected.we disagree.as to the prelitigation requirements,the fact that the legislature provided a set of procedures that a claimant must follow before suing a builder as a defendant does not indicate that the legislature intended for the act to protect builders as a plaintiff against harms done to it by other entities mentioned in the act.as to the act reference to an indemnity action,whether a builder may bring an indemnity action in which it asserts the rights of third party homeowners is entirely distinct from the question whether the law was intended to protect builders as plaintiffs asserting a direct cause of action.regan roofing superior court th,d the direct action for negligence and the derivative action for indemnity constitute wholly independent rights.therefore,the fact that section refers to an indemnity action in which a builder may be able to assert the rights of homeowners,does not demonstrate that the legislature intended to protect builders as plaintiffs asserting their own rights.
citing two legislative committee reports for senate bill,greystone argues that the act was meant to protect both homeowners and builders,establishing builder position within the class meant to be protected.however,greystone fails to identify any specific language in either report,and we have found none,that supports this claim.specifically,statements in the reports such as,a mong other things,the bill seeks to respond to concerns expressed by builders and insurers over the costs associated with construction defect litigation com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,and t his bill,the consensus product resulting from nearly a year of intense negotiations among the interested parties assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended,do not demonstrate that a builder may bring a negligence claim against a product manufacturer premised on the negligence per se doctrine for a violation of the right to repair act.
we conclude that greystone may not recover its economic losses from midtec in a negligence cause of action that is premised on the negligence per se doctrine 
greystone may not pursue a negligence action against midtec based on the special relationship theory of liability provided in,supra,cal d 
greystone argues that in the wake of the enactment of the right to repair act,it shared a special relationship with midtec as defined in,supra,cal d at page,sufficient to allow it to recover economic losses caused by midtec alleged negligence.where such a relationship exists,there exists a duty on the part of the defendant to use due care to avoid economic injury to the plaintiff.ott,supra,th at,d.whether such a special relationship and duty of care exists presents a question of law for the court.id.at,fn,d.
in,the supreme court set forth a limited exception to the general rule that economic loss alone is insufficient to state a negligence cause of action zamora shell oil th,d zamora.the court considered whether a contractor who undertakes construction work pursuant to a contract with the owner of premises may be held liable in tort for business losses suffered by a lessee when the contractor negligently fails to complete the project with due diligence,supra,cal d at.in answering this question in the affirmative,the court observed that the court prior cases had established that,where a special relationship exists between the parties,a plaintiff may recover for loss of expected economic advantage through the negligent performance of a contract although the parties were not in contractual privity.id.at.determining whether such a relationship exists involves an examination of the following criteria 
the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct and the policy of preventing future harm.citation.id.at.
in considering the first two criteria,the court stressed that the close relationship between the parties made it highly foreseeable that the contractor negligence would harm the tenant 
the contract entered into between contractor and the owner was for the renovation of the premises in which lessee maintained its business.the contract could not have been performed without impinging on that business.thus contractor performance was intended to,and did,directly affect lessee.accordingly,it was clearly foreseeable that any significant delay in completing the construction would adversely affect lessee business beyond the normal disruption associated with such construction.lessee alleges this fact was repeatedly drawn to contractor attention,supra,cal d at.
in fieldstone,supra,th at pages,d,this court applied in concluding that neither fieldstone,a home builder,nor a group of homeowners,shared a special relationship with the manufacturers of sinks that fieldstone installed in the homes that would support tort liability for economic damages.the fieldstone court reasoned 
fieldstone analysis fails because the evidence does not suggest the transactions in question were intended to affect fieldstone or the homeowners in any way particular to them,as opposed to all potential purchasers of the equipment.the absence of this foundation precludes a finding of special relationship as required by to the extent the product was intended to affect fieldstone or the homeowners in the same way as all retail buyers,this becomes a traditional products liability or negligence case in which economic damages are not available.citation.ott,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.we need not consider the remaining parts of the test.even if they weighed in favor of finding a duty of care,we would still conclude that no duty existed.if a duty of care to avoid economic injury existed in the circumstances of the present case,every manufacturer would become an insurer,potentially forever,against economic loss from negligent defects in a product used for its intended purpose.neither requires nor supports such a radical departure from traditional notions of liability.ott,supra,th at,d.
similarly,in zamora,supra,th at pages,d,this court applied and concluded that a manufacturer of resin used in the plumbing systems of homes did not have a special relationship with homeowners sufficient to support a negligence cause of action for economic losses.the zamora court reasoned,shell manufacture of pb resin did not involve a transaction specifically intended to affect the particular needs of any of the homeowners zamora,supra,th at,d accord ott,supra,th at,d defendants,manufacturers of automated cow milking machines,did not have special relationship under with dairy owners who purchased milking machine where there was no evidence defendants took action intended to affect plaintiffs,nor that defendants reasonably could foresee any economic injury from malfunctioning equipment above that which any dairy would suffer if its milking system were substandard see generally platte anchor bolt,ihi,d,reviewing cases and concluding california courts have been able to prevent the expansion of manufacturer liability for economic injuries suffered by a retail buyer at large,while at the same time allowing a particular party of whom the manufacturer had specific knowledge to go forward with a negligence action.
although greystone essentially acknowledges that its claim fails under fieldstone,it contends that the right to repair act alters the analysis,arguing 
in fieldstone,the first factor defeated the test because products manufactured for use in building homes by builders and homeowners were not somehow marked out as different from any other purchases.citation.section remedies this problem.similarly,the relationships between homeowners,builders,and the builders suppliers are at the heart of the right to repair act and all
