in this truck accident case the trial court excluded expert testimony as to what caused a fire that burned the truck and the driver.after excluding the expert testimony because it was not reliable,the trial court granted summary judgment.the court of appeals reversed.we hold that the trial court did not err,reverse the court of appeals judgment,and render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing.
background 
on october,abram tamez was operating a mack truck tractor hauling a trailer of crude oil.tamez was rounding a curve in the road when the tractor and trailer overturned.a fire erupted and burned the trailer,its cargo,and the tractor.tamez was able to climb out of the tractor,but he was badly burned and died as a result of his injuries.
as a result of tamez death,suit was filed against the tractor manufacturer,mack trucks,and others the tamezes alleged that mack defectively designed,manufactured and marketed the tractor.they claimed that mack was liable for negligence,gross negligence,strict products liability,breach of warranty,and misrepresentation.all five theories were based on the same complaint diesel fuel from the truck fuel system originated the fire that burned abram tamez.specifically,the tamezes alleged that the tractor had design and manufacturing defects because the fuel system was unreasonably prone to fail and release diesel fuel in an environment conducive to ignition and fire and the tractor had ignition sources such as hot manifolds and electric batteries in areas likely to contain released flammable fluids.the tamezes also alleged that mack failed to provide warnings about the defects.
in connection with its claims against mack,the tamezes identified ronald elwell as an expert on,fires.mack moved to exclude his testimony as unreliable and moved for summary judgment.mack asserted multiple grounds for seeking summary judgment.some grounds for its motion were directed at particular plaintiffs,while some grounds were directed at all the tamezes.one part of mack motion directed at all the tamezes was a rule i motion urging that the tamezes could present no evidence that any alleged defects caused the fire.the tamezes responded to the part of mack motion,in part,by filing elwell deposition and his expert report.they also later submitted elwell testimony from a bill of exceptions.
pretrial matters,including a robinson hearing pursuant to mack motion to exclude elwell testimony,were scheduled and heard.during the robinson hearing elwell testified.he expressed the opinion that the fire was started by the tractor battery,which was located too near the fuel tanks,igniting the tractor diesel fuel,which in turn ignited the trailer cargo of crude oil.
the trial court granted mack motion to exclude elwell testimony as to causation.the tamezes later moved the trial court to reconsider its decision.the court denied the motion but allowed the tamezes to have elwell testify again to create a bill of exceptions the court signed an order excluding the causation portion of elwell testimony from being considered as evidence at any trial or hearing because it was not sufficiently reliable.mack motion for summary judgment was granted.
the court of appeals reversed the summary judgment,concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding elwell causation testimony and also concluding that elwell testimony provided some evidence of causation.the court of appeals opinion indicates that in reaching its decision it considered elwell testimony from both the robinson hearing and the bill of exceptions.see.
mack urges that the trial court correctly excluded elwell testimony on causation,did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider that ruling,and properly granted summary judgment because the tamezes presented no evidence of causation.mack asserts,among other matters,that the court of appeals erred by considering elwell causation testimony from both the robinson hearing and the bill of exceptions reversing the trial court ruling as to admissibility of elwell causation testimony and reversing the summary judgment.
we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding elwell testimony on causation and that the court of appeals erred in considering testimony from the bill of exceptions in evaluating the trial court exclusion of elwell causation testimony.we further conclude that the tamezes presented no summary judgment evidence of causation and summary judgment was properly granted.
ii.elwell bill of exceptions testimony 
mack argues that the court of appeals erred by considering testimony admitted only for the bill when it reviewed the trial court exclusion of elwell causation testimony.the tamezes claim that whether elwell bill of exceptions testimony is considered is not relevant because his bill testimony added nothing to his robinson hearing testimony.further,in their brief and at oral argument the tamezes disclaim having urged in the court of appeals that the trial court erred in holding a robinson hearing,the manner in which the hearing was conducted,the timing of the hearing,or denying their motion for reconsideration.our review of their briefs in the court of appeals confirms the tamezes position.they do not contend here either that the bill of exceptions testimony was improperly excluded or that the trial court erred in denying their motion to reconsider.
the purpose of a bill of exceptions is to allow a party to make a record for appellate review of matters that do not otherwise appear in the record,such as evidence that was excluded.app.evid.a see also in re ford motor.the court of appeals opinion indicates that it considered elwell bill of exceptions testimony in evaluating the admissibility of his opinions even though the trial court did not.see at.as one example,the court of appeals referenced elwell opinion that at least one of the tractor side fuel tanks became displaced during the rollover and separated the balance line connecting the two fuel tanks.id.at.the court pointed to elwell testimony interpreting photographic evidence of steel straps which held the tanks as support for his opinion.id.the referenced testimony as to elwell opinion and interpretation of photographic evidence was given as part of his bill of exceptions testimony,but he did not give similar testimony during the robinson hearing.
except for fundamental error,appellate courts are not authorized to consider issues not properly raised by the parties.see in the interest of.we have described fundamental error as those instances in which error directly and adversely affects the interest of the public generally,as that interest is declared by the statutes or constitution of our state,or instances in which the record affirmatively and conclusively shows that the court rendering the judgment was without jurisdiction of the subject matter.see mccauley consol.underwriters.the court of appeals did not classify the trial court refusal to allow the tamezes to present further evidence and to then reconsider its ruling to exclude elwell causation testimony as fundamental error,and neither do we.the court of appeals erred in considering elwell causation testimony from the bill of exceptions without having first determined,pursuant to properly assigned error,that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the testimony and reconsider its decision to exclude elwell causation opinions.under the record and issues presented to us,we may not consider elwell testimony from the bill of exceptions in determining whether the trial court erred in excluding elwell causation testimony.see exito elecs.trejo.
iii.reliability of elwell testimony 
standard of review 
an expert witness may testify regarding scientific,technical,or other specialized matters if the expert is qualified and if the expert opinion is relevant and based on a reliable foundation.evid.helena chem.wilkins,robinson,at.in determining whether expert testimony is reliable,a court should examine the principles,research,and methodology underlying an expert conclusions.exxon pipeline zwahr.when the testimony involves scientific knowledge,the expert conclusions must be grounded in the methods and procedures of science.robinson,at quoting daubert merrell dow,d.otherwise,the testimony is no more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.id.quoting daubert,at.we have identified several factors that trial courts should consider when determining the reliability of expert testimony involving scientific knowledge we recognize that these factors may not apply when testimony is not scientific,but,rather,involves technical or other specialized knowledge.gammill jack williams chevrolet.even then,however,there must be some basis for the opinion to show its reliability.id.an expert bare opinion will not suffice.merrell dow,havner.and,there can not be too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.gammill,at quoting joiner,d.
a trial court has broad discretion in determining whether expert testimony is admissible.zwahr,at.its ruling will be reversed only if that discretion is abused.honeycutt.because the party sponsoring the expert bears the burden of showing that the expert testimony is admissible,the burden of presenting understandable evidence that will persuade the trial court is on the presenting party.see robinson,at.when an expert processes or methodologies are obscured or concealed by testimony that is excessively internally contradictory,or evasive,a trial court will not have abused its discretion in determining that the expert testimony is not admissible.see gmc iracheta.
reliability factors 
the court of appeals noted that elwell testimony largely applied his knowledge,training,and experience to the underlying data and that his methodology was not easily tested by objective criteria such as identifiable scientific formulas.the court of appeals concluded that under such circumstances the reliability of elwell opinion is not properly measured by a analysis,but that the analytical gap test should be applied.at.
mack argues that the court of appeals analysis is flawed.mack urges that elwell inability to demonstrate at least one of the robinson factors,coupled with his inability to eliminate the crude oil tanker as the source of the fire,rendered elwell testimony unreliable.the tamezes,on the other hand,argue that because elwell testimony was based on his training and experience,and not science,application of the analytical gap test,as opposed to use of robinson factors,was appropriate.they contend that elwell opinion was reliable because there were no analytical gaps in his testimony.see gammill,at.
in gammill we clarified that the list of factors listed in robinson may not be applicable when assessing certain kinds of expert testimony.at.we held that robinson factors did not apply to the mechanical engineer expert under consideration in gammill,even though his claimed expertise was scientific in nature.id.at.in so holding,however,we did not mean to imply that a trial court should never consider the robinson factors when evaluating the reliability of expert testimony that is based on knowledge,training or experience,or that the factors can only be applied when evaluating scientific expert testimony.we recognized that the criteria for assessing reliability must vary depending on the nature of the evidence.id.at.
the united states supreme court has noted that it is not possible to rule out,nor rule in,for all cases and for all time the applicability of the factors mentioned in daubert.kumho tire carmichael,d.nor can the court now do so for subsets of cases categorized by category of expert or by kind of evidence,as t oo much depends upon the particular circumstances of the particular case at issue.id.in robinson we likewise explained that the factors mentioned do not constitute an exclusive list and that the trial court gatekeeping inquiry will differ with each particular case depending on the t he factors a trial court will find helpful in determining whether the underlying theories and techniques are scientifically reliable.robinson,at.thus,a trial court should consider the factors mentioned in robinson when doing so will be helpful in determining reliability of an expert testimony,regardless of whether the testimony is scientific in nature or.see kumho tire,at.gammill,at.
in determining reliability,the trial court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies,the method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts,and how the expert applies the facts and methods to the case at hand.see amorgianos amtrak,cir.a significant part of the trial court gatekeeper function is to evaluate the expert qualifications,listen to the testimony,view the evidence,and determine which factors and evaluation methodology are most appropriate to apply.for example,in the present case the trial court would have been within its discretion to measure the reliability of elwell testimony,at least in part,by considering the extent to which elwell theory had been or could be tested the extent to which his methodology relied upon his subjective interpretation the methodology potential rate of error whether the underlying theory or methodology has been generally accepted as valid by the accident reconstruction and fire investigation community and the uses that have been made of his methodology.these are similar to factors,and of those enumerated in robinson.but,as we have said above,that is not to imply that the trial court was precluded from measuring elwell methodology by gammill analytical gap analysis.
elwell causation testimony 
at the robinson hearing,elwell testified that the fuel and battery system on the tractor were designed improperly,and suggested safer designs.he criticized the placement of the fuel tanks and also of the batteries proximity to the fuel tanks.he criticized certain parts of the fuel system such as the crossover or balance line hose between the two fuel tanks and the spigots by which the hose was attached to each of the tanks.he referenced a particular report,which was not introduced,which he asserted supported his design critiques and his suggested safer designs.
elwell analysis and conclusion that the fire began with the fuel system and the battery system were based on the fire triangle theory.he explained that under the fire triangle theory,a fire such as the one under consideration must be analyzed with an eye toward the ignition,fuel,and oxygen sources that were available.because the air provided oxygen,his analysis centered on the other parts required to complete the triangle,the source of fluids that could be ignited and what would it take to ignite those fluids and fuel,of course,is the primary suspect,either fuel or crude oil in this particular case.
he did not testify that he inspected the remnants of the burned tractor and trailer or that he performed or reviewed any accident reconstruction analysis as to how the rollover occurred and how different parts of the vehicle would have been affected or harmed thereby.his robinson hearing testimony did not identify a particular alleged defect of the tractor fuel system that he concluded was the source of a diesel fuel leak that initiated the fire.
on he testified that he had read and relied on over studies on the subject of the causes of fires.he did not specify any studies that supported his conclusion as to the specifics involved in the accident,and none were offered as evidence for the trial court to consider in evaluating his testimony.
in coming to his conclusion that the fire began with the fuel system and battery system of the tractor,elwell asserted that he relied on several specific factors and facts.each of the factors and facts he enumerated supported conclusions that tamez was burned by diesel and that the diesel ignited so quickly that tamez could not escape.
even assuming that what elwell relied on and classified as factors and facts were true,however,which mack denies,the factors and facts are merely consistent with diesel fuel having been released during the rollover and tamez having been burned by part of the fire fed by the tractor diesel fuel.they are not probative evidence that diesel fuel was released because of one of the asserted defects in the fuel system or that it was ignited b
