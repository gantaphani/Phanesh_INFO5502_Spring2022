edward brown,a forklift operator at quebecor,plant in covington,tennessee,suffered serious injuries when his forklift collided with that of another employee in october of.brown brought this suit against forklift manufacturer the raymond raymond under the tennessee products liability act tpla,alleging that the forklift was unreasonably dangerous due to a defective design,defective brakes,and inadequate warnings.in a series of rulings,the district court found that the test applied to the design of a forklift,excluded the expert testimony proffered by brown,and granted summary judgment in favor of raymond on all claims.
brown argues on appeal that the district court erred in applying the test instead of the test.he also maintains that the district court improperly excluded the testimony of his expert witnesses,abused its discretion in treating raymond motion for clarification as a renewed motion for summary judgment on his claim,and erred in granting summary judgment to raymond on both that claim and the other claims.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the underlying facts are undisputed.brown is an experienced forklift operator who worked as a material handler at quebecor facility in covington,tennessee.while at quebecor,brown operated an easi reach model forklift,which is a,forklift manufactured by raymond.
on october,brown was driving his forklift along an corridor at the quebecor plant when he collided with a forklift operated by charles gause,who was traveling south on a corridor that intersected the one traveled by brown.the wheel well of gause forklift entered the operator compartment of brown forklift,crushing brown left foot.that foot eventually had to be amputated.both brown and gause had previously been trained in the operation of the easi reach model forklift,and both had read the accompanying instruction manual.
procedural background 
brown,a citizen of tennessee,filed suit against raymond,a new york corporation,under the tpla,ann.to west.in the suit,brown alleged that raymond had sold the forklift in a defective and unreasonably dangerous condition,that raymond had provided inadequate warnings,and that the brakes were not working properly at the time of the accident.the district court issued a scheduling order that set dates for the completion of discovery and for the filing of dispositive motions.in accordance with those dates,raymond filed both a motion to exclude the expert testimony offered by brown and a motion for summary judgment,which the district court construed as a motion for partial summary judgment because brown claim was not specifically addressed.
the district court excluded the deposition testimony of the two experts offered by.michael romansky and james driver.romansky,who is both a lawyer and an industrial engineer,testified by deposition that the forklift was unreasonably dangerous because raymond could have identified the problem of one forklift wheel well intruding into the operator compartment of another and could have eliminated the hazard.brown v.the raymond,d.at the same time,romansky admitted that he had no expertise in forklifts and that he had no alternative design to offer that would have eliminated the perceived safety hazard.applying rule of the federal rules of evidence as interpreted by the supreme court in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the district court ruled that romansky testimony was unreliable and would not aid the trier of fact.brown,d at.
the second expert,james driver,was an experienced forklift operator and trainer who testified that the warnings provided by raymond were inadequate.but driver admitted that he had not formulated or tested any alternative warnings.the district court therefore excluded his testimony as well,holding that driver factual bases were inadequate to support the conclusions that he had reached.id.at.
interpreting the tpla and the caselaw construing it,the district court concluded that only the the in assessing the dangerousness of a forklift,which is a complex industrial machine.id.at.because expert testimony was necessary to prove a prima facie case under that test and because the testimony of brown experts had been excluded,the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of raymond on the and claims.id.at.
raymond then filed a motion for clarification,arguing that it had previously sought summary judgment on all claims,including the allegation of defective brakes,and that it had addressed brown claim in a reply brief filed after the dispositive motions deadline.although the district court ruled that raymond request for summary judgment on the claim had been untimely,it ordered brown to respond to raymond motion with evidence showing that genuine issues of material fact were in dispute on this issue.following brown response,the district court granted raymond motion for summary judgment on the claim as well.this timely appeal followed.

summary judgment standard 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.minadeo ici paints,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
proper legal standard for assessing dangerousness 
brown primary contention on appeal is that the district court erred by applying the test to the exclusion of the test.in fact,brown counsel candidly conceded at oral argument that,if the test is indeed the appropriate legal standard in this case,then brown can not prevail.whether the proper legal standard was applied is a legal question that this court reviews de novo.united states willis,cir.
under the tpla,a plaintiff can prove that a product is unreasonably dangerous by showing either that the product was more dangerous than an ordinary consumer with the ordinary knowledge common to the community would have contemplated the test or that a reasonably prudent manufacturer or seller would not have distributed the product in the condition in which it was sold the test.ann.see ray ex rel.holman bic,discussing the contours and use of each test.although the test and the test are neither mutually exclusive nor mutually inclusive,several decisions have recognized that the prudent manufacturer test will often be the only appropriate means for establishing the unreasonable dangerousness of a complex product about which an ordinary consumer has no reasonable expectation.id.emphasis added accord coffey dowley,d,concluding that,under tennessee law,only the test applied where the victim alleged that a complex automotive tool was unreasonably dangerous,aff,cir unpublished.the plaintiff must offer expert testimony about the prudence of the decision to market when the test applies.ray ex rel.holman,at.
in the present case,brown maintains that more recent tennessee supreme court decisions have required the application of the test in all products liability cases in which the plaintiff is alleging unreasonable dangerousness.see jackson motors,holding that the consumer expectation test is applicable to any products liability case in which a party seeks to establish that a product is unreasonably dangerous.the jackson court,however,limited this holding by repeating its earlier warning that plaintiffs in cases involving highly complex products will often be unable to establish that the product is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by an ordinary consumer,even though the consumer expectation test may,technically,apply.see also irion sun lighting,no,wl,at.april,unpublished acknowledging that there may be situations where the consumer expectation test is not adequate because,in order to be successful under the consumer expectation test,the plaintiff must prove that the ordinary consumer has an expectation regarding the safety of the product citations omitted.
furthermore,courts applying the tpla since jackson have continued to rule that the complexity of a product forecloses the use of the test.see coffey,d at a lthough jackson stands for the proposition that the consumer expectation test is theoretically applicable to all situations,even that court acknowledged that ordinary consumers would have no expectations regarding certain products and certain failures.brown crown equip,no,wl,at,unpublished requiring a plaintiff who was injured by an allegedly defective forklift to present expert testimony in setting forth a prima facie case under the tpla,rev on other grounds,brown crown equip,wl,at.
like the district court,we believe that an allegation that a forklift was defectively designed is precisely the type of situation in which the ordinary consumer would not have an expectation regarding the safety of the product.irion,wl,at.the district court was therefore correct in refusing to accord undue weight to the broad statement from jackson cited by brown,and instead applying the test.
brown nevertheless maintains that complex products have been subjected to the test and that even complex products have simple aspects to them.he cites to a series of cases in which courts both inside and outside of tennessee have evaluated the dangerousness of a product under the test or a variant thereof.these cases,however,are either inapposite or distinguishable.brown first points to the following three cases from this circuit that applied ohio law hisrich volvo cars of,cir adkins gaf,cir and sours motors,cir.
in those cases,this court applied ohio has since been statutorily repealed,see bleh biro,ohio app d,to an automobile airbag system,raw asbestos fiber,and the roof of an automobile,respectively.regardless of whether courts applying ohio single test for determining whether a product is defectively designed would permit plaintiffs injured by an allegedly defective forklift to proceed under the test,perkins wilkinson sword,ohio,citation omitted,our inquiry is limited to determining what tennessee courts would do under these circumstances.see imperial hotels dore,cir to the extent that the state supreme court has not yet addressed the issue presented,it is the federal courts duty to anticipate how that court would rule.citation omitted.
turning then to the five tennessee cases cited by brown,we note that all but one of them predate the tennessee supreme court decision in ray ex rel.holman,in which that court authoritatively construed the tpla as containing two separate tests for liability.at.one of the cited cases,moreover,applies the restatement of torts instead of the tpla because the allegedly tortious conduct occurred prior to the enactment of the tpla.see gann int l harvester of canada.in two of the other cases,the tennessee court of appeals ruled in favor of the defendants even when applying the test,thus obviating the need to address any other tests.see goode tamko asphalt,granting the defendants judgment as a matter of law in a suit alleging that asphalt roof shingles were unreasonably dangerous neal boggs,wl,at,unpublished affirming the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a suit alleging that a tractor was unreasonably dangerous.the fourth case,whaley rheem,also predated ray ex rel.holman,and the failure of the defendants to the court of appeals to applicability of the test is therefore not surprising.these cases,none of which even mentions the test,do not convince us that all plaintiffs are invariably entitled to invoke the test in suits under the tpla.
the only one of the five tennessee cases that cuts in favor of brown position is hughes lumbermens mutual casualty,where the primary issue was whether the defendant compliance with osha regulations created a rebuttable presumption that the wheel rim that it manufactured was not unreasonably dangerous.in another part of its opinion,the hughes court relied on the tennessee cases discussed and distinguished above and,quoting selectively from ray ex rel.holman,concluded that the statutory term ordinary consumer referred to the customary or usual consumer of the product.id.at.adopting that definition,the court then held that the trial judge had erred in failing to instruct the jury on the test.id.the applicability and requirements of the test,however,were neither raised by the parties nor addressed by the court.furthermore,the hughes court reading of ray ex rel.holman ignores the supreme court statement that the test o bviously can only be applied to products about which an ordinary consumer would have knowledge.at see also id.at t he consumer expectation test will be inapplicable,by definition,to certain products about which an ordinary consumer can have no expectation.accord jackson,at reciting the same principle.
to the extent that hughes conflicts with ray ex rel.holman and jackson,we are of course bound by the tennessee supreme court construction of the tpla,not that of the tennessee court of appeals.see allstate ins.thrifty,cir observing that federal courts in diversity cases apply state law in accordance with the controlling decisions of the state supreme court.hughes also appears to conflict with the subsequent decisions by the federal district courts and tennessee appellate courts cited above,and we find these latter authorities more persuasive.our reasoning is simple the tpla,like the section of the restatement second of torts on which it is based,requires a plaintiff invoking the test to prove that the product is dangerous to an extent beyond which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics ann.emphasis added.we think that this straightforward statutory language,when combined with the tennessee supreme court interpretation of that language in ray ex rel.holman and jackson,leaves no room for the reading advanced by brown in his appeal.
our reliance on the language and logic of the decisions in ray ex rel.holman and jackson causes us to respectfully disagree with our concurring colleague assertion that we have chosen to interpret a statutory provision never before interpreted by the tennessee supreme court and pronounce a new rule of tennessee state product liability law.to the contrary,we are performing a function that federal courts routinely undertake in diversity,that of applying a state supreme court controlling construction of a statute to the specific facts of the case before us.
as noted above,we also agree with the district court that a forklift is a complex machine beyond the purview of the ordinary consumer and that brown was therefore obligated to provide expert testimony in order to survive a motion for summary judgment.the district court relied on both the coffey decision and the tennessee court of appeals unpublished opinion in brown in reaching its conclusion.shortly after we heard argument in the present case,the tennessee supreme court reversed the appellate court decision in brown and remanded the case for trial.see brown crown equip,wl,at.this recent supreme court opinion,however,is fully consistent with our reading of tennessee law and that of the district court.
in brown,the plaintiff forklift operators sued the manufacturer under the tpla,invoking the test.the trial court granted the manufacturer motion to exclude the expert testimony offered by the plaintiffs and later entered a directed verdict for the manufacturer.after the court of appeals affirmed,the supreme court reversed and remanded for a new trial,holding that the trial court had improperly excluded the expert testimony that the plaintiffs needed to satisfy the test.at,wl,at.the brown court cited with approval both ray ex rel.holman and jackson,and made no mention of the test.
far from contradicting our decision today,we think that brown helpfully clarifies that a forklift is a complex machine whose safety is best evaluated using the test under which expert testimony is required in order to reach the jury.see ray ex rel.holman,
