julie brinson appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of raytheon aircraft company hawker beechcraft corporation rac.the district court concluded that rac was shielded from state law tort liability by application of the military contractor defense.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
on april,judson brinson,a captain in the united states air force usaf reserves,died when the aircraft he was,the texan ii,crashed near savannah,georgia.appellant asserts that the was defectively designed by rac.
brinson was an instructor in the joint primary aircraft training system program jpats.jpats was established to develop a unified system to train flight personnel from all branches of the military.in,jpats issued a request for design proposals for a new aircraft suitable for training military personnel to fly jets.although several competitors submitted designs for jet aircraft,rac prototype was a standard aircraft called the pilatus.propeller driven aircraft have the attraction of being less expensive than jet aircraft.
however,there are key differences between and jet them the p factor.the p factor is a natural aerodynamic property of single planes,which causes the aircraft to yaw and roll to the left.normally,pilots of propeller driven aircraft manually adjust the plane rudder to compensate for the p factor.however,jet aircraft are unaffected by the p factor.therefore,in order to make its prototype emulate a jet,rac designed and developed a trim aid device tad.the tad uses a computer and data input sensors to automatically adjust the plane rudder through a series of pushrods and bell cranks.
plaintiff argues that the was defectively designed in two ways.first,plaintiff argues that the various components of the trim system represent single point failure opportunities when one component of the system breaks,the entire tad system fails.plaintiff alleges that rac should have included redundancies in the rudder trim system to prevent the failure of the entire system in the event of a single point failure.second,plaintiff alleges that the rudder trim system was defectively designed using pushrods.rac selected the rods because they are and require less maintenance.however,according to plaintiff,teflon tightens up with use and exposure to humidity.the tighter the bearing on the end of the pushrod,the higher the bending stress and the greater likelihood a rod will fracture and fail.
plaintiff theory of the crash is as follows.due to the heightened bending stress caused by the use of end bearings on the pushrods,one of the pushrods fractured during the p factor is most pronounced.this caused the entire tad system to suddenly and unexpectedly fail.it sent the aircraft into a severe,uncommanded left roll,causing the aircraft to crash.
resolution of rac motion for summary judgment requires an examination of the process by which rac and the usaf worked together to produce the.the relevant evidence in this case is undisputed however,its significance is hotly contested.we will analyze the critical facts in the following section.to set the stage,we note that the tad was initially designed and patented without any input from the government.however,military representatives and rac employees worked closely together during the development of all aspects of the aircraft.the military was also involved in testing and certification of the.furthermore,in january of,four months before the accident at issue,the usaf issued a technical order tcto requiring inspection and replacement of the rudder trim pushrods.the tcto ordered that the rods be replaced by new,but otherwise identical,rods.the aircraft piloted by captain brinson on april,had been subjected to the remedy ordered by the tcto its rods had been replaced.in,well after the accident at issue,the military ordered that the rod ends be replaced with a greased metal alternative.
rac filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that it was shielded from liability by application of the military contractor defense.the district court agreed and entered summary judgment in favor of rac.brinson filed the instant appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.holloman,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported,an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading rather,its response affidavits or as otherwise provided in this out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.e see also matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
iii.discussion 
a few areas,involving uniquely federal interests,are so committed by the constitution and laws of the united states to federal control that state law is and replaced,where necessary,by federal law of a content prescribed absent explicit statutory directive by the courts.boyle united tech,d internal citation omitted.t he procurement of equipment by the united states is an area of uniquely federal interest boyle,at.at.this,however,
merely establishes a necessary,not a sufficient,condition for the displacement of state law.displacement will occur only where a significant conflict exists between an identifiable federal policy or interest and the operation of state law,or the application of state law would frustrate specific objectives of federal legislation.
boyle,at.at internal quotations and citations omitted.
the scope of displacement is determined by a test.boyle,at.at.
liability for design defects in military equipment can not be imposed,pursuant to state law,when the united states approved reasonably precise specifications the equipment conformed to those specifications and the supplier warned the united states about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the united states.
id.this doctrine is referred to as the military contractor defense.see gray lockheed aeronautical,cir,abrogated on other grounds by gray lockheed aeronautical,cir.stripped to its essentials,the military contractor defense is available only when the defendant demonstrates with respect to its design and manufacturing decisions that the government made me do it.gray,at.
on appeal,brinson argues that rac has not presented sufficient evidence to establish,as a matter of law,that the first two prongs of the boyle test are satisfied we note that brinson has not argued that rac failed to prove the third prong.accordingly,we address the first two prongs in turn.
approval of reasonably precise specifications 
this condition requires the existence of two factors reasonably precise specifications and government approval of them.gray,at.it is meant to ensure that a government officer considered and approved the design feature in question.boyle,at.at.here,the design feature in question is the rudder trim system,including specifically the tad.
where the government merely approves imprecise or general guidelines,the contractor retains the discretion over the important design decision and enjoys no immunity against liability based on the boyle defense.gray,at.m ilitary hardware does not suddenly spring into being from initial design and procurement specifications,but evolves through drawings,blueprints and mockups agreed upon by the parties.id.at quoting kleemann mcdonnell douglas,cir.the ultimate design of the product is determined not only by the original procurement and contract specifications,but also by specific,quantitative engineering analysis developed during the actual production process.id.
two of our prior precedents illustrate these boundaries.in gray,the navy contracted with lockheed to develop a new antisubmarine warfare aircraft.id.at.the navy worked closely with lockheed to develop many aspects of the aircraft and participated in a series of design reviews.id.nonetheless,lockheed failed to carry its burden on summary judgment under the military contractor defense.the design feature in question was the aircraft aileron servo id.rather than producing copies of engineering drawings,lockheed submitted a document containing a narrative description of the general requirements the servo was designed to meet.id.at.this court held that general narrative requirements can not rise to the level of reasonably precise specifications.id.
by contrast,in harduvel general dynamics,cir,the defendant successfully carried its burden on summary judgment under the military contractor defense.the usaf contracted with general dynamics to produce the military first fighter,operated completely by electric controls.id.at.following a fatal crash,plaintiffs theorized that the aircraft suffered from a massive electrical failure caused by wire chafing the rubbing of wires in the electrical system against other wires,fasteners,or structural parts of the plane.id.at.general dynamics presented evidence that a group of usaf engineers was specifically assigned to review the design of the aircraft electrical system including specifications,drawings and blueprints.id.at.the usaf and general dynamics engaged in continuous back and forth discussions during the review and approval process.id.this evidence properly supported application of the military contractor defense at summary judgment.
however,despite the guidance these cases provide,our inquiry can not end here.the instant case presents an issue of first impression in our circuit.in january of,the usaf issued a tcto requiring inspection and replacement of the rudder trim pushrods.as a threshold matter,we must determine whether rac may rely on this,evidence as additional evidence to satisfy the first prong of the boyle test.we join several of our sister circuits in concluding that it may.
first,we will return to the supreme court decision in boyle to the rationale behind the development of the military contractor defense.the boyle test is designed to identify those situations where there is a significant conflict between federal interests and state law in the context of government procurement.boyle,at.at.to outline those situations presenting a significant conflict,the court relied on a of the federal tort claims act ftca.
in the ftca,congress authorized damages to be recovered against the united states for harm caused by the negligent or wrongful conduct of government employees,to the extent that a private person would be liable under the law of the place where the conduct occurred.b.it excepted from this consent to suit,however,a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.a.
boyle,at.at.the court went on to reason 
we think that the selection of the appropriate design for military equipment to be used by our armed forces is assuredly a discretionary function within the meaning of this provision.it often involves not merely engineering analysis but judgment as to the balancing of many technical,military,and even social considerations,including specifically the between greater safety and greater combat effectiveness.and we are further of the view that permitting of these judgments through state tort suits against contractors would produce the same effect sought to be avoided by the ftca exemption.the financial burden of judgments against the contractors would ultimately be passed through,substantially if not totally,to the united states itself,since defense contractors will predictably raise their prices to cover,or to insure against,contingent liability for the designs.
boyle,at.at.in light of this rationale,we conclude that,evidence may fit within the boyle rationale.when faced with a potentially failing or defective part,the military may make a discretionary decision concerning how to address the problem.we do not want to that judgment through a state law tort suit.just as in the original design process,defense contractors may predictably raise their prices to cover,or to insure against the possibility that the government will dictate how to address a potential defect.
review of cases outside this circuit supports this conclusion.the fourth circuit addressed this issue first.in dowd textron,cir the army contracted with the defendant,bell,to design a helicopter.subsequently,during a flight at a naval pilot school,the rotor system on one of the bell helicopters struck and severed its mast causing a fatal crash.id.this phenomenon is known as mast bumping.id.the plaintiff alleged that the rotor system was defectively designed.bell moved for summary judgment on the basis of the military contractor defense.id.bell presented evidence that the army had investigated the problem of mast bumping several years after the rotor system was originally designed.id.at.bell and the army exchanged information on the design of the rotor system and bell proposed three design modifications aimed at preventing mast bumping.id.at.the army rejected bell proposals.id.the fourth circuit concluded that the army experience with the rotor its decision to continue using establish government approval of the alleged design defects.id.at.
then,in,the second circuit,citing and discussing dowd,reached the same conclusion.see lewis babcock,cir.in lewis,the military contracted with general dynamics to design its jet fighter.id.at.after general dynamics delivered the to the military,the usaf became aware of corrosion on certain cables produced by babcock industries.id.at.the usaf completed an investigation of the problem and decided to reorder new babcock cables to replace the existing ones.id.subsequently,the plaintiff suffered spinal injuries when one of the babcock cables connecting the parachute system to his crew ejection module severed.id.at.the second circuit held that when the government reordered the specific babcock cable,with knowledge of its alleged design defect,the government approved reasonably precise specifications for that product such that the manufacturer qualifies for the military contractor defense for any defects in the design of that product.id.at.the court noted that if liability were imposed the contractor might 
seek to raise the price of the replacement cables to cover its anticipated liability from the damage that might be caused by their failure.such reaction would frustrate the policy underlying the ftca discretionary function exception by placing the cost of the government discretionary decisions on the government itself when it contracts for a product.
in sum,we join the second and fourth circuits in concluding that evidence is relevant under the boyle analysis whether or not the evidence in this case represents meaningful acceptance of the rudder trim system and specifically the tad is a question we will explore in greater depth below.
we now apply the foregoing principles to the facts of this case.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that rac has presented sufficient evidence to establish,as a matter of law,that the usaf approved reasonably precise specifications of the rudder trim system,including the tad in particular.first,throughout and,usaf engineers signed off on documents demonstrating that they reviewed drawings of components,including the rudder trim system.rac undisputed statement of material facts asserts that these documents verify that the government approved and accepted the tad as meeting the contractual requirements.second,rac presented evidence that,in february of,engineers representing the usaf reviewed engineering drawings and work instructions for the rudder assembly,of which the tad is a component.rac undisputed statement of material facts states that this review was conducted to ensure that the configuration of the aircraft complied with the requirements in the design documentation it also affirmatively states that the government reviewed rac design drawings to ensure that the aircraft complied with those requirements.the cited report states that government representatives reviewed many engineering documents as a normal course of doing business while performing contractor surveillance,and notes that v irtually all assembly drawings have been reviewed,inter alia,through day to day operations.finally,the tcto demonstrates that,as of january of,the military was specifically aware of the design defect at that some of the rudder trim pushrods showed evidence of bending.with this knowledge,the government issued a specific order mandating the remedy it deemed appropriate with respect to the known the tcto ordered that the pushrods be replaced with new but identical pushrods.
appellant responds to this evidence,in part,by accurately noting that approval must be meaningful,not a mere formality.gray,at.a defendant can not prevail on summary judgment simply by showing that a government representative signed a design drawing or ordered a replacement part.gray,at the fact that the navy actually replaced the servo in the crashed does not prove that the servo conformed to precise,specifications see also trevino dynamics,cir concluding that the signatures of military representatives on detailed drawings of a navy diving chamber were not sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the military contractor defense if the approval was nothing more than a rubber stamp.
the first prong of the boyle test is designed to ensure that the design feature in question was considered by a government officer.boyle,at.at emphasis added.here,that criterion is met.there is ample undisputed evidence of a continuous back and forth between rac and governmental representatives during the development of the,involving review and approval of design drawings of all systems,including the tad harduvel,at.evidence of exhaustive communication between a contractor and the military is a persuasive indication that the military approval,if given,was meaningful.id.accordingly,on the facts before us,rac has established that the military review of rudder trim system drawings,including the tad,was meaningful.furthermore,in light of both the military considered review of engineering drawings and its extensive involvement continuous back and forth in the development and production of the,rac has presented sufficient evidence from which we may conclude that the military january tcto ordering immediate replacement of new but identical pushrods reflects an informed,discretionary decision on how to address a known problem accordingly,considering these three categories of evidence together,we conclude that rac has carried its burden on summary judgment to show that the government approved reasonably precise specifications of the rudder trim system and its critical tad.
rac having properly supported its summary judgment and established as a matter of law that the government approved reasonably precise specifications,brinson must set out specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.see.e.brinson has failed to do so.on appeal,brinson asserts rac independently designed the tad the usaf did not sign off on the tad source control drawings before they were sent to the subcontractor for production and the rod was an off the shelf part.we could accept arguendo the first two factual assertions in brinson favor however,neither raises a genuine issue for trial.under the boyle test,it is enough that the military meaningfully approved reasonably precise drawings of the tad at some point during the design and production process.the third argument we find unpersuasive.although the tad was originally designed and patented by rac,we have seen that rac produced evidence that the design was considered,reviewed and approved by the government in an extensive and continuous back and forth process.government engineers approved the inclusion of the pushrod into a unique and critical component of a complex piece of equipment.see in re agent orange prod.liab,cir all products can eventually be broken down into various components.quoting miller diamond shamrock,cir.
we believe that this case is very similar to our prior decision in harduvel.in both cases,government representatives reviewed and approved the design feature at issue,including drawings,as part of a continuous back and forth process.indeed,in the instant case,we have the additional evidence in the january tcto that the government was aware of the specific design defect at issue and mandated appropriate remedial action.with respect to this first boyle factor,the instant case is readily distinguished from gray.there,the military contractor could prove only that the navy had approved a general narrative description.gray,at.by contrast,in the instant case,rac has proved that the government meaningfully reviewed and approved reasonably precise the actual drawings for the tad.
in summary,rac has sufficiently established that the military approved reasonably precise specifications of the rudder trim system,including the tad.none of brinson arguments raise a genuine issue of fact material to this conclusion.accordingly,we conclude that rac has satisfied the first prong of the boyle test on summary judgment.
conformity to reasonably precise specifications 
to demonstrate the second boyle condition,a contractor must show that the equipment at issue conformed to precise,specifications.gray,at.we conclude that rac has carried its burden on summary judgment.rac presented evidence that engineers representing the government reviewed drawings to ensure that the configuration of the complied with its design documentation.furthermore,rac attached a dd form to its motion for summary judgment.the dd form is a material inspection and receiving report.it is signed by a government representative and states that the specific aircraft piloted by captain brinson on april,was accepted by the military and conformed to the contract.see miller diamond shamrock,cir t he government issuance of a dd form,material inspection and receiving report,further establishes the item conformity.finally,where the procurement process involves a continuous exchange between the contractor and the government,the process itself becomes persuasive evidence of the product conformity to precise specifications.gray,at internal citations omitted.we have already established that rac presented ample evidence of a continuous exchange with the military.see supra note.
accordingly,rac has properly supported its motion for summary judgment and established that the equipment at issue conformed to specifications.thus,brinson must to point to specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.see.e.
brinson argues that the tad did not meet all of the airworthiness standards for acrobatic category airplanes contained in title,part of the code of federal regulations this argument in brinson initial brief is far too sparse and vague to warrant our review the argument points to no lack of conformity with the reasonably precise specifications that the government approved.moreover,brinson argument misperceives our inquiry.at this stage,we ask only if the rudder trim system,and the tad in particular,conformed to the military reasonably precise specifications brinson points to no facts suggesting that the tad or any other component of the rudder trim system was not built exactly as it was designed.we have already concluded that the military approved that design.accordingly,we conclude,as a matter of law,that rac has met the second prong of the boyle test 
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of rac on the military contractor defense.
brinson did not expressly refute the numbered facts in rac motion for summary judgment.as a result,the district court deemed admitted rac statement of material facts.brinson does not challenge that finding on appeal or assert that any of those factual allegations are false.accordingly,we accept rac undisputed statement of material facts as true.
rac argues that brinson brief relies on evidence which is both inadmissible and was not properly before the district court on summary judgment.we need not and do not address this issue.we have reviewed all the evidence submitted to this court by the parties.none of the evidence in dispute affects our resolution of the merits of this appeal.
