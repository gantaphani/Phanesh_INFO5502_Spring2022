in this appeal,relating broadly to the marketing of lights cigarettes,we consider the scope of the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act the labeling act,et.the appellants manufacturers,brown williamson tobacco corporation brown williamson and philip morris,pm usa,challenge the district court partial denial of their motion for summary judgment.manufacturers contend that the district court erred when it ruled that the labeling act does not expressly the plaintiffs state law claims for redhibition,breach of express and implied warranties,and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment.furthermore,they argue that the district court erred when it declined to apply the doctrine of implied conflict to the plaintiffs state law claims.we hold that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs claims,as presented at summary judgment,are not expressly by the labeling act.consequently we reverse and remand,directing the district court to enter a judgment dismissing all claims with prejudice.
on march,plaintiffs filed their petition for damages against pm usa,asserting claims under the louisiana unfair trade practices and consumer protection act lutpa and for redhibition,breach of express and implied warranties,and fraudulent misrepresentation.plaintiffs claimed that they were deceived by the company marketing into believing that smokers of light cigarettes consume lower tar and nicotine,and that light cigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes.on april,plaintiffs filed their petition for damages against brown williamson,alleging the same claims.plaintiffs seek to represent a worldwide class of persons who purchased at least a single pack of defendants light cigarettes lights in louisiana since.they seek to recover economic damages as measured by the difference between the value the product would have had at the time of sale if the representations about them had been true and the actual value to the consumer of the product in question,considering the true nature of the product.plaintiffs do not claim that they have been injured by smoking and do not seek to recover for any illnesses allegedly caused by lights.
the manufacturers removed the respective cases to federal court,and moved for summary judgment,arguing that plaintiffs claims are barred by express and implied.the manufacturers also argued that the lupta claims were barred by.ann,which exempts from liability under the lupta a ny conduct that complies with section a of the federal trade commission act a.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs lutpa claim against pm usa,but rejected pm usa express arguments with respect to the remaining claims.on september,the district court entered the same order with respect to brown williamson.the manufacturers moved for reconsideration,arguing that the district court had not addressed their conflict argument and that reconsideration was appropriate in the light of watson philip morris,cir.on december,the court denied reconsideration and certified its rulings for interlocutory appeal under b.we granted manufacturers petitions for review and consolidated the cases.

the manufacturers claims must be considered against the backdrop of a long history of federal cigarette advertising regulation in,the surgeon general issued a report concluding that smoking causes lung cancer.congress responded by enacting the labeling act through which it sought to establish a comprehensive federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.the act had two stated goals first,to provide the public with adequate information about any adverse health effects of cigarette smoking by inclusion of warning notices on each package and in each advertisement and second,to prevent the national economy from being impeded by diverse,nonuniform,and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations id.to promote these dual goals,congress specified the precise warning that manufacturers must place on all packages and forbade any other state regulation requiring any other statement relating to smoking and health on any cigarette package.a.in,congress amended the labeling act to expand the provision with respect to the states,and at the same time,allow the ftc to regulate cigarette advertising.this amendment precluded states from imposing any requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes.
in,the ftc developed its own testing method ftc method and made it the official test for tar and nicotine level measurements.the test is conducted by a machine that smokes every cigarette in the same manner.beginning in,all advertised tar and nicotine yields had to be substantiated by the ftc method.the ftc is aware that the test method does not measure the actual amount of tar and nicotine that smokers receive,but has concluded that the test provides a reasonably standardized method of presenting tar and nicotine yields in a way that can be readily understood by the public.in,the ftc accepted an agreement from the manufacturers,in lieu of rulemaking,that yield measurements be disclosed in all advertising in a standardized form.the ftc has repeatedly reevaluated the ftc method,but has thus far chosen not to modify it because epidemiological studies show that persons who smoke cigarettes with lower tar as measured by the ftc method are less likely to get diseases than those smoking higher tar cigarettes and it concluded that the only way to avoid consumer confusion was to continue to rely on a single,uniform testing standard.
since the adoption of the ftc method,the ftc has directed that any representations about tar and nicotine measurements must be substantiated by ftc method results.following an enforcement action against a manufacturer for stating that certain brands were lower in tar when the claim was not substantiated by the ftc method,the ftc declared that it would permit use of descriptive terms,light or,if their use was substantiated by ftc method results.the ftc has defined low tar cigarettes as those that measure milligrams or less of tar,per the ftc method.in,the ftc launched an investigation focused specifically on whether terms like lights or low tar were deceptive and should be banned and reaffirmed that such terms were not deceptive if substantiated by ftc method results.in,the ftc reopened its investigation of whether the term lights is deceptive to consumers and whether a new methodology should be adopted,but no conclusion has been reached.despite the apparently acknowledged weaknesses in the ftc method,therefore,it remains the federal mandated standard for cigarette testing.
in the light of the ftc extensive involvement in regulating cigarette advertising,the manufacturers argue that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs state law claims for redhibition,breach of express and implied warranties,and fraud are not expressly or impliedly by the labeling act.plaintiffs,relying primarily on the supreme court decision in cipollone liggett group,d,argue that the labeling act does not all state common law claims.the treatment of this particular set of claims presents a question of first impression in this circuit.
the provision of the labeling act provides that n o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which shall be labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.b.in cipollone,the supreme court considered the extent to which this provision state common law actions against cigarette manufacturers.at.concluding that congress did not intend to exclude all common law claims from the reach of the statute provision,and noting the strong presumption against,id.at,a plurality of the court held that in determining whether a particular claim is,the court must ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the damages action constitutes a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health imposed under state law with respect to advertising or promotion id.at.the plurality then applied this test to each of the petitioner claims and concluded that the act petitioner claims based on a failure to warn and the neutralization of federally mandated warnings to the extent that those claims rely on omissions or inclusions in respondents advertising or promotions but did not petitioner claims based on express warranty,intentional fraud and misrepresentation,or conspiracy.id.at.
the test and the analysis of the state law claims garnered only four votes although we are not bound to follow a test supported only by a plurality of the justices,this court has previously adopted the cipollone test in macdonald monsanto,cir,and we are therefore bound by our own circuit precedent.cipollone is also widely followed in other circuits.see,rivera philip morris,cir spain brown williamson tobacco,cir glassner reynolds tobacco,cir philip morris harshbarger,cir.the question on appeal,therefore,is whether the district court erred in finding that none of plaintiffs state law claims are predicated on a legal duty,which constitutes a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health imposed under state law with respect to advertising or promotion.we address each claim in turn.
redhibition 
plaintiffs plead redhibition under the louisiana civil code article,et,alleging that lights are defective in failing to deliver less harmful toxins than regular cigarettes,and that had plaintiffs known of the defect,they would not have purchased them the manufacturers contend that the redhibition claim is a repackaged failure to warn claim.they assert that plaintiffs claim is premised on the allegation that the cigarette manufacturers failed to disclose,in their labeling and in their advertising,the alleged defect in light is that lights fail to deliver less harmful toxins than regular cigarettes.because liability could have been avoided,had the manufacturers further warned consumers of the defect in lights,the manufacturers argue that under cipollone this claim is.
the district court rejected the manufacturers characterization of the redhibition claim,noting that defendants ignore the fact that instead of changing the labeling,they could possibly have designed a light cigarette that would actually deliver less tar and nicotine into the hands of the customer.on this basis,the district court held that 
plaintiffs are not asking defendants to change their labeling.plaintiffs are seeking an action in redhibition because the product itself was defective.the ftc method of testing gave lower tar and nicotine measurements than what each light cigarette actually delivered to the human smoker.hence the product was not reasonably fit for its intended deliver lower tar and nicotine.because this cause of action does not impose a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health with respect to advertising or promotion,it is not preempted by the labeling act.
the district court language is not inconsistent with that of the plurality in cipollone,which noted that b does not generally obligations to avoid marketing cigarettes with manufacturing defects or to use a demonstrably safer alternative design for cigarettes.cipollone,at.internal quotation marks omitted.assuming without deciding that the district court accurately determined that the plaintiffs design defect theory is a valid redhibition claim,some redhibition claims might survive the reach of the labeling act because the remedy sought might not necessarily implicate manufacturers marketing and advertising with respect to the relationship between smoking and health 
even accepting the district court generous characterization of the pleadings,however,a review of the record indicates that the plaintiffs introduced no summary judgment evidence in support of a redhibition claim,in the nature of a design defect,sufficient to create a material issue of fact.see austin,cir a nonmovant,to avoid summary judgment as to an issue on which it would bear the burden of proof at trial,may not rest on the allegations of its pleadings,but must come forward with proper summary judgment evidence sufficient to sustain a verdict in its favor on that issue.at best,plaintiffs have made the conclusory allegation that lights are defective because the manufacturers could have created a cigarette that delivered less tar and nicotine to the smoker.yet,they have provided no evidence to suggest that this is even possible we therefore find that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden at summary judgment,and dismiss their redhibition claim with prejudice.
fraudulent misrepresentation and suppression 
plaintiffs plead intentional misrepresentations or suppressions as to the true effect of lights on smokers health.plaintiffs alleged that the manufacturers marketed light cigarettes as being safer than regular brands,when in fact they are actually more harmful.they claim that the manufacturers fraud vitiates their consent as to the purchase of lights and therefore that they are entitled to rescission of all sales of lights.
the cipollone court held that some common law fraud claims are not by the labeling act because they are based on a general duty not to deceive,not on smoking and health.the court explained that plaintiffs concealment claims were not to the extent that such claims 
rely on a duty to disclose such facts through channels of communication other than advertising and promotion.thus,for,example,if state law obliged respondents to disclose material facts about smoking and health to an administrative agency,b would not a claim based on a failure to fulfill that obligation.
moreover,petitioner fraudulent misrepresentation claims that do arise with respect to advertising and promotion most notably claims based on allegedly false statements of material fact made in advertisements are not by b.such claims are predicated not on a duty based on smoking and health but rather on a more general obligation,the duty not to deceive.
cipollone,at.relying on this language,the district court held that plaintiff sic claims of fraudulent misrepresentation to the extent that they allege a false representation or concealment of material fact are not preempted by the labeling act.
while the district court correctly stated the test for identifying those fraud claims that survive,it erred in applying this test to plaintiffs claims.after cipollone,cigarette manufacturers,under certain circumstances,may be held liable for fraud under state law for affirmative misrepresentations of material fact or for the concealment of material facts.plaintiffs here have adequately alleged neither.
plaintiffs sole basis for claiming affirmative misstatement in this case is that the manufacturers used the terms lights and lowered tar and nicotine in their labeling and advertising to promote their products.while claims based on fraud by intentional misstatement are not because congress did not intend to insulate manufacturers from state liability for affirmative lies,cipollone,at,the use of descriptors can not constitute fraud.cigarettes labeled as light and do deliver less tar and nicotine as measured by the only methodology for their measurement.in fact,the manufacturers are essentially forbidden from making any representations as to the tar and nicotine levels in their marketing about tar that are not based on the ftc method the terms light and lowered tar and nicotine can not,therefore,be inherently deceptive or untrue.
plaintiffs seem to recognize that assigning liability solely on the basis of the ftc descriptors would be problematic.they therefore argue that the descriptors,although accurate under the ftc method,are misleading because they suggest that lights are less harmful than cigarettes.the cipollone court held that the labeling act these implied misrepresentation claims,which arise from statements or imagery in marketing that misleadingly downplay the dangers of smoking,and thus minimize or otherwise neutralize the effect of the federal mandated safety warnings.cipollone,at.the court explained that as these claims are predicated on a prohibition against statements in advertising or promotional materials that tend to minimize the health hazards of smoking,any s uch prohibition is merely the converse of a requirement that warnings be included in advertising and promotional materials.id.emphasis in original.
to hold that the manufacturers use of the terms relating to the measurement system constitutes affirmative misstatement under state law would directly undermine the entire purpose of the standardized federal labeling system and most courts have been reluctant to find liability on this basis.in good altria group,d,the district court faced a claim similar to that presented here.the court first noted that except for the use of the ftc descriptors,the 
record is devoid of any affirmative misstatement.thus,the plaintiffs point to no representation by the defendant about light cigarettes inconsistent with what the ftc condoned no evidence that the defendant ever affirmed that light cigarettes were good for you,were healthy,or would not cause the host of physical problems listed on every package no evidence that any descriptors the defendant applied to its light cigarettes contravened what the ftc and congress knew the tobacco companies as a group and the defendant in particular were saying about these cigarettes.
id.at emphasis in original.the court went on to consider what is it the plaintiffs would have had the defendant say about light cigarettes that it did not say,and concluded that to respond to plaintiffs concerns,the defendant would have to tell the public that the ftc method test,though accurate in the laboratory,was inaccurate in real life,a message that would directly contravene the entire federal cigarette advertising scheme.
what the good opinion makes clear is that to impose state liability on the basis of the manufacturers use of the ftc mandated terms is necessarily to impose a state requirement or prohibition on cigarette advertising as it relates to the relationship between cigarettes and health.as a california state court concluded,in considering a similar set of claims 
while plaintiffs insist that their lights case does not depend on a finding of whether the surgeon general mandated warning is adequate,logic dictates otherwise because it is obvious that defendants alleged deception respecting their use of the term light as part of the brand name of cigarettes that actually contain less tar and nicotine could easily be corrected by requiring an additional warning on the packages to the effect that light cigarettes can be more hazardous than regular cigarettes due to smoker compensation.hence,in the context of the federally regulated field of cigarette advertising,the gravamen of plaintiffs light claim is that the warnings mandated by congress are inadequate with respect to light cigarettes.
in re tobacco cases ii,wl,at,superseded on other grounds by in re tobacco ii cases,d.see also dahl reynolds tobacco,wl,at.but see,schwab philip morris usa,d,holding that plaintiffs misrepresentation claim under the illinois consumer fraud act based on defendants use of the terms lights and lowered tar and nicotine is wholly unrelated to any failure to warn claim and,therefore,not preempted.
we find the reasoning of the majority of courts compelling,and therefore hold that by the express terms of the clause,and under the court test in cipollone,fraudulent misrepresentation claims based on the use of descriptors are.
the cipollone court also recognized a second category of misrepresentation based on fraudulent concealment of material facts.the court differentiated between claims based on failures to disclose through advertising and marketing,which are,and failures to disclose through other channels,which are not.again,while the district court recognized that some concealment claims may avoid,it erred in finding such a claim here.
in considering fraudulent concealment claims,most courts have held that any state law claim that would require additional communication between companies and consumers is by the labeling act.johnson brown williamson tobacco,d,holding that any communication from a cigarette manufacturer to the public constitutes advertising or promotion sonnenreich philip morris,holding that communication by cigarette manufacturers to their customers of the dangers of smoking is an advertising or promotional campaign lacey lorillard tobacco,a claim that a defendant has a duty to disclose additional information concerning cigarette ingredients unavoidably attacks defendants advertising and promotion griesenbeck am.tobacco,a company attempt to notify its mass market of anything,whether a danger warning or a marketing effort,is considered advertising or promotion under the general usage of those terms,and a state can not impose requirements on such activities without running afoul of the clear language of cipollone.because a concealment claim relies,by its nature,on an unfulfilled duty to disclose additional information,it would seem unavoidably to impose a state law requirement as to marketing and advertising related to smoking and health.
in advancing their fraudulent concealment claim,plaintiffs rely primarily on rivera philip morris,cir,in which the ninth circuit held that the plaintiffs failure to warn and fraudulent concealment claims were not by the labeling act.the rivera panel determined that nevada common law duty requiring manufacturers to advise consumers of their products dangers does not specify that those disclosures be made through marketing and advertising,and held therefore,that a trier of fact could find that the cigarette manufacturer had an obligation to warn consumers of the health risks of smoking outside of packaging,advertising,and promoting.id.at.while noting that many courts had previously held that any claim requiring public release or disclosure of information is necessarily related to advertising and promotion,the court rejected this reading as inconsistent with cipollone and with the labeling act.id.at.the court decided instead that by preserving some common law claims,the cipollone plurality envisioned continued avenues of research for cigarette manufacturers to perform their duty to communicate smoking and health information through means other than the rigorously controlled avenues of advertising,promotion,and packaging.id.
we consider this general holding of the rivera court unreasonable.we can not accept that the congress meant to create a system in which cigarette manufacturers have the duty both to conform their advertising and marketing to strict federal standards and simultaneously to undercut these representations through other means,as yet undefined.we therefore join the majority of courts in holding that any state law claim that would require additional communication between companies and consumers is by the labeling act.
the rivera panel also upheld the fraudulent concealment claim on the more limited and specific basis that the defendant could have met its state law obligation to disclose material facts by making such disclosures to the tobacco industry research committee,analogizing to the supreme court example of an state law obligation to make disclosures to a state agency.id.at.because the exemption of this state law duty from the reach of b finds explicit support in cipollone,and because disclosure to the government,and possibly to other entities such as trade organizations,does not fall within the meaning of advertising and marketing,to the extent that a fraudulent concealment claim relies on this type of failure to disclose,it may not be.we see no need to decide this issue at present,however,as plaintiffs have not addressed either the source of this obligation under louisiana state law,nor its factual underpinnings in their pleadings or in their are either of these issues discussed by the district court.
we conclude,therefore,that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs claim of fraudulent concealment was not.
