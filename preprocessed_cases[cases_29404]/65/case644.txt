relator ford motor company and intervenor volvo car corporation seek a writ of mandamus to vacate a trial court order that declared certain volvo documents under a provision in a stipulated protective order.because the trial court order permitting disclosure contradicted the plain meaning of the parties agreement,we conditionally grant mandamus relief.
matthew marroquin died after being partially ejected from a ford expedition that rolled over after being struck at an intersection.his family filed a product liability suit against ford and requested numerous documents from volvo,a ford subsidiary that was not a party in the underlying case.
to facilitate discovery while maintaining the confidentiality of volvo documents,the parties agreed to a stipulated sharing confidentiality protective order regarding volvo documents protective order.the protective order stipulated the parties would keep confidential those volvo documents containing trade secrets and other confidential research,development and commercial information.the agreed protective order stated that any document ford designated as confidential would be treated as such and not disclosed or disseminated,and it also prescribed a procedure for the marroquins to contest any such designation.in addition,the stipulated agreement permitted the marroquins to use the documents in litigation,and even authorized sharing the documents with other plaintiffs suing ford in similar suits,provided those plaintiffs committed to the same protective order.the protective order,however,excluded certain documents from its scope,including documents that have been submitted to any government entity without request for confidential treatment.the order also specified that i nadvertent or unintentional production of documents or information containing information which should have been designed sic confidential shall not be deemed a waiver in whole or in part of the party claims of confidentiality.after both parties signed and filed the order with the court,ford designated as confidential and produced under seal numerous volvo documents,including several reports and videos related to rollover testing of the volvo vehicle.
meanwhile,a plaintiff duncan in florida state court was litigating similar product liability claims against ford,and ford submitted under seal the same documents under a similar protective order.the clerk of the florida court,however,set off a chain of events by inadvertently allowing an unknown number of persons,including interest groups and the media,to access the documents.one person who apparently gained access was sean kane,an independent automotive safety expert and consultant for plaintiff duncan.kane submitted portions of the rollover documents to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa,which posted them on its website where they were freely downloadable.plaintiff duncan moved to have the documents declared,insisting the public disclosure had destroyed the documents protection,but the florida court said the rollover documents remained protected.the nhtsa promptly removed the documents from its website.
following these events,the marroquins likewise argued that the volvo rollover documents can not be deemed confidential given their public availability and widespread nationwide disclosure through the florida court clerk office,the nhtsa website,and the attendant media coverage discussing the documents.with this level of public disclosure,the marroquins asserted that ford could not plausibly assert trade secrecy.
the texas trial court granted the marroquins motion to deem certain documents,but because ford only had five days notice of the hearing,not the thirty days notice prescribed by the protective order,the trial court held a second hearing a month later after mandamus proceedings had begun in this court.the trial court again granted the marroquins motion and deemed the documents.in its order and findings of fact,the court said the documents satisfied an exclusion provision and thus fell outside the protective order because they had previously been posted on the nhtsa website.the court also referenced the duncan case in florida and said the clerk release of the documents and widespread news coverage had impaired ford claim of secrecy.
we consider ford request for mandamus relief under a standard mandamus is proper when the trial court has abused its discretion by committing a clear error of law for which appeal is an inadequate remedy.in re prudential ins,walker packer,see.gov t code a.moreover,as we have repeatedly held,appeal is inadequate when a trial court erroneously orders the production of confidential information or privileged documents.in re bass,in re of.health ctr.at tyler,per curiam ford motor leggat,walker packer,at 
the marroquins arguments,at bottom,are essentially the government publication of the documents triggered the protective order exclusionary clause and thus took the documents outside the scope of the protective order even if the exclusionary clause was not invoked,the documents do not qualify as trade secrets and even if the documents did qualify as trade secrets at one time,the documents widespread public dissemination defeats ford secrecy claim.we reject these arguments as legally untenable and prudentially unsound.
whether the exclusionary provision of the protective order applies 
the stipulated protective order captures the parties clear intent right at the beginning to protect the respective interests of the parties and to facilitate the progress of discovery in this case to accomplish this,ford agreed to provide confidential volvo documents,and the marroquins agreed not to disclose them.one of the principal interests of ford and volvo was to prevent disclosure of their proprietary information trade secrets.the parties thus agreed not to disclose any volvo documents produced by a party which contain trade secrets and other confidential research,development and commercial information without the prior written consent of the producing party.
the protective order excluded certain documents from confidential treatment,however,including documents that have been submitted to any government entity without request for confidential treatment.the trial court found that this clause applied because the disputed documents had been submitted to the nhtsa without a confidentiality request.
standing alone,the exclusionary provision does not specify whose submission would render the documents unprotected.a stipulation provision,however,like any contract provision,can not be read in isolation all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole.coker coker.in other provisions that mention actions involving the volvo documents,the actors are always volvo or the producing party ford.for example 
the protective order refers to documents or information generated by or obtained from volvo volvo documents that are proprietary to the defendants 
the order extends to volvo documents to be produced by a party,specifically to a ll documents or things which any party designates as confidential 
the prior written consent of the producing party is required to disclose the documents to persons not listed in the order.
given that every other reference to the disputed documents has volvo or ford generating,designating,and consenting,the only reasonable interpretation is that these parties with the paramount interest in protecting confidential be the ones whose voluntary submission would forfeit the privilege.to interpret this provision otherwise would cover a multitude of absurdities and sins it would theoretically allow even a burglar to abolish instantly and irretrievably the documents confidentiality by stealing and then submitting them to the government.as the protective order itself makes clear,even an inadvertent disclosure by ford or volvo itself of a document that should have been designated confidential shall not be deemed a waiver in whole or in part of the party claims of confidentiality.surely,an unintentional disclosure by a third party of something marked confidential would not waive what an unintentional disclosure by ford or volvo of some
