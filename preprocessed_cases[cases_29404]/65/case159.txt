in this texas law diversity suit,brian wright and lisa wright,appeal the take nothing judgment in favor of ford motor company,in their product liability wrongful death and survival action for the death of their three year old son cade wright.appellants alleged claims of strict liability for marketing defect and design defect respecting the third party owned and operated ford xlt expedition which backed over cade wright.the trial court granted summary judgment for ford on the marketing defect claim and the jury found for ford on the design defect claim.
appellants raise four claims of error.they assert that the district court erred by instructing the jury under.civ.prac.a b concerning the vehicle compliance with relevant federal safety standards,by granting ford motion for summary judgment on their marketing defect claim,by excluding evidence of their expert testing,and by allowing certain testimony of ford expert.
ford,in addition to defending the district court referenced rulings,further argues that the district court erred in two other rulings which,if corrected,would provide alternate grounds to affirm the judgment.ford argues in this connection that the district court erred,first,in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and,second,in denying ford challenge to the testimony of appellants expert witness.
we affirm the judgment below and find it unnecessary to address ford mentioned alternative grounds for affirmance.
facts and proceedings below 
this case emerges from the horribly tragic accident that claimed the life of cade wright.
on june,the wrights took their young son,cade,to a snowcone stand in groves,texas.as appellants brief states,brian wright parked his truck to the left and slightly behind an ford expedition xlt owned by robin and darren mccutcheon such that the passenger door of the wright truck was approximately parallel to the rear bumper of the expedition.the wrights truck was parked approximately to feet from the snowcone stand.the parking lot was crowded and there was no organized manner of parking.the lot was not lined,so customers for the snowcone stand parked in any area of the lot where there was room in what could be characterized as a random,haphazard fashion.
while the wrights were parking their truck,darren mccutcheon was waiting in line at the snowcone stand to purchase his family snowcones while robin mccutcheon remained in the expedition with their two young children.brian wright soon joined the snowcone line,carrying cade in his arms,while lisa wright remained in the truck.after brian received the first snowcone in his order,he placed cade on the ground and gave him the snowcone cade then began to walk alone through the parking lot to his mother waiting in the truck.brian signaled to lisa that cade was on his way to the family truck but lisa did not see the signal and did not realize cade was walking toward her through the parking lot.brian then turned back to pay for the snowcones once he saw cade walk between the truck and the mccutcheons expedition.
during this same time,the mccutcheons were preparing to leave the parking lot since darren had returned with the snowcones.robin,the driver,placed the expedition in reverse,checked her rearview and side mirrors,and then took her foot off the brake pedal to begin backing out of her parking area without accelerating.in a matter of seconds,the mccutcheons both heard a thump and,realizing she had hit something,robin immediately braked and placed the expedition in drive,moving forward a few feet.
darren and robin mccutcheon exited the vehicle and,upon reaching the rear of the driver side of the expedition,realized robin had backed over cade,who was lying on the pavement dead,crushed by the expedition tire.at this time,lisa wright had also heard the thump,and opened the door of her truck to see cade dead body.the expedition left rear bumper had struck cade approximately at his shoulder blades,throwing him face down into the parking lot the expedition left rear tire then rolled over cade,killing him.
darren mccutcheon had purchased the expedition from energy country ford in port arthur,texas,in july as a new vehicle.though he knew the reverse sensing system was available as an option on the expedition,labeled as a parking or alarm,he chose not to have that particular option installed on january,the wrights instituted this diversity action in the district court below against ford asserting products liability and negligence claims.on may,the district court granted in part ford december,motion for summary judgment,granting ford judgment as a matter of law with regard to the wrights claims for manufacturing and marketing defects based on a theory of strict products liability or negligence.the district court allowed the wrights design defect claim to proceed to trial under both a strict products liability and a negligence theory.
the wrights july,second amended complaint alleged,inter alia that the mccutcheons expedition had a large and unreasonably dangerous blind spot immediately behind the vehicle and was not equipped with any of the many viable and economically feasible safety devices,including alarms,which were available on other ford at the time that ford should have included the reverse sensing system as mandatory standard equipment on all expedition models and,on that basis,ford should be held negligent and strictly liable for defects in design,manufacture,and marketing of the expedition.
before the case went to jury,the wrights withdrew their negligence claim.the jury then returned a verdict against the wrights on their design defect claim,responding no to the first interrogatory which asked was there a design defect in the ford expedition at the time it left the possession of ford motor company that was a producing cause of the occurrence in question.the remaining interrogatories were not answered as they were submitted conditionally on an affirmative answer to the first.final judgment was entered on july,and the wrights timely filed their notice of appeal.
discussion 
jury instruction on compliance with federal safety standards 
we review properly preserved claims of jury instruction error for abuse of discretion using a inquiry,giving the district court discretion to fashion jury instructions.the wrights first must demonstrate that the charge as a whole creates substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.flores cameron county,cir eeoc manville sales,cir.second,even if the jury instructions were erroneous,we will not reverse if we determine,based upon the entire record,that the challenged instruction could not have affected the outcome of the case.flores,at.
the only issue to reach the jury was the wrights design defect claim.the wrights claim the district court erred in instructing the jury to rebuttably presume that the ford expedition was not defectively designed,pursuant to texas civil practice and remedies code.section provides 
a in a products liability action brought against a product manufacturer there is a rebuttable presumption that the product manufacturer is not liable for any injury to a claimant caused by some aspect of the design of a product if the product manufacturer establishes that the product design complied with mandatory safety standards or regulations adopted and promulgated by the federal government,or an agency of the federal government,that were applicable to the product at the time of manufacture and that governed the product risk that allegedly caused harm.
b the claimant may rebut the presumption in subsection a by establishing that 
the mandatory federal safety standards or regulations applicable to the product were inadequate to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury or damage or 
the manufacturer,before or after marketing the product,withheld or misrepresented information or material relevant to the federal government or agency determination of adequacy of the safety standards or regulations at issue in the action.civ.prac.
ford claims it complied with the relevant safety standard governing the risk at motor vehicle safety standard,rearview mirrors fmvss.fmvss addresses rearview mirror performance placement in order to protect the public from backing into deaths and injuries due to limited rearview vision.therefore,ford claims it is entitled to the presumption of no defect provided by section a.
the judge instructed the jury that the presumption was applicable and that it could be rebutted if the wrights established that the federal standard was inadequate to protect the public.the jury instruction at issue stated 
you are instructed that ford motor company complied with a mandatory federal safety standard or regulation existing at the time of manufacture that was applicable to the product and that governed the product risk that allegedly caused harm and,therefore,is presumed not to be liable for the injuries to claimants.the claimants may rebut the presumption by establishing that the mandatory federal safety standard or regulations applicable to the product were inadequate to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury or damage.
the wrights contend that the jury instruction was erroneous for two reasons the purported federal standard,federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss does not govern the rear sensing system with which they argue the expedition should have been equipped and the presumption that a vehicle is not defective if it complies with fmvss is rebuttable and should not be conveyed to the jury once a plaintiff produces evidence rebutting it.
a the wrights first argue that the applicability of fmvss is confined by its scope,rearview mirror performance and placement,and this case concerns the absence of a reverse sensing rendering the section presumption instruction erroneous since section is only triggered when a federal statute actually applies to the defect at issue.to support their arguments,they point to the legislative history of section,in which there is some discussion that the statute does not apply to a defect not asserted.rearview mirrors are not the defect lack of a reverse sensing system combined with an overly large rear blind spot are.ford maintains,and we agree,that the risk that caused the harm in this case is precisely what fmvss covers,as stated in section purpose is to reduce the number of injuries and deaths that occur when the driver of a motor vehicle does not have a clear and reasonably unobstructed view to the rear.see note supra.
when we interpret a texas statute,we follow the same rules of construction that a texas court would under texas law the starting point of our analysis is the plain language of the statute.see international truck and engine bray,cir when we interpret state law we apply the law as the state highest court would.national liability and fire ins.allen,in construing a statute,our objective is to determine and give effect to the legislature intent and first look at the statute plain and common meaning,presuming that the legislature intended the plain meaning of its words.as the texas supreme court described in fitzgerald advanced spine fixation,
there are sound reasons we begin with the plain language of a statute before resorting to rules of construction.for one,it is a fair assumption that the legislature tries to say what it means,and therefore the words it chooses should be the surest guide to legislative intent.also,ordinary citizens should be able to rely on the plain language of a statute to mean what it says.moreover,when we stray from the plain language of a statute,we risk encroaching on the legislature function to decide what the law should be.
the wrights claim that the legislative history of section establishes that the emphasis is upon whether the particular defect claimed was governed by a federal safety standard and not the risk arising from that defect.however,section statutory language is clear,and we see no reason to address the legislative history as urged by the wrights section clearly provides for a rebuttable presumption if the product at,ford xlt manufactured in compliance with federal regulations that governed the product risk that allegedly caused harm.civ.prac.a emphasis added.
it is a much closer question,however,whether fmvss governed the product risk asserted in this case.the risk that caused the harm and forms the basis of the wrights suit is the rear blindspot of the expedition.indeed,several times in the wrights experts reports and their lawyer opening statement to the jury it is asserted that the allegedly defective design feature that caused the tragic accident at issue was the expedition rather substantial blind area behind it and there is a huge blind spot behind this expedition.the testimony of their expert geoffrey mahon also reflects that the product risk they asserted was that arising from the unreasonably dangerous blind spot behind the expedition when it was not equipped with the required ultrasonic reverse sensing system.
fmvss,last updated in,expressly states that it addresses rear blindspot risks see note,supra.on november,the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa published,under the heading federal motor vehicle safety standard,rearview mirrors rear visibility systems,an advance notice of proposed rulemaking notice,that indicated the possibility of amending fmvss to require further rear visibility systems,such as mirrors or the ultrasonic reverse sensing system,rear video cameras or other such devices on commercial trucks with a gross vehicle weight of pounds or more to reduce pedestrian deaths caused by backing vehicles.
in a passing comment regarding possible preemption issues,the notice indicated that nhtsa had previously stated that the requirements in fmvss,rearview mirrors,do not address the visibility of the area directly and immediately behind a vehicle.accordingly,standard does not preempt any state from requiring rear mirrors on vehicles.the notice indicated,as well,that a washington statute requiring commercial vehicles up to meters in length to be equipped with backup alerts as urged here for the expedition or mirrors was not preempted by fmvss due to the nhtsa interpretation of fmvss.
this preemption matter mentioned by the notice,however,does not conclusively indicate that fmvss does not govern the product risk of which the wrights complain.section a is not limited to preemptive regulations,and,in fact,appears to assume regulations as compliance with a preemptive regulation would of itself normally be determinative regardless of whether the claimant established under section b that it was inadequate to protect the public.see also e compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards under does not exempt a person from liability at common law.however,the statutes and measures mentioned by the notice address entirely different issues than the one present as washington statute requiring the additional equipment on large commercial vehicles.also,fmvss has a section discussing requirements of motorcycles and passenger cars under the weight of the vehicles addressed by the november notice.indeed,the notice specifically says that reverse sensing systems installed on passenger vehicles are,as the technology stood as of the date of the notice,of questionable help in terms of detecting people in the vehicles blind spots the notice states that rear sensing systems are relatively expensive technologies that do not presently reliably detect pedestrians and that there are not yet commercially available systems that can reliably detect pedestrians and children to the rear of the vehicle.the notice then continues on to limit its applicability,stating the agency nhtsa will reevaluate the need for and practicability of means of avoiding fatal backing crashes as technology progresses and performance is improved.however,public comment is specifically invited on the agency current intentions of limiting the requirements of cross view mirrors to straight trucks with a gvwr between and pounds.id.the federal agency chose to not even pursue amending fmvss to require such systems on passenger vehicles because it concluded that the ultrasonic reverse sensing systems were not yet sufficiently reliable to detect pedestrians.the goals were admirable but the technology was simply not there yet.
indeed,the fact that the november proposal centered upon amending fmvss to address the same risk of which the wrights complain in a similar manner as they suggest is a further indication that this federal regulation governs the risk that allegedly caused the harm.this is sufficient to come within section.the product risk addressed by fmvss is and was that of deaths and injuries that occur when the driver of a motor vehicle does not have a clear and reasonably unobstructed view to the rear.when consideration was given to further expanding the vehicle requirements to meet this risk,the november notice addressed amending fmvss to expand its requirements designed to address that same risk.so far as applicable to passenger vehicles,it was decided not to impose additional requirements to address that risk,because the technology was not then available.as to such vehicles,that product risk would be governed by,and only by,the requirements of fmvss as it then stood.the ford xlt expedition met those requirements.as to the larger vehicles,further consideration would be given to amending fmvss to add further requirements addressing that same product risk.we hold that fmvss applies to the product risk asserted in this case.accordingly,the wrights objection to the jury charge on the basis that fmvss did not so apply was properly overruled by the district court.
b the wrights next argue that even if fmvss sufficed to trigger the presumption provided by section,they rebutted that presumption because they produced at trial some evidence that would support a jury finding that the standard was inadequate to protect the public from unreasonable risk of injury or damage.therefore,they argue the presumption should not have been included in the jury instructions at all.we decline to find reversible error on this issue.
the wrights did not object to the jury instruction on this ground at only objected on the grounds previously addressed,that fmvss did not govern the defect asserted.
a party may not object to an instruction on one ground at trial and then attempt to rely on a different ground on appeal.coastal distributing ngk spark plug,cir.see also,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure civil at a party may not state one ground when objecting to an instruction to the jury and attempt to rely on a different ground for an objection on appeal or on a motion for a new trial.where a claimed ground of instructional error raised on appeal was not properly preserved below we may reverse only for plain error,which requires not only error,but also that the error was clear or obvious,that substantial rights were affected and that,consistent with our discretion whether to correct any plain error,not correcting the error would seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.texas beef group winfrey,cir citations omitted.see also,rizzo children world learning centers,cir en banc.the plain error standard is not met here.
to begin with,it is by no means clear or obvious that the mere introduction of evidence which would support though not legally compel a factual finding that the applicable federal standards here,those of fmvss were inadequate to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury or damage as provided in section b suffices of itself to rebut the rebuttable presumption established under section a and cause that presumption to disappear from the case so as to be an improper subject of jury instruction it is true that under texas law presumptions are generally treated as being of the so called thayer variety,namely presumptions which shift only the burden of production of evidence,which disappear from the case once evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding contrary to the presumed fact,and which do not shift the burden of persuasion.see,general motors saenz,common law presumption that adequate warnings on products will be headed.however other texas referred to as morgan not so disappear and do operate to shift the burden of persuasion.see,trevino ortega,baker,concurring bogart somer,in re.hou,pet.denied.see also,steven goode et al,guide to the texas rules of evidence,texas practice series 
we have been cited to no texas appellate court opinion directly addressing this aspect of the section presumption that section applies only to suits filed after september.
given that the section a presumption is a statutory one,the language of the statute would appear to control its operation.the statute provides that the claimant may rebut the presumption in subsection a by establishing that the applicable federal standards were inadequate.section b emphasis added.establish connotes something more than simply introducing some evidence from which a factfinder might that which is to be established.if,as here,the assertedly rebutting evidence is not such as to require as a matter of law that the federal standards be held inadequate,but rather presents a fact question in that respect,then,in a jury tried case,it appears logical to conclude that the statute proceeds on the assumption that any such fact question as whether the presumption has been rebutted will be submitted to the jury.
we conclude that it is not clear or obvious that the presumption provided for by section a and b is a thayer than a morgan,and accordingly the wrights contention,not properly preserved below,that the trial court erred by failing to treat the section presumption as a rather than a presumption,does not present any plain error.further,there is ample evidence apart from any section presumption to sustain the verdict and certainly no clear indication that the verdict would probably have been different absent the section instruction,and accordingly,even if the minimum standards to authorize reversal under the plain error standards were met,we would not exercise our discretion to do so because it does not appear that failure to address the claimed error would seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
