respondents leroy,donna,barry,and suzanne haeger sued petitioner goodyear tire rubber company,alleging that the failure of a goodyear tire caused the family motorhome to swerve off the road and flip over.after several years of contentious discovery,marked by goodyear slow response to repeated requests for internal test results,the parties settled the case.some months later,the haegers lawyer learned that,in another lawsuit involving the,goodyear had disclosed test results indicating that the tire got unusually hot at highway speeds.in subsequent correspondence,goodyear conceded withholding the information from the haegers,even though they had requested all testing data.the haegers then sought sanctions for discovery fraud,urging that goodyear misconduct entitled them to attorney fees and costs expended in the litigation.
the district court found that goodyear had engaged in an extended course of misconduct.exercising its inherent power to sanction behavior,the court awarded the haegers million the entire sum they had spent in legal fees and costs since the moment,early in the litigation,when goodyear made its first dishonest discovery response.the court said that in the usual case,sanctions ordered pursuant to a court inherent power to sanction litigation misconduct must be limited to the amount of legal fees caused by that misconduct.but it determined that in cases of particularly egregious behavior,a court can award a party all of the attorney fees incurred in a case,without any need to find a causal link between the expenses and the sanctionable conduct.supp.as further support for its award,the district court concluded that full and timely disclosure of the test results would likely have led goodyear to settle the case much earlier.acknowledging that the ninth circuit might require a link between the misconduct and the harm caused,however,the court also made a contingent award of million.that smaller amount,designed to take effect if the ninth circuit reversed the larger award,deducted in fees the haegers incurred in developing claims against other defendants and proving their own medical damages.the ninth circuit affirmed the full million award,concluding that the district court had properly awarded the haegers all the fees they incurred during the time when goodyear was acting in bad faith.
held when a federal court exercises its inherent authority to sanction conduct by ordering a litigant to pay the other side legal fees,the award is limited to the fees the innocent party incurred solely because of the misconduct or put another way,to the fees that party would not have incurred but for the bad faith.
a federal courts possess certain inherent powers,including the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.chambers nasco.one permissible sanction is an assessment of attorney fees against a party that acts in bad faith.such a sanction must be compensatory,rather than punitive,when imposed pursuant to civil procedures.see mine workers bagwell.a sanction counts as compensatory only if it is calibrate d to the damages caused by the acts on which it is based,at.hence the need for a court to establish a causal link between the litigant misbehavior and legal fees paid by the opposing party.that kind of causal connection is appropriately framed as a test,meaning a court may award only those fees that the innocent party would not have incurred in the absence of litigation misconduct.that standard generally demands that a district court assess and allocate specific litigation expenses yet still allows it to exercise discretion and judgment.fox vice.and in exceptional cases,that standard allows a court to avoid segregating individual expense items by shifting all of a party fees,from either the start or some midpoint of a suit.
b here,the parties largely agree about the pertinent law but dispute what it means for this case.goodyear contends that it requires throwing out the fee award and instructing the trial court to consider the matter anew.the haegers maintain,to the contrary,that the award can stand because both courts below articulated and applied the appropriate causation standard,or,even if they did not,the fee award in fact passes a test.
the haegers defense of the lower courts reasoning is a neither court used the correct legal standard.the district court specifically disclaimed the need for a causal link on the ground that this was a truly egregious case.supp,at.and the ninth circuit found that the trial court could grant all attorney fees incurred during the time when goodyear was acting in bad faith,a temporal,not causal,limitation.a sanctioning court must determine which fees were incurred because of,and solely because of,the misconduct at issue,and no such finding lies behind the million award made and affirmed below.nor is this court inclined to fill in the gap,as the haegers urge.as an initial matter,the haegers have not shown that this litigation would have settled as soon as goodyear divulged the results a showing that would justify an award from the moment goodyear was supposed to disclose.further,they can not demonstrate that goodyear so permeated the suit as to make that misconduct a cause of every subsequent legal expense,totaling the full million.
although the district court considered causation in arriving at its award of million,it is unclear whether its understanding of that requirement corresponds to the appropriate standard an uncertainty pointing toward throwing out the fee award and instructing the trial court to consider the matter anew.however,the haegers contend that goodyear has waived any ability to challenge the contingent award since the million sum reflects goodyear own submission that only about of the fees sought would have been incurred regardless of the company behavior.the court of appeals did not address that issue,and this court declines to decide it in the first instance.the possibility of waiver should therefore be the initial order of business on remand.

goodyear tire rubber company,petitioner leroy haeger,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
in this case,we consider a federal court inherent authority to sanction a litigant for conduct by ordering it to pay the other side legal fees.we hold that such an order is limited to the fees the innocent party incurred solely because of the misconduct or put another way,to the fees that party would not have incurred but for the bad faith.a district court has broad discretion to calculate fee awards under that standard.but because the court here granted legal fees beyond those resulting from the litigation misconduct,its award can not stand.
respondents leroy,donna,barry,and suzanne haeger sued the goodyear tire rubber company among other defendants after the family motorhome swerved off the road and flipped over the haegers alleged that the failure of a goodyear tire on the vehicle caused the accident their theory was that the tire was not designed to withstand the level of heat it generated when used on a motorhome at highway speeds.discovery in the case lasted several years and itself generated considerable heat.the haegers repeatedly asked goodyear to turn over internal test results for the,but the company responses were both slow in coming and unrevealing in content.after making the district court referee some of their more contentious discovery battles,the parties finally settled the case for a sum on the eve of trial.
some months later,the haegers lawyer learned from a newspaper article that,in another lawsuit involving the,goodyear had disclosed a set of test results he had never seen.that data indicated that the got unusually hot at speeds of between and miles per hour.in ensuing correspondence,goodyear conceded withholding the information from the haegers even though they had requested both early and often all testing data related to the.record in d,doc,see,doc,at,doc,at filed under seal.the haegers accordingly sought sanctions for discovery fraud,claiming that goodyear knowingly concealed crucial internal heat test records related to the defective design.doc,at.that conduct,the haegers urged,entitled them to attorney fees and costs expended in the litigation.see,at.
the district court agreed to make such an award in the exercise of its inherent power to sanction litigation misconduct the court assessment of goodyear actions was harsh and is not contested here.goodyear,the court found,had engaged in a course of behavior.supp,d.by withholding the test results at every turn,the company and its lawyers had made repeated and deliberate attempts to frustrate the resolution of this case on the merits.at.but because the case had already settled,the court had limited options.it could not take the measure it most wished an entry of default judgment against goodyear,at.all it could do for the haegers was to order goodyear to reimburse them for attorney fees and costs paid during the suit.
but that award,in the district court view,could be comprehensive,covering both expenses that could be causally tied to goodyear misconduct and those that could not.the court calculated that the haegers had spent million in legal fees and costs since the moment,early in the litigation,when goodyear made its first dishonest discovery response.and the court awarded the haegers that entire sum.in the usual case,the court reasoned,sanctions under a c ourt inherent power must be limited to the amount of legal fees caused by the misconduct.at emphasis deleted.but this case was not the usual one here,the sanctionable conduct r ose to a truly egregious level.at.and when a litigant behaves that badly,the court opined,all of the attorneys fees incurred in the case can be awarded,without any need to find a causal link between those expenses and the sanctionable conduct.ibid.as further support for its decision,the court considered the chances that full and timely disclosure of the test results would have affected goodyear settlement calculus.while there is some uncertainty,the court stated,the case more likely than not would have settled much earlier.at.
perhaps sensing thin ice,the district court also made a contingent award in the event that the court of appeals reversed its preferred one.app.to pet.for cert.here,the district court recognized the possibility that a linkage between goodyear misconduct and the haegers harm is required.ibid.if so,the court stated,its fee award should be reduced to million.the deduction of,which was based on estimates goodyear offered,represented fees that the haegers incurred in developing claims against other defendants and proving their own medical damages.see app.
a divided ninth circuit panel affirmed the full million award.according to the majority,the district court acted properly in award ing the amount it reasonably believed the haegers expended in attorney fees and costs during the time when goodyear was acting in bad faith.or repeated in just slightly different words the district court did not abuse its discretion in award ing the haegers all their attorneys fees and costs in prosecuting the action once goodyear began flouting its discovery obligations.at.judge watford disagreed.he would have demanded a causal link between goodyear misconduct and the fees awarded.at dissenting opinion.the only part of the district court opinion that might support such a connection,judge watford noted,was its hypothesis that disclosure of the test results would have produced an earlier settlement,and thus obviated the need for further legal expenses.but judge watford thought that theory unpersuasive because goodyear would still have had plausible defenses to the haegers suit,i t anyone guess how the litigation would have proceeded had timely disclosure occurred.ibid.accordingly,judge watford would have reversed the district court for awarding fees beyond those sustained as a result of goodyear misconduct.at.
the court of appeals decision created a split of authority other circuits have insisted on limiting sanctions like this one to fees or costs that are causally related to a litigant misconduct we therefore granted certiorari.
federal courts possess certain inherent powers,not conferred by rule or statute,to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.link wabash.that authority includes the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.chambers nasco.and one permissible sanction is an assessment of attorney fees an order,like the one issued here,instructing a party that has acted in bad faith to reimburse legal fees and costs incurred by the other side,at.
this court has made clear that such a sanction,when imposed pursuant to civil procedures,must be compensatory rather than punitive in nature.see mine workers bagwell,distinguishing compensatory from punitive sanctions and specifying the procedures needed to impose each kind in other words,the fee award may go no further than to redress the wronged party for losses sustained it may not impose an additional amount as punishment for the sanctioned party misbehavior,at quoting united states mine workers.to level that kind of separate penalty,a court would need to provide procedural guarantees applicable in criminal cases,such as a beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof.see,at.when as in this case those protections are missing,a court shifting of fees is limited to reimbursing the victim.
that means,pretty much by definition,that the court can shift only those attorney fees incurred because of the misconduct at issue.compensation for a wrong,after all,tracks the loss resulting from that wrong.so as we have previously noted,a sanction counts as compensatory only if it is calibrate d to the damages caused by the acts on which it is based,at.a fee award is so calibrated if it covers the legal bills that the litigation abuse occasioned.but if an award extends further than that to fees that would have been incurred without the misconduct then it crosses the boundary from compensation to punishment.hence the need for a court,when using its inherent sanctioning authority and civil procedures,to establish a causal link between the litigant misbehavior and legal fees paid by the opposing party 
that kind of causal connection,as this court explained in another attorney fees case,is appropriately framed as a test the complaining party here,the haegers may recover only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the misconduct.fox vice,see paroline united states,slip,at the traditional way to prove that one event was a factual cause of another is to show that the latter would not have occurred but for the former in fox,a prevailing defendant sought reimbursement under a statute for legal expenses incurred in defending against several frivolous claims.see,at.the trial court granted fees for all legal work relating to those claims regardless of whether the same work would have been done for example,the same depositions taken to contest the claims in the suit.we made clear that was wrong.when a defendant would have incurred an expense in any event,he has suffered no incremental harm from the frivolous claim,and so the court lacks a basis for shifting the expense.fox,at.substitute discovery abuse for frivolous claim in that sentence,and the same thing goes in this case.or otherwise said and again borrowing from fox,when the cost would have been incurred in the absence of the discovery violation,then the court possessing only the power to compensate for harm the misconduct has caused must leave it alone,at.
this causation standard generally demands that a district cou
