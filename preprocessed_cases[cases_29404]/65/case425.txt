this appeal arises from a suit governed by kansas law.plaintiff arvine hiner suffered injuries in a farming accident involving a tractor and loader manufactured by defendant deere and company.plaintiff complaint alleges that the tractor and loader were defective in design and that deere failed to issue adequate warnings concerning risks posed by the equipment.the district court granted deere motion for summary judgment.plaintiff appeals.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.mattioda white,cir.plaintiff accident occurred on january,while he was operating a deere tractor.the tractor was equipped with a deere model loader.plaintiff purchased the tractor and the loader from another farmer in.the tractor had been manufactured in,and the loader had been manufactured in.the loader consists of two arms attached to a loader bucket.the arms can be raised and lowered by hydraulic power,using levers at the tractor seat.
at the time of the accident,plaintiff was using the loader to carry a large round hay bale.intending to transport the bale across his pasture to a cattle feeder,he began driving with the bale about feet off the ground.as he drove,he looked off to the side at some cattle walking toward him.while his attention was diverted,the loader began rising upward.the hay bale,which had been resting unrestrained on the loader,rolled backward onto plaintiff.the accident rendered him paraplegic.
the type of hay bale that fell on large round not introduced into the farming industry until the fall of or the spring of.plaintiff adapted his loader so that it could be used to transport large round bales.he welded brackets,or ears,onto the bucket and then used these brackets to attach bale forks to the bucket.he also welded a backstop onto the bucket.when plaintiff carried a large round bale with his loader,the bale would rest on top of the forks.
the basic hazard involved in plaintiff hazard of objects falling off loaders onto tractor the introduction of large round bales.according to plaintiff,however,the increasing use of large round bales exacerbated the dangers associated with using loaders,because injuries resulting from accidents are especially severe.deere and other manufacturers have responded to the danger of accidents by offering for sale a number of safety devices which reduce the risk of injury.one such safety feature is a protection system rops to which a canopy can be attached.the canopy prevents objects from falling onto the operator.other safety devices include bale grapples and bale equipment used to secure large round bales on loaders.
although plaintiff knew about the hazards of accidents and was familiar with the available safety devices,he believed that he could avoid the danger by carrying his load at a low level.at the time of his accident,however,the loader elevated on its rose without conscious operator input.as will be discussed in greater detail below,plaintiff did not know that such was possible and his lack of awareness of that possibility may have interfered with his ability to assess the risks of using the tractor and loader to carry large round bales.
plaintiff filed suit against deere,relying on both negligence and theories.he alleged that deere failed to issue sufficient warnings about the risks of accidents.he also alleged that the tractor and loader were defective in design,because they lacked certain safety devices that would have prevented his injuries.deere filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted as to all plaintiff claims.
plaintiff appeals the summary judgment.because this is a diversity case,we apply the substantive tort law of kansas.we follow federal law,however,regarding the standard for granting summary judgment.eck parke,davis,cir.accordingly,w e review the entry of summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.the moving party must show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.boykin of,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
ii.discussion 
kansas law recognizes three ways in which a product may be defective a manufacturing defect a warning defect and a design defect.delaney deere.plaintiff relies on both and theories in asserting that deere bears liability for his injuries.we first consider plaintiff claims.
under kansas law,a product,though perfectly designed and manufactured,may be defective if not accompanied by adequate warnings of its dangerous characteristics.meyerhoff michelin tire,cir.the kansas courts have cited the restatement second of torts as authority for t he general rule regarding a manufacturer duty to warn.long deere.section states 
one who supplies a chattel for another to use is subject to liability to those whom the supplier should expect to use the chattel for physical harm caused by the use of the chattel in the manner for which and by a person for whose use it is supplied,if the supplier 
a knows or has reason to know that the chattel is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied,and 
b has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition,and 
c fails to exercise reasonable care to inform them of its dangerous condition or of the facts which make it likely to be dangerous.
two aspects of the cause of action are the focus of the dispute in this appeal.first,what is the relevance of the user knowledge of danger second,what is the scope of the manufacturer duty,if any,to warn of dangers discovered after the item has been sold 
we begin with the relevance of the user knowledge.under paragraph b of,there is no duty to warn of an obvious danger.similar limitations appear in the kansas product liability act,et.section provides 
in any product liability claim any duty on the part of the manufacturer or seller of the product to warn or protect against a danger or hazard which could or did arise in the use or misuse of such product,and any duty to have properly instructed in the use of such product shall not extend 
a to warnings,protecting against or instructing with regard to those safeguards,precautions,and actions which a reasonable user or consumer of the product,with the training,experience,education and any special knowledge the user or consumer did,should or was required to possess,could and should have taken for such user or consumer or others,under all the facts and circumstances 
b to situations where the safeguards,precautions and actions would or should have been taken by a reasonable user or consumer of the product similarly situated exercising reasonable care,caution and procedure or 
c to warnings,protecting against or instructing with regard to dangers,hazards or risks which are patent,open or obvious and which should have been realized by a reasonable user or consumer of the product.
accordingly,the kansas courts have stressed that manufacturers should not be held liable for failing to warn about risks that would be apparent to ordinary users.see,miller lee apparel,d,a product is not unreasonably dangerous when its degree of danger is obvious and generally known or recognized.if a danger is obvious,then its obviousness constitutes a warning,and the product seller failure to provide a separate warning should not constitute a defect.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,regardless of the ordinary user knowledge of the danger,t here is no duty to warn of dangers actually known to the user of a product long,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted accord miller,at.
as for the scope of a duty to warn,in patton hutchinson,the court recognized a manufacturer duty to warn ultimate consumers who purchased the product who can be readily identified or traced when a defect,which originated at the time the product was manufactured and was unforeseeable at the point of sale,is discovered to present a life threatening hazard.two factors govern whether a manufacturer must issue a warning a reasonableness test and the manufacturer actual or constructive knowledge of the risk.id.at.a plaintiff bringing a claim must make an initial showing that the manufacturer acquired knowledge of a defect present but unknown and unforeseeable at the point of sale and failed to take reasonable action to warn of the defect.id.
turning now to the specifics of plaintiff claims,he contends that deere failed to warn of several dangerous characteristics of the tractor and loader and that these failures to warn contributed to his accident.he asserts the following claims deere should have provided warnings to the owners,operators,and dealers of deere loaders that there had been reports of accidents occurring when loaders had risen without conscious operator input deere should have provided warnings regarding the need for a rollover protection system rops on the tractor deere should have warned owners,operators,and dealers of loaders that loaders should be used only with tractors that have protection and rollover protection once deere learned of the hazards of accidents,the company should have provided warnings to owners,operators,and dealers of the loaders,advising that a falling object protection system fops should be installed and deere should have warned of the need for on the loader.aplt.br.at.
plaintiff alleges that the loader elevated itself without conscious operator input.aplt.reply br.at.he contends that because he was unaware of the hazard,he did not know that he was exposing himself to the risk of a accident.he maintains that deere should have issued warnings about the risk of.
in its brief on appeal,deere presents three arguments in support of the district court grant of summary judgment on plaintiff claim.deere contends that such a warning was unnecessary in light of plaintiff understanding of the overall danger of accidents plaintiff has failed to establish that the alleged hazard was present at the time of sale and plaintiff has not shown that it would have been feasible for deere to issue him a warning about the hazard.
with respect to the necessity of a warning,deere argues that the key question is whether plaintiff appreciated the general danger of unrestrained objects falling from the whether plaintiff had detailed knowledge of particular factors such as the danger that might contribute to a accident.in deere view,d escribing the theory of failing to warn plaintiff in plaintiff highly selective manner is not relevant because plaintiff was aware of the ultimate hazard,and aware of the serious consequences to the operator if that hazard came to pass.aple.br.at.
plaintiff responds that the precise scope of his knowledge of the risk is essential information for determining whether the loader was more dangerous than he perceived.he asserts that there was a critical gap in his understanding of the hazard he did not realize that an accident could occur even if he was attempting to carry the large round bales at a low level,because he did not know that the loader might unexpectedly rise to a high level.
in support of his position,plaintiff points out that this circuit has recognized that an assessment of a product dangerousness may take into account people misconceptions about the possibility of using the product safely.in wheeler john deere,cir,a case involving kansas law,the court stated 
w hether a danger is open and obvious depends not just on what people can see with their eyes but also on what they know and believe about what they see.in particular,if people generally believe that there is a danger associated with the use of a product,but that there is a safe way to use it,any danger there may be in using the product in the way generally believed to be safe is not open and obvious.
internal quotation marks omitted.
deere disputes whether the proposition expressed in wheeler is applicable in this case.in wheeler,deere notes,the manufacturer primary defense against the plaintiff claim was that the danger posed by the product was open and obvious.here,in contrast,deere contends not just that the hazard was open and obvious,but that plaintiff possessed actual knowledge of the hazard.deere fails to explain the significance of this distinction,however.the essential point of wheeler is that there may be a duty to warn if users incorrectly believe that a recognized danger can be avoided by a particular safety measure.deere does not challenge plaintiff assertion that he thought he was avoiding the hazard by keeping the bale low,because he did not know that the loader might elevate on its own.the logic of wheeler extends to the circumstances of this case.on this record,plaintiff knowledge of dangers does not preclude his claim.
deere second argument in support of the district court grant of summary judgment on plaintiff claim concerning the hazard is that plaintiff has no evidence that the alleged defect existed at the time of manufacture.as mentioned above,the kansas supreme court has stated that there may be a duty to warn consumers of defects which originated at the time the product was manufactured and were unforeseeable at the point of sale.patton,at.
we need not consider this issue,however,because deere did not raise it below.in its summary judgment brief,deere discussion under the heading deere is entitled to summary judgment because it did not violate a duty to warn,vol.i,at,nowhere specifically mentions plaintiff claims regarding the hazard.although the brief does mention the issue in its discussion of whether plaintiff claim was barred because the useful safe lives of the tractor and loader had expired by the time of plaintiff accident an argument not pressed on appeal,w e have consistently rejected the argument that raising a related theory below is sufficient to preserve an issue for appeal.okland oil conoco,cir.deere discussion of the hazard in its argument concerning the useful life of the equipment did not put plaintiff on notice that deere was also arguing that the hazard did not exist at the time of sale.it would therefore be inappropriate to affirm deere summary judgment on that ground.
deere next appears to argue that plaintiff claim must fail because of the impracticability of providing such warnings.in patton the kansas supreme court recognize d a manufacturer duty to warn ultimate consumers who can be readily identified or traced at.deere points out that in this case plaintiff purchased his tractor and loader.according to deere,there is no evidence deere even knew plaintiff had a loader.aple.br.at.even assuming that the local deere dealership had a business relationship with plaintiff,deere maintains,plaintiff casual purchases of parts from a merchant selling john deere parts does not lead to an inference he owned a loader and certainly creates no duty to keep track of every implement he owned.id.
plaintiff disputes deere assessment of the feasibility of notifying him about potential hazards associated with the equipment.he alleges that an incident in the demonstrates that deere could have determined that he owned a tractor and model loader.deere had ordered that tractors be retrofitted with an kit.w ithout being asked or making a charge to plaintiff,a repairman from a local deere dealership went to plaintiff farm and installed the kit on the loader.aplt.reply br.at,vol.ii,at.
in our view,this evidence creates a question of fact as to whether it would have been practicable for deere to identify plaintiff as a product owner.further,we note that plaintiff asserted that deere had wrongfully failed to issue a warning to deere loader owners,operators,and dealers about the hazard,vol.i,at.the kansas supreme court has suggested that even when it may be infeasible for a manufacturer to issue warnings to consumers,there may still be a duty to issue warnings to retailers.in patton the court stated the facts may indicate that notice to all ultimate consumers who purchased the product prior to the time the manufacturer learned of a potential danger is unreasonable,if not impossible.notice to the distributor or retail seller may,in certain contexts,meet the reasonableness standard.at.hence,even if it were clear that deere could not identify plaintiff as a
