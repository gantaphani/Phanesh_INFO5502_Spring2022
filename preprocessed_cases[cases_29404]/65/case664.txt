in illinois,two tests are employed when determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous under a strict liability test and the test.in this case,we are asked to consider whether there is a simple product exception to the application of the test.that is,we must decide whether a product which is deemed simple and its dangers open and obvious will be per se exempt from the test and subject only to the test.we decline to adopt such a per se rule.
background 
on march,plaintiff susan calles resided with her four daughters,amanda,age,victoria,age,and jenna and jillian,age.at some point that night,calles left her home with victoria to get videos for amanda.when she left,the twins were in bed and amanda was watching television.calles returned to find fire trucks and emergency vehicles around her home.it was subsequently determined by a fire investigator,robert finn,that jenna had started a fire using an aim n flame utility lighter calles had purchased approximately one week earlier.the aim n flame was ignited by pulling a trigger after an switch was slid to the on position.as a result of the fire,jillian suffered smoke inhalation.she was hospitalized and died on april.
calles,individually and as administrator of jillian estate,filed suit in the circuit court of cook county against tokai,designer and manufacturer of the aim n flame,and,distributor collectively scripto,alleging that the aim n flame was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous because it did not contain a safety device.according to the complaint,a safety device was available,inexpensive,and would have reduced the risk that children could ignite the lighter.calles claims sounded in strict liability,negligence,and breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose calles further alleged that scripto was negligent and strictly liable because of a failure to give adequate warnings.
calles also filed a medical malpractice claim against richard fox and loyola university medical center collectively loyola in connection with their treatment of jillian following the fire.scripto filed counterclaims against calles and loyola.loyola then filed a for contribution against scripto.
thereafter,scripto filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims brought by calles and loyola.scripto argued that the aim n flame was not defective or unreasonably dangerous because it worked as expected scripto had no duty to make an adult product child resistant scripto had no duty to warn because the dangers of the aim n flame were open and obvious and there was no breach of warranties because the aim n flame operated as intended and expected.
in support of its motion for summary judgment,scripto offered the deposition testimony of calles and robert finn,the fire inspector.in her deposition,calles admitted she was aware of the risks and dangers presented by lighters in the hands of children,and,for this reason,she stored the aim n flames on the top shelf of her kitchen cabinet.calles further admitted that the aim n flame operated as intended and expected.
in opposition to scripto motion for summary judgment,calles offered affidavits from several experts including john geremia,a chemical and mechanical engineer tarald kvålseth,a mechanical and industrial engineer william kitzes,a product safety manager richard dahlquist,an electrical engineer and carol,an engineering psychologist.all of these experts opined that the aim n flame was defective and unreasonably dangerous because it lacked a design.they also opined that a technologically and economically feasible alternative design,which included a safety device,existed at the time the aim n flame was manufactured.several of the experts averred that scripto was aware of the desirability of a device because it knew children could operate the aim n flame.further,according to these experts,scripto owned the technology to make the aim n flame child resistant in and.
with respect to the cost of an alternative design,kvålseth noted that the consumer product safety commission,the regulatory body for lighters,in a proposed rule dated september,estimated the increased cost of adding a safety device to the lighter would be per unit.however,it was kvålseth opinion that,had the feature been incorporated into the original design,the cost would have been negligible.
calles also offered evidence of the dangerousness of lighters in the hands of children and scripto awareness of such dangers.she introduced into evidence statistics showing the number of previous fires started by children with lighters both utility and cigarette,the number of deaths and injuries that had occurred each year as a result of fires started by children,and the reduction in cost to society that would be derived from the addition of safety devices on the lighters.calles further pointed to scripto answers to interrogatories,in which scripto admitted they had been named as defendants in lawsuits filed between and for injuries that occurred between and under circumstances similar to this case.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of scripto on both calles complaint and loyola.the trial court found that all claims must fall because these defendants neither owed nor breached any duty imposed upon them by law under any of the causes of action raised.
on appeal,the appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part d.with respect to strict liability,the appellate court held that the aim n flame does not qualify as the kind of especially simple device for which the result of the balancing is too obvious for trial.d at.accordingly,the appellate court reversed the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of scripto.d at.the appellate court also reversed summary judgment on the claims and remanded for further proceedings.d at.we granted scripto petition for leave to appeal.
strict liability 
in suvada white motor,this court adopted the strict liability doctrine set forth in section of the second restatement of torts.under this doctrine,strict liability is imposed upon a seller of any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property.restatement second of torts,at.the test outlined in section for determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous is known as the or test.this test provides that a product is unreasonably dangerous when it is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.restatement second of torts,comment i,at.
under the test,a plaintiff must establish what an ordinary consumer purchasing the product would expect about the product and its safety.this is an objective standard based on the average,normal,or ordinary expectations of the reasonable person it is not dependent upon the subjective expectation of a particular consumer or user.see american law of products liability,at bass,products liability design manufacturing defects ed britton electrolux home products,no,wl.october,crosswhite jumpking,d,henrie northrop grumman,wl april.see also owens,madden davis,madden owens on products liability,at ed.
the test was originally applied to manufacturing defects,but soon came to be applied to issues as well.over time,the applicability of the test to cases was questioned,primarily because it became apparent that consumers might not be aware of what to expect regarding the safety of certain products.see barker lull engineering,cal d.accordingly,this court in lamkin towner,adopted a second,alternative test for design defect cases known as the,or,test.see blue environmental engineering,noting this court understood the problem s associated with application of the test to cases and recognized a second,alternative test.
in lamkin,this court held that a plaintiff may demonstrate a product has been defectively designed in one of two ways.one way a plaintiff may demonstrate a design defect is to present evidence that the product fails to satisfy the test.alternatively,a plaintiff may demonstrate a design defect by presenting evidence that the risk of danger inherent in the challenged design outweighs the benefits of such design.lamkin,at,blue,at.
the rationale for employing two tests was explained in barker.there,the court noted that at a minimum a product must meet ordinary consumer expectations as to safety to avoid being found defective.emphases omitted.barker,cal d at,at.at.however,the expectations of the ordinary consumer can not be viewed as the exclusive yardstick for evaluating design defectiveness because i n many situations the consumer would not know what to expect,because he would have no idea how safe the product could be made.citation.barker,cal d at,at.at.thus,even if a product satisfies ordinary consumer expectations,if through hindsight the jury determines that the product design embodies excessive preventable danger,or,in other words,if the jury finds that the risk of danger inherent in the challenged design outweighs the benefits of such design,a product may be found defective in design.barker,cal d at,at.at.see also soule general motors,cal th,d,refining barker test and holding that the consumer expectations test is reserved for cases in which the everyday experience of the product users permits a conclusion that the product design violated minimum safety assumptions,emphases omitted but that the risks and benefits of a challenged design must be carefully balanced whenever the issue of design defect goes beyond the common experience of the product users.
since lamkin,this court has continued to employ these two tests when determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous.see blue,at,noting there are two,alternative tests in illinois for proving a strict liability design defect claim hansen baxter healthcare,separately analyzing whether an iv catheter connector was unreasonably dangerous under the and tests.we now turn to them.
as noted above,under the test,a plaintiff may prevail if he or she demonstrates that the product failed to perform as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.in the case at bar,there is a threshold question.whose expectations control,the adult purchaser or the child user calles argues we must apply the test from the point of view of a child.we disagree.
for purposes of the test,ordinary modifies consumer.ordinary means r egular usual normal common.black law dictionary ed.see also madden owens on products liability,at supp ordinary consumer applies to the customary or usual consumer of the product.see also swix daisy manufacturing,cir t he focus is the typical user perception and knowledge citation emphasis added.several courts in other jurisdictions have held that the ordinary consumer of a lighter is an adult,not a child.see,talkington atria reclamelucifers fabrieken bv,cir applying south carolina law curtis universal match,aff,cir kelley rival manufacturing,welch,bellotte zayre.in light of these cases,we hold that the ordinary consumer of a lighter,such as the aim n flame here,is an typical user and purchaser.therefore,the expectations regarding the aim n flame use and safety must be viewed from the point of view of the adult consumer.
we now consider whether the aim n flame meets the test.the purpose of a lighter,such as the aim n flame,is to produce a flame.see peters carroll,playing with fire assessing lighter manufacturers duties regarding child play lighter fires,loy.consumer.clearly then,the ordinary consumer would expect that,when the trigger is pulled,a flame would be produced.here,the aim n flame was not used in its intended manner,by an adult.thus,the question is whether it was used in a reasonably foreseeable manner.we find that it was.
an ordinary consumer would expect that a child could obtain possession of the aim n flame and attempt to use it.thus,a child is a reasonably foreseeable user.likewise,an ordinary consumer would appreciate the consequences that would naturally flow when a child obtains possession of a lighter.see madden,products liability,products for use by adults,and injured children back to the future,summer.specifically,an ordinary consumer would expect that the aim n flame,in the hands of a child,could cause the result that occurred starting of a fire that led to injury to a child.see,flock,cir texas law curtis.at tennessee law bondie bic,williams bic,so d,welch,at price bic,campbell bic,misc d,perkins wilkinson sword,ohio,hernandez tokai.
under the facts of this case,the aim n flame performed as an ordinary consumer would produced a flame when used in a reasonably foreseeable manner,by a child.this leads to the inescapable conclusion that the ordinary consumer expectations were fulfilled.in other words,the aim n flame did not fail to perform as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in a reasonably foreseeable manner.thus,as a matter of law,no fact finder could conclude that the aim n flame was unreasonably dangerous under the test.therefore,calles can not prevail under this theory.
this does not end our analysis however.though the aim n flame satisfies the test,it may,nonetheless,be deemed unreasonably dangerous under the test.
under the test,a plaintiff may prevail in a strict liability case if he or she demonstrates that the magnitude of the danger outweighs the utility of the product,as designed.lamkin,at.stated differently,t he utility of the design must therefore be weighed against the risk of harm created and i f the likelihood and gravity of the harm outweigh the benefits and utilities of the product,the product is unreasonably dangerous.d products liability,at.
relying on scoby,d,scripto argues there is a simple product exception to the application of the test.in other words,scripto contends that,when a product is deemed simple,the test need not be employed.we disagree.
in scoby,an individual was injured while working in a restaurant kitchen when he slipped and fell and his arm became submerged in hot oil contained in an open fryer.scoby,d at.the plaintiff sued the fryer manufacturer,alleging a design defect,and argued for liability under the test.scoby,d at.relying on lamkin,the manufacturer argued that,because the danger at issue was not excessive,the test should not be utilized.scoby,d at.
the scoby court agreed with the defendant.scoby,d at.noting that hot oil in a fryer was an open and obvious danger and that,for efficient kitchen operation,it was often necessary to keep a lid off the fryer,the scoby court concluded 
we do not deem that lamkin or other cases applying aspects of the test intend that all manufacturers should be subject to liability depending upon a trier of fact balancing under that test.somewhere,a line must be drawn beyond which the test can not be applied.considering not only the obvious nature of any danger here but,also,the simple nature of the mechanism involved,we conclude the circuit court properly applied only the contemplation test.scoby,d at.
several appellate court decisions have followed scoby in various situations giving rise to the so called simple product exception to the application of the test.see miller rinker boat,d,mele howmedica,d,bates richland sales,d,wortel somerset industries,d,besse deere,d.
in support of their position that summary judgment was properly granted in their favor,scripto also cites to todd societe bic,cir,wherein the court applied the scoby exception to facts very similar to those in the case at bar.in todd,a child died when a child used a bic lighter to start a fire in the bedroom.todd,at.the plaintiff filed a strict liability claim against the manufacturer,alleging the lighter was unreasonably dangerous because it did not contain a safety device.todd,at.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the manufacturer and the plaintiff appealed.todd,at.the seventh circuit court of appeals affirmed,concluding that the lighter was not unreasonably dangerous under the test because it performed exactly as a consumer would produced a flame when activated.todd,at.
the todd court then observed that this court had adopted a second test in strict liability cases,the test.the court also observed,however,that in scoby,a exception to application of this test had been adopted.todd,at.noting that this court had not yet addressed the scoby exception,the todd court opined that this court would not apply the test to simple but obviously dangerous products.todd,at.the todd court then concluded the lighter was a simple product and,for that reason,the test was not applicable.todd,at.
while this court has made reference to scoby in past decisions,we have never had occasion to squarely address the exception it adopted.see blue,at,hansen,at.we do so now.
upon close examination of scoby,we find that it uses simple and open and obvious as separate components.however,in our view,the dangers associated with a product that is deemed simple are,by their very nature,open and obvious.see,swix,at finding that the fact that a product may be a simple tool is not dispositive in a design defect obviousness of a danger is merely one factor in the analysis of whether the risks are unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries.we conclude,then,that scoby adoption of a simple product exception is nothing more than the adoption of a general rule that a manufacturer will not be liable for open and obvious dangers.
a majority of courts have rejected the notion that the open and obvious danger of a product is an absolute defense to a claim in strict liability.restatement third of torts products liability,reporters note,comment d,at identifying jurisdictions that have rejected a per se rule.see also american law of products liability,at.at.we,too,recognized this principle in blue,when this court stated 
in strict products liability cases,the open and obvious nature of the risk is just one factor to be considered in the range of considerations required by the test,and it will only serve to bar the liability of the manufacturer where it outweighs all other factors to be considered in weighing the inherent design risks against the utility of the product as manufactured.blue,at.
moreover,this court noted that such a ruling appeared to be consistent with illinois law.blue,at,citing coney industries,assumption of risk is not a bar to recovery in strict liability.see also miller,d at,wortel,d at.as one case has held,the obviousness of a risk inherent in a product,simple or nonsimple,does not by itself obviate a manufacturer liability.cacevic simplimatic engineering,vacated in part.
policy reasons also support rejection of a per se rule excepting simple products with open and obvious dangers from analysis under the test.adoption of such a rule would essentially absolve manufacturers from liability in certain situations even though there may be a reasonable and feasible alternative design available that would make a product safer,but which the manufacturer declines to incorporate because it knows it will not be held liable.this would discourage product improvements that could easily and alleviate the dangers of a product.a per se rule would also frustrate the policy of preventing future harm which is at the heart of strict liability law.see madden owens on product liability,at noting that the test limited by the open and obvious doctrine perniciously rewards manufacturers for failing to adopt measures to remedy obviously unnecessary dangers to human life and limb restatement third of torts products liability,comment a,at strict liability for design defects creates incentives for manufacturers to achieve optimal levels of safety in designing and marketing products restatement third of torts products liability,reporters note,comment a,at strict liability promotes investment in product safety.
accordingly,we hold that the open and obvious danger of a product does not create a per se bar to a manufacturer liability,nor does it preclude application of the test.rather,the open and obvious nature of a danger is one factor that may be weighed in the test.blue,at.see also restatement third of torts products liability,reporters note,comment d,at.we reject scoby adoption of a per se rule excepting simple products with open and obvious dangers from analysis under the test.accordingly,we reject scripto assertion that only the test applies here.we now consider whether calles presented sufficient evidence under the test to withstand summary judgment.
under the test,a court may take into consideration numerous factors.in past decisions,this court has held that a plaintiff may prove a design defect by presenting evidence of the availability and feasibility of alternate designs at the time of its manufacture,or that the design used did not conform with the design standards of the industry,design guidelines provided by an authoritative voluntary association,or design criteria set by legislation or governmental regulation.anderson hyster.see also hansen,at,feasibility of alternative design relevant moehle chrysler motors,evidence of compliance with governmental regulations relevant in design defect cases to determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous rucker norfolk western ry,same kerns engelke,feasibility of alternative design relevant.although all of these cases,except hansen,preceded the adoption of the test in illinois,we find the factors set forth in these cases are relevant when engaging in analysis.see blue,at,noting the rationale of anderson appears to partially set forth the test.
john wade,dean and professor of law,emeritus,vanderbilt university school of law,has also identified several factors relevant when engaging in analysis.these factors include 
the usefulness and desirability of the utility to the user and to the public as a whole.
the safety aspects of the likelihood that it will cause injury,and the probable seriousness of the injury.
the availability of a substitute product which would meet the same need and not be as unsafe.
the manufacturer ability to eliminate the unsafe character of the product without impairing its usefulness or making it too expensive to maintain its utility.
the user ability to avoid danger by the exercise of care in the use of the product.
the user anticipated awareness of the dangers inherent in the product and their availability,because of general public knowledge of the obvious condition of the product,or of the existence of suitable warnings or instructions.
the feasibility,on the part of the manufacturer,of spreading the loss by setting the price of the product or carrying liability insurance.wade,on the nature of strict tort liability for products.
wade factors have been adopted and relied upon by numerous jurisdictions,including our own appellate court.see labelle philip morris,d,nemir mitsubishi motors sales of america,d,aff in part,rev in part,fed.app x cir dart wiebe manufacturing,armentrout fmc,potter chicago pneumatic tool,tabieros clark equipment,wortel,d at,banks iron hustler,nunnally reynolds tobacco,so d,duke gulf western manufacturing,johansen makita,duran general motors,app rainbow albert elia building,aff,roach motor,or,phatak united chair,ray bic.
lastly,we find that when assessing the utility of a product,the following factors may also be relevant the appearance and aesthetic attractiveness of the product its utility for multiple uses the convenience and extent of its use,especially in light of the period of time it could be used without harm resulting from the product and the collateral safety of a feature other than the one that harmed the plaintiff.american law of products liability,at through.
although we have listed a number of factors which courts may consider when assessing,we do not mean to imply that the list is exclusive.the factors cited merely illustrate those that may assist a court and jury in evaluating whether a design is unreasonably dangerous.a plaintiff need not present proof on each of the factors.in the first instance,the court must balance factors it finds relevant to determine if the case is a proper one to submit to the jury.restatement third of torts products liability,reporters notes,comment e,at.once this threshold determination has been met,it is up to the fact finder to determine the importance of any particular factor,and its relevance,and the relevance of other factors,will vary from case to case.see restatement third of torts products liability,comment f,at.we now apply those factors identified above to the evidence presented in the case at bar.
after reviewing the evidence presented,we find the only factor which favors calles and a finding of unreasonably dangerous is the second wade aspects.calles presented specific and detailed evidence as to the likelihood of injury and the seriousness of injury from lighters which do not have devices.
factors which would favor scripto and a finding that the product is not unreasonably dangerous are the first and sixth wade utility of the aim n flame and the user awareness of the dangers.as to the utility of the aim n flame,it is both useful and desirable to society as a serves as an inexpensive alternative source of fire.moreover,compared to other sources of fire,such as matches,it is more convenient and longer lasting since it is a multiuse product.the lighter may also be safer since it will extinguish if dropped on the floor while lit,unlike a match.with respect to the user awareness of the dangers,there is no question,based on calles deposition testimony,that it was obvious to her that the lighter could come into the hands of a child and the dangers and risks that situation would pose.
in connection with the remaining relevant factors,we find that these neither weigh for nor against a finding of unreasonably dangerous.calles claims that a substitute product was available,but the only evidence she relies upon is the fact bic introduced a utility lighter in march,the very same month of the incident here.this is insufficient to demonstrate that a substitute product was available at the time of the manufacture of the aim n flame.
calles offered expert affidavits regarding the availability and feasibility of an alternative design,including product impairment and cost factors,along with industry standards.each expert opined,in a conclusory fashion,that a feasible alternative design existed.kvålseth identified three alternative designs.
scripto argues that,although kvålseth set forth these alternative designs,he failed to give a basis for his feasibility determination,nor did he show that these alternative designs met regulatory standards.in this regard,scripto notes that the consumer product safety commission cpsc,the regulatory body for these products,required safety devices on cigarette lighters beginning in,but exempted utility lighters.it was not until that cpsc required safety devices on utility lighters.see,bartholic,d.cpsc exempted utility lighters because it was concerned about flashbacks the build up of gas and resultant sudden flash when a lighter was not ignited properly.specifically,cpsc feared that if a device on a utility lighter needed to be reset between attempts,this could cause a delay in ignition,resulting in the increased risk of flashback.scripto maintains that this concern shows that some of the options proffered by kvålseth in his affidavit were not,in fact,feasible.scripto also disputes calles claim that there would be no impairment to the aim n flame from modification with a safety device since she cites no evidence in support of her argument.
with respect to the cost feasibility,calles offered evidence through kvålseth affidavit.according to kvålseth,
the cpsc consumer product safety commission in the proposed rule dated september,has estimated that the rule will likely increase the cost of manufacturing utility lighters by about per unit.the defendants have indicated that such a cost increase would only be a few cents per lighter.however,had a utility lighter been originally designed to be effectively child resistant,then the incremental cost due to an effective feature would have been negligible.
there is nothing in our record showing scripto provided any amount as to the increase in cost of incorporating a safety device.apparently,according to loyola,this information was offered into evidence in flock,where an internal scripto memorandum authored in estimated cost increase would be per unit.in light of the foregoing,we conclude that a material issue of fact exists on the question of whether there was a feasible alternative design available,which can not be determined on the basis of the record as it currently stands.
lastly,with respect to the user ability to avoid the danger,calles testified she put the aim n flames on the top shelf of her kitchen cabinet.however,she also acknowledged she could have left them on the counter.as scripto maintains,the appellate court embraced the former testimony,despite contradictory evidence.this is a factual determination we can not make.
based on a review of the foregoing factors,reasonable persons could differ on the weight to be given the relevant factors,particularly where additional proofs are necessary,and thus could differ on whether the risks of the aim n flame outweigh its utility.therefore,reasonable persons could differ as to whether the aim n flame is unreasonably dangerous,and we can not say that scripto was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.as such,we affirm the appellate court decision reversing the trial court decision granting summary judgment in favor of scripto on the strict liability claims.
negligence claim 
the next question we must decide is whether scripto was entitled to summary judgment on the claims.
the appellate court found that the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of scripto on the basis of the exception.d at.it then concluded that blue held that the test was not applicable to claims.d at.based on this holding,the appellate court reversed summary judgment and remanded for further proceedings.we find that the appellate court erred in doing so.
there was no majority opinion in blue holding that the test was not applicable to cases.rather,as justice freeman pointed out,only three justices thomas,garman,and kilbride concurred in this conclusion.blue,at,freeman,specially concurring.as such,the conclusion that the test is not applicable in cases is not binding precedent.accordingly,we conclude that the appellate court erred in reversing summary judgment based on blue and we must review anew the trial court order that scripto owed no duty,nor breached any duty owed.
a product liability action asserting a claim based on negligence,such as negligent design,falls within the framework of common law negligence.flaugher sears,roebuck,d.thus,a plaintiff must establish the existence of a duty of care owed by the defendant,a breach of that duty,an injury that was proximately caused by that breach,and damages.ward k mart.the key distinction between a negligence claim and a strict liability claim lies in the concept of fault.coney industries.in a strict liability claim,the focus is on the condition of the product.coney,at.however,in a negligence claim,a defendant fault is at issue in addition to the condition of the product.coney,at.
a manufacturer has a nondelegable duty to design reasonably safe products.doser savage manufacturing sales,quoting savage manufacturing sales,doser,d,jiganti,dissenting coney,at.the crucial question in a case is whether the manufacturer exercised reasonable care in the design of the product.american law of products liability,at d products liability,at.see also restatement second of torts,at a manufacturer of a chattel made under a plan or design which makes it dangerous for the uses for which it is manufactured is subject to liability to others whom he should expect to use the chattel or to be endangered by its probable use for physical harm caused by his failure to exercise reasonable care.
in determining whether the manufacturer conduct was reasonable,the question is whether in the exercise of ordinary care the manufacturer should have foreseen that the design would be hazardous to someone.american law of products liability,at.see also d products liability,at a manufacturer has a duty to design against reasonably foreseeable hazards.to show that the manufacturer acted unreasonably based on the foreseeability of harm,the plaintiff must show the manufacturer knew or should have known of the risk posed by the product design at the time of manufacture.d products liability,at.
scripto argues that if the aim n flame is not unreasonably danger
