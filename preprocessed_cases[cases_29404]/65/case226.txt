your mother refused to buy you a bb gun,warning that you shoot your eye out.apparently she was right to be concerned.based on the facts of this case and a review of other cases on the topic,it seems that bbs are attracted to children eyes as politicians are attracted to television cameras.after losing the use of one eye,aaron swix together with his parents brought this products liability action against daisy,the manufacturer of the air rifle which was used to shoot him,alleging that the air rifle was defectively designed.the district court dismissed swix complaint.this appeal followed.
in may of,albert carl porrit purchased a daisy powerline air rifle for his minor grandson,nicholas porritt.the air rifle was kept in a locked gun cabinet.on april,nicholas,then age eleven,removed the loaded air rifle from the gun cabinet without permission.according to his affidavit,nicholas took the safety lock off the gun and checked to see if the air rifle was empty.app.at.he then shook the rifle with the barrel facing down toward the floor.he pulled the bolt back and tilted the gun towards himself to see if there was a bb inside the rifle.he believed at this point that the rifle was empty.he subsequently pumped the rifle about five times and shot it at the floor.only air came out.he then took the air rifle to the basement,pumping the rifle as he walked.when he got to the basement,he began to watch a movie and held the air rifle in his lap.halfway through the movie,he picked up the air rifle,pointed it at his old friend aaron swix and the air rifle went off.id.according to the plaintiffs,the result was painful and permanent injury to aaron swix and virtually complete loss of sight in his left eye.
on january,aaron swix and his parents filed a products liability suit against daisy manufacturing company,in the eastern district of michigan,seeking one million dollars and alleging claims of defective design and failure to warn of a known danger.in their amended complaint,the plaintiffs argued that t he bb storage magazine in the model was dangerously and defectively designed in that it allowed a bb to become lodged in the forward portion,between the barrel and interior of the outer barrel assembly thus misleading the operator to believe the air rifle,to be completely empty of bbs,even after pumping and firing,when,in fact,a bb would still be present in the magazine.app.at.
on march,daisy filed a motion to dismiss the complaint arguing that a gun is a simple tool under michigan law and the dangers of pointing it at another person are open and obvious.on april,plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of daisy liability but apparently they failed to file a timely memorandum in support.on august,the parties appeared at a telephonic hearing before magistrate judge steven pepe.at that hearing,magistrate judge pepe granted the plaintiffs motion to amend their complaint to include the allegation that d efendant primary marketing target and principle sic consumers children and young adults and that t he model was particularly dangerous and defective when placed in the hands of minor children.app.at.the magistrate stated that defendant motion to dismiss will apply to the amended complaint.app.at.
when the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss one week later,on august,however,it gave no indication that it was aware of the recent amendment to the complaint.app.at.in oral argument,the parties agreed that judge woods may have been unaware of the amendment at the time he granted the motion to dismiss.in the same order,judge woods denied plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment as moot.this appeal followed.
the parties do not dispute that michigan state law applies in this diversity suit brought under.the task of this court,sitting in diversity,is to apply the same law as would be applied by michigan state courts.see erie tompkins.where a state highest court has spoken to an issue,we are bound by that decision unless we are convinced that the high court would overrule it if confronted with facts similar to those before us.see bernhardt polygraphic of.where a state appellate court has resolved an issue to which the high court has not spoken,we will normally treat such decisions as authoritative absent a strong showing that the state highest court would decide the issue differently.in re auto rental,cir.
the district court dismissed swix complaint in this case finding that he had failed to establish that daisy owed swix a duty of care.app.at.under michigan law,both a failure to warn claim and a defective design claim require a plaintiff to establish that the defendant owed him a duty of care.see davis mccourt,cir kirk hanes of north carolina,cir.there is also a defense under michigan law to the duty requirement in a failure to warn and in a defective design claim known as the simple tool rule.see fisher johnson milk,kirk,at.
in fisher,a failure to warn case,a milkman sold a patent attorney a wire carrier made to carry four bottles of milk.id.at.on arriving home from the market with his carrier containing four milk bottles,the attorney slipped on some ice in such a manner that the bottom of the carrier struck the sidewalk,causing the bottles to break.id.at.he extended a hand in order to break his fall and his palm landed on a piece of broken bottle,severely injuring his hand.the attorney brought suit against the manufacturer of the wire carrier.the court in fisher found that a manufacturer owes no duty to warn of an open and obvious danger associated with the use of a simple tool.davis,at discussing fisher.the parties do not dispute that this is a correct statement of law with respect to a failure to a warn claim.
is the simple tool rule an absolute defense to a defective design claim 
the parties do seem to disagree,however,whether the fact that a product is deemed a simple tool and the danger is open and obvious is an absolute defense to a defective design claim or whether the obviousness of a danger is merely one factor in the analysis of whether the risks are unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries.we agree with virtually every michigan court which has opined on the matter,all of which have suggested that the obviousness of a danger is merely one factor in the analysis of whether the risks are unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries.see,owens,as in fisher,the obviousness of the risks that inhere in some simple tools or products is a factor contributing to the conclusion that such products are not unreasonably dangerous.the test,however,is not whether the risks are obvious,but whether the risks were unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries cacevic simplimatic eng g,vacated in part on other grounds,a manufacturer in a case alleging design defects is not absolved of liability simply because the danger associated with the product simple or nonsimple is open and obvious.boumelhem bic,holding the same relying,inter alia,on owens and glittenberg doughboy recreational,adams perry furniture,the test in design defect cases concerning simple tools is whether the risks are unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries,overruled on other grounds by allied supply,tenaglia,restatement third of torts prod.liab.noting that a strong majority of courts including michigan in owens have rejected the open and obvious rule as an absolute defense and a cademic commentators have been almost unanimous in their criticism of the rule.the supreme court of michigan has explained why obvious dangers should be treated differently in the design defect context than in the failure to warn context.see glittenberg,at,at.in glittenberg,the court explained 
in the design defect context,obvious risk may unreasonably breach the duty to adopt a design that safely and feasibly guards against foreseeable misuse.because the manufacturer liability for choice of design is not determined solely by looking at the obvious nature of the alleged defect,obviousness of the danger does not preclude the possibility that an alternative design could reduce the risk of harm at a cost and in a manner that maintains the product utility.
in the failure to warn context,the obvious nature of the simple product potential danger serves the core purpose of the claim,it functions as an inherent warning that the risk is present.stated otherwise,if the risk is obvious from the characteristics of the product,the product itself telegraphs the precise warning that plaintiffs complain is lacking.
id.citations omitted.in other words,there is no need to warn of a danger where the danger is obvious,but in a design defect case,the court must also consider whether a manufacturer should have created the danger in the first place.for instance,the danger associated with a with steak knives for arms steak knife sally may be quite obvious,but it is equally clear that the risks associated with such a design choice far outweigh the utility.
our opinion in kirk is in accord.see.in kirk,we were not asked to decide whether the fact that a danger is open and obvious is an absolute defense to a defective design claim or whether the obviousness of a danger is merely one factor in the analysis of whether the risks are unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries.instead,the question presented to this court was whether the simple tool rule applies in design defect cases at all.id.
nonetheless,in deciding whether the simple tool rule applies to design defect cases,our discussion provided insight into the question whether the open and obvious nature of a danger is merely one factor to be considered or is dispositive.id.specifically,our opinion addressed whether fisher,which was argued to have established the rule that the obviousness of a danger is dispositive,was overruled by prentis yale manufacturing,which was argued to have replaced the dispositive rule with a reasonableness analysis.id.we concluded that prentis was actually consistent with fisher and that both cases found that the obviousness of the danger was simply one factor in the reasonableness analysis.id.at,even though fisher was decided prior to prentis,it also applied a pure negligence standard while the risks that glass bottles will break or that broken glass might injure someone are inarguably foreseeable,the court in fisher determined that such risks,as a matter of law,were not unreasonable given the obvious nature of the danger and the simple nature of the product.emphasis in original.kirk then applied the same reasonableness test of prentis and fisher to a bic lighter to conclude that no jury in light of the fact that the danger of lighters is obvious to their intended find that these lighters pose an unreasonable risk of harm.id.at,emphasis in original.therefore,kirk suggests that the test is not simply whether the danger is open and obvious,but instead whether the risks were unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries.id.at were we to reject fisher and adams,as kirk argues,we would have to hold that the determination of whether a particular design presents an unreasonable risk of foreseeable injury may never be resolved by the court on summary judgment.see also id.at 
daisy argues that the open and obvious nature of a danger is dispositive based on mallard hoffinger industries,we find the reasoning of mallard,however,to be unpersuasive.in mallard,the court discounted the guidance of the michigan supreme court,noting that w hile we agree with plaintiffs that the supreme court language in glittenberg appears to suggest that the open and obvious nature of the danger will not preclude any design defect claims,we conclude that the court was discussing general principles of design defect claims and not their applicability to simple products.see mallard.at,at.we are at a loss to see how the court in mallard could find that the supreme court was excluding simple products from its discussion of design defect claims,given that it held that i n the design defect context,obvious risk may unreasonably breach the duty to adopt a design that safely and feasibly guards against foreseeable misuse while i n the failure to warn context,the obvious nature of the simple product potential danger serves the core purpose of the claim.glittenberg,at,at quoted in full supra at mallard also discounts the relevant discussion in owens and glittenberg as dicta.mallard.at,at.as we have held,dicta can be of value in determining state law.see kirk,at.this is especially true here,where we have strong dicta from a variety of michigan courts,including the state highest court,all making the same point.finally,we note that mallard was decided prior to cacevic and without any apparent consideration of boumelhem.
therefore,for the reasons discussed supra,we find that the fact that a product may be a simple tool is not dispositive in a design defect obviousness of a danger is merely one factor in the analysis of whether the risks are unreasonable in light of the foreseeable injuries.the fact that a analysis may be involved,however,will not prevent a defective design claim involving a simple tool from being decided as a matter of law where reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.see kirk,at noting the appropriateness of summary judgment where the facts were clear and there was no genuine dispute as to the reasonableness of the manufacturer conduct glittenberg,at,at noting,in the context of a failure to warn claim,that a jury must consider the obviousness of the risk only if reasonable minds could differ with respect to the outcome boumelhem,at,at noting the propriety of the test but affirming grant of summary judgment under the circumstances adams.at,at same restatement third of torts prod.liab.a court may direct a verdict when it is convinced that,given the obviousness of the danger,it is not reasonable to require the adopting of an alternative design.
in sum,whether the danger associated with a simple tool is open and obvious will determine whether a manufacturer owes a duty to warn and is also an important factor in deciding a design defect claim.this inquiry requires us to address two questions.first,is a daisy air rifle a simple tool under michigan law second,if so,is the danger alleged to be associated with a daisy air rifle open and obvious 
is an air rifle a simple tool 
michigan caselaw does not provide a clear test for determining whether a product is a simple tool.however,the courts have categorized products as simple tools when one or both of the following conditions exist the products are not highly mechanized,thus allowing the users to maintain control over the products the intended use of the products does not place the users in obviously dangerous positions.davis,at.for example,courts have found hammers,knives,gas stoves,axes,buzz saws,propeller driven airplanes,trampolines and backyard pools to be simple tools.id.we have also found guns to be simple tools.see also treadway smith wesson,holding that a caliber revolver is a simple tool.as far as we are aware,no michigan court has specifically considered whether an air rifle or bb gun,as opposed to a firearm,is a simple tool.fortunately,this is the easier of the two questions which we must answer.swix does not argue that an air rifle is more highly mechanized than other guns.similarly,the intended use of an air rifle does not appear to place the user in a significantly different position than users of firearms.in short,swix complaint does not even attempt to distinguish an air rifle from a firearm in any way relevant to the determination of whether it is a simple tool.although swix argues that an air rifle can mislead the operator into believing it is empty when it is actually loaded,we have noted the same to be true of a firearm.see davis,at.therefore,we agree with the district court that swix has failed to demonstrate that an air rifle is anything but a simple tool.
is the danger alleged here to be associated with a daisy air rifle open and obvious 
the second question,whether the danger associated with a daisy air rifle is open and obvious,is more difficult.in answering this question,t he focus is the typical user perception and knowledge of whether the relevant condition or feature that creates the danger associated with use is fully apparent,widely known,commonly recognized,and anticipated by th
