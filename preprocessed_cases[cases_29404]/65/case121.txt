opinion of the court 
this appeal arises from the litigation mdl diet drug product liability litigation.the appeal concerns the validity of an amendment the sixth amendment to the nationwide class action settlement agreement the settlement agreement executed between appellants and american home products corporation wyeth in relation to the diet drugs litigation.the sixth amendment was approved by the district court in pretrial order pto.the amendment gives claimants who would otherwise have been bound by the settlement agreement the right to opt out of the agreement and proceed with tort litigation against wyeth in the event that the fund established to pay claims under the settlement agreement,the settlement trust becomes insolvent.under the sixth amendment,claimants rights to sue wyeth are subject to certain restrictions.because of these restrictions,appellants here argue that the district court should not have approved the sixth amendment as fair,adequate and reasonable.appellants further argue that they were deprived of due process in that they did not receive adequate notice of the risk of trust insolvency when they opted to be bound by the settlement agreement and did not receive adequate representation.
because we believe that the sixth amendment provides class members with additional rights that did not exist under the original settlement agreement specifically,the right to sue wyeth,albeit subject to certain conditions we will affirm the district court approval of the amendment as fair,adequate and reasonable.we reject the due process notice and adequate representation arguments,because those arguments relate to the original settlement agreement,the validity of which is not properly before this court,and have been previously and finally heard and rejected by this court.accordingly,we hold the sixth amendment to the settlement agreement to be valid.
factual background and procedural history 
prior to,wyeth sold two prescription drugs for the treatment of obesity,fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine,marketed as pondimin and redux.in september,the food and drug administration fda issued a press release reporting abnormal echocardiograms in a higher than expected percentage of patients taking the drugs.see press release,fda,fda announces withdrawal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine.subsequent studies suggested that the drugs may have been linked to serious cardiopulmonary side effects,including regurgitation the reverse flow of blood through a closed valve of the heart.
after the withdrawal of the diet drugs,individual suits and class actions were filed in state and federal courts.in december,the federal cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes in the eastern district of pennsylvania pursuant to mdl.in november,wyeth entered into a nationwide class action settlement agreement with users of the diet drugs in the united states.after conducting fairness proceedings,the district court in the eastern district of pennsylvania certified a settlement class and approved the settlement agreement,finding it fair,reasonable and adequate.see pto.the settlement agreement became final upon exhaustion of all appeals.the settlement agreement established the settlement trust to administer wyeth obligations to class members who agreed to participate in the settlement.
diet drug users who wished to opt out of the settlement agreement could do so by filing an initial opt out form by march.putative class members were informed of the right to opt out through an elaborate and extensive plan of notice,which included weeks of television,print,and internet advertising,patient notification materials provided through pharmacists and prescribing doctors,a number,and a detailed notice package sent to all possible class members whose names and addresses were known or who called the number.pto.persons who timely exercised initial opt out rights were free to pursue any and all claims against wyeth.those who did not remained members of the class and agreed to be bound by the conditions and benefits of the settlement agreement.upon approving the settlement agreement,the district court entered pto,which expressly bars and enjoins all class members from asserting,continuing to prosecute any settled claim against wyeth 
the settlement agreement contained an exception to this bar,permitting class members who met specific physical requirements diagnosed as having a severity of regurgitation defined as fda positive to pursue intermediate opt out rights.these rights allowed class members to opt out of the settlement at a date beyond the initial opt out period without wyeth asserting statute of limitations defenses and to pursue claims against wyeth subject to certain limitations.these limitations included a prohibition against seek ing punitive,exemplary,or any multiple damages.app.at.
diet drug users who currently suffer from severe regurgitation or from moderate regurgitation with complicating features,or who have less severe conditions that progress to the more serious levels in the fifteen years following execution of the settlement agreement,may claim and recover compensation under the settlement.the amount of their recovery is determined by damage matrices that assess factors such as severity and length of illness to calculate the damage award alternatively,class members with conditions that would allow them to qualify for these matrix benefits and who fulfill other eligibility requirements set out in the agreement may exercise opt out rights and pursue tort claims against wyeth,so long as they have not already made a claim for compensation under the settlement agreement.once a class member discovers that his condition is serious enough to qualify him for benefits,the class member must make an election as to which option to pursue.the settlement agreement specifically provides that a class member may not exercise a opt out right after claiming any matrix compensation benefits.app.at.as with the intermediate opt out,class members exercising opt out rights will not be blocked by statute of limitations defenses,but are restricted from asserting punitive,exemplary,or multiple damages.
thus,according to the system set out in the settlement agreement,any diet drug users who fail to exercise initial,intermediate,or opt out rights are bound by the terms of the settlement agreement and its bar against attempting to pursue any claims against wyeth.for those who remain in the settlement,a claim for matrix benefits is made by submitting a green form to the settlement trust.wyeth funds payment of matrix benefits through deposits into the trust.under the settlement agreement,wyeth funding obligation is limited to billion,plus any increase in value of the principal of the trust.the fact of this limit was made known to class members through the class notice.during the fairness hearing before the district court,experts testified as to their conclusion that,after considering extensive epidemiological and demographic evidence,billion was more than sufficient to pay all matrix claims anticipated under the settlement.based on this evidence,to which none of the parties objected,the district court found the funds sufficient to satisfy all likely claims.
however,after approval of the settlement agreement,the trust was inundated with green form claims for matrix benefits in a volume not anticipated by the experts who testified at the fairness hearing.as the district court determined,a significant proportion of the filings came from a few law firms that represented large numbers of claimants.the district court also observed that,in conducting their claims process,these firms carried out mass screening programs in which cardiologists retained by the firms made unreasonable judgments on a broad scale concerning the existence,history,nature,and degree of disease claimed.pto.the claims process was further frustrated by the fact that several of the green forms submitted were incomplete,which made it impossible for trust administrators to assess eligibility for the particular matrix benefit claimed.to ameliorate the situation,the district court ordered that all claims for matrix benefits be subjected to audit.
despite this effort,the risk remained that the number of claims would exhaust the trust available funds.additionally,the remedy intended under the settlement agreement to address the problem of insufficient matrix funds,the opt out,was not available to class members who had already filed claims for matrix benefits.therefore,in response to the potential risk of trust insolvency,wyeth and class counsel executed a proposed sixth amendment to the settlement agreement,which would create a new opt out right for class members who claimed matrix benefits by may,and were found medically eligible for these benefits,but would otherwise go without payment under the original settlement agreement in the event of funding insufficiency under the sixth amendment opt out right,claimants may pursue a tort action but may not name any defendant other than wyeth,may not join any other plaintiff other than a derivative plaintiff,and may not consolidate their action with any other the sixth amendment opt out right is also subject to the same restrictions placed on the intermediate and opt out in that persons exercising this opt out may not pursue punitive,exemplary,or multiple damages.in addition to the opt out provision,the sixth amendment also sets forth criteria for the required level of completedness of the green form submitted for matrix benefits by extension,this provision allows the trust to determine whether a class member is qualified to exercise a sixth amendment opt out.
after conducting an approval hearing,the district court issued pto,finding the sixth amendment fair,reasonable and adequate.however,appellants argue that the sixth amendment deprives them of their full litigation rights by imposing new restrictions on their ability to pursue tort claims against wyeth,limiting the defendants whom they may name and join,and barring consolidation of actions.related to this argument is appellants claim that the class notice pertaining to the original settlement agreement was inadequate for not specifically informing diet drug users of the risk of trust insolvency and that their representation was inadequate as a result of this risk of insolvency.thus,appellants contend that class members affected by the risk of insolvency were denied due process and should be permitted to opt out of the settlement unconditionally.
ii.discussion 
fairness,adequacy and reasonableness of the sixth.additional rights provided by the sixth amendment 
under federal rule of civil procedure e a,a court must approve any settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise of the claims,issues,or defenses of a certified class.subsection c states that t he court may approve a settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise that would bind class members only after a hearing and on finding that the settlement,voluntary dismissal,or compromise is fair,reasonable,and adequate.in pto,the district court held that this standard for analyzing the fairness of a proposed settlement under rule e should also be applied to analyze the fairness of a proposed amendment to the settlement.see walsh great atl.pac.tea,cir a court may approve a proposed class action settlement if it is fair,adequate,and reasonable to class members.
class counsel and wyeth argue that the sixth amendment provided new rights to class members that the original settlement agreement did not contain.they stress that,in evaluating an amendment to a class action settlement,the court should consider whether the amendment provides additional benefits and protections for the class.see,in re sulzer prosthesis liab,wl,at,granting approval to amended settlement agreement that increased overall value of the settlement and eliminated liens on defendants assets for the benefits of.one purpose for which it is appropriate to approve such an amendment is adjusting for changed circumstances,particularly in light of the parties experience in implementing the agreement.see,in re joint dists.asbestos,d.
the new sixth amendment opt out right provides class members who claim matrix benefits with at least some protection against the risk that their injuries would go uncompensated if the settlement trust becomes insolvent at some future time.as it is now,wyeth financial obligations to the settlement trust are subject to a specified maximum under the settlement agreement.wyeth,therefore,has no further obligation to pay otherwise eligible matrix claimants once its billion funding contribution is exhausted.
appellants do not argue that any provision of the settlement agreement obligates wyeth beyond this amount if the trust can not satisfy all claims.rather,appellants claim that class members did not receive adequate notice under rule e of the risk of trust insolvency.thus,they argue from principles of contract and equity discussed more fully below that any unpaid class members would not have received the full benefit of their agreement under the settlement due to a mutual mistake of fact concerning the trust capacity to satisfy all potential claims.therefore,appellants contend that the settlement agreement is void and that unpaid claimants should be released from the agreement and permitted to sue wyeth without restriction.
even if appellants are correct in these contract and equity arguments,the district court found that class members would suffer no harm by approval of the sixth amendment.the court explained that because wyeth obligation to the class is capped at billion,the amendment provides a new benefit by providing those matrix claimants who would otherwise go unpaid with a specific contractual right to pursue their compensatory claims against wyeth by opting out of the settlement.app.at.this right was nonexistent under the original settlement agreement as eligible class members who filed green forms claiming matrix benefits relinquished their opt out rights and,consequently,agreed to be bound by the settlement.on the other hand,if appellants are correct that exhaustion of funds voids the settlement agreement and leaves them free to pursue their tort rights without restriction,then class members will have lost nothing by the district court approval of the amendment.id.
further,the amendment provides that,if the trust becomes insolvent,wyeth has the option of paying any eligible unpaid claims although it would have no contractual obligation to do so or leaving them unpaid,subject to the sixth amendment opt out.this provision was intended to give wyeth an incentive to fund such benefits voluntarily in order to avoid defending tort claims by unpaid matrix claimants a threat that did not exist before the amendment.consolidated brief at.however,appellants argue that wyeth always had a right to voluntarily fund unpaid matrix claims despite the sixth amendment and,therefore,that this provision of the amendment conferred no additional benefit on appellants.appellant brief at.we are not convinced by appellants argument here.it is true that if wyeth chooses to pay a claim in the event of funding exhaustion,then the compensated claimant will simply have received his benefit under the settlement.however,appellants can not view this provision of the amendment in isolation.the amendment as a whole provides an additional benefit to claimants through its new opt out right in addition to the incentive it gives wyeth to pay claims voluntarily.a claimant chance of recovering damages is only strengthened by the added incentive provided by the opt out and voluntary payment provisions of the sixth amendment combined.thus,the sixth amendment provides all claimants with additional protections against being left that did not exist under the original settlement agreement.
restrictions on the sixth amendment opt out right 
appellants claim that the sixth amendment unfairly and unreasonably restricts the opt out right that it provides.first,appellants assert that the sixth amendment opt out strips class members of their rights to join plaintiffs and name additional defendants in any lawsuit filed against wyeth.we are not persuaded by this argument because,as discussed above,the sixth amendment still provides class members with an opt out right that did not exist un
