this products liability case concerns the question of standing based on a theory of enhanced risk of future injury.tim kerin appeals the dismissal of his case against titeflex corporation gastite titeflex for an alleged product defect in gastite corrugated stainless steel tubing csst,which causes risks of csst being vulnerable to failure after lightning strikes.the district court of massachusetts dismissed for lack of standing because kerin injury was too speculative.kerin titeflex,cv map,wl,at.
we do not hold that increased risk of harm from product vulnerability to lightning strikes can never give rise to standing.but in this case,kerin fails to allege either facts sufficient to assess the probability of future injury or instances of actual damage where the cause is clear,and concedes that csst meets applicable regulatory standards specifically addressing the risk.
we affirm dismissal based on lack of standing.
facts procedural background 
kerin owns a house in florida which has gastite csst installed to provide gas for his outdoor firepit.his complaint purported to bring a class action against titeflex,the manufacturer of gastite,for an alleged product defect.he brought the claim under diversity jurisdiction in massachusetts,where titeflex is located.
introduced in the,csst is used in home and commercial structures throughout the country.it has since been discovered that csst may fail when exposed to electrical insult,such as that caused by lightning.see fire prot.ass n,nfpa faqs hereinafter nfpa faqs,available at https last visited,discussing a mitigation measure.both direct and indirect lightning strikes can cause an electrical arc that can puncture csst,igniting the natural gas within.kerin alleges that csst significant risks are,and that industry experts recommend several possible remedies,including complete removal.kerin also alleges that,a s of august,fires involving lightning and csst have been reported throughout the united states.titeflex has allegedly been aware of the risks that its product creates since at least,and developed a new product,flashshield,in to address risks associated with lightning.but despite these known risks,gastite csst continues to meet code requirements and is still used in buildings throughout the country.see,national fuel gas code,ansi nfpa ed.national fuel gas code,ansi nfpa ed.bd.of state exam rs of plumbers gas fitters,board policy corrugated stainless steel tubing csst,hereinafter.board policy,available at http last visited.
kerin july complaint asserted four causes of action under massachusetts law,each based on allegations of gastite csst vulnerability to lightning strikes strict liability for design and manufacturing defects,negligence in design ing and failing to test the product,negligence in failure to warn,and strict liability in failure to warn.kerin does not allege that this vulnerability of his home csst to lightning strikes has manifested in any actual harm.rather,he seeks damages that may be measured as his overpayment or as the cost of remedying the safety issue.
the district court dismissed for lack of standing,stating that it is obvious that plaintiff can not clear the injury in fact hurdle.kerin,wl,at.the court reasoned that the strand of conjecture is simply too attenuated,requiring both a lightning strike and one that effects a puncture in the csst.id.the court also concluded that,even if kerin had standing,kerin failed to state a claim because he failed to allege an applicable standard against which titeflex due care could be measured as required to claim economic injury from a defective product under massachusetts law.id.citing iannacchino ford motor.
we do not adopt the district court reasoning to the extent it relies on the proposition that lightning strikes present a textbook example of speculative risk and remote possibilities which are simply insufficient for injury in fact.mountain states legal found.glickman,finding standing for increased risk of wildfire,a probabilistic event.although t he capriciousness of a lightning strike is the stuff of folklore,kerin,wl,at,the law of probabilistic standing is evolving and it is conceivable that product vulnerability to lightning might,in some circumstances,constitute injury.but where,as here,the alleged present harm depends solely on the risk of some future injury,we must proceed cautiously.see ctr.for law educ.dep t of,sentelle,w ere all purely speculative increased risks deemed injurious,the entire requirement of actual or imminent injury would be rendered moot.because kerin fails to allege risk sufficient to find injury,we affirm the district court dismissal.
standard of review 
the existence of standing is a legal question,which we review de novo.see katz pershing,llc,cir.when reviewing a grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,we accept as true all fact s and indulge all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.see id.at quoting deniz mun y of guaynabo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we may affirm dismissal on any ground made manifest by the record.see id.at quoting rom√°n cancel united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because no class was certified below,our review is limited to whether kerin himself has standing.see id.
standing based on enhanced risk of injury 
our judicial power is limited by article iii of the constitution to actual cases and controversies.see warth seldin,d.one element of the requirement is that plaintiffs must establish that they have standing to sue.see blum holder,cir quoting clapper amnesty int l usa,d internal quotation marks omitted.this requirement is founded in concern about the proper and properly limited role of the courts in a democratic society.id.at quoting summers earth island,d.
to satisfy this standing requirement,a plaintiff must sufficiently plead three elements injury in fact,traceability,and redressability.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.an injury in fact is an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.see id.at internal citations omitted quoting whitmore arkansas,d.imminence,which plays a central role in cases of probabilistic standing,is concededly a somewhat elastic concept.see clapper.at quoting lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted.i ts purpose is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for article iii purposes.see id.quoting lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted.
cases claiming standing based on risk,such as this,potentially involve two injuries a possible future injury that may or may not happen,the harm threatened and a present injury that is the cost or inconvenience created by the increased risk of the first,future injury,the cost of mitigation.see blum,at quoting mangual rotger sabat,cir identifying two injuries in context of first amendment challenge the present injury,a chilling effect,caused by the threat of future injury,criminal prosecution see also monsanto geertson seed farms,d recognizing that present costs to mitigate risk of crop infection would occur even if crops were never actually infected.these cases require caution,because although one of the alleged injuries is present,satisfying imminence,that injury may still be speculative.this is because the alleged present injury depends on the plaintiff response to an increased risk,and whether his or her response constitutes a reaction for which compensation is owed or constitutes a mere attempt to manufacture standing.compare friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d finding standing where plaintiffs responded to increased risk of health hazards from pollution by refraining from use of the north tyger river,with clapper.at denying standing for incurr ing costs as a reasonable reaction to a risk where risked harm was not certainly impending.for this reason,cases claiming standing based on risk fall into at least two categories.
in the first,where standing is more frequently found,the present injury is linked to a statute or regulation or standard of conduct that allegedly has been or will soon be violated.see,laidlaw,at baur veneman,cir.cases in this first cat
