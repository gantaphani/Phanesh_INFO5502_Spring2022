appellant brandi fox fox filed a medical malpractice action against her surgeon,asserting his negligence during surgery caused a perforation of her small intestine and subsequent complications.during his deposition,the surgeon first raised the possibility that the perforation was caused by a malfunctioning stapler.fox then filed an amended complaint asserting a products liability cause of action against the manufacturer of the stapler,respondent ethicon,ethicon.the amended complaint was filed three months after the deposition,but months after the initial surgery.
ethicon filed a demurrer,asserting the cause of action was time barred by the statute of limitations.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend based on the principle of imputed simultaneous discovery of causes of action,w hen a plaintiff has cause to sue based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence the statute of limitations begins to run as to all potential defendants.squibb superior court th,d,disapproved on other grounds in norgart upjohn cal th,fn,d.
although we agree with the result reached in squibb,we reject its bright line rule of imputed simultaneous discovery of causes of action and conclude the delayed discovery of fox products liability claim should be analyzed based on the facts and circumstances relevant to that claim.therefore,fox should be given an opportunity to allege facts explaining why she did not have reason to discover earlier the factual basis of her products liability claim.accordingly,we reverse judgment and direct the trial court to grant fox leave to amend.
facts and proceedings 
on april,fox underwent gastric bypass surgery performed by herbert gladen.during this surgery,fox was unconscious as the result of general anesthesia and,thus,did not observe the procedures or equipment used.after the record is not clear as to the exact length of went home.however,she returned to the hospital a few days after the surgery because she did not feel well.her condition deteriorated,and she was taken to the operating room for exploratory surgery.gladen found a perforation or leak at the staple closure of the proximal jejunum and attempted to close it.gladen operative report for the exploration and remedial action states,no reason could be identified for the perforation.subsequently,fox remained hospitalized until march,and apparently required additional surgeries.
on april,in accordance with code of civil procedure section fox served a notice of intent to commence action on gladen and the two hospitals where the surgery and subsequent care took place.prelitigation discussions with these health care providers did not resolve fox claim of professional negligence.
on june,fox filed a complaint in fresno county superior court for medical malpractice against gladen and the two hospitals alleging that defendants lacked the necessary knowledge and skill to properly care for fox condition and were negligent and unskillful in the diagnosis,treatment and prescription procedures utilized in treating her condition.the negligence claimed is for negligently performing,surgical,and care so as to cause injuries and damages to fox.
the complaint was filed on the judicial council form for personal injury complaints and named as defendants gladen,the two hospitals,and does to,inclusive.the complaint alleged,a t all times herein mentioned,the defendants named herein as does through,inclusive,were the agents,servants,and employees of each of the remaining defendants,and in doing the things hereinafter alleged,were acting within the course and scope of their authority as such agents,servants and employees,and with the permission and consent of their.
during his august,deposition,gladen testified that when he performed a postsurgery exploration of fox abdomen he found a leak at the staple closure of the small intestine.gladen further testified that the bowel had been stapled using an ethicon stapler,the stapler had been furnished by the hospital,and he had experienced occasions where the this type of ethicon stapler was used and subsequent leaks occurred.
on november,fox filed a first amended complaint that restated her negligence cause of action against gladen and the hospitals,added ethicon as a named defendant,and added a products liability cause of action against ethicon that alleged she was injured by an ethicon stapler on or about april.the claims against ethicon were set forth on the judicial council form for a products liability cause of action fox checked the boxes relating to counts for strict liability concerning the design,manufacture and assembly of the product,negligence,and breach of implied warranty.
the first amended complaint also added the allegation that fox did not discover,nor suspect,nor was there any means through which her reasonable diligence would have revealed,or through which she would have suspected the ethicon stapler as a cause of her injury until the deposition of gladen was taken on august.the first amended complaint continued to name as defendants does through.
ethicon filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint on the ground that the products liability cause of action against ethicon showed on its face that it was by the statute of limitations contained in former section,subdivision.
in her declaration opposing the demurrer,fox stated that she was never told during the course of her care and treatment subsequent to the gastric bypass surgery that the stapler had malfunctioned in any way or was responsible for the postsurgery problems she suffered did not believe she was told that a stapler type instrument was to be used on her during the gastric bypass surgery and first became aware of a possible stapler malfunction when her attorneys told her about the doctor testimony after his deposition.fox declaration also states her willingness to file a second amended complaint to clarify the facts that support her position that until the deposition of her doctor she had no suspicions,and no basis on which a reasonable person would have had suspicions,that ethicon stapler had malfunctioned.
fox attorney filed a declaration stating that neither the operative report nor the reparative operative report indicated that the stapler had malfunctioned or misfired.the declaration also asserts that gladen deposition was taken during the normal course of discovery in a medical malpractice lawsuit,fox pursued the lawsuit and discovery with reasonable diligence,and fox could allege that during the entire time of gladen care of fox after the surgery he never mentioned to fox a malfunction or defect in the stapler he used in her surgery.
on may,the trial court issued a tentative ruling indicating its intention to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.in concluding the products liability cause of action was time barred,the trial court relied upon norgart upjohn,supra,cal th,d,norgart and squibb superior court,supra,th,d squibb.in applying those cases,the trial court determined that when a plaintiff has cause to sue based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence in this case suspicion of medical malpractice by the doctor and hospitals,the statute of limitations begins to run as to all defendants,including a manufacturer subject to a products liability claim.the tentative ruling also stated fox failed to show that an amendment could overcome the statute of limitations defense.
after hearing argument from counsel,the trial court adopted the tentative ruling as its order the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.subsequently,a judgment was entered in favor of ethicon.fox appeals from that judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a judgment sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.the reviewing court must reverse the judgment if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory,or the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.blank kirwan cal d.the burden of proving a reasonable possibility of cure is squarely on the plaintiff.ibid.
ii.statute of limitations and the discovery rule 
general rule for accrual of a cause of action 
under the statute of limitations for personal injury actions in effect at the time fox filed her complaint see former,subd,as amended by stats,ch,fox was required to bring her products liability cause of action within one year after its accrual.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,wrongful death searle superior court d.personal injury.the general rule for the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of it elements.norgart at,d.the essential elements of a cause of action are described generically by the supreme court as wrongdoing or wrongful conduct,cause or causation,and harm or injury.ibid.
postponed accrual under the discovery rule 
the general rule regarding accrual of a cause of action for purposes of former section,subdivision is subject to an exception referred to as the discovery rule.jolly eli lilly cal d,personal injury allegedly caused by defective drug jolly.under the discovery rule,the accrual of the cause of action is postponed until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.a reason to discover the cause of action exists when the plaintiff has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.id.at,d.
a reason to suspect a factual basis for the elements of a cause of action exists when the plaintiff has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,jolly,supra,cal d at.ignorance of legal theories or the legal significance of facts does not delay the running of the statute.norgart at,d,jolly at.furthermore,a plaintiff need not be aware of the specific facts necessary to establish the claim that is a process contemplated by pretrial discovery.once the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing,and therefore an incentive to sue,she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights.so long as a suspicion exists,it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.jolly at.
the language used by the supreme court in articulating the discovery rule plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover norgart,supra,cal th at,d,and plaintiff suspects or should suspect jolly,supra,cal d at,clearly indicates that the discovery rule contains a subjective alternative and an objective alternative.the words plaintiff suspects refer to a subjective test requiring actual suspicion by the plaintiff that the injury was caused by wrongdoing.kitzig nordquist th,d,citing jolly at.the words plaintiff should suspect refer to an objective test requiring a showing that a reasonable person would have suspected the injury was caused by wrongdoing.kitzig at,d.
applying the subjective and objective alternatives to a particular case is recognized as presumptively in the domain of the jury squibb,supra,th at,d or usually for the trier of fact rose fife d.nevertheless,these issues may be resolved by the court as a matter of law in certain circumstances.while resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact,where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are susceptible of only one legitimate inference,summary judgment is proper.jolly,supra,cal d at.for example,norgart,jolly,squibb,and rose fife are all cases in which the application of the discovery rule was decided in favor of the defendants as a matter of law on motions for summary judgment.
based on the foregoing principles concerning the discovery rule and the elements of a cause of action,a fundamental or basic approach to the delayed accrual of a cause of action for purposes of former section,subdivision involves the following steps.first,the identification of each element of the cause of question of law.second,as to each element,a determination of whether or not the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the factual basis for that question of fact.third,as to the remaining elements,a determination of whether or not the plaintiff had an actual suspicion of the factual basis for those question of fact.fourth,as to the remaining elements of the cause of action not actually known or suspected by the plaintiff,a determination of whether a reasonable person would have suspected the factual basis for each such a question of fact.see rose fife,supra,d at.reasonability is generally a question of fact.this method of analysis subsequently will be referred to as the basic approach to the discovery rule 
in rose fife,supra,the second district applied the discovery rule to a medical malpractice cause of action and a products liability cause of action using the basic approach,although it did not label its method or number its steps.the second district found as a matter of law that the plaintiff suspected or should have suspected that the manufacturer of her intrauterine device iud wronged her by supplying a defective product,and her doctor wronged her by prescribing it.rose fife,supra,d at.as to the elements of injury and causation,when plaintiff was hospitalized with a pelvic infection she was told by two doctors that the iud caused the infection and one of those doctors told her that she was no doubt sterile because of her infection and high fever.id.at.as to the element of wrongdoing by the remaining element of her products liability cause of than one year before filing her lawsuit,plaintiff was suspicious of iud per se,worried about using one without having had children,and alerted to the dangers of iuds by the media.id.at.the second district inferred from this uncontradicted evidence plaintiff suspected or should have suspected the manufacturer of her iud of wrongdoing and issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to grant the manufacturer motion for summary judgment.id.at.
squibb rule of simultaneous discovery 
in the squibb case,the fourth district did not use the basic approach to determine if there was a delay in the plaintiff discovery of a products liability cause of action against the manufacturer of her silicone breast implants.instead,the fourth district reinterpreted the jolly test to create the following version of the discovery rule when a plaintiff has cause to sue based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence the statute starts to run as to all potential defendants bms rule.squibb,supra,th at,d,italics in original.it appears the jolly test referred to by the fourth district is the often quoted statement that the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing,that someone had done something wrong to her.bernson industries cal th at,d,italics added bernson,quoting jolly,supra,cal d at.
because the bms rule is based on the discussion and holding in jolly,we first consider whether the bms rule was mandated by the holding in jolly and subsequent decisions by the supreme court.
bms rule not mandated by supreme court precedent 
in norgart,the supreme court most recent decision applying the delayed discovery rule to a products liability cause of action,the supreme court had the opportunity to approve and apply the bms rule,but left its status undecided.see norgart,supra,cal th,d.
in norgart,parents sued the manufacturer of the prescription drug halcion for the wrongful death of their daughter six years after the daughter suicide was allegedly caused by the drug side effects.at the time of the daughter death in,the father suspected some outside agent had caused her to commit suicide.prior to the death,the parents were aware of their daughter depression and prior suicide attempts.soon after her death,the father had reason to learn of a connection between her suicide and halcion because the connection was disclosed by the package insert upjohn prepared.the insert cautioned about the possibility the drug could intensify depression and mentioned suicide and intentional overdoses.under these circumstances,the supreme court found as a matter of law that the parents had reason to suspect wrongdoing by upjohn in manufacturing and distributing halcion soon after their daughter suicide.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court mentioned the bms rule in norgart but did not explicitly approve or disapprove it w e need not resolve any conflict between the holding of the court of appeal in squibb and the holding of the court of appeal below.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.however,the supreme court did disapprove of another aspect of the squibb court reading of jolly.see norgart,supra,cal th at,fn,d,a plaintiff is not required to do more than suspect a factual basis for the elements of a cause of action to discover it.
in norgart,the supreme court did not need to address the status of the bms rule or rely on imputed simultaneous discovery of causes of action because it determined that,even under the version of the discovery rule the first district had adopted below in norgart,the start of the limitation period was not sufficiently delayed to save plaintiffs causes of action.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,the supreme court found the undisputed facts showed the parents should have suspected the alleged wrongdoing by upjohn soon after their daughter suicide.id.at,d.
if the bms rule had been mandated by jolly or other supreme court decisions,it is unlikely that the supreme court would have expressly left its status undecided in norgart.a closer look at jolly will be helpful.
a direct analysis of jolly shows that the bms rule is an extension of its holding.the jolly case concerned a drug,diethylstilbestrol des,that the plaintiff mother had taken during her pregnancy to prevent miscarriage.plaintiff,who was born in,learned in that her mother had taken des and that des daughters could suffer injuries.plaintiff had a checkup in and was diagnosed as having adenosis,a precancerous condition that required monitoring.in,plaintiff underwent surgery to remove abnormal tissue and in underwent a complete hysterectomy and partial vaginectomy to remove malignancy.jolly,supra,cal d at.during her deposition,plaintiff testified that in she believed des was a defective drug,someone had done something wrong to her,and she should be compensated.jolly,supra,cal d at,fn.also during,plaintiff was aware of lawsuits against des manufacturers,but she believed she had no cause of action because she could not identify the particular manufacturer of the drug her mother took during pregnancy.id.at.plaintiff did not file her lawsuit until nearly a year after the supreme court decided sindell abbott laboratories cal d,and held that a plaintiff who is unable to identify the particular manufacturer of the des that injured her may jointly sue all the manufacturers of that drug on the theory of enterprise liability.
in jolly,the supreme court held that plaintiff cause of action did not accrue when she learned of the sindell decision.jolly,supra,cal d at.furthermore,plaintiff ignorance of the identity of the particular manufacturer of the des used by plaintiff mother did not delay the accrual of her cause of action.subsequently,in bernson,the supreme court stated that the rationale for distinguishing between ignorance of the wrongdoer and ignorance of the injury itself appears to be premised on the commonsense assumption that once the plaintiff is aware of the injury,the applicable limitations period often effectively extended by the filing of a doe complaint normally affords sufficient opportunity to discover the identity of all the wrongdoers.bernson,supra,cal th at,d,cause of action for libel against persons who allegedly concealed their identities.
on one hand,the bms rule can be derived from a literal reading of the statement in jolly that a statute of limitations starts to runs when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that someone had done something wrong to plaintiff.also,the bms rule appears consistent with the rationale stated in bernson that once the plaintiff is aware of the injury,the applicable limitations period often effectively extended by the filing of a doe complaint normally affords sufficient opportunity to discover the identity of all the wrongdoers.bernson,supra,cal th at,d.the bms rule is supported by broadly interpreting this statement of rationale,particularly the phrase identity of all the wrongdoers,to mean that the applicable discovery period is normally sufficient not only to discover the identity of the person who committed the suspected wrong but also to discover unsuspected wrongs.
on the other hand,the fourth district in squibb went beyond the facts of jolly when it created a rule of imputed simultaneous discovery of causes of action for medical malpractice and products liability.in both bernson and jolly,the plaintiffs actually suspected the wrongdoing but could not identify the person who did the wrong.bernson,supra,cal th at,d,plaintiff had a copy of the libelous document,but not know its author or distributor jolly,supra,cal d at,plaintiff actually suspected des was a defective drug but could not identity which manufacturer made it.in squibb,the plaintiff claimed she did not suspect the manufacturer of her silicone breast implant did anything wrong because she did not actually suspect a defect in the product.
this factual difference between ignorance of the identity of who did a suspected wrong and ignorance of the wrong itself is legally significant.the identity of the that made a defective product is not an essential element of a products liability cause of action and therefore ignorance of wrongdoer identity will not delay the running of the statute of limitations.bernson,supra,cal th at,d.in contrast,the existence of the potential defect in the product,the manufacturer wrongdoing,is one of the three generic elements essential to a cause of action.clark baxter healthcare,supra,th at,d triable issue of fact as to when plaintiff knew or suspected wrongfulness component of cause of action regarding defective manufacture of latex gloves see norgart,supra,cal th at,d,regarding generic elements.moreover,the significance of this distinction was recognized by the supreme court when it stated the failure to discover,or have reason to discover,the identity of the defendant does not postpone the accrual of a cause of action,whereas a like failure concerning the cause of action itself does.id.at,d.
in addition,the complaint in jolly asserted a single type of manufacture and distribution of defective which all of the defendants potentially shared liability under the market share or enterprise liability theory recognized by the supreme court in sindell abbott laboratories,supra,cal d.in contrast,squibb involved two types of potential by plaintiff treating physician and production of a defective silicone breast implant by the manufacturer.
thus,we conclude the factual differences between squibb and jolly lead to the conclusion that the bms rule is not a principle inherent in the jolly holding,but is an extension of that holding.
choosing between the basic approach and the bms rule 
having determined that the bms rule is not mandated by prior supreme court holdings,we next discuss why we find it inappropriate to adopt and apply the bright line bms rule in this case.instead,we follow the method of analysis used by the second district in rose fife,supra,which is essentially the basic approach we have outlined.
the trial court here decided to apply the bms rule to the facts of this case,causing it to sustain ethicon demurrer ethicon argues we should follow the bms rule because it is a viable and unblemished rule of law since the supreme court did not criticize or disapprove it in norgart.in response,fox argues the facts of this case are distinguishable from the facts of squibb and the holding in squibb should not be extended to apply to a case where the plaintiff did not know a particular product was to be used on her,could not observe the injury the product may have caused,and did not learn of the possibility of wrongdoing connected to the product,a product defect,until the doctor who performed the operation and used the product testified about that possible defect in his deposition.
one method of analyzing the bms rule of imputed simultaneous discovery is to restate the actual holding as well as the rule itself in terms of the basic approach.
squibb held the limitation period on the plaintiff products liability cause of action against the manufacturer of her silicone breast implant began to run at the same time plaintiff suspected negligence by her treating physician.squibb,supra,th at,d.because it would be highly fictionalized to restate this holding in terms of the subjective alternative of the discovery rule actual suspicion,we will use the objective alternative.stated in terms of what a reasonable person should have suspected,the fourth district in effect held that based on the information available to plaintiff when she suspected professional negligence by her treating physician,she also should have suspected that her implant was defective.
it appears the result in squibb would have been the same if the fourth district had applied the basic approach because the facts of that case showed that plaintiff should have suspected her implant was defective.in squibb,the plaintiff implant was ruptured in an altercation in.by,plaintiff knew that the implant had ruptured,that silicone was migrating down her arm and that the silicone was a cause of physical injury in the form of ulcerations.squibb,supra,th at,d.plaintiff argued she did not actually suspect the manufacturer of the implant of wrongdoing because she had been told that silicone was an inert substance that could do no harm by itself.id.at,d.instead of applying a rule of simultaneous discovery of causes of action,the fourth district could have held that a reasonable person should have suspected the implant was defective at some point prior to april,one year before she filed her complaint,because plaintiff should have suspected that what she had been told about silicone doing no harm was not true since she knew the silicone was a cause of her ulcerations.
with respect to the bms rule itself it can be restated using the objective alternative in the basic approach as follows when a plaintiff knows,suspects or has reason to suspect a factual basis for negligence by one potential defendant,then a plaintiff also has,as a matter of law,reason to suspect a factual basis for all potential wrongdoing by all potential defendants.
when the consequences that flow from this restatement of the bms rule are examined,we find the rule is too broad to be accepted without limitation.for example,if a reasonable plaintiff suspects malpractice by the surgeon in connection with an operation,then that plaintiff,to be objectively reasonable in the eyes of the bms rule,must also suspect every manufacturer of every piece of equipment and each material used in connection with the operation.this suspicion would include manufacturers of scalpels,clamps,sponges,latex gloves,staplers,sutures and other items.for example,applying the bms rule to this case would imply that fox also should have suspected her slow healing after the operation was caused by a material that was toxic or to which she was allergic and that this material was one of the items used in her surgery.clark baxter healthcare,supra,th at,d plaintiff not aware that chemical substances may have been added to latex gloves that cause her severe allergic reaction a triable issue of fact existed with respect to when she should have suspected the latex gloves might have been defectively manufactured.similarly,in the context of accidents involving negligence,the bms rule also would require the injured plaintiff to suspect a defect in every manufactured item involved in the accident or the causal chain of events leading to the accident.
requiring as a rule of law that a plaintiff exercise such a high degree of suspicion,without regard to the actual facts known or available to the plaintiff and perhaps in contradiction to those facts disconnects the discovery rule from the facts of the case.because the imputed suspicions of the bms rule are disconnected from the facts,that rule will produce a different result than the basic approach in cases where the trier of fact would have found the cause of action was timely,the plaintiff had no reason to suspect its factual basis before the applicable limitations period,and meritorious furthermore,to deal with such imputed suspicions,drafters of complaints seeking to comply with the view of objective reasonableness embodied in the bms rule would be required to include allegations that would reach all potential wrongdoing by all potential wrongdoers.these pleading requirements necessitated by the bms rule would be a regression to the more formalistic pleading requirements of bygone years.
in addition,requiring the pleading of all potential wrongs committed by all potential defendants in order to take advantage of relation back would result in an expansion of section beyond its literal terms section addresses doe pleading when a plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a defendant,but does not mention situations where the plaintiff does not know or actually suspect wrongdoing of a known person or wrongdoing of an unknown person.
in addition to the foregoing implications of the bms rule,that rule also creates a pitfall in cases where the plaintiff has relied upon the extension in section to extend the time for filing a professional negligence action against a health care provider beyond the period set forth in section.subdivision d of section does not appear to extend the statute of limitations for causes of action other than professional negligence.see noble superior court d,subd.d does not extend limitation period for intentional tort of battery.thus,a plaintiff who did not file his or her lawsuit within one year of discovering or suspecting professional negligence would be barred from asserting any other causes of action subject to a limitation period,such as a personal injury claim based on products liability.for example,in the present case,plaintiff did not file her complaint until june,which was more than one year after her april,operation.the claim of professional negligence is timely because of the extension granted by section,subdivision d.however,even if fox has the benefit of the doctrine,if she is held to have simultaneously discovered the products liability cause of action against ethicon when she suspected professional negligence,shortly after the initial operation,her products liability cause of action would be time barred.
to avoid this pitfall,an objectively reasonable plaintiff,who is required by the bms rule to suspect other types of wrongdoing simultaneously with suspicions of professional negligence,would never rely on the provisions of subdivision d of section to extend the time for filing the lawsuit.thus,one consequence of the bms rule would be to eliminate the use of the extension and undermine the purpose served by the extension.the legislative purpose of the waiting period is to encourage negotiated resolution of medical malpractice disputes outside the formal litigation process.russell stanford university hospital cal th,d.accordingly,to avoid disharmony between section and former section,subdivision,as interpreted and applied through the bms rule,we conclude that application of the bms rule should not be extended beyond those situations where the plaintiff actually suspects or has reason to suspect a factual basis for the wrongdoing on the part of the product manufacturer.the practical effect of this limitation is that the bms rule has no independent application beyond situations covered by the basic approach.
in summary,we conclude a bright line rule that imputes the simultaneous discovery of a products liability cause of action with the discovery of a professional negligence cause of action should not be applied in this case.instead,we adopt the more reliable basic approach,which is dependent upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the products liability claim and its delayed discovery.
application of the basic approach 
the next question is whether ethicon demurrer should be sustained under the basic approach to the discovery rule.specifically,did fox know,actually suspect,or have reason to suspect a factual basis for the three elements of her products
