patrick died of mesothelioma.his widow,appellant barbara individually and as successor in interest to patrick,and his children,appellants michael and regan schneider,sued respondents crane and warren pumps llc for negligence,negligent failure to warn,strict liability for failure to warn,and strict liability for design defect on the consumer expectation theory.after days of jury trial,the court granted respondents motion for nonsuit and judgment was entered in their favor.we reverse.
patrick died of mesothelioma in,when he was years old.the jury heard evidence connecting his disease to his exposure to asbestos during the period between june of and august of,when he served as an officer on the uss oriskany,an essex class aircraft carrier built between or and 
on the oriskany,was first a main engine junior officer,then a boiler division officer.in both assignments,he stood watch in the machinery spaces,that is,in the boiler rooms and engine rooms and machine room,where he was responsible for supervising repairs and maintenance of equipment in those rooms.he also supervised repairs when the oriskany was in dry dock for a period of about three months,after a fire.
through testimony from an expert witness,retired navy captain william lowell,from former crane and warren employees,and from other witnesses,appellants produced evidence about the oriskany and about respondents products 
the main power source on the oriskany was steam,produced by eight boilers in four rooms.the steam system operated at very high temperatures,and all valves,flanges,and fittings were necessarily covered in insulation.when the oriskany was built,the primary type of insulation for that purpose was made of percent magnesium and percent asbestos.asbestos was also used in the packing which was found in pumps and valves.
there were thousands of valves on the oriskany.most of the valves in the machinery spaces were made by crane.all of the crane valves contained packing,and crane itself specified that material.most of the valves had insulation.the valves had flange connections,and most of the flange connections required the use of asbestos gaskets 
there were several hundred pumps on the oriskany.of them were made by warren pumps,including reciprocating steam engine pumps and tall bilge pumps.all but or of the pumps were located in the machinery spaces.the pumps had insulation and packing and were designed to be used with gasket insulation.at least in some instances,packing and insulation were supplied by warren and were on the pumps when they were delivered.warren knew that work on the pumps would require removal of asbestos gaskets.
packing and insulation had to be replaced or removed during the ordinary course of maintenance.the heat involved in steam power meant that the packing and insulation would bake onto the equipment,and could only be removed by being scraped off with a chisel or knife or wire brush.this work created asbestos dust 
douglas deetjen,a shipmate of patrick,worked in the oriskany boiler and engine rooms.he described the process of valves and pumps,and of removing insulation from the equipment in the course of repair or maintenance.this would be done with a knife,scraper,grinder or wire brush,and produced a lot of dust.deetjen saw in the machinery spaces while this work was going on and dust was created.he testified that during these repairs,the dust floated all over the room,so that there was no way to avoid breathing the dust.
lowell testified similarly,and also testified about work undertaken by ship personnel during the repair of the oriskany.
deetjen testified specifically that work on crane valves created dust and that patrick was in the room when that happened.he testified that work on warren pumps created dust,and that he saw patrick in the room when work was being done on warren pumps.
the navy required manufacturers of equipment such as pumps and valves to provide manuals containing information about installation,operation,and maintenance.manufacturers were required to include information about expected repairs and about safety cautions and requirements.manuals also identified replacement parts.these manuals were living documents which could be changed during subsequent years.
none of the respondents manuals included a warning about asbestos dust,or any recommendation concerning use of respirators or methods such as wetting friable asbestos.in the,warren questioned navy specifications on asbestos packing,raising issues about the health hazards.a warren representative testified that nothing prevented it from doing so sooner,or from including warnings in the manuals.
deetjen testified that his orders included an order to look at the manuals supplied by manufacturers.
the jury also heard evidence on the navy design and procurement process.appellants expert witness testified that a ship builder,building a ship for the navy,would turn to qualified manufacturers and direct them to the broad specifications the navy provided.for instance,the navy might specify that pumps should deliver gallons a minute,be turbine driven,and able to operate at temperatures of up to degrees.the manufacturer would take that information and design the pumps.lowell testified that the navy did design pumps.the manufacturers designed the pumps.
appellants also presented the deposition testimony of roland doktor,a manager at warren pumps,designated as the person most knowledgeable about issues in this case.when asked what does it mean to be built to a military specification he answered,there are a certain set of guidelines that are put forward in the specifications as far as materials and properties,testing,things like that,to make sure that the pump will meet the requirements as it needs to be on the ship.
respondents also called witnesses on this subject.retired admiral david sargent testified about the process.this included the testimony that the navy and manufacturers engaged in a design process,going back and forth between the navy and the manufacturer,in which the manufacturer produced drawings for the navy.this process resulted in navy specifications.
there was also evidence concerning scientific knowledge of the dangers of asbestos at the relevant times,and of respondents,and the navy,actual knowledge of the dangers of asbestos evidence about patrick disease,damages evidence,and evidence relevant to causation.rutherford,cal th,d.
crane moved for nonsuit on all causes of action on the ground that there was no evidence that patrick was exposed to asbestos from crane products,that there was no evidence that any exposure from crane products was a substantial factor in causing disease,and other grounds.warren pumps joined in crane motion,and also moved for nonsuit on the ground that there was no evidence that patrick was exposed to asbestos from the maintenance or repair of a warren pump.
neither motion was based on the component parts defense,but questions concerning that defense arose during oral argument on the motions,and the court granted the motions on that basis.the court also found that the pumps and valves were not dangerous or defective except that they included or were designed to work with asbestos,and that the release of asbestos was not caused by the normal use of the equipment but by maintenance which was under the supervision of the navy 
standard of review 
our review is de novo.saunders taylor th,d.the judgment may be affirmed only if,interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff,no facts have been identified which would justify a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.nally grace community church cal d.
discussion 
the component parts defense 
t he manufacturer of a product component or ingredient is not liable for injuries caused by the finished product unless it appears that the component itself was defective when it left the manufacturer.fetzger th,d.that is the component parts defense,sometimes called the raw material or bulk supplier defense.as we wrote in,supra,the policy reasons behind the component parts doctrine are well established m component and raw material suppliers should not have to assure the safety of their materials as used in other companies finished products.first that would require suppliers to retain experts in a huge variety of areas in order to determine the possible risks associated with each potential use.citation.a second,related rationale is that finished product manufacturers know exactly what they intend to do with a component or raw material and therefore are in a better position to guarantee that the component or raw material is suitable for their particular applications.citations.springmeyer ford motor th,d,supra,th at,d.
the trial court found that this defense applied here.we do not.
walker stauffer chemical d,which is perhaps the first california component parts case,is illustrative.that defendant sold bulk sulfuric acid.one of its customers was a manufacturer of drain cleaner,and the defendant sold the acid with the understanding that its customer would subject it to processes which would render it suitable to be a household product.the customer combined the acid with another product to make drain cleaner.the holding of the case is that the bulk supplier had no duty to the consumer injured when the drain cleaner exploded.the court found that the drain cleaner and the bulk acid were not the same product,and wrote we do not believe it realistically feasible or necessary to the protection of the public to require the manufacturer and supplier of a standard chemical ingredient such as bulk sulfuric acid,not having control over the subsequent compounding,packaging or marketing of an item eventually causing injury to the ultimate consumer,to bear the responsibility for that injury.the manufacturer seller of the product causing the injury is so situated as to afford the necessary protection.id.at.conversely,manufacturers of a defective product which is not altered when it is incorporated into the final product have a duty to the consumer.jenkins t n plc th,d arena fiberglas th,d raw asbestos fibers are not altered when they are incorporated into insulation.
lee electric motor division d,is the same,although the defendant there did not sell bulk supplies,but manufactured ordinary,motors.another manufacturer bought some of those motors to put into its own product,a meat grinder which the defendant had no role in designing.plaintiff was injured by the meat grinder,and the allegation was that the injury would have been minimized if the motor was designed to stop immediately when turned off.the court found that the defendant was a component part manufacturer and could not be held liable for the defective design of the finished product.id.at.
the defendant in fierro international harvester d,made a product which was incomplete in itself,and was necessarily going to be incorporated into another product.that is,international harvester made skeleton trucks which consisted only of an engine,cab and chassis,and in that case,three fuel tanks.these skeleton trucks were made to be modified and could not be used without the customers modifications.one customer installed a refrigerator unit on the skeleton truck.five years later,when the modified truck was in an accident,the gas tanks caught fire.the injured plaintiff sought a jury instruction on international duty to design a truck.the trial court refused to give the instruction and the court of appeal agreed.one basis of that holding was that skeleton trucks were designed to be modified by another manufacturer,in a manner outside international control.it was the second manufacturer design of the final product which was the cause of the injury,superseding any causation involving international product.id.at.see also in re deep vein thrombosis d,boeing,which sold airplanes with no seats,and did not design,manufacture,purchase or select the seats,which were added by the airlines,was not liable for deep vein thrombosis allegedly caused by faulty seat design.
as in re tmj implants products liability litigation,observed,the component part cases involve generic or components,or building block materials as opposed to those which are really a separate product with a specific purpose and use.id.at citing fleck kdi sylvan pools,cir see also,supra,th at,d springmeyer ford motor,supra,th at,d,gonzalez autoliv asp,th,d.
artiglio general electric th,d,on which the trial court here based its ruling,is no different.in that case,ge supplied bulk silicone to a manufacturer of breast implants.that manufacturer substantially processed the silicone in a manufacturing process over which ge had no control.the silicone was only dangerous when used in medical devices,and ge shipped the product with a disclaimer,disclaiming any responsibility for determining whether the material was suitable for medical applications.ge really had no ability to warn the ultimate user,because it in no way exercised any control over the design,testing or labeling of the implants.thus,ge was a component parts supplier and was not liable to women who claimed to have been injured by the implants.
in contrast,we found that the defendants in,supra,th,d,were not entitled to the defense.those defendants made grinders,sanders and saws,which were according to the allegations of the complaint specifically designed to be used with abrasive wheels and discs.plaintiff became ill as a result of airborne toxic substances produced and released from those discs and wheels.we found that the component parts defense did not protect the defendants,because the facts before us are not that respondents manufactured component parts to be used in a variety of finished products,outside their control,but instead that respondents manufactured tools which were specifically designed to be used with the abrasive wheels or discs they were used with,for the intended purpose of grinding and sanding metals,that the tools necessarily operated with those wheels or discs,id.at,d.
the restatement third of torts is in accord.in section,titled liability of commercial seller or distributor of product components for harm caused by product into which components are integrated,it provides that one engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing product components who sells or distributes a component is subject to liability for harm to persons or property caused by a product into which the component is integrated if a the component is defective in itself,as defined in this chapter,and the defect causes the harm or b the seller or distributor of the component substantially participates in the integration of the component into the design of the product and b the integration of the component causes the product to be defective,as defined in this chapter and b the defect in the product causes the harm.rest d torts,products liability.
in comment a,the restatement defines components product components include raw materials,bulk products,and other constituent products sold for integration into other products.some components,such as raw materials,valves,or switches,have no functional capabilities unless integrated into other products.other components,such as a truck chassis or a machine,function on their own but still may be utilized in a variety of ways by assemblers of other products.rest d torts,products liability,com.
we can not see that respondents pumps and valves are component parts under this body of law.component parts manufacturers are exempt from liability because they make or fungible products,designed to be incorporated into some other product.the component will be substantially altered by the customer,and the manufacturer of the component will have no control over the design of that finished product,or the warnings or labels on those products.
here,in contrast,respondents did not supply a building block material,dangerous only when incorporated into a final product over which they had no control.instead,respondents made separate products with a specific purpose and use.in re tmj implants,supra.at.the products were not fungible or,and were not designed to be altered by respondents customers.nor were they altered.instead,they were used as they were designed to be used,with asbestos insulation and packing which would have to be removed during routine repair and maintenance.further,unlike the manufacturers in the component parts cases,who had no interaction with the user of the finished product,and no ability to warn,respondents supplied manuals with their products.they had the ability to warn the users of their products.
in the component parts cases,the component manufacturer may not even know what the customer intends to do with the part,and the point of the doctrine is that they need not know.without such a rule,suppliers would have to hire experts to learn of the dangers of each possible use,in order to understand the risks,supra,th at,d.as the restatement explains imposing liability on a component parts manufacturer would require the component seller to scrutinize another product which the component seller has no role in developing.rest d torts,products liability,com.but here,respondents knew exactly how their products would be used,and they had a role in developing those products.the policy reasons for the component parts doctrine simply do not apply.as we wrote about the defendants in,respondents are not asked to warn of defects in a final product over which they had no control,but of defects which occur when their products are used as intended,supra,th at,d.
taylor elliott turbomachinery,th,d taylor,which was decided after the judgment here,found that the component parts defense was applicable to manufacturers similarly situated to respondents,but we think that taylor misses the mark.
the plaintiff in taylor,like patrick,worked on an aircraft carrier,and was exposed to asbestos from pumps,valves and other equipment.taylor found,inter alia,that the component parts defense shielded those defendants.in its analysis,taylor cited the fact that the plaintiff therein acknowledged that the equipment was intended to operate as part of a larger marine steam propulsion system.taylor then cited that plaintiff argument that the equipment was not,but was manufactured to the navy specifications for a particular purpose,but found the argument unpersuasive.citing artiglio general electric,supra,th,d,taylor ruled that the mere fact that respondents followed navy specifications when producing their products does not preclude them from invoking the component parts doctrine.taylor,supra,th at,d.
we reach a different conclusion.the defendant in artiglio met all the criteria which define a component parts seller.as we have seen,respondents here do not.we also disagree with the finding that the entire steam system of an aircraft carrier or,as respondents here argue,the ship itself is a finished product as that term is used in the context of the component parts defense.such a broad definition would make the analysis unworkable.for instance,under the defense,a component maker may be liable if it is substantially involved in the design of the finished product.springmeyer ford motor,supra,th at,d.if the entire ship,or steam system were the finished product,evidence that respondents were substantially involved in the design of their own pumps and valves,and in the integration of that equipment into the rest of ship systems through insulated flanges,would be inadequate unless appellants could also prove that respondents were involved in the design of the entire steam propulsion system,or of the ship itself.that simply stretches the defense too far.
nor are we persuaded by taylor reference to artiglio,supra,and customer specifications.artiglio found that ge was not deprived of the component parts defense merely because it had formulated the silicone to its customer specifications.artiglio,supra,th at,d.to say that respondents were not deprived of the defense is not to say that they were entitled to it.indeed,under california law,compliance with a customer specification is not a defense to a claim of strict products liability.t he uniqueness of a purchaser order does not alter the manufacturer responsibilities and is not a defense.wright stang manufacturing th,d mclaughlin sikorsky aircraft d.rawlings oliver,d.
moreover,we agree with appellants that respondents would not be shielded by the component parts defense even if they were manufacturers of components,because that defense does not apply if the product itself is defective.
the trial court here found that respondents products were not defective because they posed no danger until the asbestos was disturbed.we can not see that this is correct.appellants design defect case was that respondents valves and pumps were defective because they were designed to be used with insulation and packing which would become dangerous during the ordinary and foreseeable use of the products.that is a perfectly acceptable theory.the performance of a product during ordinary,expected and routine maintenance and repair is part of the functionality of that product.a car which only exploded when the oil was changed or the tires rotated could not be deemed.see deleon commercial manufacturing supply,supra,d.intended use of the component included regular cleaning gonzales carmenita ford truck sales,d.retailer liable for failure to warn with respect to need and method of repair.
jones john crane,supra,th,d is instructive.in that case,the plaintiff was exposed to asbestos products,including valve and pump packing materials manufactured by john crane.he sued for strict liability on a design expectations theory,on evidence that toxic fibers were released during routine use of the products,that is,when packing was replaced.the court of appeal affirmed a judgment in plaintiff favor,rejecting john crane argument that the consumer expectation test was inapplicable because expert witnesses were required.see also sparks,th,d plaintiff can recover against manufacturer of asbestos insulation on a theory of strict liability based on design defect on the consumer expectations test,on evidence that expected manner of use included removal of insulation from valves for inspection,creating dust.
another manufacturer product 
crane motion for nonsuit was based in part on the evidence that the asbestos which it supplied with its products had been replaced by the time patrick served on the oriskany crane contended that under california law,it can not be liable in strict liability for an injury caused by a product it did not manufacture or supply,unless it was involved in the vertical distribution of the defective product or played an integral role in the producing and marketing enterprise of that product.bay summit community shell oil th,d peterson superior court cal th,d.warren pumps joined in the motion.
this was not a ground for the trial court ruling,but the parties heavily brief the issue on appeal,no doubt because taylor found the argument persuasive,at least insofar as the causes of action were based on a failure to warn.we do not.
we begin with basic principles this doctrine of strict liability extends to products which have design defects,manufacturing defects,or warning defects.sparks,supra,th at,d.a manufacturer is liable in strict liability for an injury caused by the foreseeable use daly general motors cal d,and misuse of its product huynh th,d and for defective components made by others that are incorporated into their products.a manufacturer of a completed product can not escape liability by tracing the defect to a component part supplied by another.vandermark ford motor cal d.
under these principles,respondents would clearly be liable to a sailor who was injured as a result of exposure to the packing and insulation they supplied with their pumps and valves.respondents do not contend otherwise.instead,they seek a different result because was injured not by the original packing and insulation,but by replacement parts.in support,they cite cases which do not consider a manufacturer liability for the components of its products,or for replacement parts,or the kind of interdependent products valves and pumps along with their insulation and packing which this case presents.we see nothing in these cases which would cut off respondents responsibility for failure to warn or design defect,at the point in time at which their products
