a jury returned a nearly million judgment against ford motor company for injuries sustained by barry william muth,while traveling in a,ford crown victoria.ford appeals,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence,evidentiary rulings,and the conduct of the trial judge.we affirm.
after finishing a basketball game,plaintiff barry muth,and julius wineglass,both majors in the united states army,got in a,ford crown victoria and headed back to escon village,site of a army base,in riyadh,saudi arabia.wineglass was driving with muth in the front passenger seat,both men wearing seatbelts.traveling along a highway,they approached a curve going approximately ten miles per hour over the speed limit.loose in the turn,wineglass lost control of the car and ran it into a high jersey barrier separating the two sides of the highway.although the precise movement of the car was disputed,generally the left front wheel climbed the side of the barrier,causing the car to slide along the barrier for a short distance and,ultimately,to flip,landing on its roof and coming to rest about feet from where it initially hit the barrier.muth sustained a subluxation injury of the vertebrae in his spinal cord,leaving him a quadriplegic with only limited use of his arms and hands.wineglass received minor injuries and is not party to this litigation.
muth and his family sued ford in federal district court,bringing negligence and strict product liability claims.muth alleged two design defects first,that the ford crown victoria contained inadequate crush protection and second,that the ford crown victoria contained an inadequate occupant restraint system.during the seven day trial,muth focused on the roof strength defect,contending that a stronger and economically practical roof would have prevented the injury.keith friedman,muth expert witness,testified that the roof was defective because it collapsed twelve to fifteen inches on the passenger side.friedman testified that increasing the thickness of the steel in several parts of the roof structure could have reduced the roof collapse to three inches for per car or two inches for per car.
ford did not dispute that a stronger roof would be feasible.rather,ford contended that a stronger roof would do little,if anything,to prevent injuries in rollover accidents.according to ford,during a rollover accident,the body drops toward the other words,toward the roof.because a normal seatbelt system allows the body to drop five inches,which is more than the normal inches of clearance between head and roof,the only way to prevent injuries in rollover accidents is to use a,seatbelt with crotch strap,an impossibility in commercial vehicles.in short,ford contended that a stronger roof would not help prevent injuries in rollover accidents.
attempting to prove this counterintuitive point,ford relied on data from two crash tests an early series from general motors using chevy malibu sedans the malibu test and a series from ford using the controlled rollover impact system the cris test.both tests used video and cameras to record the precise movements of cars and dummies during rollovers.although the district court allowed ford expert witnesses to discuss the data and conclusions drawn from the tests,the court excluded the demonstrative and those results.
at the close of all the evidence,muth withdrew his negligence claim and only submitted his design defect claim to the jury.the jury answered yes to the question of whether there was a design defect in the crown victoria at the time it left the possession of ford motor company that was a producing cause of the injury and awarded muth and his family nearly million in damages.ford timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
ford raises four issues.first,ford,contending that muth failed to meet his burden on either theory of design defect,argues that the district court erred when it denied ford motion for judgment as a matter of law.second,ford contends that even if there was sufficient evidence,the district court erred when it did not ask the jury to unanimously agree on one particular design defect.third,ford objects to the exclusion of demonstrative evidence from the malibu and cris tests.finally,ford contends that remarks of the trial judge in front of the jury were improper,warranting reversal.we address each in turn.
ford moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence,so our review is de novo we apply the same legal standard as the district is,judgment as a matter of law will only be granted if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in the movant favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary conclusion.
ford objects to the sufficiency of the evidence on both theories of design defect.as to the inadequate roof strength,ford contends that muth failed in his burden to establish that the vehicle was in substantially the same condition at the time of the accident as it was at the time of manufacture,pointing to evidence suggesting that the windshield had been replaced prior to the accident.as to the inadequate restraint system,ford contends that muth failed to establish any safer alternative designs,a requirement imposed by law.we disagree with the former,but agree with the latter.
although cast as an insufficient evidence charge,ford objection to the jury finding of defective roof strength is really that muth did not put on sufficient evidence of an essential element in his prima facie,that he failed to establish that the crown victoria was in substantially the same condition at the time of the accident as it was at the time of manufacture.muth questions ford reading of texas law,citing to cases placing the burden on the defendant to show that the injury was caused by a substantial alteration in the product.
ford cites two cases for the proposition that texas law requires the plaintiff to prove that the product was in substantially the same condition at the time of accident as at the time of manufacture uniroyal goodrich tire martinez,from the supreme court of texas,which only states that texas follows section of the restatement second of torts and syrie knoll international,from our court,which reads section to put the burden on the plaintiff to show that the product reached the consumer without substantial change in its condition from the time of original sale.but the restatement says nothing about the burden of proof and subsequent cases,some cited by muth,suggest that the burden of showing a substantial alteration in the product lies with the defendant 
both arguments miss the mark.both arguments focus on the windshield,but we need not resolve who has the burden of proof to show that the vehicle involved in the accident had the same or a similar windshield as the vehicle off the assembly line if the windshield played no part in muth theory of design defect.we do not read ford argument to suggest that muth has the burden to show that the vehicle had not changed in any respect from the time it left ford manufacturing plant.all products,especially complex products like cars,change between the time of purchase and the time of accident,but not every change would obviate a manufacturer liability.muth could have replaced the tires on the car,which may mean it was not in substantially the same condition as at the time of manufacture,but the replacement tires are only relevant if they were a cause of the accident.put another way,regardless of who carries the burden of proof on a substantial alternation,the supposed alteration must be relevant to the theory of defect.
all of this is subsumed by the basic elements of a design defect products liability claim design defect and producing cause inherent in the notion of a design defect is a defect in the design of the is,a defect existing when the product was manufactured.the second element,causation,ties the past to the present,linking the specific defect,existing at the time of manufacture,to the particular injury.to this end,syrie is at least partially right,as muth must show that the alleged defect,existing at the time of manufacture,was in substantially the same condition at the time of the accident.and this is done by showing that the design defect was the producing cause of the accident.
so framed,our question is whether the windshield was a component of muth alleged design defect.if it was,as ford contends,then,yes,muth had the burden to show that the windshield was in substantially the same condition at the time of accident as at the time of manufacture.only then would there be a design defect that was a producing cause of muth injuries.if the windshield was not part of the theory,then it is only relevant if ford can show that the replacement windshield actually caused muth injuries,rather than the allegedly defectively designed roof structure.
ford argues that the windshield had been replaced,that the original windshield contributed to the roof strength and that there was no evidence it was replaced with a product,that the replacement conformed to ford design specifications,or that the replacement was installed correctly.all of that may be true,but it is beside the point.the windshield contribution,if any,to the roof strength was not part of muth theory of design defect,as explained by keith friedman,muth expert witness.his analysis did not turn on the role of the windshield.he stated plainly that the roof structure was defectively designed because it had a very weak roof rail and a pillar,b pillar system,header system,and when testifying as to safer alternative designs,he never mentioned any changes to the windshield.ford treatment of the case confirms that the windshield was not a relevant aspect of muth design defect case.ford did not friedman on any contribution of the windshield to the overall strength of the roof,and kenneth orlowski,ford expert witness,testified that during testing,the roof peak strength relies more on the the metal structure and the b pillar behind the a pillar.ford can not reinvent muth theory of design defect on appeal and then contend that muth evidence was insufficient.
if ford was proceeding on a substantial alteration is,the replaced windshield was the real cause of muth it likely failed in its proof.ford evidence that the windshield was replaced is scant at best.orlowski testified that it was his understanding that the windshield had been replaced,no more.it is doubtful that this is sufficient to warrant an instruction on substantial alteration but the answer to that inquiry is of no moment here.procedurally and even more probative,ford did not raise substantial alteration as an affirmative defense,nor did it request an instruction on the issue during the charge conference.the bottom line is that factual issues relating to the windshield and its contribution,if any,to the roof strength and muth injuries,were not part of this case,and muth presented sufficient evidence that the design defect,properly construed,was a producing cause of his injuries.the district court did not err when it denied ford motion for judgment as a matter of law on the roof strength defect.
as to the inadequate restraint system,we agree with ford that muth did not present sufficient evidence of a safer alternative design,a necessary element of texas law on which muth had the burden muth does not contest this point,stating in his brief that the inadequate roof strength design defect was the entire focus of his case.the district court judge erred when it denied ford motion for judgment as a matter of law on the restraint system defect 
the question becomes,however,whether that error makes any difference in this case.ford contends that it does,citing the general rule,first recognized by the supreme court in maryland baldwin that when a case is submitted to the jury on a general verdict,the failure of evidence or a legal mistake under one theory of the case generally requires reversal for a new trial because the reviewing court can not determine whether the jury based its verdict on a sound or unsound theory.that occurred here,at least according to ford,because muth proceeded on two design defect theories,both supposedly submitted to the jury one illegitimate.
we agree that if both theories are put to the jury,a new trial is generally necessary when the evidence is insufficient on one but this court,as well as many others,have engrafted a harmless error gloss onto the basic principle.braun flynt is our case there,we upheld a general verdict for invasion of privacy,despite an instruction authorizing recovery on either a false light theory,that was supported by the evidence,or on a appropriation theory,that was not.we concluded that the entire focus of the plaintiff case was her claim that the publication of an indecent photograph of her in chic magazine,a larry flynt production,created a false impression of her and damaged her reputation.on review,we were both totally satisfied and reasonably certain that the verdict in the plaintiff favor was not based on the erroneously submitted appropriation theory.
braun applies here.true,as ford points out,muth fourth amended complaint alleged two design defects inadequate roof strength and an inadequate restraint system.that being said,the inadequate restraint system played little role during the trial.muth made no mention of that theory during voir dire or during opening arguments.during closing argument as muth counsel was summarizing the case,he referenced only the inadequate roof strength defect.he stated,ladies and gentlemen of the jury,the answer to question,was this vehicle defectively designed in not having a stronger roof yes.muth counsel never mentioned the allegedly defective restraint system.
furthermore,evidence of a defect in the crown victoria restraint system was minimal.keith friedman,muth expert witness,was asked whether other changes could be made to the crown victoria to improve the occupant protection system.friedman then discussed changes to the seatbelt system,recognizing how the seatbelt can work in tandem with the roof to prevent injuries in rollover accidents.yet,friedman testified that he did not take into account changes in the seatbelt system when evaluating the design modifications to the roof structure,and ford did not question his comments about the restraint system.
ford also points to statements by muth counsel during an in camera conference on the jury instructions,in which muth counsel argued that the restraint system was still part of the case.we find these statements,made outside the presence of the jury,insufficient to bring the restraint system back into the case.importantly,here,the jury instructions did not identify the two different design defect theories.from the jury perspective,they had no reason to think the restraint system was at issue,aside from the minimal comments of friedman.the allegedly defective restraint system was not mentioned during voir dire,opening argument,or closing argument.
this case illustrates how an evidentiary deficiency can work in tandem with the rule concerning general verdicts in lawsuits.without a doubt,a party can present evidence sufficient to invoke baldwin rule,which requires reversal,but insufficient to sustain even a favorable jury verdict.muth presented sufficient evidence of a design defect in the roof strength,and we are totally satisfied or reasonably certain that the jury decided in muth favor on that defect and that defect alone 
ford next objects to the district court exclusion of demonstrative and the malibu test,a rollover crash test conducted by general motors in the early using a chevrolet malibu,and the cris test,a rollover crash test conducted by ford in using a model crown victoria.the malibu test was one of the first attempts to determine the relationship between roof deformation and injury.improving on the malibu test,the cris test was conducted after the national highway traffic safety administration sought comments on federal motor vehicle safety standard,which set requirements on the amount of weight the roof structure in passenger cars must withstand.the cris test controlled the position,momentum,and point of impact of the vehicle first contact with the ground.according to ford,both tests illustrate how a stronger roof would do little,if anything,to prevent injuries in rollover accidents.
