in march,robert reimer was severely burned while examining a boiler used to heat a swimming pool owned by the crookston public school district school district and jointly operated with the city of crookston city.at the time of the accident,reimer was an employee of gibb sons,a boiler repair company.in this diversity action,reimer and his wife sought damages based on the alleged negligence of the school district,the city,and two companies,johnson controls,and kriss premium products,kriss,which serviced the pool facilities pursuant to contracts.
the district court granted summary judgment to all the defendants,holding they owed no duty of care to reimer because his injury resulted from an open and obvious danger.alternatively,the district court held that reimer assumed the risk of his injury when he agreed to examine the boiler.after a careful review of minnesota law in this area,we affirm in part and reverse in part.we agree that johnson controls and kriss owed no duty of care to reimer.as to the school district and city,however,we find genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment in their favor.
this case involves a serious accident which occurred when reimer,the,was examining a school swimming pool boiler that reportedly was leaking.while reimer was conducting an ultrasound test on the boiler,his knee accidentally brushed up against a corroded pipe,or nipple,which was screwed into the boiler vessel via a welded fitting hole called a bunghole.the corroded nipple broke off and reimer was severely burned over much of his body.few facts remain uncontested by the parties.for summary judgment purposes,however,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to reimer.offerdahl of.hosps.clinics.
the crookston municipal swimming pool is jointly operated by the city and school district pursuant to a joint powers agreement.the school district owns the pool building and boiler,and is responsible for routine maintenance and boiler checks.see financial responsibility statement,city.at.major capital expenses associated with maintenance,repair and replacement of pool related items such as,pumps,water filtration system,plumbing are shared by the two entities,as are major building improvements and equipment purchases.see id.significant decisions concerning the boiler at the pool are subject to final authorization by the board of education.the school district has a contract with johnson controls to provide some maintenance services for the swimming pool boiler and other boilers at school district facilities.kriss supplies boiler water chemicals to the swimming pool.
at some point during the school year,ken stromberg,the pool director,noticed some moisture on the floor of the boiler room near the rear left side of the boiler.stromberg informed ray nelson and bill brinkman of his observation.nelson was the head custodian in charge of the pool facilities,including the boiler,and,as such,was a licensed boiler engineer.brinkman was the school district business director.nelson called reimer at gibb sons and told him that the pool boiler was leaking in the tubes,and that there was a leak in the back of the boiler.reimer had worked for gibb sons for about ten years and was considered to be a boiler repair expert.his duties included troubleshooting on commercial boilers.
some time passed before reimer could get to the school to follow up on nelson phone call.the parties dispute how long this period was,perhaps as long as months.in the meantime,it is assumed that the boiler continued to leak.
on the afternoon of march,john king of johnson controls was at the crookston swimming pool for maintenance work.he testified that during his visit nelson asked him to tighten the nipple located on the lower left rear of the boiler which,according to king,was dripping a little bit or a little wet.king dep.at.king refused to tighten the nipple because it was corroded and appeared unsafe.he could not say precisely how much corrosion was visible but it was enough to know that it was something to put a wrench on.id.at.
that evening at seven,reimer arrived to examine the boiler.based on nelson suspicion that the boiler needed retubing,reimer had brought along ultrasound equipment.an ultrasound test is a diagnostic procedure which measures the integrity of the metal comprising the boiler vessel.with this information,reimer could advise the school district as to whether retubing the boiler would suffice or whether the boiler should be completely replaced.
it is not necessary that the boiler be hot or operational for the ultrasound test to be effective.an ultrasound works equally well on a cold,or even empty,boiler.in this instance,reimer did not direct nelson to cool down the boiler prior to beginning the examination to conduct the test,reimer and nelson first pulled back an outer sheet metal cover so that the boiler vessel itself was accessible.then,while nelson held a trouble light,reimer selected several spots on the boiler vessel to lightly grind down in order to remove any rust and millcoat,thereby providing a smooth surface for testing one of the spots he chose was relatively close to the nipple on the lower left rear of the boiler.at one point,while grinding in this area,reimer felt that he did not have complete control of the grinder.he attempted to reposition himself and,in so doing,his left knee accidentally brushed against the corroded nipple.this caused the nipple to break out of the bunghole,releasing the pressurized hot water and steam from inside the boiler.as a result,reimer sustained scalding water and steam burns over percent of his body.
reimer and his wife sued the school district,the city,johnson controls and kriss,alleging their negligence led to his injury.the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment.this appeal followed.

essential to any negligence claim is the breach of a duty of care owed to the plaintiff.see lubbers anderson,listing elements of negligence claim.the district court held as a matter of law that none of the defendants owed a duty of care to reimer,and,alternatively,that reimer assumed the risk of his injury.we will discuss each of these holdings in turn.
whether a legal duty exists is generally a question of law to be determined by the court.servicemaster of cloud gab bus,gabrielson warnemunde.however,where the existence of a duty turns upon contradicted facts,those facts must be submitted to a jury for resolution prior to the court legal conclusion on the issue.johnson urie.
the school district and city of crookston landowner liability.
at issue in this case is the duty owed by a possessor of land to the employee of an independent contractor the duty imposed on a possessor of land who hires an independent contractor is to inspect the premises for latent or hidden dangers and then to warn oncomers of those dangers.conover states power.that duty extends to employees of independent contractors hired by the landowner.id.although the school district owned the pool building and the boiler,a written agreement with the city supports a finding,for summary judgment purposes,that the parties jointly operated the facilities and jointly shared the indices and liabilities of ownership.accordingly,although our discussion will focus on reimer case against the school district,our analysis and conclusions with regard to that defendant apply equally to the city.
in determining a landowner duty,minnesota applies the rule set forth in section of the restatement second of torts.as explained by the minnesota supreme court in a case,peterson rawleigh,
in support of its contention that it violated no duty toward the plaintiff,defendant asserts that it is not liable for injuries caused by defects which were obvious to,and comprehended by,plaintiff.we think the better rule is that adopted by restatement,torts s,as follows 
a possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to them by any activity or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious to them,unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge or obviousness.
rawleigh,at footnote omitted and emphasis added see also louis louis,reaffirming minnesota adoption of the rule set out in restatement second of torts baber dill,thus,even for obvious dangers,a possessor has a duty to warn if harm to an invitee should be anticipated despite the obviousness of the danger.
the minnesota supreme court has characterized section unless clause as a crucial qualifier to the general rule.sutherland barton,et,citing adee evanson,and rawleigh,at.however,liability under this clause does not attach where the anticipated harm involves dangers so obvious that no warning is necessary baber,at emphasis added.as acknowledged by the supreme court in baber,the difference between open and obvious dangerous activities and conditions for which the possessor should anticipate harm and those activities and conditions for which the possessor should not anticipate harm because they are so open and obvious is a fine one,but one that we choose to make.id.
following these principles,reimer appeal turns on whether a reasonable jury could find that the corrosive nipple was a latent or hidden danger rather than a known or obvious danger so that the school district had a duty to warn reimer about it or even if the dangerous condition presented by the corroded nipple was known or obvious,whether a reasonable jury could find that the section exception conditions are met,that the school district should have anticipated the harm despite the known or obvious danger.
the district court concluded that reimer injury was caused by an obvious danger,about which the defendants owed no duty to warn.the district court cited the following facts in support of this conclusion reimer saw that the boiler nipple was badly corroded,and reimer knew that the boiler was leaking.reimer was a boiler repair expert hired specifically to investigate the problem of the leaking boiler.the suspect integrity of the boiler posed an inherent danger.reimer city of crookston,et,wl at.reimer argues that evidence in the record refutes the district court finding of obviousness.first,he points to his own testimony that the nipple corrosion was not of a type or magnitude that would have alerted him to the possibility of the nipple breaking off.and second,he relies on an expert affidavit which opined that the corrosion would have been much worse on the less visible underside of the nipple than the top and sides.
testimony and evidence regarding reimer subjective observations are not instructive on the issue of obviousness.t he test for what constitutes an obvious danger is an objective test the question is not whether the injured party actually saw the danger,but whether it was in fact visible.louis,at citing munoz applebaum food market.given reimer testimony that he saw corrosion on the nipple,and his experience and expertise in the field of boiler repair,we agree that the record irrefutably establishes that the condition and risk were objectively obvious.see restatement second of torts,cmt.b explaining that obviousness determination is made from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the visitor,exercising ordinary perception,intelligence and judgment.
our analysis does not end there,however.there is nothing in the record to conclusively indicate that the dangerous condition in this case was so obvious as to preclude application of section unless clause,and genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether the school district should have anticipated the harm to reimer.see,louis,at requiring consideration of unless clause applicability even where known or obvious condition found as a matter of law.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to reimer,this court must accept the following as true in the course of examining the boiler,reimer saw a nipple with some corrosion on it but no more than he had seen on many occasions on similar boilers the corrosion on the nipple was more severe on the underside of the nipple,close to the bottom of the boiler,than on the top and sides where reimer was more likely to focus given the task he was performing conducting an ultrasound does not entail contact with the interior of the boiler or with the nipples or bungholes on the boiler nelson was aware that the nipple was corroded because only hours earlier a johnson controls employee refused his request to tighten the nipple because of its corroded and dangerous state nelson understood the gravity of the danger posed by a nipple with this degree of corrosion because he is a licensed boiler engineer nelson saw reimer working in close proximity to the nipple on a procedure that would not necessarily call his attention to the state of the nipple and nelson did not warn reimer about the corroded nipple or tell him about the concerns raised by johnson controls just hours earlier.on these facts,the school district,through its agent,nelson,could reasonably anticipate that reimer would proceed with the noninvasive ultrasound without making a careful assessment of the condition of the nipple.
the school district disputes most of the facts.in our view,such factual disputes are precisely of the type that preclude summary judgment resolution.and contrary to appellees contention,our holding is consistent with sutherland barton,et,a minnesota supreme court case with some factual similarities.in sutherland,an independent was killed while using a metal tape measure near exposed live buss bars.id.at.it was undisputed that sutherland had worked near live buss bars before and in fact had warned others of the danger inherent in such a task.id.at.moreover,o n the day of the accident,his supervisor specifically pointed out the live buss bars to sutherland.id.the supreme court affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment to the employer.see id.at.the court found that the danger posed by the live buss bars was open and obvious,that the risk could have been avoided by turning off the electricity,and that this was not a case where the employer should have anticipated that the plaintiff would fail to appreciate the risk involved in using a metal tape measure near live buss bars.see id.at.
as in sutherland,the plaintiff here had expertise in his field and alternatives other than confronting the risk.it is undisputed that reimer could have ordered nelson to turn off the boiler and let it cool overnight prior to examining it.however,these facts alone are not sufficient to find as a matter of law that no duty existed.the relevant inquiry remains whether under the circumstances the school district should have anticipated harm.
as explained by the sutherland court a reason to anticipate the harm may arise when the landowner has reason to expect that the invitee will proceed to encounter the known or obvious danger because to a reasonable man in his position the advantages of doing so would outweigh the apparent risk.sutherland,at quoting restatement second of torts cmt.f see also rawleigh,at characterizing comment f of section as well summariz ing the court view.we see a significant qualitative difference between the risk posed by using a metal tape measure near live buss bars,as in sutherland,and conducting what is expected to be a noninvasive diagnostic procedure on a closed boiler as in the case at bar.here,a jury could reasonably find that the apparent risk did not necessarily warrant the off the boiler.see conover,at finding that a jury could properly conclude that routine inspection procedures of independent contractors would not have revealed the particular condition that caused harm and would not be reasonably expected to do so.we also note an important factual distinction between sutherland and the instant case.it was undisputed in sutherland that the plaintiff was explicitly warned about the dangerous condition that caused his prior to and on the very morning of his injury.see sutherland,at see also hamm oak park lutheran church,no,wl.unpublished affirming grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants where plaintiff who was electrocuted by power wires knew of the danger of using a crane near power wires and the record shows that plaintiff was made aware of the power lines before beginning work that day.in this case,there are significant fact disputes regarding reimer actual knowledge of the dangerous condition,even if it was objectively obvious.thus,while both reimer and nelson were licensed boiler engineers,only school district particularized information that may have shifted the balance in the restatement analysis.no analogous scenario existed in sutherland.
given the conflicting evidence in the record as to what reimer and the school district knew or should have known at the time of the accident,we conclude it is for a jury to determine whether this case falls within the unless clause of restatement.construing the record favorably to reimer,the evidence is sufficient to establish that the school district,through its agent,nelson,should have anticipated that reimer might fail to appreciate the dangerous condition posed by the corroded nipple and be injured while examining the boiler.accordingly,the record will not permit a summary judgment finding that the school district lacked a duty of care to reimer.because we deem the city joint of the pool facilities,our conclusion on this issue applies equally to the city.
johnson controls and kriss 
absent landowner status,the existence of a legal duty to act depends on two factors the relationship of the parties,and the foreseeability of the risk involved.gilbertson leininger,erickson curtis inv,we agree with the district court that,as a matter of law,neither johnson controls nor kriss owed a duty of care to reimer under the circumstances of this case.johnson controls was contracted by the school district to provide automatic temperature controls services,associated air conditioning and heating services,and filter services.the planned service agreement between the school district and johnson controls outlined specific services to be provided by johnson controls,including specific services related to the boiler.it is undisputed that the contract did not include repair or maintenance of the boiler nipples nor did johnson controls ever work on the nipple that caused reimer injury.the mere fact that on occasion johnson controls would do additional work does not make it responsible for the deterioration of the boiler nipple or create a duty on its part to anyone down the line who may be harmed by the boiler.nor was a duty created on march when a johnson controls employee refused nelson request to tighten the corroded nipple,a task that was not within johnson controls contractual responsibilities.see in re temporomandibular joint tmj implants prods.liab,cir explaining that the threshold inquiry in the gratuitous undertaking duty analysis is whether the defendant specifically undertook the services allegedly performed.in short,there is no basis in the record to establish that johnson controls owed a duty to reimer and the district court properly granted summary judgment in its favor.
summary judgment in favor of kriss was also proper.pursuant to a contract with the school district,kriss supplied chemicals for use in the swimming pool boiler to control unwanted mineral levels.reimer alleges that kriss negligent chemical water treatment program caused the corrosion in the boiler.assuming reimer allegation is true,we nevertheless discern no duty on kriss part to reimer.kriss owed a contractual obligation to the school district to supply chemicals as necessary for the upkeep of the pool and its boiler.nothing in that contractual relationship supports a finding of a duty on kriss part to reimer,an independent contractor who was hired by the school district for consultation repair of the boiler.further,at the time of reimer injury,the school district was aware of the corrosive condition of the nipple,as evidenced,at a minimum,by nelson interaction with johnson controls on march.we agree that it was not reasonably foreseeable on kriss part that,with this knowledge,nelson,a licensed boiler engineer,would permit an independent contractor to work on the boiler at and around the badly corroded nipple without taking appropriate precautionary measures.see gilbertson,at in order to find that a special relationship exists,it must be assumed that the harm to be prevented by the defendant is one that the defendant is in a position to protect against and should be expected to protect against.citation omitted.
primary assumption of risk 
as an alternative basis for granting summary judgment,the district court held that e ven if the defendants did owe reimer a duty,they are still not liable for his injuries because reimer assumed the risks involved with boiler repair work.reimer,wl at the elements of primary assumption of risk are the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk,the plaintiff appreciated the risk,and the plaintiff had a choice to avoid the risk but voluntarily chose to accept the risk.kraft,cir applying minnesota law andren,wegscheider plastics.
the doctrine requires actual knowledge of a known risk.wegscheider,at coenen buckman,w here it merely appears that the plaintiff should or could have discovered the danger,the defense is contributory negligence and not assumption of the risk,quoted in beckman,snilsberg lake washington club,application of the doctrine requires actual,rather than constructive,knowledge.citing parr hamnes.primary assumption of risk does not apply when a defendant conduct has enlarged or obscured the risk to the plaintiff.kaiser states power,holding that landowner was not shielded from liability where his misconduct materially enhanced the risk or created a new risk of harm beyond that assumed by firefighters as incidental to fighting fires rusciano,at person standing in path of motor vehicle did not assume risk of being hit when vehicle accelerated,thereby enlarging the risk.whether a party has primarily assumed the risk is usually a question for the jury unless the evidence is conclusive.schneider,at citing hollinbeck downey.
the district court conclusion that reimer assumed the risk of his injury was based primarily on the following reimer,a boiler repair expert,was at the school to examine the boiler pursuant to reports of moisture and leaking as an expert,reimer knew and appreciated that moisture and leaking lead to corrosion of the metal comprising the boiler reimer knew that the boiler was operational and contained pressurized degree water.given these facts,the district court concluded that reimer knew and appreciated the risk of being burned while examining the boiler and could have avoided that risk by first cooling down the boiler.accordingly,reimer injury directly flowed from his decision to confront the known dangerous condition rather than avoid it and therefore he assumed the risk of his injury.we do not necessarily disagree with this logic.however,we do believe that it conflicts with minnesota interpretation and application of the primary assumption of risk doctrine.
in olson hansen,the minnesota supreme court discussed the doctrine of assumption of risk 
assumption of risk has two separate and distinct concepts primary and secondary assumption of risk.primary assumption of risk is not so much an affirmative defense as an expression of the idea that the defendant owes a limited duty of care to the plaintiff with respect to the risk incident to their relationship 
primary assumption of risk is applicable only where parties have voluntarily entered a relationship in which plaintiff assumes,incidental risks.as to those risks,the defendant has no duty to protect the pl
