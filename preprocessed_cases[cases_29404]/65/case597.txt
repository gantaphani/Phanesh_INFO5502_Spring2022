bell helicopter textron is the manufacturer of a helicopter that crashed in griffith park on march.the crash was caused by the failure of the helicopter tail rotor yoke.the two survivors and the successors of four others who died in the crash sued bell helicopter and others,asserting products liability theories of strict liability,negligence,warranty and fraud.bell sought summary judgment based on a federal statute of repose,which bars actions against manufacturers of general aviation aircraft if the part that allegedly caused the accident is more than years old.
we conclude an exception to the statute of repose applies,precluding its application to this lawsuit.an action is excepted from the statute of repose if the claimant proves the manufacturer concealed or withheld from the federal aviation administration required information material to the maintenance or operation of the aircraft or part that is causally related to the harm.there is evidence bell,within the period of repose,withheld information from the faa about five military aircraft accidents bell knew were caused by the failure of identical tail rotor yokes installed on those aircraft.we hold that faa regulations required bell to report those failures,and its withholding of that information falls squarely within the statutory exception to the time limitations on civil actions that would otherwise apply.we therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings.
factual,procedural and legal background 
bell helicopter textron manufactured a helicopter that crashed on march,during a rescue airlift following an automobile accident.the accident victim and three butler,michael mccomb and eric killed,and pilot steven robinson and another paramedic were seriously injured.the crash was caused by the failure of the helicopter tail rotor yoke.lawsuits were filed against bell,bell technical services,btsi,a bell affiliate providing customer service for bell and robert gustafson an employee of btsi,by the injured crash victims and the successors of those who died referred to collectively as butler.the lawsuits filed by the surviving paramedic and by the successors of the accident victim were settled the remaining lawsuits are the subject of this appeal.
bell motion for summary judgment.
bell filed a motion for summary judgment the motion was based upon a federal statute of repose,the general aviation revitalization act of gara gara precludes any civil action against a manufacturer of general aviation aircraft if the part that allegedly caused the accident is more than years old gara,a.several circumstances may affect the application of the period of repose.among them is an exception from the time limitation if the claimant proves the manufacturer knowingly misrepresented to the federal aviation administration,or concealed or withheld from the federal aviation administration,required information that is material and relevant to the performance or the maintenance or operation of such aircraft,or the component,system,or other part,that is causally related to the harm,b.
bell motion for summary judgment asserted that a it sold the helicopter,a model,to the los angeles fire department on march,years before the accident,and b the tail rotor yoke that caused the accident was original equipment on the helicopter when it was sold to the department.bell supported its motion with declarations from bruce taylor and giffen marr.taylor declaration established the date of delivery of the helicopter to the city of los angeles,including the tail rotor yoke.marr,who was in charge of civil certification and regulatory requirements for bell until december,stated that no information pertaining to the design and safe operation of bell helicopters was ever deliberately withheld from the faa 
butler opposition to bell motion.
butler opposed bell motion,asserting triable issues of material fact as to the applicability of certain exceptions to the statute of repose.butler asserted bell knowingly misrepresented or withheld required information from the faa a in,when it revised the helicopter maintenance manual to increase the retirement life of the tail rotor yoke from to flight hours b in,when it revised the manual to require a new,allegedly defective dimensional test for inspection of the yoke and c throughout the entire period from to the time of the march crash 
most of the facts presented in butler opposition are undisputed by bell to facilitate comprehensibility,we first describe the cause of the helicopter crash and other pertinent general information,and then relate the facts butler believes are relevant to the assertion that bell knowingly misrepresented and concealed required information from the faa.
a.the cause of the accident.
the tail rotor yoke referred to as the accident yoke failed hours of flight to static overload damage.static overloads occur when the tail rotor is stationary,not when a helicopter is in flight.static overload can be caused by improper ground handling such as using the tail rotor blade as a handhold to move the helicopter,collision with a vehicle,improper bearing removal while the yoke is off the helicopter,and wind gust or jet blast.the static overload creates a loss of compressive residual stress and therefore a fatigue fracture.bell explained that because the yoke is metal,static forces such a s striking the part with an object,will cause the yoke to bend.it is the bending of the yoke which causes the loss of the residual stress on the surface of the yoke and its susceptibility to fracture due to fatigue.
loss of surface compressive residual stress also referred to as yielding is not visually detectable.until this accident,bell used a dimensional testing tool to determine if a yoke had been bent so as to cause it to be yielded.bell also installed new flapping stops to perform the same function.flapping stops are flexible metal tabs installed against the yoke so that a bending of the yoke will bend the flapping stops.when the yoke bends back into place,the flapping stops do not,and the bent flaps can be observed on visual inspection.bending in the flapping stops requires removal of the yoke for inspection.loss of compressive residual stress or yielding can be measured directly only by diffraction testing.
alleged misrepresentation to and concealment of information from the faa.
butler asserts that bell withheld from the faa required information material to the performance or the maintenance of the tail rotor yoke on two different occasions,in and,as well as continuously during this period and up to the time of the crash.reduced to its essentials,butler claim is that a bell knew about and failed to report the failure of identical yokes on five military helicopters,and b bell was required to,but did not,perform additional fatigue testing or analysis to justify its increase in retirement life of the yoke from to hours,and therefore misrepresented to the faa that it had complied with fatigue evaluation regulations.
butler relied on the following evidence,most of which was described in the affidavit of russell boocock,an aeronautical engineer specializing in aircraft structural analysis,static and fatigue,with years of experience with rotorcraft.
facts known to bell in.
in,bell increased the retirement life of the tail rotor yokes on model helicopters from to flight hours.when it did so,bell had the following information 
the tail rotor yokes on model helicopters were identical to the yokes used on some other bell helicopter models,including certain models in military use.bell engineers knew there had been at least five accidents in which tail rotor yokes failed in military use prior to,each of which involved fatigue failure after less than hours of use.moreover,as a result of a study conducted by bell and funded by the army,bell engineers knew by august that the military failures were not caused by the military nature of the helicopter operation,but by static overload,which would occur regardless of whether the aircraft was involved in civil or military use.
one conclusion reached in bell study of the military failures of the tail rotor yoke was that any tail rotor yoke in service may be inspected using nondestructive diffraction techniques to determine the peak compressive strain that the yoke has been subjected to.
nevertheless,on october,bell issued technical bulletin,requiring a change in the maintenance manual for the model helicopter,increasing the retirement life of the tail rotor yoke on the helicopters from flight hours to flight hours.the design engineering aspects of the bulletin were.the bulletin stated that a review of the service history and fatigue evaluation data for tail rotor yokes all and all,has provided justification for an increase in the retirement life.bell certified that the data was examined and complied with applicable federal aviation regulation far requirements,specifically part c.
part governs fatigue evaluations.in,part c covered r eplacement time evaluation.the regulation stated that i t must be shown that the probability of catastrophic fatigue failure is extremely remote within a replacement time furnished under section of appendix c ed.
from these facts,boocock opined that,in,bell deceived the faa by concealing the failure history of the yoke on military aircraft,and falsely represented,without performing any additional testing,that the probability of catastrophic fatigue failure prior to the retirement life was extremely remote.boocock stated that when bell increased the retirement life of the yoke,bell knew it had not met the requirements of part c,in that it had not substantiated,nor demonstrated,that the likelihood of a catastrophic fatigue failure of the and tail rotor yokes was extremely remote within their revised retirement life of hours.boocock also pointed out bell knew in that static overload would reduce compressive residual stress,and opined bell therefore knew that any increase in retirement life could not,on any rational known engineering substantiation by test or analysis,be made without doing further testing,and could not be made without doing further substantiation of the tail rotor yoke in a yielded or bent condition a declaration from hugh waterman,an aeronautical engineer whose work included years with the faa,described the military failures of the yoke and opined bell was required to report those failures under code of federal regulations part,which governs the reporting of specified types of failures,malfunctions and defects to the faa.
additional facts learned by bell after.
in,bell had completed the second phase of its study of the military yoke failures.this study included a fatigue test of is,or yielded yokes.these or yielded yokes were tested for fatigue strength,and showed a percent degradation in fatigue strength.a hour fatigue life for the yielded yoke in military use was calculated based on the yielded yoke reduced endurance limit.the study concluded,conservatively,that the preconditioned yokes represented yokes that just barely passed a dimensional inspection,so that as long as a yoke can pass a dimensional inspection the current recommended retirement life of hours is still appropriate.
in,bell issued an alert service bulletin to provide inspection requirements,including dimensional testing with a special tool,for continued airworthiness of the yokes on model helicopters butler asserted that in the bulletin,bell again deceived the faa by concealing significant information and falsely representing that the probability of catastrophic fatigue failure was extremely remote.based on the failures of the yokes on military aircraft and the military study,boocock opined,among other things,that a in,bell knew the only reliable method of determining loss of residual compressive stress was by diffraction testing and b it was likely the accident would not have happened if bell had not increased the service life to hours and had adequately determined the fatigue life of the yoke on a helicopter,or if bell had required diffraction testing to directly determine the loss of residual compressive stress.butler other experts also stated the dimensional testing specified in the bulletin could not reliably measure the slight,minimally detectible bending that would indicate a yoke had been yielded.butler contended this point was confirmed by the fact that the crash occurred after dimensional testing of the accident yoke took place.moreover,after the accident the bulletin was revised,on may,to require diffraction testing of the yokes 
bell reply to butler evidence.
in reply to butler opposition,bell submitted a declaration from henry armstrong,a employee of the faa responsible for certification of civil aircraft.armstrong opined that part of the faa regulations does not require reporting of failures of aircraft parts in military applications,explaining that military aircraft are not certified by the faa,and manufacturers of those aircraft do not apply for and do not receive an faa type certificate part requires reporting only by type certificate holders,and the faa does not require bell to report failures on anything that they do not hold a type certificate for.armstrong observed that military and civil aircraft sometimes share common parts produced in a common production process,but that military aircraft with such parts frequently differ significantly from the civil aircraft.military aircraft,he explained,are frequently designed according to different load spectrums,resulting in different operating limitations and different component service lives.
the trial court order.
the trial court granted bell motion for summary judgment.the court concluded military aircraft failures are not subject to the mandatory reporting requirements of far part,and bell failure to report them to the faa did not establish the fraud exception to the statute of repose.the court observed butler had cited no regulation expressly requiring such reporting and presented no evidence that military failures were in practice reported to the faa.the court also rejected butler claim that bell violated part by representing the probability of catastrophic failure of the tail rotor yokes was extremely remote,since that claim too was founded upon the irrelevant nondisclosure of military failures 
judgment was entered in bell favor on july,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
we conclude that the facts proffered by butler support the applicability of the fraud exception to the statute of repose,and therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.specifically,we hold that under part a of the faa regulations,bell had an affirmative duty to report the failures that occurred in identical tail rotor yokes installed on military aircraft,referred to by the parties as dual use parts.the withholding of that information brings these lawsuits within the statutory exception applicable when a manufacturer has knowingly misrepresented to the faa,or concealed or withheld from the faa,required information material to the maintenance or operation of the aircraft or part that is causally related to the harm.gara,b.
our conclusion is required by the plain meaning of part,and is the only interpretation consistent with the faa statutory responsibility to promote the safe flight of civil aircraft.contrary to the trial court conclusion,interpreting part in accordance with its plain meaning in no way expands the scope of the faa jurisdiction.in addition,there is no merit in bell contention that summary judgment was proper based on the absence of a causal relationship between bell failure to report the military accidents and this accident.we treat each of these points in turn.
bell had an affirmative duty to report the military failures in the tail rotor yoke under the plain language of far part.
butler contends,and we agree,that the plain language of part of the faa regulations required bell to report the five military accidents to the faa,once bell had determined those accidents were caused by failures in a critical aircraft to those installed on bell model helicopter part provides that 
t he holder of a type certificate shall report any failure,malfunction,or defect in any product,part,process,or article manufactured by it that it determines has resulted in any of the occurrences listed in paragraph c of this section.a.
paragraph c lists a rotorcraft hub or blade structural failure,c,which includes the tail rotor yoke.
on its face,part applies.bell was the holder of a type certificate for the model helicopter.bell manufactured the tail rotor yoke that caused the military accidents,using it in both the model and several military models.part says bell is required to report any failure in any product,part,process or article manufactured by it that it determines has resulted in the listed occurrences.those occurrences include tail rotor yoke failure.bell determined in that fatigue failure of the yoke it manufactured caused the military aircraft accidents.consequently,bell obligation to report those failures is patent.the regulation contains no exceptions.
accordingly,nothing in the plain language of the regulation excuses bell from reporting the failure of a dual use tail rotor yoke merely because it is installed on a military helicopter.moreover,even if part were less clear,we would be required to interpret it in consonance with the statutory charge given to the agency which issued it.the faa raison is to promote safe flight of civil aircraft a when issuing certificates,the faa is obliged to consider an air carrier duty to provide service with the highest possible degree of safety in the public interest,b a.indeed,as one court observed more than thirty years ago,the requirement of safety permeates the whole federal aviation act.gabel hughes air.we find it inconceivable that an agency charged with the safe flight of civil aircraft would or could forswear the receipt of information so patently relevant to its statutory responsibilities,simply because the defective part was installed on a military rather than a aircraft.such an interpretation does not make abundant good sense as bell claims it makes no sense at all in light of the faa regulatory obligations 
bell nonetheless argues,despite the clarity of the regulatory language,that part is directed only at failures on civil,aircraft.we discuss that contention next.
there is no merit in bell contention that the reporting requirement of part is directed only at failures on aircraft.
bell argues,and the trial court agreed,that military yoke failures are not required to be reported to the faa under part,because the regulation clearly is directed to the holder of a type certificate,and military aircraft are not aircraft.this interpretation is sensible,bell contends,because the significant differences between civil and military aircraft mean that problems which surface in one application will not inevitably occur in the other.moreover,bell points out,military helicopters are built to specifications and requirements of the armed forces,which establishes the standards and procedures for maintaining the airworthiness of its aircraft,over which the faa has no authority.similarly,the trial court appeared to conclude that interpreting part as meaning what it says would result in having expanded the scope of the faa jurisdiction.
bell argument is fundamentally flawed.first,bell points to no basis upon which we might find the words of the regulation ambiguous.well settled principles of statutory construction tell us that when language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it.esberg union oil cal th,d,internal quotations and citations omitted.more significantly,however,bell argument and the trial court conclusion are based on an entirely false premise,namely,that the reporting of military accidents determined to have been caused by an aircraft part used in both civil and military aircraft would somehow expand the faa jurisdiction.that premise is patently erroneous.
certainly,part is directed to the holders of type certificates for civil aircraft,and it is only those aircraft and those manufacturers over which the faa has jurisdiction.however,the requirement to report a failure or malfunction in an aircraft part,whether the part is installed on a or military aircraft,has nothing to do with the faa jurisdiction,and most assuredly does not expand it.the faa responsibility to promote the safety of civil aircraft flight necessarily gives it the authority to require a civil aircraft manufacturer to file reports on any matter that is clearly relevant to the safety of a aircraft.that is all part does.the requirement to report a military failure under the circumstances specified in part requires no action by the military.it in no way interferes with military decisions on the airworthiness of military aircraft or their components.it merely requires bell,after it has determined that a military accident was actually caused by a part also in use on its aircraft,to report that occurrence to the faa nothing in that requirement expands or purports to expand the faa jurisdiction.
bell insists that substantial differences exist between civil and military aircraft,and problems which surface in military aircraft will not inevitably occur in civil aircraft.there may indeed be instances where the information reported to the faa about a defective part in a military aircraft does not have equal significance to the performance of that part in a civil aircraft that,however,is for the faa to decide.irrelevant information may be discarded,but the faa can not fulfill its obligation to promote civil aircraft safety if information which may be highly relevant to safety is withheld in the first instance.in short,the faa decision whether to act on a particular report submitted to it has no bearing on whether a report is required,nor should it 
in sum,our interpretation of part,consonant with its plain meaning and with the faa statutory role in the safety of civil aircraft,does not expand the scope of the faa jurisdiction.the regulation merely requires a manufacturer to report any failure,malfunction,or defect in a part manufactured by it,when the manufacturer has determined the defect has resulted in one of the occurrences listed in the regulation.we discern no reason in law or public policy to exclude from this reporting requirement a failure in a critical part used on a manufacturer aircraft,simply because the failure occurred on a military aircraft 
bell is not entitled to summary judgment based on the alleged lack of causal relationship between its failure to report the military accidents and the occurrence of this accident.
bell also argues there is no causal relationship between its failure to report the military accidents and this accident bell points out that in,two years before the accident,it fully informed the faa,as well as helicopter operators,of the need to inspect and immediately replace any tail rotor yoke that had been damaged by static overload.therefore,bell contends,its failure to report the incidents involving military aircraft can not be deemed causally related to the crash.
the argument has no merit.if the faa had been aware of five catastrophic yoke failures in,when bell increased the retirement life of the yoke to hours,the faa may have been inclined to question the increase,or require further evaluation,or require diffraction testing the last of which the faa did require after this accident occurred.we can not conclude,on this record,what the faa would have done,and we certainly can not conclude as a matter of law there was no relationship between the withheld information and the accident.see steggerda,gara achilles the problematic application of the knowing misrepresentation exception transp,the faa can not ask for more extensive examinations of a problem that it does not know exists because a manufacturer withheld or concealed the required information the faa may well have required flight tests into actual icing conditions had the manufacturer accurately and timely reported the known defect.in short,causation which bell presented no evidence in its summary judgment matters for resolution by the trier of fact 
conclusion 
we discern no basis in the language of part,or in sound public policy,for excusing bell from reporting the catastrophic failures of a yoke it manufactures and installs on both civil and military helicopters.once bell actua
