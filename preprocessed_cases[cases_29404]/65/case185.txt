in this products liability diversity case,elizabeth crowder austin,et,appellants,appeal the summary judgment dismissal of their action against for damages for the wrongful death of their decedent,andrew.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
andrew austin austin was a year old college graduate in his fourth month as a production manager for television station wabg in greenville,mississippi.on june,austin was assigned to set up the station electronic news gathering eng van for a live broadcast in downtown greenville,in front of the city hall.his duties typically included operating the telescoping mast that was mounted on the van in order to facilitate the broadcast.the mast,which fed through a hole in the roof of the van,was constructed of aluminum tubes nestled inside each other that could be extended by air pressure.on the day in question,the van was parked by someone other than austin underneath power lines.when the mast was raised,it became entangled with the power lines,sending volts through the mast and electrifying the van and its appurtenances.when austin touched the van,he received a fatal electric shock.
no federal or state statute or regulations or similar requirements such as osha or american national standard institute standards dictate how telescoping masts should be constructed,perform or operate.masts are used by the military,border patrol,firefighters,and the television industry.however,each sector uses the masts for a somewhat different purpose.
the telescoping mast at issue was manufactured in by the,and in may of that year was sold by to quality coach,a company in indiana that purchased component parts and integrated them into vehicles pursuant to the demands of an end user.did not do business with quality coach after or.in december wabg purchased the mast,as a separate item,from alan haines,custom construction of monroeville,new jersey,the invoice reflecting that it was used and completely rebuilt.was unaware,until a time after the accident in question,that wabg had acquired the mast.in or wabg in a separate transaction or transactions acquired from one or more sources other than and other than haines a and microwave antenna,neither of which were manufactured or sold by which does not make or sell items of that kind.the and microwave antenna house the movable camera and transmitting antenna that are to be placed on the top of a telescoping mast.
wabg had a eng van which it had purchased from a third party did not and does not make or sell such vans.in,wabg,through its own employees,integrated into its eng van the mast and separate payload components,which included a quick set and a microwave antenna.that process involved cutting a hole in the top of the van,affixing the mast to the floor of the van where it could extend through that hole,and attaching the separate and the antenna to the top of the mast.the wabg employee that performed this work was at that time aware of the risk that the telescoping mast could be raised into overhead power lines and he therefore placed two warning plaques on the van,one on the dashboard of the van and the other near the lever that activated the telescoping mast,stating something to the effect of check around the van before raising the mast and look for all overhead obstructions.these two plaques were in addition to the warnings sic sign s that came affixed to the telescoping mast that warned of overhead danger as well.
although originally sold the mast with a constant pressure switch,which required an operator to continuously depress the switch in order to raise or lower the mast,when wabg integrated the mast into its eng van,it rigged a bungee cord to hold down the pressure switch.the bungee functioned as a crude remote control,enabling the mast to be raised and lowered without a person physically applying constant pressure.
austin surviving mother,individually and as administratrix of his estate,father,and sister,filed this wrongful death and survival products liability action in against and other defendants in mississippi state court,alleging as to that at the time the mast left control,it was defective in design,and that failed to provide adequate warnings or instructions.they further alleged respecting that it breached its duty to warn like wabg about the dangers posed by its product,in light of its knowledge of five or six deaths by electrocution involving its masts the case was removed to federal court on diversity grounds.the parties agree that mississippi substantive law governs this case.
on november,the district court granted motion for summary judgment,dismissing all of the appellants claims against it.judgment for was certified as final under fed.civ.b.appellants have timely appealed.

mississippi products liability act 
in holland prestage,so d,the mississippi supreme court rejected the consumer expectations test which it had earlier applied in products liability cases and adopted instead the analysis accordingly,prestage also rejected the consumer expectation test driven doctrine that an open and obvious danger could not render a product defective.prestage,so d at.prestage was decided march.soon thereafter,the legislature passed the products liability act,ann.smith mack trucks,so d.the substantive provisions of the mississippi products liability act mpla are inapplicable to cases filed before july,the effective date of the mpla,and such cases are governed by prestage.smith at.all cases filed after july,are fully governed by the mpla.because the instant suit was filed after july,it is fully governed by the mpla.
the mpla provides that 
in any action for damages caused by a product except for commercial damage to the product itself 
a the manufacturer or seller of the product shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove by the preponderance of the evidence that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller 
i.the product was defective because it deviated in a material way from the manufacturer specifications or from otherwise identical units manufactured to the same manufacturing specifications,or 
the product was defective because it failed to contain adequate warnings or instructions,or 
the product was designed in a defective manner,or 
the product breached an express warranty or failed to conform to other express factual representations upon which the claimant justifiably relied in electing to use the product and 
ii the defective condition rendered the product unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer and 
iii the defective and unreasonably dangerous condition of the product proximately caused the damages for which recovery is sought.ann.a.
in this appeal,appellants do not raise any contentions under section i manufacturing defect or section i express warranty or representation,but rely only on claims of inadequate warning section i and defective design section i.
concerning defective warning claims section a i the mpla provides 
c i in any action alleging that a product is defective because it failed to contain adequate warnings or instructions pursuant to paragraph a i of this section,the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove by the preponderance of the evidence that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller,the manufacturer or seller knew or in light of reasonably available knowledge should have known about the danger that caused the damage for which recovery is sought and that the ordinary user or consumer would not realize its dangerous condition.
ii an adequate product warning or instruction is one that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have provided with respect to the danger and that communicates sufficient information on the dangers and safe use of the product,taking into account the characteristics of,and the ordinary knowledge common to an ordinary consumer who purchases the product or in the case of a prescription drug,medical device or other product that is intended to be used only under the supervision of a physician or other licensed professional person,taking into account the characteristics of,and the ordinary knowledge common to,a physician or other licensed professional who prescribed the drug,device or other product.ann.c,
e in any action alleging that a product is defective pursuant to paragraph a i of this section,the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable if the danger posed by the product is known or is open and obvious to the user or consumer of the product,or should have been known or open and obvious to the user or consumer of the product,taking into account the characteristics of,and the ordinary knowledge common to,the persons who ordinarily use or consume the product.ann.e.
as to design defect claims section a i the mpla provides 
b a product is not defective in design or formulation if the harm for which the claimant seeks to recover compensatory damages was caused by an inherent characteristic of the product which is a generic aspect of the product that can not be eliminated without substantially compromising the product usefulness or desirability and which is recognized by the ordinary person with the ordinary knowledge common to the community.ann.b,
f if any action alleging that a product is defective because of its design pursuant to paragraph a i of this section,the manufacturer or product seller shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove by the preponderance of the evidence that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller 
i the manufacturer or seller knew,or in light of reasonably available knowledge or in the exercise of reasonable care should have know,about the danger that caused the damage for which recovery is sought and 
ii the product failed to function as expected and there existed a feasible design alternative that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm.a feasible design alternative is a design that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm without impairing the utility,usefulness,practicality or desirability of the product to users or consumers.ann.f 
inadequate warning claim 
the appellants claim that the mast at issue was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous when it left control in may because of inadequate warnings.the district court dismissed this claim,noting that the warning labels that were placed on the mast specifically cautioned the operator that he or she could be killed if the mast were raised near power lines in mississippi,a warning may be held adequate as a matter of law where the adverse effect was one that the manufacturer specifically warned against.cather catheter tech.
the warnings on the mast clearly connected contact with power lines and risk of death.moreover,to the extent this danger was not already obvious,we refer to the testimony of donnie reid,the operations manager at wabg who conducted austin safety training and trained him in setting up the live truck.reid warned austin that before raising the mast he should check that the truck was on level ground,check for obstacles overhead such as trees and power lines,never raise the mast if there were overhead obstacles,and maintain a clearance from any power lines.furthermore,on the day in question reid specifically told austin that he did not need to raise the mast to do the shot from the city hall location 
the warnings on the mast see note above seem clearly adequate,particularly taking into account the ordinary knowledge common to an ordinary consumer who purchases the product.ann.c ii.in any event,the uncontradicted evidence establishes that austin was adequately warned of the danger he encountered using the mast and that that danger was either known or open and obvious to him and certainly should have been known or open and obvious to him.ann.e provides that with respect to claims under paragraph a i liability for inadequate warnings or instructions the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable if the danger is known or is open and obvious to the user or should have been known or open and obvious.see also,city of jackson ball,so d,the dangerous product user need give no further warning after the contractor has actual knowledge of the danger.mississippi chem.rogers,so d at knowledge of danger by an independent contractor relieves the owner from the duty of warning the independent contractor or his employees emphasis by ball sprankle bower ammonia chem,cir in an action for negligent failure to warn,there is no right to recover where the party to be warned is already aware of the danger and,there is no duty to warn when the user has actual knowledge of the danger.quoting hobart sohio petroleum,aff,cir gray manitowoc,cir no duty rests upon a manufacturer or seller to warn a purchaser of a dangerous design which is obvious,quoting harrist tool,so d,
there is also the matter of proximate cause.under ann.a i and iii the plaintiff clearly has the burden to prove that the claimed failure to adequately warn was a proximate cause of the accident in question.see wolf stanley works,so d,proximate cause not shown where there was no evidence that desired warning would have had any causative impact,citing wyeth,fortenberry,so d,little liquid air,cir en banc plaintiff must show that adequate warning would have altered conduct,citing fortenberry,so d at.where the party to be warned has been informed of the danger,the manufacturer failure to warn thereof is not shown to be a proximate cause,at least absent evidence that a manufacturer warning would have changed that party conduct.fortenberry,so d at.see also id.at citing with approval kirsch picker int l,cir there is simply no evidence that murphy did not know of the danger in using radiation therapy.on the contrary,the only evidence is that he had such knowledge.any failure to warn by picker would not have been the proximate cause of kirsch injuries.here the uncontradicted evidence is that reid adequately warned austin.in light of this,and in the absence of any contrary evidence,it can not be assumed that any further warning by would have altered austin conduct.thus,appellants failure to warn claims must also fail because proximate cause has not been shown.
duty to warn 
appellants also claim a duty to warn.this claim fails for the same reasons discussed in section above.additionally,we conclude that the mpla precludes imposition on a manufacturer or seller of a duty to warn at least where detrimental reliance on a manufacturer or seller warning is not involved.this appears to be required by the provision of ann.a that 
the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller 
the product was defective because it failed to contain adequate warnings or instructions,or 
emphasis added.
similarly,section c i provides that with respect to claims of inadequate warnings or instructions pursuant to paragraph a i the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller,the manufacturer or seller knew or should have known of the danger posed by the product and that the ordinary user or consumer would not realize its dangerous conditions emphasis added.
we agree with the mississippi court of appeal statement in palmer volkswagen of,so d,wl at,that the plain meaning of the mpla language is that the statute imposes liability on the manufacturer or seller for warnings that were inadequate at the time of sale,not for warnings that became inadequate at some later time.
design defect 
appellants claim that the mast was defectively designed in two respects,namely that it did not have a proximity warning device pwd and that it was not insulated 
appellants claim that the mast should have had a pwd which would have either given a warning sound or signal,or stopped the mast from continuing to rise,when the mast came within a certain distance of a power line.has manufactured and sold such a device,called a,starting in it commenced attempting to develop the in and produced a prototype which it exhibited at the april national association of broadcasters convention.thereafter,it made some improvements to the and began selling it in september.the only other pwd referenced in the evidence is the sigalarm,manufactured by another company.it was first used in the broadcast industry in or.pwds used in the broadcast industry or in eng vans are and were sold by the manufacturer either to van assembling companies,which then sell the van with mast,payload,and pwd to broadcasters,or are sold directly to the station,which does its own integration.the pwd is a separate item,not a part of the mast itself,and is affixed on top of the mast payload the and antenna which itself sits on the top of the mast.the and antenna are likewise items separate from the mast itself and are manufactured by companies other than mast manufacturers.the cost of a pwd is and has been approximately to percent of the cost of the mast.in unsuccessfully attempted to sell its pwd to wabg,which declined to purchase it and continued to use its van without a pwd.as early as the or sigalarm manufactured a form of pwd which was used on cranes respecting the horizontal movement of the crane boom.prior to the only use of pwds on elevating masts was the use by the border patrol,which in or first began placing of a modified form of sigalarm pwd on elevating masts,on top of which the border patrol would mount infrared sighting devices used to view aliens crossing the border at night 
b insulation 
with respect to insulation,the summary judgment evidence showed that telescoping masts were not and never had been insulated.the only exception to this was that commencing in made some telescoping masts,through not for eng vans,the top tube of which was of fiberglass rather than metal,which the rest of the mast was.this was apparently done for military surveillance devices.although fiberglass is nonconductive at least unless dirty or wet it was not used to avoid anticipated problems of electricity coming into the mast,or for related safety reasons,but to avoid interference with separate communications devices that were placed on top of the mast.in the late began working on the development of an entirely,telescoping mast,a prototype being first built in or,but the project was abandoned and no such masts were produced or sold.moreover,if the and antenna,which sit on top of the mast and extend horizontally from it a distance considerably greater than the diameter of the mast,came into contact with a live electrical wire the current would pass down wires contained in the nycoil that runs around the mast and connects with the camera and antenna on the to the base of the mast and the van.the summary judgment evidence showed without contradiction that neither telescoping masts used in the broadcast industry or in eng vans,nor devices,nor their cameras or antennas,were or had ever been insulated.
c discussion 
the mpla,section f,provides with respect to a claim that a product is defective because of its design pursuant to paragraph a i that the manufacturer shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer ii the product failed to function as expected and there existed a feasible design alternative that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm emphasis added.
in wolf stanley works,so d,the court observed that the test for determining whether a product contains a design defect set out in prestage has probably been replaced by the statutory command that there is no liability unless the product failed to perform as expected.citing f ii.we conclude that the mpla,in section f,unambiguously precludes recovery against the manufacturer on the basis of design defect unless the product failed to function as expected,and that this preclusion of recovery is applicable even though the facts are such that design defect recovery against the manufacturer would have been available under the prestage test notwithstanding that the product functioned as expected two other preliminary observations are appropriate in this regard.first,the mpla makes plain that the failed to function as expected requirement is to be applied as of the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller.id.f under the undisputed facts here,the relevant time is accordingly may,when sold the elevating mast to quality coach.second,the mpla makes it plain that in claims of design defect the plaintiff has the burden to prove that the product failed to function as expected when it left the manufacturer control.f manufacturer shall not be liable if the claimant does not prove that at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer t he product failed to function as expected 
the failed to function as expected requirement of section f appears to largely reinstate for design defect cases a frequently expressed requirement of the consumer expectations test which prestage had abrogated in favor of the broader test.see,prestage,so d at i n a consumer expectations analysis,ordinarily the phrase defective condition means that the article has something wrong with it,that it did not function as expected internal quotations and citations omitted.see also,todd societe bic,cir en banc hernandez tokai,
in gray manitowoc,cir,a products liability case governed by mississippi law,we applied the consumer expectations or consumer contemplation test,id.at,to hold as a matter of law that the plaintiff,gray,a construction employee injured when struck by the horizontally moving boom of the crane his employer was using on the job,could not recover under strict products liability or negligence from the manufacturer of the crane.the crane was in the boom down position which obscured the crane operator field of vision to the left of the boom,where gray was standing when struck.gray claimed the crane lacked adequate warnings and was defectively designed because it lacked mirrors,closed circuit television cameras or other devices to enable the operator to see to the left side of the crane when operated in the boom down position.id.at.we held that,as a matter of law,there could be no recovery,notwithstanding the testimony of gray and an inexperienced that they were unaware of the blind spot,because the evidence 
demonstrated a common awareness in the construction industry of both the limitation on the operator field of vision inherent in the design of such cranes and the dangers posed by this limitation.plaintiff adduced no evidence that manufacturers of other cranes of the vintage of the equipped them with mirrors,television cameras or other similar devices.rather,the evidence showed that there was no such industry custom of providing such devices.id.at.
we also noted that the crane functioned properly for its intended purpose.id.at.
we find gray highly instructive here 
here,the evidence is that at the relevant,when the mast left telescoping masts or their payloads,whether in the broadcast industry or any other,were insulated so as not to conduct electricity or were either equipped or used with any sort of pwd,and the danger of electrocution if the mast was raised so th
