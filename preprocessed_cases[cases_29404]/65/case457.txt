in this case,several tire manufacturers,a tire industry trade association,and public citizen,petitioned for review of safety standard adopted by the national highway traffic safety administration.standard requires new cars to have warning systems for tire.
in our initial opinion,we held that the tire manufacturers and the trade association lacked standing to challenge the safety standard.public citizen,nhtsa.we ordered supplemental submissions from public citizen to determine whether it satisfied the requirements for standing under article iii of the constitution.see id.at.based on the supplemental filings and additional oral argument,we conclude that public citizen lacks standing to challenge the safety standard,and we dismiss its petition.
we discussed the relevant facts and background in our original opinion in this case.see public citizen,nhtsa.we recite only a brief summary here.
in the wake of accidents and deaths caused by vehicle tire blowouts,congress in passed the transportation recall enhancement,accountability,and documentation act tread act to impose new requirements.see,stat.among other things,the tread act required the secretary of transportation to promulgate a regulation requiring new vehicles to feature a warning system to indicate to the operator when a tire is significantly under inflated.id,stat.at codified at note.
acting through the national highway traffic safety administration and pursuant to the tread act,the secretary in published the final version of federal motor vehicle safety standard.see tire pressure monitoring systems,recon.granted in part.standard requires automakers to install tire pressure monitoring systems to warn drivers when the pressure in the vehicle tires is approaching a level at which permanent tire damage could be sustained as a result of heat buildup and tire failure is possible.at.the monitoring system must detect when one or more of a car tires is significantly that is,when a tire i is at or below psi,for most cars,or ii is percent or more below placard pressure.id.at,table.placard pressure is the recommended tire inflation pressure that automakers must print on a placard often found on the driver side door jamb.
under standard,the monitoring system must cause a dashboard warning light to illuminate within minutes after a tire falls below either of the two warning thresholds.at.
automakers must certify that the pressure monitor is compatible with the car original set of tires but need not certify that the monitor is compatible with replacement tires.id.at.if a driver installs replacement tires that are not compatible with the pressure monitor,the monitoring system must activate a dashboard malfunction light to warn the driver that the pressure monitor is no longer functioning that light must not switch off unless the driver installs compatible tires.id.at.nhtsa estimated that monitoring systems will fail about one percent of the time,in part because of incompatible replacement tires.office of regulatory analysis evaluation,dep t of,final regulatory impact analysis tire pressure monitoring.fmvss,at.at the high end,it estimated that less than percent of replacement tire designs would not work with the monitoring systems or will have other malfunction problems.id.at to.
public citizen,four individual tire manufacturers,and the tire industry association filed petitions for review of standard in this court.they challenged i the absence of a requirement that pressure monitors be compatible with all replacement tires ii the delay between significant and the illumination of the dashboard warning light iii the use of the standard for and iv the testing that nhtsa required for pressure monitors.see public citizen,at.in our initial opinion,we held that the tire manufacturers and the tire industry association lacked standing because they had failed to demonstrate a causal connection between their alleged injury and the adoption of standard.id.at.we therefore dismissed their petitions.id.
we also considered whether public citizen had standing to challenge standard.id.at.under article iii of the constitution,standing to sue requires injury in fact that was caused by the conduct of the defendants and that can be redressed by judicial relief.id.at citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d.to show injury in fact,a litigant must establish invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at quoting lujan,at.public citizen alleged as its injury in fact an increased risk of harm to its members under standard,some of public citizen members allegedly will suffer car accidents in the future that otherwise would be prevented if nhtsa were to adopt public citizen proposals.id.at.
in the original panel opinion,we explained that,under supreme court precedent,public citizen standing in this case is not precluded but is substantially more difficult to establish because its asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else.id.quoting lujan,at.we concluded that public citizen had demonstrated a concrete and particularized of the three requirements for injury in fact.at see also lujan,at.but we questioned whether public citizen met the third its asserted injury be actual or imminent.at.in particular,we noted that public citizen raised only remote and speculative claims of possible future harm to its members.id.at.such claims ordinarily are properly left to the policymaking branches,not the article iii courts allowing a party to assert such claims to obtain federal court jurisdiction threatens to eviscerate the supreme court standing doctrine.id.at.that is because,in these kinds of claims,virtually any citizen can claim injury because of a fractional chance of benefit from alternative action.id.at.allowing such claims would drain the actual or imminent requirement of meaning in cases involving consumer challenges to an agency regulation or lack of regulation would expand the properly role of the judicial branch beyond deciding actual cases or controversies and would entail the judiciary exercising some part of the executive responsibility to take care that the law be faithfully executed.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as we noted in the original panel opinion,however,this court has not closed the door to all cases.id.at.instead,this court has allowed standing when there was at least both i a substantially increased risk of harm and ii a substantial probability of harm with that increase taken into account.id.citing nrdc epa,and mountain states legal found.glickman.in applying this standard,we are mindful,of course,that the constitutional requirement of imminence as articulated by the supreme court necessarily compels a very strict understanding of what increases in risk and overall risk levels can count as substantial.id.at.
we concluded that the record was not sufficiently complete to determine whether public citizen met the mountain states and nrdc requirements,and we ordered supplemental briefing from the parties to address 
i whether standard as adopted creates a substantial increase in the risk of death,physical injury,or property loss over the interpretation of the tread act that public citizen has advanced,and ii whether the ultimate risk of harm to which public citizen members are exposed,including the increase allegedly due to nhtsa action,is substantial and sufficient to take a suit out of the category of the hypothetical.
id.at quoting nrdc,at.
public citizen challenges three aspects of standard i how the warning system works for replacement tires ii the lag time between significant and warning light activation and iii the standard for significant 
public citizen standing argument relies principally on the declaration of a statistician who purported to analyze the increase in death,injury,and property damage to public citizen members as a result of nhtsa decision not to adopt public citizen proposed version of standard.nhtsa and the intervenor auto manufacturers have filed their own statistical analyses criticizing public citizen data.the auto manufacturers
