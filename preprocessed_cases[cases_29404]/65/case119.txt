the manufacturer of the inch rocket launcher was the lockley manufacturing company,of new castle.the was made in the as a a and was subsequently reworked into a a in the by harvard interiors sic of louis.lockley manufacturing company,has,we believe,gone out of business 
two avenues of inquiry for you would be the naval air systems command and naval surface warfare center 
taylor did not attempt to contact lockley manufacturing because,based on the letter,he believed the company had gone out of business.instead,taylor sent additional foia requests to the naval air systems command and to the naval surface warfare center,the two naval agencies mentioned in the staff judge advocate letter.
on june,in response to the third foia request,the naval surface warfare center sent a copy of the engineering investigation report,dated june,which stated that a n investigation into the subject launcher history revealed that the launcher lot is.

on november,derienzo filed a complaint in federal court against harvard industries,the company believed to have refurbished the rocket launcher during the period between manufacture and his accident derienzo also named fictitious defendants john does.the complaint alleged,defendant harvard industries designed,manufactured,assembled,installed,modified,maintained,sold distributed the rocket launcher involved in the accident.derienzo did not name lockley manufacturing as a defendant because he believed it had gone out of business.
the trial court held an initial scheduling conference on march,and gave the parties until october,to conclude fact discovery.
on may,an engineering consultant retained by derienzo inspected the recovered portion of the rocket launcher.the identification plate on the launcher included the notation contract no.and the notation contractor lockley mfg.new castle.the tag also had the titles inspected,manufacturer and lot,but the information following the titles was illegible.
on may,counsel for derienzo and harvard industries deposed haywood hedgeman and charles paras,both navy employees from the naval surface warfare center,indian head division.hedgeman and paras testified they believed lockley manufacturing was the rocket launcher original manufacturer.paras believed the identification tag was a manufacturer identification tag,and the lot number on the tag was for lockley manufacturing,pennsylvania.he also believed lockley manufactured the rocket launcher in the.
based on this testimony,derienzo concluded lockley manufacturing was the original manufacturer of the rocket launcher.derienzo amended his complaint on june,four months after the statute of limitations expired,to substitute lockley manufacturing and entwistle company,lockley successor as the result of a merger,for two of the fictitious defendants named in his original november,complaint.derienzo retained the other fictitious defendants in the complaint but ceased taking steps to locate other defendants.
after being added to the suit,entwistle company retained attorney henry steck as counsel.steck had previously worked as a procurement officer for the united states air force and was familiar with labeling in matters.based on knowledge gained during his prior federal contracting experience,steck believed the identification tag likely indicated that lockley manufacturing was the contractor for a fiscal year contract,not the original manufacturer.his view directly contradicted the information provided by paras and hedgeman,the persons identified by the navy as cognizant personnel regarding the rocket launcher.steck reviewed a lockley manufacturing shop order logbook in possession,which entwistle company had not disclosed to derienzo in its.discovery requests the logbook revealed that lockley manufacturing modified rocket launchers in under contract.this confirmed that lockley was the contractor that modified the rocket launcher,not the original manufacturer.
on february,counsel for derienzo,harvard industries,and took second depositions of paras and hedgeman.paras acknowledged he was no longer certain that lmp actually referred to lockley manufacturing.hedgeman testified he believed lockley manufacturing was the original manufacturer of the rocket launcher solely because it was listed as the contractor on the identification tag.paras also testified he believed that the rocket launcher was originally manufactured in may because designated the month and year the launcher was originally manufactured 
based on paras new testimony that the rocket launcher was manufactured in may,steck revisited lockley logbook.the logbook revealed that lockley manufacturing had ceased manufacturing rocket launchers in.the logbook also recited that lockley manufacturing had purchased stacking lugs from lasko metal products on december,but it did not state for what purposes lockley manufacturing used the lugs.steck explained in his affidavit that,p rior to paras february,testimony,there was no reason to suspect that this shop order for components purchased by lockley from lasko metal products had any relationship whatsoever to the fabrication of the rocket launcher in question,which navy personnel had previously said was manufactured by lockley in the.
on march,steck deposed lockley manufacturing former president and chief engineer norman smilek.smilek had retired from lockley manufacturing in and was living in florida steck asked smilek for information regarding lot number.smilek replied that lasko metal products,not lockley manufacturing,used the lmp designation on its identification tags.steck immediately informed counsel for derienzo and harvard industries of smilek testimony,identifying lasko metal products as the manufacturer of the rocket launcher.
derienzo requested and was granted leave to file a second amended complaint in early april to substitute lasko metal products for fictitious defendant john doe.lasko metal products received its first notice of the suit when served with a summons and the second amended complaint on april,fourteen months after the statute of limitations had expired.lasko metal products moved for summary judgment,arguing derienzo
