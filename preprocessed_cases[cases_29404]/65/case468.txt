plaintiff brandi fox filed a medical malpractice action after gastric bypass surgery performed on her resulted in severe complications.in the course of discovery,fox received information that a medical device used during the surgery may have malfunctioned,causing her injury.fox then amended her complaint to add a products liability cause of action against the manufacturer of the device,ethicon,ethicon.ethicon filed a demurrer raising a statute of limitations defense,to which plaintiff responded by relying upon the delayed discovery rule most recently discussed by this court in norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart.
plaintiff alleges that she could not,with reasonable investigation,have discovered earlier that the medical device might have caused her injury.we granted review to determine whether such an allegation is sufficient to withstand demurrer,or whether we should adopt the rule announced in squibb superior court th,d squibb,that w hen a plaintiff has cause to sue based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence the statute of limitations starts to run as to all potential defendants.
we conclude that,under the delayed discovery rule,a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff has reason to suspect an injury and some wrongful cause,unless the plaintiff pleads and proves that a reasonable investigation at that time would not have revealed a factual basis for that particular cause of action.in that case,the statute of limitations for that cause of action will be tolled until such time as a reasonable investigation would have revealed its factual basis.we disapprove the decision in squibb superior court,supra,th,d,to the extent that it holds to the contrary.
facts and procedural history 
on april,respondent brandi fox underwent gastric bypass surgery and treatment the operation was performed by herbert gladen.during the surgery,fox was under general anesthesia and unconscious.fox went home following the surgery,but returned soon after the surgery because she felt ill.
fox condition worsened,moving gladen to perform exploratory surgery a few days after the gastric bypass operation.the exploratory surgery revealed a perforation at the stapled closure of the small intestine,which caused fluid to leak into fox abdominal cavity.gladen attempted to seal the perforation.in his operative report for the exploratory surgery,gladen failed to identify a cause for the perforation.fox required additional medical care and remained hospitalized until march.
on april,fox served gladen,and the hospital and medical center in fresno where the surgery and subsequent care took place,with a notice of intent to commence action pursuant to code of civil procedure section.fox filed a complaint for medical malpractice against the doctor and the treating hospitals in fresno county superior court on june.in her complaint,fox claimed that d efendants lacked the necessary knowledge and skill to properly care for her condition and were negligent and unskillful in the diagnosis,treatment,and prescription procedures utilized in treating her condition.the negligence claimed is for negligently performing,surgical,and care so as to cause injuries and damages to fox.
fox named as defendants gladen,the hospital and medical center,and does to,inclusive.the complaint alleged that the defendants named herein as does through,inclusive,were the agents,servants,and employees of each of the remaining defendants,and in doing the things hereinafter alleged,were acting within the course and scope of their authority as such agents,servants,or employees,and with the permission and consent of their codefendants.
when fox deposed gladen on august,the doctor testified that he had discovered a leak at the stapled closure of fox small intestine during the exploratory surgery.he further noted that the bowel had been stapled with an ethicon stapler,that the hospital had furnished the stapler,and that he had found on previous occasions that such a stapler had caused postsurgery leaks.
accordingly,on november,fox filed a first amended complaint adding the manufacturer of the stapler,ethicon,as a named defendant.in the first amended complaint,fox asserted a products liability cause of action against ethicon,alleging that she was injured by an ethicon stapler on or about april.fox used a judicial council form for products liability causes of action,specifying counts for strict liability relating to the design,manufacture,and assembly of the stapler,negligence,and breach of implied warranty.the first amended complaint also alleged that fox did not discover,nor suspect,nor was there any means through which her reasonable diligence would have revealed,or through which she would have suspected the ethicon stapler as a cause of her injury until the deposition of gladen was taken on august.
ethicon demurred to the first amended complaint,contending that the products liability claim was by the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure former section,former subdivision.stats,ch,see fn,post.in opposition,fox noted that she had no knowledge that the gastric bypass surgery would involve the use of a stapler or any similar device.
fox further stated that she never learned during the postsurgical care following the gastric bypass operation that the stapler had malfunctioned or could have caused the leakage and other problems,and that she first discovered the possibility of a stapler malfunction when her counsel notified her of gladen deposition testimony.finally,fox offered to file a second amended complaint to clarify the facts supporting her assertion that she had no reason to suspect the stapler until after gladen testimony,and that no reasonable person would have suspected that the ethicon product had malfunctioned.
fox attorney also filed a declaration stating that neither the operative report nor the reparative operative report indicated that the stapler had malfunctioned or misfired.the declaration also stated that gladen testimony was taken during the normal course of discovery in a medical malpractice lawsuit,fox was reasonably diligent in pursuing the lawsuit and discovery,and fox could allege that gladen never mentioned a stapler malfunction or defect during the entire course of his postsurgical care.
on june,the superior court sustained ethicon demurrer to the products liability cause of action without leave to amend,relying upon norgart,supra,cal th,d,and squibb,supra,th,d,to conclude that the statute of limitations barred the products liability cause of action.the superior court stated that when a plaintiff sues based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence,including medical malpractice as in fox case,the statute of limitations begins to run as to all defendants,including manufacturers possibly liable under products liability theories.the superior court also stated that fox failed to demonstrate that amending the complaint could overcome the limitations defense.fox timely appealed from the superior court order sustaining ethicon demurrer as to the products liability cause of action.
the court of appeal reversed the superior court order and remanded with directions to grant fox leave to amend to allege facts explaining why she did not have reason to discover earlier the factual basis of her products liability claim.in so ruling,the court of appeal held that squibb rule of imputed simultaneous discovery of causes of action did not apply.ethicon petitioned this court,and we granted review.
ii.discussion 
this case requires us to address once again the proper application of a statute of limitations.see gutierrez mofid cal d,jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly bernson industries cal th,d,bernson norgart,supra,cal th at,d.
statute of limitations is the collective term applied to acts or parts of acts that prescribe the periods beyond which a plaintiff may not bring a cause of action.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,accord,norgart,supra,cal th at,d.there are several policies underlying such statutes.one purpose is to give defendants reasonable repose,thereby protecting parties from defending stale claims,where factual obscurity through the loss of time,memory or supporting documentation may present unfair handicaps.bernson,supra,cal th at,d,jolly,supra,cal d at,see also davies krasna cal d.a statute of limitations also stimulates plaintiffs to pursue their claims diligently.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,jolly,supra,cal d at,see,bernson,supra,cal th at,d.a countervailing factor,of course,is the policy favoring disposition of cases on the merits rather than on procedural grounds.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,barrington robins cal d.
a plaintiff must bring a claim within the limitations period after accrual of the cause of action.code civ,civil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title,after the cause of action shall have accrued norgart,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,statutes of limitation do not begin to run until a cause of action accrues.romano rockwell international,cal th,d.
generally speaking,a cause of action accrues at the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,see neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,neel.an important exception to the general rule of accrual is the discovery rule,which postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,neel,supra,cal d at.
a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,citing jolly,supra,cal d at,see also gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d at,the uniform california rule is that a limitations period dependent on discovery of the cause of action begins to run no later than the time the plaintiff learns,or should have learned,the facts essential to his claim.under the discovery rule,suspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action,coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements,will generally trigger the statute of limitations period.norgart,supra,cal th at,fn,d,jolly,supra,cal d at.norgart explained that by discussing the discovery rule in terms of a plaintiff suspicion of elements of a cause of action,it was referring to the generic elements of wrongdoing,causation,and harm.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.in so using the term elements,we do not take a hypertechnical approach to the application of the discovery rule.rather than examining whether the plaintiffs suspect facts supporting each specific legal element of a particular cause of action,we look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing has injured them.
the discovery rule,as described in bernson,allows accrual of the cause of action even if the plaintiff does not have reason to suspect the defendant identity.see bernson,supra,cal th at,d.the discovery rule does not delay accrual in that situation because the identity of the defendant is not an element of a cause of action.see norgart,supra,cal th at,d,bernson,supra,cal th at,d.as the court reasoned in norgart,i t follows that failure to discover,or have reason to discover,the identity of the defendant does not postpone the accrual of a cause of action,whereas a like failure concerning the cause of action itself does.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.in norgart,we distinguished between ignorance of the identity of the defendant and ignorance of the cause of action based on the commonsense assumption that once the plaintiff is aware of the latter,he normally has sufficient opportunity,within the applicable limitations period,to discover the identity of the former.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,quoting bernson,supra,cal th at,d.
the discovery rule only delays accrual until the plaintiff has,or should have,inquiry notice of the cause of action.the discovery rule does not encourage dilatory tactics because plaintiffs are charged with presumptive knowledge of an injury if they have information of circumstances to put them on inquiry or if they have the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to their investigation.gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d at,quoting sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d at.in other words,plaintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable investigation after becoming aware of an injury,and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.
the legislature,in codifying the discovery rule,has also required plaintiffs to pursue their claims diligently by making accrual of a cause of action contingent on when a party discovered or should have discovered that his or her injury had a wrongful cause,code civ,subd.a within three years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered,subd.a w ithin three years from the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered,subd.a w ithin one year after the date the plaintiff either knew,or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known,one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered.this policy of charging plaintiffs with presumptive knowledge of the wrongful cause of an injury is consistent with our general policy encouraging plaintiffs to pursue their claims diligently.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.
in order to rely on the discovery rule for delayed accrual of a cause of action,a plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show the time and manner of discovery and the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.mckelvey boeing north american,th,d.in assessing the sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery,the court places the burden on the plaintiff to show diligence conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.ibid.
simply put,in order to employ the discovery rule to delay accrual of a cause of action,a potential plaintiff who suspects that an injury has been wrongfully caused must conduct a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of that injury.if such an investigation would have disclosed a factual basis for a cause of action,the statute of limitations begins to run on that cause of action when the investigation would have brought such information to light.in order to adequately allege facts supporting a theory of delayed discovery,the plaintiff must plead that,despite diligent investigation of the circumstances of the injury,he or she could not have reasonably discovered facts supporting the cause of action within the applicable statute of limitations period.
under the statute of limitations applicable to this case,a plaintiff must bring a cause of action for products liability within one year of accrual.code civ,former subd.products liability claims brought under either negligence or strict liability theories are subject to delayed accrual under the discovery rule.see fireman fund ins.sparks,th,d.normally,the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action should govern a cause of action for products liability.see norgart,supra,cal th at,d.for both negligence and strict liability products liability claims,the last element to occur is generally,as a practical matter,the injury to the future plaintiff.
fox alleges that she was injured by an ethicon stapler on april.she timely filed her medical malpractice claim on june,her cause of action for products liability was alleged for the first time in the first amended complaint filed on november,more than one year after her injury.accordingly,fox products liability action would only be timely if the discovery rule acted in some fashion to delay accrual of the cause of action 
the court of appeal below applied the discovery rule to fox products liability claims against ethicon,and ordered that the trial court judgment sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend be reversed and that the case be remanded to the trial court with directions to enter an order sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend the cause of action for products liability.
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,aubry blank kirwan cal d.i t is error for a court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.aubry,supra,cal th at,d,citing barquis merchants collection cal d.i t is also an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.aubry,supra,cal th at,d,citing blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.
this procedural posture differs from that of our prior cases discussing delayed accrual and the discovery rule.resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact.jolly,supra,cal d at.norgart,jolly,gutierrez,and sanchez involved appeals from summary judgments on the statute of limitations defense,and we therefore examined those cases in light of the undisputed material evidence presented to the court.code civ,subd.c see also aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,a triable issue of material fact exists only if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.thus,in our prior cases discussing the discovery rule,we were presented with a more fully developed factual basis for determining when and how the plaintiff discovered an injury,whether the plaintiff conducted a reasonable investigation,when such an investigation would have brought to light the factual basis for the cause of action for which the plaintiff sought delayed accrual,and whether the plaintiff could have discovered the factual basis for a cause of action earlier by exercising reasonable diligence.
here,however,we must assume to be true fox allegations that she did not discover,nor suspect,nor was there any means through which her reasonable diligence would have revealed,or through which she would have suspected the ethicon stapler as a cause of her injury until the deposition of gladen was taken on august.in addition,we also consider whether any defect in the first amended complaint could have been cured by fox proposed amendment to that complaint,in which she would have stated that she had no reason to suspect the stapler until after gladen testimony,and that no reasonable person would have suspected that the ethicon product had malfunctioned.
in order to employ the discovery rule to delay accrual of a cause of action,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she conducted a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of his or her injury.fox has only partially met this requirement by alleging that there was no way through which her reasonable diligence would have revealed,or through which she would have suspected the ethicon stapler as a cause of her injury until august.fox first amended complaint was,as the court of appeal below held,insufficient to withstand demurrer because it failed to allege specific facts supporting the allegations quoted above.the defect in fox first amended complaint,however,could have been cured by the proposed amendment to that complaint.
fox proposed second amended complaint would have properly alleged that the products liability cause of action did not accrue until after the stapler malfunction was revealed during the deposition of gladen.the facts that fox seeks to add to her complaint support her allegation that she did not suspect,nor did she have reason to discover,facts supporting a products liability action against ethicon until after deposing gladen.accordingly,we conclude that the court of appeal did not err in ordering the trial court to grant fox leave to amend her complaint 
ethicon,however,contends that we should adopt the more restrictive squibb formulation of the discovery rule.ethicon does not argue that the squibb formulation is mandated by this court decisions,or that we have expressly or impliedly adopted it,but rather,asserts that the squibb approach is consistent with our formulation of the discovery rule in prior cases.
in squibb,the plaintiff silicone breast implant was ruptured in an altercation in.two years later,the plaintiff learned that the implant had ruptured,that silicone was migrating down her arm,and that the silicone was a cause of physical injury in the form of ulcerations.squibb,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff argued that because she had been told that silicone was an inert and harmless substance,she did not actually suspect the manufacturer of the implant of wrongdoing until after reading a newspaper article in late.id.at,d.
the court of appeal held that the statute of limitations on the plaintiff products liability cause of action against the manufacturers of her silicone breast implants began to run when the statute of limitations on her medical malpractice action commenced.squibb,supra,at,d.as the court stated w hen a plaintiff has cause to sue based on knowledge or suspicion of negligence the statute starts to run as to all potential defendants,regardless of whether those defendants are alleged as wrongdoers in a separate but related cause of action.id.at,d.
we have neither approved nor disapproved the squibb formulation.in norgart,we declined to address whether the discovery rule applied by the court of appeal in that case was correct or whether the more restrictive squibb standard reflected the correct rule.we expressly declined to resolve any conflict between the holding of the court of appeal in squibb and the holding of the court of appeal below,holding instead that the wrongful death cause of action at issue in that case was barred under either formulation.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.
the court of appeal in the present case,after concluding that the squibb formulation was not mandated by our decision in jolly or adopted by this court in norgart,rejected its rule of imputed simultaneous discovery of causes of action and concluded that the delayed discovery of fox products liability claim should be analyzed based on the facts and circumstances relevant to that claim.in so holding,the court of appeal noted the sharp distinction drawn in our prior case law between a plaintiff ignorance of the identity of the person who committed a suspected wrong and ignorance of the existence of a cause of action.
in our previous cases addressing the discovery rule,we affirmed that ignorance of the identity of the defendant does not delay accrual of a cause of action,but that ignorance of a generic element of the cause of action does.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.such a distinction certainly exists in the context of a products liability action.although the identity of the is not an essential element of a products liability cause of action,and therefore ignorance of its identity will not delay the running of the statute of limitations see bernson,supra,cal th at,d,a plaintiff ignorance of wrongdoing involving a product defect will usually delay accrual because such wrongdoing is essential to that cause of action.see,clark baxter healthcare th,d triable issue of fact existed as to when the plaintiff knew or suspected wrongfulness component of products liability cause of action.
it is therefore consistent with our prior applications of the discovery rule to delay accrual of a products liability cause of action even when a related medical malpractice claim has already accrued,unless the plaintiff has reason to suspect that his or her injury resulted from a defective product.more broadly stated,if a plaintiff reasonable and diligent investigation discloses only one kind of wrongdoing when the injury was actually caused by tortious conduct of a wholly different sort,the discovery rule postpones accrual of the statute of limitations on the newly discovered claim.
in both jolly and norgart,the plaintiffs suspected or had reason to suspect that a product had caused their injury.in jolly,the plaintiff alleged injury caused by her mother ingestion of the synthetic drug estrogen diethylstilbestrol des while jolly was in utero.jolly,supra,cal d at.the undisputed evidence in that case showed that,as of,jolly at least suspected
