andersen manufactures and sells insulated glass products,including windows,doors,and skylights.according to andersen website,some of these products contain glass,the space between the panes being filled with an argon gas blend to minimize thermal transfer and increase the products energy efficiency.argon is a transparent,odorless,inert gas recognized for its insulating capabilities.in at least one of its product lines,andersen represented that it secures its insulating glass with two sealants,which helps provide a longer life for the windows,helping to prevent moisture from leaking in between the double glazing,and preventing the argon gas blend from leaking out.
andersen installs capillary or breather tubes in its windows that are destined for cold environs and those that are transported across or installed in high altitudes.the tubes are installed to enable the pressure between the panes to equalize with atmospheric pressure,thus eliminating any pressure disparity that would otherwise cause the panes to shatter or bulge.the tubes,however,cause the inert gas to diffuse out of the window and into the atmosphere,resulting in the space between the panes eventually being filled with air.
drobnak,a colorado resident,filed a class action complaint against andersen,alleging violations of minnesota law.drobnak sought damages and injunctive relief for the harm from andersen products fitted with capillary or breather tubes,when it was known within the industry generally and andersen specifically that capillary or breather tubes cause the loss of inert gas and,therefore,reduction in the insulating capability attributable to the use of such gas.drobnak sought to represent a nationwide class composed of a ll persons who own homes or other residential or commercial structures containing andersen glass products that are fitted with capillary or breather tubes and filled with inert gas.the complaint alleged seven counts,including violations of minnesota version of the uniform commercial code,various claims,and an equitable cause of action for unjust enrichment.
andersen moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,based largely on andersen express disclosure in its product guides that use of the capillary or breather tubes eliminates the argon gas from the product and results in a less effective insulating glass.andersen supported its motion with copies of excerpts of its product guides from to.
his original theory having likely been thwarted,drobnak cast about for an alternative basis for relief,this time by way of an amended complaint that advanced new theories of recovery and added two plaintiffs.in addition to the seven counts alleged in the initial complaint,the amended complaint asserted another claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability and future performance and a claim for common law fraud by omission.the reason for the alleged leaked argon gas also changed.specifically,the amended complaint alleged that 
andersen sold many insulated glass units that it represented were filled with inert gas when,in fact,the percentage of inert gas,versus air and other gases,sealed in those units at the time of manufacture was below.as a result,such units did not have the full insulating capability that they would have had were the units actually filled with inert gas.
andersen sold many products that had defective seals that caused permeation,or leakage,of the inert gas from between the glass panes.as a result,such glass products lose the insulating capability attributable to the gas fill.
the amended complaint also named two new plaintiffs cirks,a minnesota resident who purchased seventeen andersen windows in and,and markowitz,a pennsylvania resident who in purchased a home that contained andersen windows.each plaintiff alleged that he is informed and believes,and thereon alleges,that his andersen windows were not filled with inert gas at the time of purchase experienced gas leakage.the amended complaint did not set forth the source of the information or the reasons for the belief.
drobnak notified andersen of its breach of express warranties in march,and david yancey,the named plaintiff in a separate purported class action proceeding in the california state court system,also provided notice to andersen in march.the amended complaint alleged that andersen failed to remedy the breach and that f urther notice by additional plaintiffs and class members would be futile.the plaintiffs in the amended minnesota action again sought to represent a nationwide class,excluding california,of persons who own homes or other residential or commercial structures containing glass products that were manufactured by andersen.
andersen withdrew its first motion to dismiss and filed a second motion,which responded to the amended complaint.during the hearing on the motion to dismiss and in a letter to the court following the hearing,plaintiffs counsel asked the court for leave to amend should the court find that the amended complaint fails to state a claim.the plaintiffs did not move to amend or file a proposed amended complaint before the district court granted andersen second motion to dismiss.
the district court dismissed with prejudice the claims for failure to satisfy rule b,the claims for failure to provide adequate notice,and the equitable claim because there was an adequate legal remedy available.drobnak claim for breach of express warranty,however,was dismissed without prejudice because he had provided notice to andersen.his remaining claims were dismissed with prejudice because the statute of limitations had run and he failed to adequately plead fraudulent concealment.
after dismissal,plaintiffs moved for reconsideration and asked for leave to amend the complaint,attaching a proposed second amended complaint to the letter brief.in the proposed second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that counsel caused andersen windows to be tested by an independent laboratory through a consultant in the spring and summer of and that two windows,including one belonging to cirks were tested later in.plaintiffs did not allege that any of drobnak or markowitz windows were tested.according to the proposed second amended complaint,most of the windows that were tested contained argon gas levels of less than cirks window contained just over.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration,concluding that counsel request at oral argument and his request in writing did not comply with minnesota local rules because no amended complaint accompanied those requests.the district court reviewed the proposed amended complaint and found it troubling that cirks window was tested after plaintiffs filed their amended complaint.the district court found no reason to reconsider its dismissal and denied plaintiffs request for leave to amend.
the named plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of the amended class complaint,arguing that the amended complaint satisfied rule b and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the plaintiffs also contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that cirks and markowitz had not put andersen on notice of breach of contract and warranty and that plaintiffs claim for equitable relief was barred.drobnak argues that the district court erred in concluding that he failed to adequately plead fraudulent concealment for statute of limitations purposes related to his claims and for dismissing without prejudice his express warranty claim for want of subject matter jurisdiction.finally,the plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend the complaint.

allegations pleaded on information and belief usually do not meet rule b particularity requirement.see generally,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed james moore et,moore federal practice g ed.when the facts constituting the fraud are peculiarly within the opposing party knowledge,however,such allegations may be pleaded on information and belief.state bd.of admin.green tree fin,cir.rule b is deemed satisfied if the allegations are accompanied by a statement of facts on which the belief is founded.id.citing parnes gateway,cir see also moore federal practice g rule b may be satisfied if the pleader identifies the available information on which the allegation of fraud is founded,as well as the efforts made to obtain additional information.
plaintiffs alleged four counts sounding in fraud,but the amended complaint does not indicate whether the plaintiffs windows actually failed.each plaintiff pleaded,on information and belief,that his andersen windows were not filled with inert gas at the time of purchase experienced gas leakage.no facts were pleaded to support this broad allegation,and the plaintiffs did not identify the facts on which the belief was founded.moreover,pleading this allegation on information and belief was inappropriate because the plaintiffs possess the andersen products at issue.at the time the suit was filed,the sole access to the factual underpinnings supporting the conclusion that their windows did not contain inert gas.perhaps discovery would have explained why the products were not filled with inert gas,and perhaps that information is uniquely within andersen control.to get past the pleadings stage,however,rule b requires a plaintiff to plead the equivalent of the first paragraph of any newspaper story,parnes,at.here,the plaintiffs failed to plead facts to support the what that the products they own did not contain inert gas at the time of filing.instead,the amended complaint makes sweeping class allegations that all andersen products were not filled with inert gas,were sealed defectively,or were fitted with capillary tubes.accordingly,the amended complaint did not satisfy the rule b standard,and the district court rightfully dismissed it.
dismissal with prejudice of cirks and markowitz claims 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that they did not give adequate notice for their claims.in both the first and the amended complaint,plaintiffs pleaded that drobnak and yancey,the california plaintiff,notified andersen of the breach,that andersen failed to remedy the breach,and that f urther notice by additional plaintiffs and class members would be futile.in other words,cirks and markowitz were not required to give notice because andersen already knew of its alleged breach from drobnak and yancey.at oral argument,plaintiffs counsel argued that the lawsuits filed against andersen provided further notice,bringing plaintiffs tally to four notices.we agree with the district court that as a matter of law cirks and markowitz did not provide adequate notice.
under minnesota law,a buyer must notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy.a.notice is sufficient so long as it let s the seller know that the transaction is still troublesome and must be watched,cmt.the bar for sufficiency is low,but notice is nevertheless important because it informs the seller that the transaction is claimed to involve a breach,and thus opens the way for normal settlement through negotiation.id.
according to the minnesota supreme court,the notice requirement serves three purposes notice provides the seller an opportunity to correct any defect notice affords the seller an opportunity to prepare for negotiation and litigation and notice provides the seller an opportunity to investigate the claims independently while the products remain in a relatively pristine state.church of the nativity of our lord watpro,overruled on other grounds,ly nystrom,see also christian sony of,d.in analyzing the uniform sales act provision which preceded and corresponds to,judge learned hand made the following observation 
the plaintiff replies that the buyer is not required to give notice of what the seller already knows,but this confuses two quite different things.the notice of the breach required is not of the facts,which the seller presumably knows quite as well as,if not better than,the buyer,but of buyer claim that they constitute a breach.the purpose of the notice is to advise the seller that he must meet a claim for damages,as to which,rightly or wrongly,the law requires that he shall have early warning.

cirks and markowitz relied solely on drobnak and yancey notice and lawsuits,alleging that further notification would be futile.by choosing not to provide notice,cirks and markowitz deprived andersen of its opportunity to cure the alleged defect and failed to open the way for normal settlement through negotiation.a,cmt.the failure to notify andersen is especially troubling because plaintiffs theory of the case changed significantly after cirks and markowitz joined the lawsuit.drobnak original complaint alleged that windows destined for travel across or installation in high altitudes were fitted with capillary tubes causing inert gas to disperse into the air.the amended complaint included the first complaint theory,along with allegations that the windows were never filled with inert gas the windows seals failed causing the dispersion of the inert gas.moreover,after adding cirks and markowitz as named plaintiffs,the class allegations expanded to include all americans,except californians,who owned a home or business that contained an andersen product.minnesota statute required the plaintiffs to give andersen some notification of its breach,and the district court thus did not err in holding that cirks and markowitz had failed to provide any
