chad and michelle the bring suit against general motors corporation gm for injuries sustained by their daughter,when she was partially ejected from a chevrolet tahoe during a rollover accident.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gm on the ground that the suit is preempted by federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss.the appeal.for the reasons stated below,we reverse in part,affirm in part and remand to the district court.
facts and proceedings 
a minor,seriously injured her arm when she was partially ejected from the passenger side window of a tahoe during a accident.the sued gm in texas state court,alleging common law theories of strict liability and negligence for the defective design,manufacture,and marketing of the tahoe side windows.the claimed that gm use of tempered glass in the side windows was unreasonably dangerous and that the use of advanced glazing would have decreased the likelihood of passenger ejection the also brought marketing and claims.
gm removed this action to federal district court based on diversity jurisdiction.gm moved for summary judgment on the ground that fmvss,the federal safety standard for glass used in motor vehicle windows,preempted the claim.in their reply to gm motion,the argued that fmvss did not preempt their advanced glazing claim.they also claimed that the tahoe side windows did not comply with fmvss as designed and that the tempered glass in the window was defectively installed and implemented.the district court granted gm motion for summary judgment on the basis of preemption and dismissed the noncompliance and defective design claims sua sponte.motors,wl,at.
the glazing standards in fmvss were promulgated by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa under the federal safety act fsa,et.the fsa preempts state regulations,b,but compliance with a motor safety standard prescribed under the act does not preempt common law suits,e.fmvss specifies performance requirements for the types of glazing that may be installed in motor vehicles and specifies the vehicle locations in which the various types of glazing may be installed.nhtsa,glazing materials,final rule,july,codified at hereinafter glazing materials final rule.the purpose of fmvss is to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces,to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility,and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisions.
in,following a review process,nhtsa updated fmvss to incorporate the most recent standards from the american national standards institute ansi,the american national standard for safety glazing materials hereinafter.glazing materials final rule.at.under both the old and revised versions of fmvss,tempered glass and laminated glass are approved glazing materials.see tempered glass,laminated glass,glazing,incorporated by reference in,a.laminated glass is approved for use throughout a vehicle,while tempered glass can be used anywhere other than in the windshield.see,items.the ansi standards also state that o ne safety glazing material may be superior for protection against one type of hazard,whereas another may be superior against another type n o one type of safety glazing material can be shown to possess the maximum degree of safety under all conditions.id.at.
nhtsa rollover accident research 
fmvss became the focus of nhtsa rollover protection policy in the early after congress mandated that nhtsa initiate rulemaking on rollover protection.nhtsa,withdrawal of advance notices of proposed rulemaking,june,hereinafter notice of withdrawal.in,nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on rollover protection which solicited comments on both rollover prevention measures such as vehicle stability controls and occupant ejection prevention strategies such as advanced glazing.nhtsa,rollover prevention,advance notice of proposed rulemaking.following the notice of proposed rulemaking,nhtsa chose to focus its rollover protection policy on advanced glazing and issued status reports on its advanced glazing research in and.notice of withdrawal.at.
in,congress passed the department of transportation and related agencies appropriation act of,which noted that the nhtsa had been considering the utility of advanced side glazing since and directed nhtsa to complete and issue a final report on advanced side glazing.id.at citing the house of representatives conference report on.in response,nhtsa withdrew its notice of proposed rulemaking on advanced glazing.id.nhtsa stated in its notice of withdrawal that it declined to require advanced glazing based on safety and cost concerns.id.the safety concerns included nhtsa desire to establish standards for promising new technologies like side air curtains.id.nhtsa also noted that the safety benefits of advanced glazing in side windows were not without drawbacks,including a slightly increased risk of minor neck injuries.id.at.with regard to cost,nhtsa noted that manufacturers disputed its estimate that it would cost between and to modify the front side windows.id.at.nhtsa stated that it would not continue to examine a potential requirement for advanced side glazing.id.nhtsa decided that it was more appropriate to devote its research and rulemaking efforts to projects other than ejection mitigation through advanced glazing and that in the future it would focus its efforts on developing more comprehensive,test procedures to evaluate potential new technologies.id.
in,however,congress passed a law requiring nhtsa to initiate rulemaking in two areas rollover prevention including stability enhancing technologies which prevent vehicles from rolling over and o ccupant ejection prevention.id.b,c as part of this comprehensive response to rollover accidents,nhtsa has continued to research the ways that advanced glazing can reduce occupant ejection.see,stephen summers et,highway traffic safety,nhtsa crashworthiness rollover research program,paper,at reporting on crashworthiness tests employing advanced side glazings developed under previous nhtsa research.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment on preemption grounds de novo.wright allstate ins,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.brewer wilkinson,cir.
iii.discussion 
this appeal is about whether fmvss,which governs motor vehicle glazing safety,preempts a common law suit alleging that gm use of a permitted glazing technology was unsafe.we are the first appellate court to rule on this question nhtsa studied the question of whether to require advanced glazing in side windows for over a decade and decided in to leave the existing glazing standards in place and pursue a comprehensive,approach to ejection mitigation instead.notice of withdrawal.at.gm argues that this decision embodies a federal policy regarding motor vehicle glazing which would be frustrated by a texas rule requiring advanced glazing in side windows.gm contends that this conclusion is compelled by geier american honda motor,d,which found that fmvss the nhtsa safety standard for occupant crash protection,preempted state common law claims.see.the argue that fmvss differs significantly from fmvss and that nhtsa decision not to require advanced glazing in side windows left fmvss intact as a minimum safety standard that does not preempt state tort actions.geier,at.they also argue that nhtsa decision not to require advanced glazing in side windows is similar to the coast guard decision not to require propeller guards,which was held to be in sprietsma mercury marine,d.because we find that fmvss differs significantly from fmvss and does not establish a federal policy which would be frustrated by a state common law rule requiring advanced glazing in side windows,we hold that the suit is not preempted.
implied conflict preemption 
even where congress has not completely displaced state regulation in a specific area,state law is nullified to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.federal regulations can have a preemptive effect equal to that of federal laws.id.conflict preemption can arise in one of two ways,either when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.the second form of implied conflict preemption is at issue here.
the geier court authoritatively construed the statute under which fmvss was promulgated.at.nhtsa promulgated fmvss under the authority granted to it by the fsa,et,and its predecessor,the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act tsa,et.the fsa contains both an express preemption provision,b formerly codified at d,and a savings clause,e formerly codified at k.the express preemption provision states that w hen a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter,a state may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance only if the standard is identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter.b.this provision applies to state statutes and regulations.see geier,at.construing the express preemption provision.the savings clause states that c ompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.e.the savings clause removes tort actions from the scope of the express preemption clause and preserves those actions that seek to establish greater safety than the minimum safety achieved by a federal regulation intended to provide a floor.geier,at.construing the savings clause.the express preemption clause and the savings clause read together,reflect a neutral policy,not a specially favorable or unfavorable policy,toward the application of ordinary conflict principles.id.at.
fmvss and federal policy on rollover prevention 
we must determine what federal policy fmvss expresses before we can decide whether the claims are subject to conflict preemption.when nhtsa regulations are only intended to create a minimum safety standard,states are free to adopt common law rules which require a greater level of safety.geier,at.see also wright ford motor,slip op.at,cir,noting that compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards does not exempt a person from liability at common law internal quotations omitted.when a federal safety standard deliberately leaves manufacturers with a choice among designated design options in order to further a federal policy,a common law rule which would force manufacturers to adopt a particular design option is preempted.id.at.see also hurley motor coach,cir holding that the safety restraint policies expressed in fmvss would be frustrated by a common law rule requiring seatbelts in heavy vehicles.finally,a federal agency choice not to require a particular safety measure and leave the regulatory status quo intact is not necessarily preemptive.sprietsma,at.holding that the coast guard decision not to regulate a particular aspect of boat safety is fully consistent with an intent to preserve state regulatory authority pending the adoption of specific federal standards.
to determine the federal policy expressed in fmvss,this court looks to the text of the regulation,the history of nhtsa regulation in this area,and nhtsa or department of transportation statements construing fmvss.geier,at.in order to find implied conflict preemption,it is not necessary for an agency to provide a specific expression of agency intent to,made after rulemaking.id.at.
fmvss text and history are straightforward.the text of the regulation incorporates the ansi standards for glazing materials and provides minimal restrictions on the placement of different types of glass,a.prior to,fmvss included the text of the ansi standards and piecemeal amendments the amendments deleted much of the existing text and incorporated the ansi standards by reference.see glazing materials final rule.at.the ansi standards only require manufacturers to test small sections of the glazing materials,usually under one square foot.see.with the exception of the test for glazing materials to be used in egress windows,none of the glazing materials are tested in the frame in which they will ultimately be used.see id.on its face,fmvss is a materials standard that sets a safety floor to ensure that the glazing materials used by manufacturers meet certain basic requirements.
in addition,the text of fmvss differs significantly from fmvss,the regulation considered in geier.fmvss,entitled occupant crash protection,includes detailed implementation timelines which required manufacturers to introduce airbag technology gradually prior to.see,the amount of passenger cars complying with the regulation by means of an airbag shall not be less than percent of the manufacturer total production of passenger cars manufactured on or after september,and before september.fmvss requires manufacturers to conduct tests involving full vehicles and crash test dummies.see id.for passenger vehicles produced in the model year of the vehicle at issue in geier,fmvss permitted manufacturers to comply with the crash protection requirements by using one of several specific protection system options set out in the standard.geier,at.in geier and later in hurley,federal courts held that the carefully constructed safety restraint options and timelines in fmvss preempted state common law actions which would impose liability on manufacturers for failing to adopt litigants proposed improvements.geier,at.hurley,at.the text of fmvss strongly supports the conclusion that it expresses a federal policy which would be frustrated by lawsuits seeking to establish common law rules to the contrary.all of these implementation timelines,full vehicle testing procedures and options conspicuously absent from fmvss.
next we turn to nhtsa statements interpreting fmvss to see if nhtsa has clearly articulated a glazing materials policy which would be frustrated by the suit.federal agency statements interpreting specific agency regulations are given substantial deference.auer robbins,d.the geier and hurley courts had the benefit of extensive agency statements interpreting fmvss and making nhtsa occupant crash protection policy clear.geier,at.citing nhtsa,occupant crash protection final rule,july,codified at hurley,at citing nhtsa,occupant crash protection final rule,july,codified at.hurley stated that t he commentary accompanying the final rules indicates that even the details of seat belt as the retractor mechanism,mounting position,and buckle hotly debated during the rulemaking process and that seat belt use among heavy truck drivers is far below the national average for all vehicles.at.in light of this specific and detailed commentary,the hurley court concluded that a common law rule requiring three point seat belts could reduce utilization and thereby undermine fmvss safety objectives.id.likewise,the nhtsa final rule commentary on the version of fmvss at issue in geier is pages long and lays out in detail the agency concerns regarding public acceptance of airbag technology.at.the geier court concluded that a common law rule imposing liability for not installing airbags in all their cars would frustrate nhtsa clearly stated and policy of encouraging manufactures to introduce airbags gradually in order to win over a skeptical public.at.the manufacturers in geier and hurley identified specific statements in nhtsa official commentary on fmvss which supported their position that the plaintiffs safety enhancements would actually frustrate nhtsa safety goals.hurley,at.
the nhtsa final rule commentary on the version of fmvss at issue here is very different from the commentary on fmvss analyzed in geier and hurley.it is short only eight pages in the federal register and does not discuss nhtsa rollover protection policies.glazing materials final rule.at.the commentary identifies the policy goal behind the update as increasing the clarity and usability of the standard.id.at stating that t he amendments of the past years have resulted in a patchwork of requirements and that inco
