background 
in march,a fire caused damage to an office building that plaintiff owned.plantiff investigated the fire and ultimately attributed the cause of the fire to a busway malfunction.a busway is a system of four insulated aluminum bars in aluminum casing that run from the basement to the top floor and distribute electricity to the floors.defendant manufactured the busway and another company installed it in.plaintiff brought an action asserting strict liability and negligence based on manufacturing defects and failure to warn.
plaintiff advanced alternate theories for recovery.plaintiff argued that the presence of contaminants in the busway indicated that there was a manufacturing defect.alternatively,plaintiff argued that if the contaminants had infiltrated the busway through water intrusion after it left defendant control,then defendant had failed to place a warning label on the product instructing owners to keep the busway free of water and other contaminants.
after discovery,defendant filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion based on its rejection of plaintiff expert reports as untimely.plaintiff appealed and this court reversed the district court decision because the timeliness of plaintiff report had been unfairly affected by extensions that had been granted to defendant without a corresponding extension for plaintiff.see investors i,square d,cir.
on remand,defendant again filed a motion for summary judgment and for exclusion of one of plaintiff experts,carl martin,under rule of the federal rules of evidence and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.after the district court held a daubert hearing,it granted defendant motion to exclude martin testimony and granted defendant motion for summary judgment on the manufacturing defect and negligence claims.the district court denied defendant motion for summary judgment on the failure to warn claim.
prior to trial on the failure to warn claim,defendant filed a motion for sanctions for spoliation of evidence because plaintiff had failed to preserve all but a small section of the busway.the case proceeded to trial on the sole issue of whether the warning label defendant placed on its busways was placed on the busway in question when it left defendant control in.plaintiff elicited testimony from gregory goens,the building maintenance supervisor,who testified that he had not seen a warning on the busway.his testimony was controverted by ron rush,defendant senior staff engineer,who testified that in the manufacturing of the busways,defendant placed a warning label on specific components of the busway assembly and on the installation instructions.
at the close of evidence,defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law on the basis that there was no evidence the busway lacked a warning label when it left defendant control.at that point,the district court granted defendant motion for sanctions for spoliation of evidence and struck goens testimony.the district court then granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law,concluding that even with goens testimony there remained an absence of evidence on whether a warning label was missing from the busway at the time it left defendant control in.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
spoliation sanction 
plaintiff first argues that the district court erred in granting defendant motion for spoliation and striking the testimony of goens.in the motion,defendant asserted that plaintiff investigators had access to the busway after the fire and were able to inspect and evaluate it.then without notice to the defendant,plaintiff threw away fifty to sixty feet of the busway and saved only four feet.the portion of the busway that was saved was not a piece that would have contained a warning.defendant argued that plaintiff had a duty to preserve the busway and that defendant was prejudiced by plaintiff actions because there was no way for defendant to defend against the claim that the busway lacked a warning.the district court agreed and struck goens testimony as a sanction for the spoliation.
plaintiff asserts that the district court should not have granted defendant motion without a showing that plaintiff was acting in bad faith when it destroyed the majority of the busway after the fire,relying on aramburu boeing,cir.in aramburu,however,we did not reach the question of what kinds of sanctions could be used for spoliation generally.instead,we focused solely on the use of an adverse inference jury instruction as a spoliation sanction.we noted that the general rule is that bad faith destruction of a document relevant to proof of an issue at trial gives rise to an inference that production of the document would have been unfavorable to the party responsible for its destruction.id.at.
in its ruling on the spoliation motion,the district court cited to aramburu as guiding precedent and explained that an jury instruction would not be appropriate because defendant had not shown that plaintiff acted in bad faith.to support its decision to impose a different type of spoliation sanction without a showing of bad faith,the district court cited to an unpublished decision from this court,jordan miller aircraft service,wl cir.in that case,we noted that c ourts have not generally imposed a similar requirement of bad faith when considering other sanctions for the spoliation of evidence.id.at citing allstate ins.sunbeam,cir dillon nissan motor,cir unigard sec.ins.lakewood eng g,cir.we then upheld the dismissal of miller damages claim as a spoliation sanction without a showing of bad faith on the part of miller.id.at.
defendant was not required to show that plaintiff acted in bad faith in destroying the evidence in order to prevail on its request for spoliation sanctions.the district court found that plaintiff had a duty to preserve the evidence because it knew or should have known that litigation was imminent,and defendant was prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence because there was no substitute for a direct visual examination of the busway.the district court also imposed the least severe sanction that would be appropriate to balance out the prejudice to the defendant.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendant motion for sanctions and striking goens testimony.
judgment as a matter of law on the failure to warn claim 
plaintiff next argues that the district court erred when it sustained defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law on the failure to warn claim.it contends there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could have concluded that all the elements of a prima facie case for strict liability were met.in order to establish a prima facie case for negligence or strict liability in a kansas products liability case,plaintiff must produce evidence that shows the injury resulted from a condition of the product the condition was an unreasonably dangerous one and the condition existed at the time it left defendant control.messer amway,d,citing jenkins amchem prods.plaintiff asserted at trial that defendant had failed to include a warning label on the busway regarding the risks of water infiltration into the busway.defendant offered testimony that it did place such a warning label on the busway when it was manufactured.
in ruling in favor of the defendant on its motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court concluded that there was a complete absence of proof on the issue of whether the warnings were missin
