john and roxie pritchett,christian and cathy scott,and gaylan and carman fix brought three separate actions in state court against cottrell,cottrell,jack cooper transport,jct,and others,for injuries that the men sustained while operating a ratchet system designed by cottrell cottrell removed the cases to federal court,and the district court denied motions to remand.in each case,the district court dismissed jct for fraudulent joinder and lack of subject matter jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to cottrell,concluding that the appellants had failed to generate a genuine dispute of fact over whether their injuries were caused by a specific design defect.pritchett and scott appeal the denial of their motions to remand,asserting that the removal was improperly perfected.pritchett,scott,and fix all appeal the adverse grants of summary judgment.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
in this summary judgment context,we view the evidence and recite the facts in the light most favorable to the appellants,the nonmoving parties in these cases.ruminer motors,cir.
pritchett,scott,and fix were each employed by jct as drivers of specially designed rigs,used generally to haul automobiles from the car manufacturer to the dealership.in separate incidents,all three men were injured while operating a ratchet system that was attached to the trailer of their rig and used in securing vehicles to the trailer for transport.the ratchet system in each case was designed by cottrell and required a great deal of physical force to operate.in general,each appellant testified that while he was manually operating the ratchet system,either to or to untie a vehicle on his trailer,he experienced a sudden release of pressure or tension in the chain,which caused him to slip,fall,and incur injuries.
some understanding of how the ratchet system works is necessary for our discussion.according to the affidavit of elwood feldman,vice chairman of cottrell,most of cottrell trailers are equipped with a chain and ratchet system that is used to tie down the vehicles being hauled.the ratchet system includes a chain and ratchet assembly for each corner of every vehicle hauled on the rig.the driver secures a vehicle to the trailer by attaching a hook in a slot on the undercarriage of the vehicle.the ratchet chain is attached to the hook and sometimes passed around an idler bar to achieve a proper chain angle.with a grab hook,the driver takes up the slack of excess chain.the driver then inserts a bar into two parallel holes on the ratchet assembly and tightens the chain by pulling on the bar.this turns the shaft or spool of the device,and the ratchet pawl clicks as it engages the teeth of the spool as the chain tightens,preventing the release of the tension generated.the chain wraps around the ratchet shaft no more than two times during normal use and should not overlap on itself.the driver tightens the chain until it compresses the loaded vehicle suspension to a desired level,and he then repeats the process on each corner of that vehicle.
the process of untying a vehicle is merely the reverse of the process unless the rig is equipped with the newer mechanism.the driver applies additional pressure by pulling on the bar so that he can lift the dog or pawl out of the ratchet teeth and allow the chain to unwind little by little until completely released.on models equipped with the newer ratchet,the mechanism eliminates the need to apply excessive physical force to untie the vehicle but it does not alter the process.
scott was injured in missouri on january,when untying a pickup truck from the trailer of a cottrell rig,which was not equipped with a mechanism.he testified that while loosening the ratchet by exerting pressure on the bar to release the dog,he thought the chain rolled on the ratchet causing a sudden release of pressure that jerked and popped his shoulder and wrist.scott app.at.he stated that he had experienced this type of occurrence on prior occasions.
fix was injured on october,in kansas while operating a rig that was equipped with a mechanism,but his injury occurred during the process of tightening the chain.he asserted that his footing was slippery due to leaking hydraulic fluid and the chain rolled and popped,causing him to fall and injure his knee.cottrell app.at.fix stated he had complained about the way the ratchet system would just bounce you,explaining that it like pulling on pounds and all of a sudden somebody gives you about six inches,and then it just really whacks you.id.at also stating that the the ratchet type setup was causing injuries.fix brought another claim alleging injuries from an unrelated ladder incident that occurred on october,in kearney,nebraska.the ladder,which had been mounted on his trailer rig,broke while he was climbing it,causing him to fall and sustain injuries.
pritchett was injured on april,in kansas while operating a cottrell rig equipped with a ratchet system,but like fix,he was injured while tying down a vehicle to the top deck of the rig,not while using the mechanism to untie the vehicle.pritchett stated that while tightening the ratchet on his rig,a sudden force threw back the chain and bar,causing him to fall from the trailer and injure his arm and shoulder.id.at.he stated he had experienced this type of occurrence on more than ten occasions.
pritchett,scott,and fix and,as noted,their respective wives brought separate actions against cottrell and others in the circuit court of jackson county,missouri.on claims of strict liability,negligence,and breach of warranty against cottrell,they sought compensation for the injuries incurred as a result of alleged defects in the design of cottrell rigs.cottrell filed a notice of removal of civil action in federal court with the consent of every defendant except jct.the written consents were attached to the notice of removal as an exhibit.cottrell asserted that jct consent was not necessary as there was no valid claim against jct,and it had been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction.
pritchett,scott,and fix moved to remand their cases to state court,asserting a lack of unanimous consent to removal.they challenged cottrell assertion that jct consent was not necessary because it was fraudulently joined,and pritchett and scott asserted that the consent of defendant general motors corporation gm was not valid because it was not signed by an attorney licensed to practice in missouri.the district court denied the motions to remand,dismissed jct for lack of jurisdiction,and ultimately granted gm a voluntary dismissal.
following discovery,cottrell moved for summary judgment.to substantiate their design defect claims,pritchett,scott,and fix presented the expert opinion of linda weseman regarding the ratchet design.she is an engineer who has studied the industry,the rigs,and their designs for the purpose of applying engineering principles to issues involving injuries experienced by drivers while tying down and untying vehicles on the rigs.she has secured vehicles on rigs,inspected rigs,met with drivers,and conducted tests measuring the force levels that are applied by drivers when securing vehicles to the rigs.citing various studies,reports,and her own observations,she stated that the ratchet and chain and untying system requires significant manual force to operate,that cottrell knew of the significant danger of drivers being injured while tying and untying cargo,and that the technology for alternative devices requiring less manual force has been available for decades and would have prevented the injuries in these cases.in particular,she referred to a study that determined that the ratchet used by delavan,which is substantially similar to the cottrell ratchet tie down system,was improperly designed,allowing sudden releases and chain overloads.cottrell add.at.
in each case,weseman stated her opinion that there are feasible,safer,alternative designs,such as tire restraints or hydraulically powered systems,that would have required little or no manual exertion and would have protected the drivers from injury in the event of a sudden release of force in either the or the untying process.she also stated that a wheel strap tie down system has been used successfully for many years in europe and by competitors in this country.id.at.she offered her opinion that the ratchet system design is unreasonably dangerous and defective.weseman also provided an opinion in fix case that the ladder designed and manufactured by cottrell failed to meet the safety criteria established by applicable safety codes and standards.
the district court granted summary judgment on the strict liability claims,concluding that the appellants had failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that their injuries were caused by a specific defect in the ratchet system.the district court later amended the judgment,granting summary judgment for the same reasons on the appellants claims of negligence and implied warranty.
motions to remand 
pritchett and scott appeal the district court denial of their motions to remand their cases to state court for lack of unanimous consent.they assert that,because the attorney who signed gm consent was not licensed to practice law in the state of missouri or admitted to practice in the united states district court for the western district of missouri,gm consent to removal was invalid.we review de novo the denial of a motion to remand and the district court exercise of removal jurisdiction.chaganti,nowotny,cir,cert.denied,d.
the general removal statute,see b,permits a notice of removal to be filed within days after receipt of the pleading and has been interpreted to require that all defendants must consent to the removal.see,chicago,ry.martin.i t is well settled that a removal could not be effected unless all the parties on the same side of the controversy united in the petition.dep t of corr.schacht,d kennedy,concurring removal requires the consent of all of the defendants.bradley.cas,cir stating this general rule.while the failure of one defendant to consent renders the removal defective,each defendant need not necessarily sign the notice of removal.see getty oil ins.of,cir cited with disagreement on a different point of law in marano enters.of,cir.there must,however,be some timely filed written indication from each served defendant,or from some person with authority to act on the defendant behalf,indicating that the defendant has actually consented to the removal.id.
we conclude that the requirement of a timely filed written indication of consent was satisfied in this case.gm attorney signed gm written consent in a timely fashion,it was attached to cottrell notice of removal as an exhibit,not a pleading,and there is no contention that the attorney who signed the document did not have authority to act on the company behalf.the notice of removal with its attached exhibit was filed in federal court by cottrell attorney,who was licensed and admitted to practice both in the state of missouri and the united states district court for the western district of missouri.the exhibit sufficiently represented gm consent to removal,and as the district court correctly noted,the appellants cite no legal authority for the proposition that the consent must be filed as a separate document or pleading.accordingly,the district court properly exercised removal jurisdiction and did not err in denying the motions to remand.
summary judgment 
we review the district court determination of state law,its conclusions of law,and its grant of summary judgment de novo.gamradt fed,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the record show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see,anderson liberty lobby,d ruminer,at.in considering a motion for summary judgment,we do not weigh the evidence,make credibility determinations,or attempt to discern the truth of any factual issue.thomas corwin,cir.t he substantive law will identify which facts are material.anderson,at.
state law governs the substance of these products liability actions.erie tompkins.the district court determined that kansas law governs the claims of pritchett and fix,that missouri law applies to scott claims,and that nebraska law governs fix ladder claim.these rulings are not appealed.instead,appellants argue that the district court erroneously concluded that they had failed to present competent evidence that their injuries were caused by a specific design defect under the applicable state laws.
the ratchet design defect claims 
there is no dispute that the ratchet claims are governed by kansas and missouri law.the parties have not identified any substantial differences between the laws of these states regarding the need to demonstrate both a design defect and proximate cause.however,it is fair to say that the determination of when a product is actionable because of the nature of its design is one of the most agitated controversial question s that courts face in the field of products liability law.richcreek motors,internal marks omitted.
in both kansas and missouri,the plaintiff bears the burden to demonstrate that the product design was defective and that the defect caused the plaintiff injury.see wilcheck doonan truck equip,richcreek,at.each state articulates the definition of a design defect in its own way.kansas law provides a clear statement that the product must be both defective and unreasonably dangerous.jenkins amchem prods,cert.denied,d.the court in jenkins emphasized that the plaintiff must establish some specific defect.id.at.missouri law provides a somewhat broader articulation of the standard,requiring a showing that the product,as designed,is unreasonably dangerous and therefore defective.richcreek,at internal marks omitted.in missouri,the courts have stated that unreasonable danger and causation are the heart and soul of a design defect case,id.internal marks omitted,and that the term unreasonably dangerous needs no judicial definition,rodriguez suzuki motor,en banc.
kansas has adopted the consumer expectations test,which states that a product design is unreasonably dangerous where the product is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.jenkins,at quoting the restatement second of torts cmt.i.under this test,e vidence of a reasonable alternative design may be introduced but is not required to prove a design defect.delaney deere.missouri has not adopted the consumer expectations test but treats the term unreasonably dangerous as the ultimate issue for the jury.rodriguez,at.in missouri,n othing prevents the litigants from arguing that the utility of a design outweighs its risks,or that consumer expectations were violated,or any other theory of unreasonable dangerousness supported by the evidence.newman ford motor,en banc.
missouri articulation of what constitutes a design defect may be somewhat more relaxed than that of kansas,but these distinctions do not affect the outcome of the cases before us.both states permit a design defect to be proven by sufficient circumstantial evidence,as long as the defect may be inferred without resort to conjecture and speculation.peters motors,see jenkins,at kansas law see also hickerson pride mobility prods,cir discussing missouri law.also,mere proof of injury or that an accident occurred,standing alone,will not make out a submissible case in either state.see shaffer amada,d,citing winters sears,roebuck,wilcheck,at.with these principles in mind,we turn to the evidence before us.
appellants argue that the district court misconstrued the nature of the defect they asserted by focusing on their inability to pinpoint the mechanical origin of the sudden release that they experienced.appellants articulate that the defect lies in the manual nature of the ratchet system,which they allege is unreasonably dangerous because it requires a great deal of physical force to operate,and at the same time is prone,for various reasons,to sudden releases of tension.appellants assert that absent the manual nature of the ratchet system,they would not have been in physical co
