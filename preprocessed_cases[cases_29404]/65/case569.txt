cheryl stephen was injured in a accident when the tread separated from the right rear tire of her ford explorer.the explorer was towed to a scrap yard,where an insurance adjuster took a few snapshots of the vehicle to establish that it was a total loss,and where stephen boyfriend took a few polaroid pictures of the car when he and stephen went to collect her personal belongings.the explorer was then sold for scrap and the tire discarded.about a year later,stephen sued ford motor company and north american tire,llc for damages,alleging the tire and the vehicle were defectively designed.at trial,the court excluded the testimony of stephen tire expert,substantially limited the testimony of her directional stability expert,then granted ford and firestone motions for nonsuit.stephen appeals,challenging the evidentiary rulings and the nonsuits based on those rulings.we hold that expert testimony was necessary to establish stephen claims against both ford and firestone,that the tire expert testimony was properly excluded because there was no foundation for his opinions or conclusions,and that the directional stability expert testimony was properly limited for precisely the same reason.we affirm the judgment.
in august,cheryl stephen family purchased a used ford explorer.on september,stephen felt a vibration,then lost control of the explorer,which crashed into the center divider of the freeway,then rolled over.a california highway patrol officer who arrived shortly after the accident reported that the explorer right rear tire was still inflated but that its tread was completely gone that is,it had detreaded,which means it had separated from the tire although the front tires on the explorer had been replaced about a month before the accident,the rear tires were the firestone radial atx that were on the vehicle at the time of its original sale by ford.at the time of the accident,the explorer had been driven about miles.
stephen insurer had the explorer towed to a salvage company for storage.in early october,an adjuster took photographs of the explorer to substantiate stephen claim,then declared the vehicle a total loss.about the same time,stephen and her boyfriend went to the salvage yard to retrieve some cds from the explorer,and her boyfriend took some polaroid photographs of the vehicle,some of which show that the right rear tire was still on the explorer at that time.both sets of photographs are amateurish,and none of the pictures are anything like those that would be taken by a tire expert documenting an inspection.in,the explorer was scrapped and sold for salvage,and the tire was discarded.
in september,stephen sued ford motor company and north american tire,llc,alleging that the explorer was defectively designed by ford,that the tire was defectively designed by firestone,and that both ford and firestone were negligent ford and firestone answered,discovery ensued,and the case was tried in february and march.
ford and firestone each filed motions in limine to exclude testimony by stephen experts,and a series of evidence code section hearings were held to determine the admissibility of various opinions by baumgardner stephen tire expert and david renfroe stephen vehicle stability expert ultimately,the trial court for reasons discussed at length below excluded baumgardner testimony in its entirety and imposed significant limitations on the scope of renfroe testimony.
stephen proceeded to put on the remnants of her case,at the conclusion of which ford and firestone motions for nonsuit were granted.the court found stephen had failed to present a prima facie case of negligence or strict liability firestone because she did not have any expert testimony to show the tire failed as the result of a design defect,and that stephen had failed to present a prima facie case of negligence or strict liability ford because the evidence did not show the applicable standard of care or that ford fell below it,or that the design of the explorer was a substantial factor in causing her injuries,or that the design presented a substantial risk of harm,or that there were feasible alternative designs.
stephen appeals from the judgment in favor of firestone and ford.
discussion 
stephen contends the issues about baumgardner testimony go to its weight,not its admissibility,that the trial court should not have excluded his testimony,and that the nonsuit in favor of firestone can not stand.we disagree.
baumgardner testimony at the section hearing 
stephen theory is that the tread separated from her right rear tire because this tire,like all radial atx size tires made by firestone between and,was defective.according to baumgardner,there was an increase in the number of firestone radial atx tire failures beginning with tires manufactured during,and the failures peaked with tires manufactured during and firestone recalled all of its radial atx tires in,after stephen accident.the defect,according to baumgardner,was that the rubber skim stock between the inner and outer radial steel belts was of insufficient strength to hold the tire together when the vehicle was moving at high speed.he said there was a weakness in the peel strength,which occurred,he said,because there was excessive sulfur in the skim rubber recipe firestone used in manufacturing its tires.because of this systematic design defect and based on his examination of the amateur photographs of stephen tire,baumgardner concluded that stephen tire had failed due to the design defect inherent in firestone radial atx tires there were a number of problems with baumgardner testimony.
qualifications.although he is a tire engineer who worked for firestone for years designing bias ply tires and performing tire failure analyses in the company retread division,baumgardner did not work on firestone radial atx or on any steel belted radial tires.he retired from firestone in and since that time has worked as a consultant.he is not a chemist he has no background in rubber chemistry or rubber compounding,and he is not a licensed engineer he has a bachelor degree in industrial design.
scientific theory.baumgardner testimony was based on his review of work by other experts,and his design defect opinion was formed,he said,using a analysis,a technique based on the compilation,evaluation,and continuous refining of data for example,the number of occurrences or trends,the time of occurrences,and similar bits of information from other supposedly similar tire failures.baumgardner conceded that the method requires empirical testing to confirm the conclusions reached from an examination of the data,and admitted that no tests were done by him or anyone else on stephen tire which had been discarded before this case was filed or on any similar tire.baumgardner conceded that he did not know of anyone using the analysis for forensic tire evaluation,that he himself had never used the analysis in any prior case,and that he was not aware of any peer review publication approving the analysis for that use.
the amateur photographs.baumgardner used the amateur photographs as a substitute for testing.although he did not know what kind of camera or lens had been used to take either set of photographs,and although he could only guess at the distance at which the photographs were taken six to ten feet,and although the photographs did not show the size of the tire or its number which would have shown the date and place it was manufactured,baumgardner testified that he nevertheless found the photographs sufficiently detailed to support his conclusion that the failure was in the middle of the rubber.as for his inability to determine the time of manufacture,baumgardner said he assumed that,because the tire was on a explorer,it was manufactured during or.
the photographs which we have examined do not show the interior of the tire or the inside sidewall,and baumgardner testified that he could see only percent of the outside wall and none of the inside.there are no photographs of the tread belt piece that detached from the tire.in response to a hypothetical question,baumgardner admitted that,had he been shown similar photographs of a different manufacturer tire,he would not have been able to opine with a reasonable degree of engineering certainty about the reason why the tread came off the tire or whether there was a manufacturing or design defect when the tire left the manufacturer plan,and that it was only because he knew stephen tire was a firestone tire that he considered the photographs sufficient to support his conclusion about this tire failure.
baumgardner conceded that he had never before testified that a tire was defective without first examining the tire itself,and he agreed that the photographs were insufficient to rule out other causes of failure,such as whether the tread detachment was,or,or a result of,overloading,mounting damage,or wear.he admitted that his usual practice is to inspect the tire surfaces from a distance of inches,not feet,using bright lights and magnifiers.
foundational facts.in making his analysis,baumgardner relied upon conclusions he said were drawn from data compiled from similar tire failures but he did not produce the compiled data,only selected portions from previous tire failures he had analyzed.he did not remember the circumstances of the prior failures or when they occurred or the age of the failed tires,and he did not produce the accident reports for those failures.of the ten failed tires he described,only three were firestone radial atx tires,and baumgardner had no information about whether those tires were manufactured at the same plant as stephen tire or during the same year.none of the tires were pretty well worn out as baumgardner described stephen tire.
although baumgardner opined that all of firestone radial atx tires were defectively designed,he conceded that not all of the tires were in fact he admitted that he had turned away at least cases involving firestone radial atx tire failures after determining that the tires had failed due to causes unrelated to the design defect.he admitted that the vast majority of these tires did not fail less than one percent of the tires subject to the recall had experienced tread belt detachment problems.
after extensive briefing and several hearings about the admissibility of baumgardner testimony,the trial court granted firestone motion to exclude the testimony in its entirety on the grounds,among others,that the other accidents he relied on to form his opinion were insufficiently similar to support his conclusions,that the amateur photographs were unreliable,and that his opinions were too speculative because he had no basis for his conclusion that it was more likely than not that the detachment was caused by a defect rather than some other factor.
the testimony was properly excluded 
to prove her case against firestone,stephen had to present substantial evidence that firestone manufactured the tire,that the tire was defective in its manufacture or design,that the defect existed when the tire left firestone possession,that the defect was the cause of stephen injury,and that stephen injury was caused by a use of the tire that was reasonably foreseeable to firestone.henderson harnischfeger cal d,barrett atlas powder d.the defect must be affirmatively established,and a mere inference of defect is insufficient.the causation element is the same with regard to stephen negligence claim.jackson ryder truck rental,th,d.
as we have explained,stephen tire was not examined by baumgardner or anyone else,and no forensic photographs were taken,which meant baumgardner relied on supposedly similar tire failures and the amateur photographs taken by the insurance adjuster and stephen boyfriend.the problem is that stephen failed to show there was substantial similarity between the tire failures relied on by baumgardner and her tire failure,and she failed to establish that the amateur photographs were sufficient to support baumgardner conclusions.as a result,baumgardner opinions and conclusions were mere speculation.lockheed litigation cases,supra,th at,d the matter relied on by an expert must provide a reasonable basis for his opinion,and opinions based on speculation or conjecture are not admissible pacific gas electric zuckerman d.an expert can not base his opinions on assumptions that are not supported by the record,or upon information that is not reasonably relied upon by other experts leslie perry associates th,d a possible cause of an injury only becomes probable when,in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations,it becomes more likely than not that the injury was a result of its action jennings palomar pomerado health systems,th,d a theoretical possibility of causation can not support an expert conclusion that the act in question was the cause of the injury.
we agree with stephen that evidence of substantially similar accidents would be admissible to prove that stephen tire failure accident occurred in the same manner hasson ford motor cal d,but disagree with her contention that the other tire failures relied on by baumgardner were sufficiently similar to the failure of stephen tire to provide a foundation for baumgardner opinion.the trial court finding of insufficient similarity was one made in an exercise of its discretion,and that decision will not be disturbed where,as here,the record supports the finding and does not show abused discretion.kopfinger grand central pub.market cal d,ault international harvester cal d.
baumgardner testified that he had worked on about firestone tire failure cases but he based his similar accident testimony on only of those cases,and he did not provide the sort of information that would support a finding of substantial similarity.he did not provide police reports from the other accidents or any other information to show that the circumstances of the tire failures were similar to the circumstances of this case.he conceded that only three of the ten cases involved firestone radial atx tires and that,in two of those three cases,the tires had been manufactured in,not or when stephen tire was manufactured.he conceded that none of the tires were nearly as worn as stephen tire.
although stephen submitted further similarity information in briefing on that issue,the additional data did not fill the gap.baumgardner offered a list of tire failures in which he had personally examined firestone radial atx tires,but he once again omitted the details that would show were still no police reports or other details about the age or condition of the tires or the circumstances of the failures.elsworth beech aircraft cal d,brake beech aircraft d.
the amateur photographs were not a substitute for a tire examination and they could not properly provide a basis for baumgardner opinion.as baumgardner conceded,experts generally conduct visual and tactile examinations of failed tires to determine the cause of the failure and,at the same time,to rule out other possible causes.see kumho tire carmichael,d.as baumgardner also conceded,he has never before rendered an expert opinion based on photographs,and he does not know of anyone else who has done so.for her part,stephens has not offered any citation to any type of case in which an amateur photograph has been used to support an expert opinion in any type of case,let alone a case of this nature,and we know of no such authority.to the contrary,the authority we have found supports the trial court ruling,triton energy square d cir summary judgment proper in a product liability case when plaintiff experts had not seen the allegedly defective product brown cir directed verdict for defense proper where plaintiff expert had never examined failed product and thus could not rule out other possible causes of failure.
these problems do not go to the weight of baumgardner testimony.because his opinions and conclusions were nothing more than speculation,his testimony could not constitute substantial evidence in support of a verdict in stephen favor,and it is for this reason that the trial court correctly excluded the testimony in its entirety.lockheed litigation cases,supra,th at,d leslie perry associates,supra,th at,d.
it follows that firestone motion for nonsuit was properly granted.a product liability case must be based on substantial evidence establishing both the defect a
