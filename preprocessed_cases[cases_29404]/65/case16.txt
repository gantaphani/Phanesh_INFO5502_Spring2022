suzanne genereux,her husband barry genereux,and their children brought suit against various manufacturers of beryllium products,alleging that their products caused injury to suzanne genereux when she came into contact with them at her workplace.the complaint asserted negligence,breach of warranty,failure to warn,violation of massachusetts general laws chapter,and other claims.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all of the plaintiffs claims,concluding that the claims were and that the defendants were relieved of liability under chapter by massachusetts sophisticated user defense.plaintiffs appealed.
after a careful review of the record,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the plaintiffs claims were timely and that the sophisticated user defense did not relieve the defendants of liability.we therefore vacate and remand.
on appeal from summary judgment,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.cmi capital mkt,llc,cir.
a.the raytheon company and beryllium 
suzanne genereux genereux worked for raytheon company raytheon,a major defense contractor,from to.she was employed at the company waltham,massachusetts plant,where its microwave and power tube division was then headquartered.genereux spent seven years in the plant backward wave oscillator lab and one year as a quality assurance technician in the backward wave oscillator lab,genereux assembled components,known as subassemblies,for incorporation into radar tubes.she spent most of her time working on two subassemblies the arco window and the tall man.both subassemblies contained beryllium.
beryllium is a metal that is exceptionally light,stiff,and able to disperse heat rapidly.when alloyed with other metals,such as copper,beryllium tends to pass on its properties to the alloy.this is also true of beryllium oxide ceramics,or beryllia,which can withstand extreme temperatures and rapidly disperse heat.these features make beryllium ideal for many specialized applications,including windows,transistors,jet brake pads,ceramic jet engine blades and rocket covers,nuclear reactors,and nuclear weapons.unfortunately,however,beryllium dust and fumes are hazardous to human health.in some individuals,inhaling beryllium dust triggers an immune response,causing inflammation and the formation of granulomas in the lung tissue.this disease is known as chronic beryllium disease,and it gives rise to a number of symptoms,such as coughing,shortness of breath,fatigue,weight loss,fevers,and night sweats.the beryllium industry has long known of the disease and implemented various hygienic controls to prevent it.
brush wellman,brush,american beryllia american beryllia,and hardric laboratories,hardric manufacture beryllium ceramic and beryllium alloy parts and supply these parts for use in some of the applications discussed above.brush is the largest domestic producer of products,including beryllium oxide ceramics,and sometimes supplies beryllium to other beryllium manufacturers for further processing.brush is also one of the oldest producers of beryllium products it has been in existence since incorporated as brush beryllium company,and its facilities hosted one of the earliest major studies of beryllium exposure and beryllium disease,carried out in the late by the united states atomic energy commission.american beryllia was incorporated in after purchasing the assets of general ceramics,which had manufactured beryllium products since the,initially under the name national beryllia corporation.general ceramics,brush,and hardric manufactured beryllium parts that genereux worked with in the waltham backward wave oscillator lab 
raytheon used both beryllium ceramics and beryllium metals in the backward wave oscillator lab.blueprints used by genereux identified several subassembly parts containing beryllium.for example,the arco window contained two beryllium parts a beryllium copper sleeve and a cylindrical beryllium oxide ceramic.the tall man contained a rectangular beryllium oxide ceramic.genereux performed a number of operations on these parts that produced respirable dust.she filed,sanded,smoothed using a dremel rotary tool,and polished beryllium copper and possibly other beryllium metals these processes removed small amounts of material from the metal,some of which were so small that they would become airborne and remain suspended in the air as respirable dust.
genereux also spent considerable time sandblasting various beryllium two hours a day and eight hours a day,towards the end of the month or when a shipping deadline approached she used a pencil grit blaster,which worked by expelling grit from a nozzle controlled by the operator.this process removed small amounts of ceramic material from the beryllia.although sandblasting took place under a hood the ceramic material and some of the grit would become airborne,producing white dust that settled on genereux clothes and shoes.in addition to these activities,genereux was also designated to handle,store,and track all the beryllium parts used in the backward wave oscillator lab 
raytheon took steps to control employees exposure to beryllium dust,and brush,along with other beryllium producers,provided raytheon with information about appropriate hygienic controls and exposure rates.we discuss aspects of raytheon industrial hygiene program and brush input to it below.
diagnosis of chronic beryllium disease 
genereux became ill many times during her employment at raytheon.sometime in or,she developed a cough and shortness of breath.the symptoms were attributed to asthma,and physicians prescribed a treatment regimen of steroids and inhalers.sometime later,genereux was hospitalized for five days and diagnosed with recurrent asthma.physicians again prescribed inhalers,and supplemented them with prednisone.genereux returned to work,but after a period of three to four months she developed an upper respiratory infection.exacerbation of asthma symptoms required genereux to be hospitalized several times during the year.throughout this period and afterwards,genereux regularly sought emergency care.according to the report of a pulmonologist treating her,she has gone to the emergency room approximately three times a year for respiratory complaints.
in november,genereux took a medical leave of absence from raytheon due to a pregnancy.after her pregnancy,genereux developed carpal tunnel syndrome and required surgery on both of her hands.unable to work,she went on extended sick leave from raytheon and ultimately did not return.genereux began to receive disability benefits through raytheon during this time.however,in the insurance company discontinued benefits on the grounds that genereux was no longer disabled.genereux repeatedly sought reinstatement of the benefits,arguing that she remained completely disabled and was entitled to benefits until age.
meanwhile,genereux was formally diagnosed in with vascular parkinson disease in her right side,where she suffered from tremors,pain,and muscle weakness.in late or early,finding that she was unable to pay her expenses,genereux wrote united states senator jack reed,seeking his assistance in obtaining reinstatement of the disability benefits and securing a pension.in her letter,genereux stated that she suffered from parkinson disease and was totally disabled.genereux then wrote 
i am told that the causes of parkinson disease are still being researched,i am told that environment may be a cause,but it may not be found out in my lifetime.while working for raytheon,i worked in rooms with asbestos ceilings which left dust on the benches and other items i was forced to sandblast beryllium ceramics with no masks,open sandblasting units,no protective clothing.i also used alot sic of acetone and other degreasing agents and worked in a small room off of a large plating room.
she did not mention asthma,lung disease,or pulmonary symptoms of any kind.
after receiving a written response to her letter in late or early,genereux called senator reed office.during the ensuing conversation,a staff member asked genereux whether she had ever been tested for cbd chronic beryllium disease.according to genereux,this was the first time she had ever heard of chronic beryllium disease.senator reed office advised genereux to call the department of labor officials at the department of labor told genereux about national jewish medical center national jewish,a colorado facility experienced in the treatment of chronic beryllium disease,and instructed her to call.genereux contacted national jewish sometime in early.
national jewish recommended to genereux that she take a blood test,known as the belpt test,to determine whether she was sensitized to beryllium.national jewish also provided her with a booklet explaining the causes,symptoms and treatment of chronic beryllium disease.as the booklet explained,
beryllium sensitization often leads to disease,even in people who are no longer working with beryllium.most people with beryllium sensitization have granuloma scars in their lungs,and sometimes in other organs also once a person has been exposed to beryllium,there is a lifelong risk of developing the disease.
the booklet quantified this risk,stating that o nly of exposed people will develop beryllium disease,but noted that certain work tasks have been associated with disease rates as high as.those who were sensitized,it said,but did not develop the disease,do not need treatment but need to be checked by a doctor regularly for signs of disease.
on june,genereux met with her primary care physician,david ashley.notes from the meeting indicate that genereux again raised concerns about p otential exposure to acetone,berrilium sic,asbestos.genereux provided ashley with the national jewish booklet on chronic beryllium disease,an illness previously unfamiliar to him.according to ashley,genereux then connected beryllium exposure to her lung disease 
and did she suggest that there was some kind of problems that she was encountering that she thought was related to potential beryllium exposure 
a.her breathing problems.i mean,she had childhood asthma that basically reoccurred as an adult,and she was labeled as an asthmatic,and she was wondering whether this,you know,could be something other than asthma 
on june,genereux again met with ashley.notes from the meeting indicate that ashley and genereux discussed her exposure to beryllium during her employment at raytheon,as well as the belpt test.ashley office ordered a belpt test kit from national jewish.on june,genereux had blood drawn at the laboratory in ashley office for use in a number of tests,including the belpt test.ashley office sent the completed belpt test kit to national jewish in colorado,where it was analyzed on june.test results were classified as abnormal.genereux had a second belpt test analyzed on february,whose results were also abnormal.in late august,genereux traveled to colorado for further testing,where she was diagnosed with chronic beryllium disease 
on june,genereux,her husband barry genereux,and their two children filed suit in massachusetts superior court against brush,several other beryllium manufacturers,and raytheon.on september,plaintiffs amended their complaint,naming american beryllia and hardric as additional defendants.in the amended complaint,genereux asserted seven causes of action against the defendants negligence breach of warranty failure to warn strict liability for ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities breach of massachusetts consumer protection statute,massachusetts general laws chapter fraudulent concealment and conspiracy.barry genereux and the genereux children asserted six additional counts,based on liability for medical monitoring,loss of consortium,and breach of chapter.
on october,brush and another defendant removed the case to federal district court,asserting jurisdiction under the federal officer removal statute,a subsequently,the district court dismissed the sole count against raytheon,a claim of liability for medical monitoring.it also dismissed counts based on theories of strict liability and conspiracy,and all defendants other than brush,american beryllia,and hardric.nine counts remained negligence breach of warranty failure to warn breach of chapter towards genereux fraudulent concealment loss of consortium based on negligence loss of consortium based on breach of warranty loss of consortium based on failure to warn and breach of chapter towards barry genereux and the genereux children.
after the parties conducted discovery,the three remaining defendants moved for summary judgment.defendants made four arguments in common a that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations b that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the sophisticated user doctrine and the bulk supplier doctrine c that genereux did not work with their products and d that the defendants were not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.american beryllia also argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because under massachusetts law,it was not subject to successor liability as a purchaser of assets.
taking the facts in the light most favorable to genereux,the district court concluded that genereux had performed activities on products that contained beryllium,such as sandblasting,welding,filing,and brazing,which had generat ed airborne beryllium dust that genereux inhaled.it also concluded that the defendants had each supplied raytheon with products containing beryllium,including windows,pins,collectors,rectangular plates,discs,rods,tubes,and beryllium metal emitter rings.the court assumed,without deciding,that american beryllia was subject to successor liability for injuries caused by products produced by general ceramics,noting,t he factual record on the issue of successor liability is not sufficiently for resolution sic.
the district court then granted the motion for summary judgment on all nine remaining counts.the court held that the plaintiffs claims remaining counts and were.it noted that the claims were subject to a statute of limitations,but that under massachusetts discovery rule,the limitations period only began to run when genereux knew or had sufficient notice that she had been harmed,and knew or had sufficient notice of the cause of the harm.after describing genereux appointments with ashley in june,the court concluded that by june,at the latest,genereux was aware that she might have chronic beryllium disease and that she was exposed to beryllium while at raytheon.thus,b y june,she was sufficiently aware of the possibility that she contracted the disease through exposure to beryllium at raytheon to start the statute of limitations.based on that start date,the court held that limitations period ended on june,three days before genereux filed suit.
the court held that the plaintiffs statutory claims under chapter remaining counts and,which were subject to a statute of limitations,were timely filed but barred by the sophisticated user doctrine.plaintiffs theory of liability under chapter turned on the defendants failure to warn of the dangers of their products the court noted that the sophisticated user doctrine relieves a manufacturer of liability for failing to warn when the end user knows or reasonably should know of a product dangers.after determining that raytheon was the end user,the court concluded that raytheon had substantial knowledge of the dangers of beryllium exposure,manifest in three ways knowledge held by employees raytheon own policies and internal memoranda and warnings provided to raytheon by its suppliers.in addition,raytheon was a sophisticated company,which ranked in fortune magazine top list of american companies,and had a keen appreciation of the dangers of beryllium,for which it ordained prophylactic procedures decades before genereux employment.
plaintiffs timely appealed and now ask us to reverse.they contend that the district court erred in determining that the statute of limitations expired before they filed suit and that the sophisticated user doctrine relieves the defendants from liability.defendants argue that the district court properly resolved the issues it addressed,and raise as alternative grounds for upholding summary judgment the bulk supplier doctrine,plaintiffs failure to show that genereux was exposed to any products manufactured by the defendants,and the fact that defendants were not the proximate cause of genereux injuries.american beryllia also argues that it is not subject to successor liability for injuries caused by exposure to general ceramics products.

statute of limitations 
under massachusetts law,actions of tort and actions of contract to recover for personal injuries are subject to a statute of limitations.laws ch.the counts in the amended complaint of negligence,breach of warranty,failure to warn,and fraudulent concealment fall into these categories and are all governed by this statute.fidler eastman kodak,cir failure to warn olsen bell,negligence and breach of warranty noble cournoyer,no.ca,wl,at,fraudulent concealment.claims for loss of consortium are also subject to the limitations period under section.olsen,at.in contrast,claims under chapter are subject to a statute of limitations.laws ch.

the limitations period specified in section commences after the cause of action accrues.laws ch.normally,a cause of action for personal injury will accrue at the time of injury.koe mercer,riley presnell.however,under the discovery rule,a cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiffs know or reasonably should have known that they were injured as a result of the defendant conduct.cornell du pont de nemours,cir citing olsen,at.actual knowledge is not the standard,but what a reasonable person in the plaintiff position would have known or on inquiry would have discovered.bowen eli lilly.the supreme judicial court has analyzed this rule as having two components a plaintiff must have knowledge or sufficient notice that she was harmed and knowledge or sufficient notice of what the cause of harm was.bowen,at see also fidler,at such notice to start the statute of limitations includes not only knowledge that one has been injured but knowledge of its plaintiff has been harmed as a result of the defendant conduct.quoting olsen,at riley,at.

appellants argue that the district court erred in determining that the limitations period began to run on june,because genereux did not know by this date that she had chronic beryllium disease,and thus lacked notice that she was injured.appellees counter that under massachusetts law,a disease diagnosis is not necessary to trigger the statute of limitations.however,this case does not require us to decide whether a disease diagnosis is ever necessary for a plaintiff to have notice that she has been injured.genereux has long ited symptoms associated with chronic beryllium disease.her knowledge that she had sustained substantial physical harm is not at issue.see bowen,at.rather,the question is when genereux had sufficient notice that her lung disease was caused by the appellees conduct.
in bowen,the supreme judicial court considered for the first time the case of a plaintiff who was well aware that she had sustained substantial physical harm,but may have lacked sufficient notice as to the cause of her physical harm.bowen,at.the plaintiff in bowen developed a malignant tumor and required extensive surgery to remove it.many years earlier,her mother had taken the drug diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy.id.at.the question before the court was when the plaintiff had sufficient notice that her tumor was caused by diethylstilbestrol to trigger the statute of limitations.id.at.citing the plaintiff possession of materials suggesting the prospect of a significant causal connection between diethylstilbestrol and her exceedingly rare condition,the court concluded that the plaintiff acquired sufficient notice of the cause of her injury outside the limitations period.id.at.
construing massachusetts law,this court has previously characterized the level of notice of cause sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations as notice of likely cause.fidler,at see also cornell,at t he level of notice required to start the statute running has been defined as likely cause.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.massachusetts courts,including the supreme judicial court,have repeatedly cited this language in their own decisions.see bowen,at see also demoulas demoulas super,krasnow allen,schwartz,murphy novartis consumer health,wl,at,locke jones,wl,at.
appellants argue,as they did below,that genereux asthma diagnosis is relevant to determining when she had sufficient notice that her lung disease was related to beryllium exposure the district court did not mention asthma in its analysis of the limitations issue.nor have appellees addressed the matter,outside a footnote,in their briefing to this court we agree with the appellants that genereux asthma diagnosis is significant.at the time genereux first learned of chronic beryllium disease,she had long suffered from asthma symptoms.in fact,genereux was diagnosed with asthma as a child,years before she was exposed to beryllium.this diagnosis was confirmed on repeated occasions when genereux was an adult.she was treated for asthma during her employment at raytheon and afterwards,at times by a specialist.in light of these facts,we can not say,as we must to affirm,that no reasonable jury could conclude that genereux lacked notice,even after june,that her symptoms were likely caused not by asthma,but by another disease.a reasonable jury could conclude that genereux claims were timely.thus there exists a genuine issue of material fact about the timeliness of those claims 
close attention to the record supports the view that a material issue exists in this case about when genereux had notice that the likely cause of her breathing problems was exposure to beryllium.sometime before june,national jewish provided genereux with the booklet on chronic beryllium disease.according to the booklet,only of people exposed to beryllium contract chronic beryllium disease,and certain work tasks are associated with disease rates as high as.even if genereux believed she had a chance of having chronic beryllium disease,she had been told since she was a child that she had asthma,and might have reasonably concluded that while there was a chance her symptoms were caused by exposure to beryllium,it was not the likely cause of her injury.this conclusion is fully consistent with ashley testimony that during genereux june appointment,she was wondering whether her condition,you know,could be something other than asthma.
genereux decision,on june,to take the belpt test does not compel the conclusion,as the summary judgment standard requires,that she then had notice beryllium was the likely cause of her injury.on the contrary,a reasonable juror could view the belpt test as merely an initial step in exploring the possibility of chronic beryllium disease.it was described this way in the national jewish booklet.thus,while we agree with the district court that a ctual knowledge of cause is not the triggering event for the statute of limitations,we disagree that genereux decision to take the belpt test to explore the mere possibility that her symptoms were not caused by asthma,but by beryllium,shows as a matter of law that she was sufficiently aware of the possibility that she contracted the disease through exposure to beryllium at raytheon to start the statute of limitations.
however,on june,genereux belpt test was analyzed at national jewish and the results were classified as abnormal.the record does not indicate when national jewish apprised genereux of the results of her test.whatever that date,it was arguably at this point that genereux had notice not simply that beryllium might have caused her lung disease,but that it was the likely cause.if the limitations period did begin to run on june,then genereux claims,filed on june,were timely filed.
we need not decide whether the statute of limitations on genereux claims actually began to run on june.instead,we hold that,on this record,a reasonable juror could conclude that genereux first had sufficient notice of the cause of her injury after june.in light of genereux asthma diagnosis and the low probability of developing chronic beryllium disease,deciding when genereux had notice that her symptoms were likely caused by beryllium involves a decisional process fraught with resolution of factual issues,castillo,at,such as how confident a reasonable person would have been during june of genereux previous asthma diagnosis,see bowen,at.resolution of such factual issues is peculiarly within the province of the trier of fact.castillo,at.the district court should not have resolved the statute of limitations issue against genereux on this summary judgment record.
applying the likely cause standard,we came to the same conclusion in cambridge plating napco,cir,where,on facts similar to this case,we reversed the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant.the plaintiff,cambridge plating,purchased a wastewater treatment system from the defendant,napco.cambridge plating became aware early on that the system did not sufficiently clean its wastewater to meet regulatory requirements.however,during the initial debugging of the system and afterwards,analysis of the problem focused on operation and not possible defects.the question before the court was when cambridge plating had sufficient notice that the system problems were caused by manufacturing defects to trigger the statute of limitations.we reasoned 
when the problems persisted despite napco announcement that debugging was complete,two explanations theoretically were available.either the system itself was defective,or it was being operated improperly.at this point,however,the two possibilities were not equally weighted.cambridge plating knew that the system was technically complex and required sensitive operation.and napco only response to cambridge plating inquiries was to suggest ways to improve operation.
in these circumstances,we do not believe massachusetts law requires a finding that cambridge plating was on notice of the system defects.a plaintiff is sufficiently aware of her cause of action,and thus should have discovered it,once she has received notice of likely cause,fidler,at quoted in bowen,at.
id.at.as we then explained,the likely cause standard does not require knowledge that the defendant is the culprit,but a basis for identifying it as a suspect.where cambridge plating could not choose between the two possible explanations for the system failure,it lacked such a basis and a material issue existed for the jury to resolve.
loss of consortium 
like claims of negligence,breach of warranty,failure to warn,and fraudulent concealment,actions for loss of consortium are subject to the statute of limitations under.laws chapter,section.olsen,at.under massachusetts law,loss of consortium is independent from the underlying claim of negligence brought by the injured spouse.id.at.for this reason,the date of accrual of a loss of consortium claim and the underlying claim must be determined separately.id.at see also lareau page,cir angelini omd.while loss of consortium and the underlying claim will usually accrue at the same time,this may not always be true.olsen,at.a consortium action may be timely even though the spouse underlying negligence action is.see fidler parker,discussing this possibility.
in its memorandum order granting summary judgment,the district court did not determine separately the date of accrual of the loss of consortium claims and the underlying claims brought by genereux.rather,it denied all the common law claims on the basis of one date of accrual.this was error.we make no determination here about the date of accrual of the loss of consortium claims brought by barry genereux and the genereux children,and leave this matter to be determined in the district court.
sophisticated user doctrine 
legal principles 
under massachusetts law,a manufacturer of a product has a duty to warn foreseeable users of dangers in the use of that product of which the manufacturer knows or reasonably should know.bavuso caterpillar.however,under the sophisticated user doctrine,a manufacturer has no duty to warn of a product latent characteristics or dangers when the end user knows or reasonably should know of those dangers.see carrel cord braid,hoffman houghton chem,restatement second of torts,cited in carrel,at.t he relevant inquiry turns on the end user level of sophistication.hoffman,at.
the sophisticated user doctrine is sometimes explained as a corollary of the open and obvious doctrine.see,carrel,at citing koken black veatch,cir applying maine law.under the open and obvious doctrine,a manufacturer has no duty to warn when the danger presented by a product is obvious.bavuso,at.a warning under those circumstances would not reduce the likelihood of injury.id.similarly,the sophisticated user defense applies where a warning is unlikely to have a deterrent effect.see hoffman,at.the end user already perceives the danger because of his sophistication.restatement second torts cmt.k t he condition is one which only persons of special experience would realize to be dangerous.
significantly,massachusetts recognizes a sophisticated user defense when the end user knows or reasonably should know of the particular danger posed by the product.for example,in carrel a camper was injured when he pulled on the end of a bungee cord,causing a knot in the cord to unwind and the cord to suddenly retract,striking him in the eye.carrel,at.at trial on the camper claim for failure to warn,the jury was instructed on the sophisticated user defense,and the defendant prevailed.the supreme judicial court upheld the instruction on appeal.it noted that it was the practice of the cord distributor not the manufacturer to include in its shipments a document warning against using the bungee cord in a course in the precise manner that the camp had used it.the court also pointed out that a consultant had visited the camp,learned of the bungee cord use,and disapproved,specifically instructing a camp employee to use a different kind of knot than the one which later unwound,causing the injury.id.at.these warnings proved that the end user knew of the particular danger to be guarded against,in which case an additional warning from the manufacturer would have been superfluous.id.at.
conversely,where there is a lack of proof that the end user knew of the particular danger,courts have upheld a jury verdict of liability against a manufacturer for failure to warn against a sophisticated user defense similarly,in koken,at,we held that,under maine law,a welder was not a sophisticated user of fire blankets despite his awareness that welding created a fire hazard,since a reasonable could have found that he was unaware of the limitations of the particular fire blanket he was using we agreed with the district court that the fire hazard posed by welding was obvious to both laymen and experienced welders.id.at.we disagreed,however,that an awareness of the general hazard sufficed to make the welder a sophisticated user of the defendants fire blankets 
i n holding that the duty to warn was precluded by the known hazard of fire in torch cutting,we think that the district court gave too broad a scope to the open and obvious and sophisticated user doctrines.the fact that the risk of accident is well known does not preclude a duty to warn of particular risks,different from the general risk,if those risks are not open and obvious or known by a reasonable sophisticated user.for example,the risk of vehicle accidents on the highway is well known,and drivers of commercial trucks are sophisticated users of their equipment.there is no duty to warn of the general risk of an accident but there may be a duty to warn that loading a particular kind of truck in a particular way could increase the risk of rollover if that risk is not generally appreciated.in each case the analysis must focus on the particular risk and whether that risk is open or obvious or known to the sophisticated user.
id.at.we then observed that the necessity of a particularized analysis makes it important to defin e the claimed risk and the warning so that the issues of duty to warn and causation can be addressed intelligently.id.at.
although these general principles are relevant here,we must emphasize a distinctive feature of this case.for the purpose of analyzing the sophisticated user defense,the plaintiff genereux is not the end user whose sophistication is at issue.the district court concluded that raytheon was the end user of appellees products.appellants did not challenge this determination.although genereux relies on the duty to warn in her claims against the appellees,it follows that brush,american beryllia,and hardric had no duty to warn genereux of the dangers associated with using their beryllium products if they prevail on their sophisticated user is,if they establish that raytheon knew or reasonably should have known of those dangers.see kenneth willner,note,failures to warn and the sophisticated user defense,under the duty approach to the sophisticated user defense,a seller has no duty to warn an ultimate user when intermediate purchasers are knowledgeable.
normally,the existence of a duty of care is a question of law decided by a judge,not a jury.cottam cvs pharmacy,page keeton et,prosser keeton on the law of torts ed.w hether,upon the facts in evidence,such a relation exists between the parties that the community will impose a legal obligation upon one for the benefit of the other is entirely a question of law,and it must be determined only by the court.however,in the case of the sophisticated user doctrine,as applied in massachusetts,the existence of a duty to a plaintiff such as genereux depends on the sophistication of the intermediary employer,which is a factual matter that may be resolved by the jury.see hoffman,at t he sophisticated user doctrine allows a fact finder to determine that no such duty was owed.
in this case,the focus of the sophisticated user defense is the knowledge of the intermediary in the situation involving genereux as an employee,raytheon as an employer,and appellees as manufacturers of products for use in raytheon manufacturing operations.generally,an intermediary knowledge may come from many sources.sometimes the analysis will focus on what the intermediary already knows,and sometimes it will depend on what the manufacturer tells the intermediary.here,appellees have placed the focus on themselves by introducing into the record,and relying on,evidence of warnings they provided raytheon.nevertheless,we are not making a determination of whether the appellees exercised due care in warning raytheon about their beryllium products the question is what raytheon knew,or reasonably should have known,as a result of the warnings.see willner,supra,at t he defense focuses on the actual knowledge of a purchaser or user,rather than the reasonableness of the sellers conduct in warning or in failing to warn.
the particular dangers and raytheon knowledge of those dangers 
appellees argue that the particular danger to be guarded against was chronic beryllium disease.the record is clear that raytheon knew that exposure to beryllium dust or fumes could cause chronic beryllium disease.however,on the facts of this case,that proposition is stated too broadly.following carrel and koken,we must analyze the particular danger s to be guarded against in use of the appellees beryllium products.carrel,at.
appellants argue that raytheon was unaware of five particular dangers 
raytheon believed that beryllium operations should be to ensure compliance with the occupational health and safety administration permissible exposure limit pel only when they produced visible amounts of dust,while in fact all beryllium operations should be periodically,and a workspace may be dangerous to human health even though no dust is visible 
raytheon believed that local exhaust ventilation was required only for operations that produced visible dust,while in fact other beryllium operations should also be carried out under local exhaust ventilation 
raytheon was unaware that beryllium dust can contaminate work clothing,which,if worn home,can cause injury to family members 
raytheon was unaware that polishing beryllium metals without protective measures is unsafe and 
raytheon was unaware that occupational exposures to an airborne concentration of m of beryllium dust is unsafe 
we agree with the district court that raytheon awareness of the dangers posed by the beryllium products it used can be gleaned from the knowledge of its employees,its policies as evidenced by internal memoranda,and warnings provided by suppliers.we also agree with the district court that these categories of evidence establish that raytheon was aware that beryllium was toxic raytheon was aware that exposure to beryllium could cause chronic beryllium disease raytheon knew that exposure to beryllium dust,in particular,was hazardous and because of its concern about beryllium dust,raytheon created safety policies for opening packages containing beryllium and for sandblasting beryllium oxide ceramics even if these latter policies were not followed.however,we disagree with the district court that this evidence establishes,as a matter of law,that raytheon was a sophisticated user with respect to all of the particular dangers identified by the appellants.
instead,the record leads us to conclude that raytheon knew,or should have known,of the following particular dangers the need to all beryllium operations,the need to provide local exhaust ventilation for operations besides those that produced visible dust,and the risk to family members posed by work clothing contaminated with beryllium dust.in each case,undisputed record evidence proves that raytheon knew or should have known of the particular danger,often because it was informed of the danger by the appellees,principally brush the sophisticated user defense is dispositive for these particular dangers.however,we also conclude that there are genuine issues of fact about whether raytheon knew or should have known of the last two particular dangers identified above a polishing beryllium metals without protective measures,and b exposing workers to airborne concentrations of m of beryllium dust.
polishing beryllium metals 
appellants assert that genereux polished beryllium metals while working in the waltham plant backward wave oscillator lab.they further assert that appellees failed to warn raytheon of the need for hygienic controls during polishing,and that this caused genereux injury.
there are two genuine issues of material fact about appellants claim that make the summary judgment disposition inappropriate.the first issue relates to genereux exposure to beryllium dust generated by polishing.appellee brush asserts that genereux simply made up the fact that she polished beryllium.however,al broadbent,genereux direct supervisor at raytheon,stated in his deposition that his team would polish finished subassemblies.whether genereux herself was involved in this stage of the process is ambiguous.appellants expert witness,john martyny,described genereux use of a dremel tool and sandpaper on beryllium metal parts as polish ing.for purposes of summary judgment,on this record,a reasonable could conclude that genereux polished beryllium metals and was therefore exposed to beryllium dust generated by polishing.
second,there is a genuine issue of material fact about when raytheon knew or should have known that uncontrolled polishing posed a danger to the health of exposed workers.only a handful of documents in the record expressly discuss polishing.first,on april,brush provided raytheon with a report entitled potential beryllium exposure while processing beryllia ceramics for electronic applications,dated september.the report states that wet polishing could possibly result in exposures above m.second,brush included a material safety data sheet msds in every shipment of beryllium to raytheon.the version of the msds stated,a irborne exposure to beryllium in excess of the occupational standards can occur when sintering,machining,grinding,sanding,polishing,laser scribing and trimming,chemical etching,crushing,or otherwise abrading the surface of this material in a manner which generates finely divided particles.emphasis added.
brush provided both of these warnings near the end of genereux employment.it is possible that before april,when brush sent raytheon the potential beryllium exposure report,raytheon was unaware of the danger posed by polishing,and that during this time genereux was exposed to beryllium dust generated by polishing 
although the record does not show that raytheon knew of the dangers posed by polishing before april,it is possible that it should have known.descriptions of polishing in the record suggest that polishing may denote a wider array of operations than the ordinary use of the term suggests.for example,appellant expert characterizes operations with sandpaper and a dremel tool as polishing.if polishing includes sanding and the use of a dremel tool,then arguably there were earlier warnings about polishing that raytheon should have understood.in a letter sent august,brush warned raytheon that a potential health risk can occur when grinding,machining,sanding,drilling,brazing,welding,or otherwise abrading or treating the surface in such a manner as to generate finely divided airborne particulate.emphasis added.
however,the record is far from clear about what activities constitute polishing.on the record developed thus far,a reasonable jury could reject the conclusion that warnings about sanding or abrasion were sufficient to warn about polishing as well.brush practice was to warn users about specific operations that posed a danger grinding,machining,sanding,drilling,brazing,welding.although brush also warned users against otherwise abrading the surface in a manner which generates finely divided particles,it later decided to include polishing in the list of specific operations.we conclude that there is a genuine issue of fact about whether raytheon knew or should have known of the dangers posed by uncontrolled polishing,at least before april.
occupational exposure to m 
appellants assert that raytheon was unaware that exposures of m or less could cause its employees to develop chronic beryllium disease.they assert that appellees knew that there might be a danger posed by such exposures to their products,but that they failed to warn raytheon.in response,appellees point to evidence that raytheon already knew of the danger posed by exposures at m.
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether raytheon was aware that exposures of m or less could cause its employees to develop chronic beryllium disease.the record contains evidence that raytheon was aware that exposures at the m level were dangerous.crucially,however,the record also contains evidence that raytheon distinguished between occupational exposures and or,or neighborhood exposures,and believed that only exposures at the m level posed a danger of chronic beryllium disease.exposures may occur among individuals who live in the vicinity of a plant where beryllium is processed.according to beryllium project,a raytheon memorandum,exposures could cause disease at lower exposure levels because the beryllium particles involved were smaller,and thus possessed greater reactivity.the same document stated that occupational exposures of m,in contrast,were considered safe.not only did raytheon own documents expressly distinguish and occupational beryllium exposures,the record contains multiple letters from brush stating that no occupational cases of chronic beryllium disease had been reported where plants observed the m standard.in light of this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that during the time of genereux employment,raytheon did not believe that workplace exposures of m or less posed a threat to its employees,such as genereux 
we excerpt the relevant evidence below.for purposes of clarity,we have divided the evidence into two categories i internal raytheon documents,and ii information provided by brush to raytheon concerning hazards posed by beryllium 
internal raytheon documents 
of particular relevance among raytheon internal documents are those from a file maintained by walter hartford,mccarthy predecessor and a raytheon safety manager from.the most important of these documents,beryllium project,a raytheon memo dated november,expressly states that μg m exposures are safe in view of the many unknowns in beryllium pathology,the only possible preventative has been to reduce the atmospheric concentrations to within safe limits,namely,t he atmospheric concentration of beryllium should not exceed m averaged over an hour day.emphasis added.the document goes on to distinguish between safe exposure levels for and areas.the basis for the distinction is the greater reactivity of beryllium dust particles in the setting.
the m allowed for an average daily exposure is considered to be well within the concentrations necessary for causing the chronic disease.it should be noted that the concentration of m is considered safe whereas cases have been reported in the neighborhood of beryllium processing plants where monitoring indicated only μg m.one reason proposed for the higher incidence of chronic beryllium poisoning with these relatively low concentrations of beryllium is the smaller particle size and thus greater reactivity of beryllium in the area.
emphasis added.
another document in raytheon files,toxicity of beryllium,a report authored by the air force,reinforces this distinction by stating that chronic beryllium disease has not been reported at plants observing the standard to date no case of either acute or chronic beryllium disease has been reported in connection with plant operations at which these standards exposures at m have not been exceeded.
ii.materials provided by brush 
brush provided raytheon with a considerable number of documents about the safety of beryllium products.these materials almost uniformly corroborate the impression that occupational exposures at the μg m level are safe.for example 
brush published msdss in,and,and provided them to raytheon throughout genereux employment.all of the msdss identify the beryllium pel or tlv as m.msdss provided by american beryllia also identify the m value.
on may,brush mailed raytheon a letter,to which it attached a paper entitled beryllium and its compounds,authored by the american industrial hygiene association,and dated.the paper identifies a recommended maximal atmospheric concentration of m.
letters mailed to raytheon on june,october,august,and march,state,d aily weighted average exposure over an day may not exceed micrograms beryllium per cubic meter of air.
in addition,brush mailed its customers material that impugned prior evidence that exposures at the m level were dangerous and stated that occupational exposures at that level had never produced chronic beryllium disease.on april,brush mailed raytheon a letter,to which it attached several documents discussing beryllium exposure levels.included among those documents was its own paper,safe handling of beryllia ceramics,dated november.
the paper introduction explained,u ntil a few years ago almost all beryllium oxide production and fabrication was performed in a limited number of facilities because of the integrated nature of early beryllium operations,much of the literature concerning the health and safety aspects of beryllium is quite general in nature and not applicable to simple beryllium operations.accordingly,a good deal of confusion still exists concerning the relative hazards of handling beryllia.the purpose of this document is to answer the questions most often posed by those engaged in the handling of beryllia and thereby to summarize the health considerations involved in this aspect of beryllium activity.emphasis added.
the safe handling paper included a number of questions and answers,such as,q.what are the health hazards associated with the handling of beryllia a.the only potential problem of any significance associated with the handling of beryllia is the inhalation of excessive amounts of respirable beryllium.q.what is an excessive amount a the majority of people,perhaps as much as,apparently do not seem to react adversely to beryllium exposures at any level.a small percentage of people do develop an immunological response opinion varies as to what level of exposure is apt to produce a reaction in a hypersensitive person but we do know that there has never been an illness recorded where exposures were kept at,or below,the threshold limit values originally recommended by the atomic energy commission in and subsequently established by the occupational safety and health administration emphasis added.
the safe handling paper also explained,q.if these recommended standards have been so effective in controlling beryllium illness,what about the hundreds of cases one hears about hygienic controls were established in the late.prior to that time people were exposed to massive doses of beryllium under completely uncontrolled conditions.in many cases people exposed in the early did not develop symptoms of illness until years afterward.thus,we still hear occasionally of a new beryllium illness due to those old exposures.does this mean that there have been no cases of beryllium disease as a result of exposures in recent years no.new cases of beryllium disease,although relatively infrequent,still occur as a result of accidental or negligent exposures in excess of the permissible concentration levels.emphasis added.
the point that occupational exposures at the μg m level pose no danger to employees was repeated in subsequent materials from brush.
also attached to brush april,letter were two versions of a paper entitled,potential beryllium exposure while processing beryllia ceramics for electronic applications.the first version of the paper was authored by martin powers,a brush employee,and published in.it states there has not been a nonoccupational case of beryllium disease as a result of exposure since the and the acute disease,which is only found in beryllium producer plants,has not been seen in the past decade.emphasis in original.
the second version of potential beryllium exposure,authored by marc kolanz and richard davis,and published in september,states no one is able to define the dividing line between safe and unsafe concentration of beryllium with any precision.therefore,the levels μg m,which are now osha standards,incorporate a margin of safety.although the exact margin of safety is not known,we do know that there has never been an occupational case of chronic beryllium disease when the exposure was at or even near the m level emphasis in original.
in a july,letter sent by brush to its beryllia customers,brush physician thomas markham states,t he fact that no beryllium disease cases have been reported where the standard has been met provides immutable testimony to its effectiveness.
taken together,we think that this evidence establishes a genuine issue of material fact about whether raytheon knew,or reasonably should have known,that exposures to beryllium at the m level could cause employees like genereux to develop chronic beryllium disease.to be sure,the record contains some evidence suggesting that raytheon was aware that exposures at could be dangerous however,the beryllium project memo clearly distinguishes between occupational exposures and exposures,expressly stating that the m standard is considered safe in the occupational setting.according to the raytheon memo beryllium project,raytheon believed that exposures at or below the m level were dangerous due to the greater reactivity of the beryllium particles involved.that occupational exposures at that level were safe would have been corroborated by multiple documents,including the safe handling paper,the potential beryllium exposure papers,and the markham letter,all of which asserted that no chronic beryllium disease had ever been discovered in an occupational setting where the m standard was observed.on this basis,a reasonable could conclude that raytheon reasonably believed workplace exposures of m or less posed no danger to its employees.
moreover,we can not ignore the evidence of brush effort to persuade its customers that occupational exposures to beryllium at the m level do not cause chronic beryllium disease.in light of this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that even if raytheon did suspect,at one time,that exposures at the m level were dangerous to their workers,brush convinced it that this suspicion was unreasonable while raytheon is a sophisticated company,the record reveals that brush is much more sophisticated in its understanding of beryllium,the dangers posed by beryllium,and how best to implement hygienic controls.brush is the leading producer of beryllium,has been involved in beryllium research for sixty years,was recognized as an expert on beryllium by raytheon employees,and held itself out to raytheon as a beryllium it was.
conclusion 
this record does not entitle appellees to summary judgment on the sophisticated user defense.there are genuine issues of material fact about whether raytheon knew,or reasonably should have known,of the particular dangers posed by polishing beryllium metals and by exposing its workers to concentrations of beryllium at the m level.therefore,we can not conclude,for purposes of summary judgment,that genereux employer was sufficiently knowledgeable of the dangers she faced to relieve the appellees of their duty to warn genereux of those dangers.see willner,supra,at discussing this version of the sophisticated user defense.
of course,the record leaves little question that raytheon was,generally speaking,as the district court noted,a sophisticated company,and that it knew a considerable amount about beryllium.still,it would be speculative to infer,on these grounds alone,that raytheon knew or should have known of the polishing and dangers.there is simply no basis in the record from which a reasonable could draw such an inference.johnson am.standard,cal th,d,record contained evidence about what plaintiff profession could reasonably be expected to know humble sand gravel gomez,record contained testimony about what one would expect a person in the plaintiff profession to know.the district court was wrong to conclude otherwise.
appellees alternative grounds for affirmance 
bulk supplier doctrine 
as the massachusetts supreme judicial court has made clear,the bulk supplier doctrine is a separate,conceptually discrete defense from the sophisticated user doctrine.hoffman,at citing donahue phillips petroleum,cir.under the bulk supplier doctrine,a supplier of bulk products discharge s its duty to warn end users of a product hazards by reasonable reliance on an intermediary to transmit an appropriate warning.id.the supreme judicial court has stated that f or the bulk supplier doctrine to apply,a product must be delivered in bulk to an intermediary vendee.id.this requirement reflects two rationales for the doctrine that products delivered in bulk are often reformulated and repackaged by an intermediary,making it unlikely that the supplier could provide a warning that would reach end users and that bulk supplies are often put to multitudinous commercial uses,making it unduly burdensome to require the supplier to warn all foreseeable end users.id.at.
if the bulk supplier doctrine applies,a supplier discharges its duty to warn only if it has reasonably relied on the intermediary to transmit its warnings.id.at.the reasonableness inquiry is fact intensive,id.at,and factors that may determine whether reliance was reasonable are 
the dangerous condition of the product the purpose for which the product is used the form of any warnings given the reliability of the third party as a conduit of necessary information about the product the magnitude of the risk involved and the burden imposed on the supplier by requiring that he directly warn all users.
see also tilton union oil of.
the district court held that whether the bulk supplier doctrine applied to the appellees raises at least one question of material fact.we agree.for the bulk supplier doctrine to apply,a supplier must supply its products in bulk to an intermediary vendee.in hoffman,the supreme judicial court stated that b ulk products are often delivered in tank trucks,box cars,or large industrial drums.at.as explained,the characteristics of this method of supply justify permitting a supplier to discharge its duty to warn by reasonably relying on an intermediary to transmit its warnings.see id.at.the record does not show whether appellees supplied their products in box cars or by comparable means,and appellees do not argue in their briefing to this court that the summary judgment record permits a resolution of this question.for that reason alone,this alternative ground of decision is not available to the appellees.
genereux did not work with appellees products 
taking the facts in the light most favorable to the appellants and resolving all inferences in their favor,the district court below concluded that appellees had supplied raytheon with a wide variety of products containing beryllium.it stated that american beryllia had supplied raytheon with beryllium oxide components,including windows,pins and collectors that brush had supplied raytheon with rectangular plates,discs,rods and tubes and that hardric had supplied beryllium metal emitter rings made from raw materials supplied to hardric by brush.
appellees argue that we should affirm summary judgment on the ground that the appellants have produced no evidence that genereux ever worked with their products.we disagree.taken in the appropriate light,the record supports the conclusion that genereux worked with beryllium products manufactured by appellees.as to brush,the record contains invoices showing that brush shipped beryllium oxide components,including windows discs and rectangles,to raytheon waltham plant.genereux testified that she worked with beryllium oxide discs and rectangles in the backward wave oscillator lab.the record also contains evidence that brush supplied beryllium to intermediate fabricators,who altered the pieces and sold them to raytheon.for example,brush supplied hardric with beryllium metal tubes,which it made into emitter rings and delivered to the waltham plant.lastly,as to american beryllia,invoices included in the record show that its predecessor,general ceramics,supplied beryllium oxide windows to raytheon waltham plant throughout the.
taken in the light most favorable to the appellants and resolving all inferences in their favor,the record supports the conclusion that genereux worked with beryllium products manufactured by appellees.
proximate causation 
appellees argue that even if they breached their duty to warn genereux,summary judgment should be affirmed because their conduct was not the proximate cause of genereux injury.in support of this argument,appellees point to record evidence that raytheon removed the warnings that appellees did provide and failed to heed warnings about controlling beryllium exposures,particularly in connection with the sandblasting of beryllium ceramics.these practices,appellees argue,show that raytheon was the proximate cause of genereux injury 
under massachusetts law,a defendant is liable for the foreseeable intervening conduct of a third party whether that conduct is negligent or not.wilborg denzell,collecting cases jones cincinnati.o nly unusual,extraordinary negligence of a third party will excuse an original tortfeasor liability.jones,at quoting commonwealth of.whether conduct meets this standard depends on the character of intervening events,and the natural and probable connection between the wrong done and the injurious consequence.solimene grauel,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.proximate causation is normally a jury question.id.at generally,questions of causation,proximate and intervening,present issues for the jury to decide.
in this case,the record provides some support for appellees claim that raytheon did not pass on their warnings to employees however,the record also shows that raytheon created warnings of its own to accompany beryllium parts throughout the waltham plant.these warnings were roughly similar in content to appellees warnings,stating that beryllium was toxic,and that employees should avoid operations that generated dust.raytheon practice of issuing its own warnings distinguishes this case from the authority cited by the appellees,in which an employer transferred a hazardous product from drums,which bore a warning,to a small container with no label or warnings thereon of any type.whitehead dycho,cohen steve ice cream,similar.in contrast to such a practice,we can not conclude that raytheon act of replacing manufacturer warnings with its own warnings was unforeseeable intervening conduct,or that it constituted unusual,extraordinary negligence.jones,at internal quotation marks omitted.a reasonable could conclude that by issuing its own,roughly similar warnings,raytheon exercised some care in protecting the health and safety of its employees.
whether raytheon heeded appellees warnings presents a slightly different issue.like most jurisdictions,massachusetts presumes that a user will follow a warning if it is given.knowlton,at wolfe ford mtr,restatement second of torts cmt.j.as we explained the presumption in knowlton,where no warning is given,or where an inadequate warning is given,a rebuttable presumption arises,beneficial to the plaintiff,that the failure to adequately warn was a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.knowlton,at quoting seley searle,ohio,see also garside osco drug,cir.while no court has yet stated what must be proved to defeat this presumption under massachusetts law,the authority discussed in knowlton held that the defendants had surmounted the presumption by proving that an adequate warning would have made no difference in preventing injury to the plaintiff.seley,at.
in this case,there is indeed record evidence that raytheon failed to implement and enforce hygienic controls necessary to maintain beryllium exposure levels of μg m,particularly in the context of sandblasting beryllium ceramics.however,there is also record evidence that raytheon had strict hygienic controls,including controls of sandblasting operations that raytheon repeatedly sought out brush advice about what controls were necessary and that raytheon was inclined to adjust hygienic practices in response to input from brush.james mccarthy,a raytheon safety engineer,testified 
brush wellman provided a variety of information that raytheon considered to be reliable.we certainly considered that and compared that information against the controls that were in place and the configuration of those controls,certainly considered it in constructing the allowances and the prohibitions that were incorporated into the control programs at raytheon company 
in light of the conflicting evidence about the hygienic practices at raytheon and raytheon reliance on brush,we can not conclude,for purposes of summary judgment,that a warning about the danger posed by polishing or occupational exposures to beryllium at the m level would have gone unheeded.
successor liability as to american beryllia 
american beryllia argues that we should affirm summary judgment as to it on the grounds that it is not subject to successor liability for injury caused by products manufactured by general ceramics.american beryllia advances three arguments in support of this conclusion that it purchased general ceramics assets at a bankruptcy sale pursuant to an asset purchase agreement that rendered the assets free and clear of all claims and interests of any nature whatsoever that the july,bankruptcy court order confirming the amended plan of orderly liquidation prohibited any distributions to creditors other than distributions pursuant to the plan and that under massachusetts law,which applies to this case,american beryllia did not assume the liabilities of general ceramics because it was a purchaser of assets.in response,appellants argue that this case is governed by new jersey law,and that under new jersey law american beryllia is liable for injuries caused by general ceramics even though it is a purchaser of assets,because it fits under the continuation and product line exceptions to the general rule.
the arguments raised by american beryllia and appellants are of considerable complexity,involving federal bankruptcy law,state principles,state law of corporations,and the relationships between these doctrines.the district court below declined the reach the matter,stating that the record was insufficient to resolve it.the matter should be resolved in the first instance by the district court on an appropriate record.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to the defendants is vacated.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.costs are awarded to appellants.
so ordered.
genereux also worked in quality assurance at raytheon northborough plant,but only for a short time.she did not work with beryllium in this position.she also worked briefly as a production coil winder,which did not involve beryllium.
appellees dispute this point.see infra section iii c.
appellees dispute that genereux polished beryllium metals.see infra section iii b.
genereux was sometimes asked to sandblast beryllium oxide ceramics in addition to those contained in the arco window and the tall man subassemblies.
genereux described two sandblasting machines.the first machine was equipped with a plexiglass shield or sash.the operator would put on protective gloves and lower the sash over the gloves,operating the pencil blaster behind the sash.a year after genereux arrived,this machine was replaced.the second machine may have been equipped with a complete sandblasting enclosure and local exhaust ventilation.it still emitted dust.
as the district court noted in its memorandum order,genereux also alleges that she was exposed to airborne beryllium dust generated elsewhere in the plant that spread through the ambient air.
on january,senator reed office mailed genereux a letter that stated,pursuant to your request for information concerning compensation for berylium sic exposure,you should contact and leave your name and address for further information.
when genereux returned from colorado,she initially sought treatment from a local pulmonologist who had seen her prior to the diagnosis.it seems that questions persisted about the diagnosis the local pulmonologist,corrao,was not convinced that genereux had chronic beryllium disease.genereux eventually left corrao care.

in motions to the district court,plaintiffs asserted that defendants failure to warn constituted an unfair or deceptive act within the meaning of chapter,section a.see.laws ch,a declaring unlawful unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce ch,c granting massachusetts attorney general the authority to make rules and regulations interpreting section a regs.defining general misrepresentations.
appellee brush contests that appellants made this argument below.in appellants memorandum of law in opposition to brush motion for summary judgment,they argued the facts show that suzanne too sic all reasonable steps to diagnose her condition,but it was not until,less than three years before she commenced this action,that she learned the true cause of her lung problems.shortly thereafter,appellants discussed genereux asthma diagnosis.
in the footnote,brush argues that genereux asthma diagnosis does not affect the statute of limitations because she was never told by a physician that beryllium was unrelated to her condition.in fact,the record belies this contention.see supra note infra note.
a reasonable jury could also conclude that genereux claims were untimely.
moreover,the local pulmonologist who treated genereux was apparently confident enough in the asthma diagnosis that he did not believe genereux had chronic beryllium disease even after she was diagnosed at national jewish in.physicians at national jewish also expressed uncertainty about which of genereux medical events were attributable to chronic beryllium disease.they wrote,it is difficult to determine if her hospitalizations for respiratory problems were truly due to asthma,or whether she was,in fact,suffering symptoms of chronic beryllium disease 
our holding does not excuse plaintiffs previously diagnosed with a disease from being willful ly ignoran t of the possibility that their condition was caused instead by the defendant conduct.see in re.diet drug,d at.willful ignorance does not toll the statute of limitations.id.but neither does massachusetts law require plaintiffs to have the gift of prophecy or to investigate every speculati on about their health.see gore daniel sons.we acknowledge that it can be difficult to separate willful from reasonable ignorance,and speculation from inevitable inference.it is for just this reason,we believe,that on this summary judgment record this matter should go to the jury.
