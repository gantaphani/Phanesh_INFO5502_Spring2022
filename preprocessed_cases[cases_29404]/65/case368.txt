we must decide whether two naval warships are products for the purposes of strict products liability and whether a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether materials originally installed upon such ships caused a decedent injuries.
in the,james mcindoe served aboard two naval ships which contained pipe insulation made from asbestos.from,he served aboard the uss coral sea,an aircraft carrier built by a predecessor in interest to huntington ingalls huntington and commissioned in.from,he served aboard the uss worden,a guided missile cruiser built by bath iron works corporation bath and commissioned in.aboard each ship,mcindoe was allegedly present during maintenance work involving the removal of pipe insulation that caused asbestos fibers to float in the air he breathed.
on september,mcindoe died from complications related to mesothelioma,a form of cancer closely associated with asbestos exposure.plaintiffs appellants are mcindoe legal heirs,who filed suit in california state court against bath and huntington arguing that mcindoe exposure to materials aboard their ships contributed to his death.mcindoe heirs raised design,manufacture,and claims based on theories of both strict products liability and general negligence.the case was removed to federal district court under a,where bath and huntington each moved for summary judgment.the district court granted both motions on the grounds that the ships were not products for purposes of strict liability and that the heirs could not establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the shipbuilders were responsible for installing any insulation that caused mcindoe injuries.mcindoe heirs timely appealed,and these cases have been consolidated before our court.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,and,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.colwell bannister,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.if the evidence is merely colorable,or is not significantly probative,summary judgment may be granted.beck assocs.city borough of sitka,cir internal quotation marks omitted.arguments based on conjecture or speculation are insufficient id.
federal maritime law an amalgam of traditional rules,modifications of those rules,and newly created rules governs this case.river transamerica delaval,d see wallis princess cruises,cir federal maritime law applies to torts that occur on navigable water and bear a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.
mcindoe heirs first argue that bath and huntington should be held strictly liable for defects in materials originally installed on the ships they built.the supreme court has recognized that federal maritime law incorporates actions for products liability,including those that sound in strict liability.river,at.the question whether a naval warship is to be considered a product in this context,however,appears to be one of first impression for the federal courts of appeals.
when analyzing claims under maritime law,we look to the restatement of torts the restatement particularly the most recent third restatement for guidance.oswalt resolute,cir see also saratoga fishing martinac,d citing both second and third restatements in evaluating maritime action.the third restatement defines a product subject to strict liability as tangible personal property distributed commercially for use or consumption.restatement third of torts prods.liab.a am.law inst emphasis added.o nly when the injury was allegedly caused by a defect in something within this definition of product should the defendant manufacturer or seller be strictly liable for the harm caused.id.reporter note,cmt.injuries caused by other items are actionable only under negligence,misrepresentation,or some other liability theory.id.
by these terms,the restatement would exclude warships that were never distributed commercially from the realm of strict products liability.this makes sense.the general aim of strict liability is to plac e responsibility on the party most able to prevent harm caused by dangerous products and thus to incentivize proper design and quality control of such products.all alaskan seafoods,raychem,cir citing third restatement.therefore,strict liability should be imposed on the party best able to protect persons from hazardous equipment.river,at.these goals would be advanced little by imposing liability on the builder of a naval ship.as evidence submitted in this case suggests,a ship built under government may not even be designed by the builder but instead by the government itself or another outside professional.further,the shipbuilder does not manufacture and has little ability to control the quality of the many thousands of component parts installed on each ship,let alone to account in its pricing for the virtually unlimited liability that would flow from a rule holding it strictly liable for their dangers.we do not believe that federal maritime law the primary goal of which is to protect and to promote the smooth flow of maritime commerce,foremost ins.richardson,d would countenance such a sweeping grant of liability.see generally mack,d,discussing principles of strict liability and maritime law.
we therefore agree with the district court that mcindoe heirs can not sustain an action for strict products liability premised upon the notion that the warships in question are themselves products under maritime law accordingly,the heirs may prevail only under a theory of negligence.
we turn to the heirs general negligence claims.to prevail on such claims,they must demonstrate,among other things,that mcindoe injuries were caused by exposure to asbestos that was attributable to the shipbuilders conduct.to do so,mcindoe heirs must be able to show both that he was actually exposed to materials that were installed by the shipbuilders and that such exposure was a substantial contributing factor in causing his injuries.lindstrom a c prod.liab,cir.we examine each requirement in turn.
first,mcindoe heirs must show that he was exposed to asbestos from materials that bath or huntington installed aboard the coral sea and worden.the heirs do not claim that the shipbuilders were responsible for replacing or maintaining such insulation after the ships were commissioned.therefore,they must show exposure to asbestos from materials that were originally installed aboard the ships.the heirs seek to demonstrate mcindoe asbestos exposure through the observations of two lay witnesses and,based on these observations,the opinion of one purported expert.
regarding the uss coral sea built by huntington and commissioned in,mcindoe heirs offered a declaration of brian tench,who boarded the ship as an ensign in and spent significant time with mcindoe in engineering spaces of the ship.tench testified that there were insulated steam pipes throughout the engineering spaces in which he worked with mcindoe that b ased on his training and experience,he knew such insulation contained asbestos that,he saw mcindoe in the area of others removing insulation on different occasions and that the removal of the insulation created large amounts of visible dust in the air mcindoe breathed.tench states that he knows some of the removed pipe insulation was original to the ship because he could tell from the thickness of the paint on the insulation that it had been painted times,indicating to him that it must have been aboard the ship for some time.
regarding the uss worden built by bath and commissioned in,mcindoe heirs offered a declaration of thomas sappington,who boarded the ship in and worked for two years in one of the ship fire rooms.sappington declared that there were thousands of feet of insulated pipe in the fire rooms that mcindoe was often present when maintenance was performed,which involved the removal of pipe insulation and that the process of removing the insulation created visible dust in
