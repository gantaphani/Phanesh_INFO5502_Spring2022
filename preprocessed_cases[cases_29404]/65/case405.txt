joe rivera brought a wrongful death action against philip morris,a tobacco manufacturer,asserting state law claims for strict product liability,fraud,and conspiracy.summary judgment in favor of philip morris was granted.we affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
joe rivera initiated this action individually,as guardian ad litem for his children and as executor of his deceased wife estate.he filed suit in nevada state court,alleging strict product liability based on theories of and,fraud based on theories of both fraudulent concealment and fraudulent misrepresentation,and conspiracy.he contended that his late wife,pamela rivera,smoked marlboro cigarettes manufactured by philip morris beginning in the summer of until her death from lung cancer in.
district court proceedings 
this action was timely and properly removed from state to federal court under diversity jurisdiction.the district court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of philip morris,on grounds that the strict product liability claim was preempted by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act of,et,or alternatively,as a matter of law,the claim failed under nevada common knowledge test the fraudulent concealment claim was preempted by the same federal statute,or alternatively,evidence was lacking that the decedent would have acted differently if philip morris had disclosed material information concerning the health effects of smoking the fraud claim was not preempted under federal law but evidence was absent that the decedent saw,heard,or read and relied upon any misrepresentation by philip morris and the conspiracy claim necessarily failed because it was a derivative of other underlying claims.rivera does not appeal the dismissal of his strict liability claim.he has not presented any argument with regard to the dismissal of his conspiracy claim and has therefore waived that issue on appeal.

federal preemption 
as a threshold issue,we first determine whether any of rivera state law claims are preempted by federal law.under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,congress may preempt state common law as well as state statutory law through federal legislation.const.art.vi.chicago transp.kalo brick tile,d.the district court concluded that rivera strict liability and fraudulent concealment claims were preempted by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act of,as amended by the public health cigarette smoking act of,because both claims necessarily attacked the sufficiency of cigarette health warnings.
in,congress enacted the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act,which required all cigarette packages to contain a warning that smoking was hazardous.the purpose of the labeling act was to adequately inform the public of the dangers associated with smoking cigarettes and to protect the national economy from the burden imposed by diverse,and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations.cipollone liggett group,d.a few years later,congress passed the public health cigarette smoking act of,which amended the labeling act by including a preemption clause that states no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.b.
in cipollone,the supreme court addressed preemption as applied to several state common law claims against cigarette manufacturers.in interpreting the preemption provision,a plurality of the court found that the labeling act broad language preempted some,but not all,common law claims.cipollone,at.to determine whether a particular common law claim fell within the express preemption clause,the plurality performed the following central inquiry we ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the damages action constitutes a requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health imposed under state law with respect to advertising or promotion,giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.id.at.applying this test,four justices agreed that the labeling act preempted the petitioner claims insofar as claims under a theory require a showing that advertising or promotions should have included additional,or more clearly stated,warnings id.
as to the claims before us,a majority of the court,including two dissenting justices,agreed that claims based on allegations that advertising or promotional materials should have included additional,or more clearly stated,warnings are preempted by the labeling act.however,a plurality of the court found that certain claims were not preempted,including claims based solely on negligent testing,research practices,or other actions unrelated to advertising or promotion,fraudulent concealment claims based on a duty to disclose material facts through channels other than advertising or promotion,state agency,misrepresentation claims based on false statements of material fact made in advertising,and conspiracy to misrepresent material facts,provided a claim for misrepresentation can be maintained.
strict liability claim 
the plaintiff advances two arguments to save his strict liability claim from the preemptive effect of the labeling act section b and the supreme court holding in cipollone that cipollone is not binding authority and may be disregarded by this court,and even if cipollone is binding,his claim still survives because it is not based on advertising or promotion.
although courts are not bound to follow the preemption test adopted by the plurality opinion,other federal courts of appeal have applied the holding in cipollone as binding precedent.see,spain brown williamson tobacco,cir glassner reynolds tobacco,cir philip morris,harshbarger,cir michael shiley,cir,overruled on other grounds,medtronic,lohr,d macdonald monsanto,cir.additionally,we have repeatedly relied upon cipollone in our jurisprudence.see,lindsey,at interpreting and relying upon cipollone in holding a ban on outdoor tobacco advertising preempted harris ford motor,cir relied on plurality opinion in cipollone in determining that product liability claim was preempted taylor ag indus,cir recognizing that w e look to cipollone for guidance in order to determine whether appellants failure to warn claim is preempted.
looking to cipollone for guidance we must conclude that rivera claim is not preempted by the labeling act.a claim is expressly preempted if the predicate duty underlying the claim constitutes a requirement or prohibition,based on smoking and health,imposed under state law,with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.cipollone,at.rivera asserts that philip morris failed in its duty to warn consumers about the dangers of using its product,including the addictive nature of nicotine,the manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes,and the carcinogenic effect of smoking.according to rivera,the duty to warn about such information is unrelated to advertising or promotion.his claim is based on philip morris failure to employ communications,such as public service announcements,to adequately warn consumers of the specific hazards of smoking.in support of his claim,he introduced examples of advocacy statements by philip morris,including the purchase of newspaper space for making public announcements and issuing press releases.
philip morris counters that any claim that it should have provided more information than was required on the federally mandated warning labels necessarily challenges the adequacy of those labels and is therefore preempted.see papike tambrands,cir holding that a failure to warn claim was preempted under the medical devices amendments to the food,drug cosmetic act because the claim involved,in part,mandating that the manufacturer of tampons add a variety of warning statements not required by federal regulation taylor,at holding that claims that signs,consumer notices,and other informational materials inadequately warned consumers were preempted under the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act because those claims challenged the adequacy of and mandated warnings on the product labeling and packaging.
rivera does not,though,challenge the warnings philip morris actually gave pursuant to the labeling act.rather,his claim addresses smoking harms outside the act reach,about which philip morris gave no warnings at all,but could have,through means other than advertising and promotion.his claim is thus unlike the claims in papike and taylor,where we held that plaintiffs claims regarding harms addressed in warning labels were preempted because the claims were premised ultimately upon the inadequacy of the product label.taylor,at.rivera claim is predicated on nevada common law duty that requires manufacturers to advise consumers of their products dangers,a warning which is not necessarily required to be given through advertising or promotion.since nevada does not specify how manufacturers should warn consumers,rivera claim is not preempted as long as it does not challenge a substantive warning issued pursuant to the act,and is not based on philip morris packaging,advertising,or promotional material.
philip morris also relies on a line of cases which hold that any claim requiring public release or disclosure of information is necessarily related to advertising and promotion.johnson brown williamson tobacco,d,holding that any communication from a cigarette manufacturer to the public constitutes advertising or promotion under the labeling act sonnenreich philip morris,holding that any attempt by cigarette manufacturers to notify their customers of the dangers of smoking is the equivalent of an advertising or promotional campaign because the same techniques are employed even though the goal is to discourage smoking lacey lorillard tobacco,a claim that the defendant has a duty to disclose additional information concerning cigarette ingredients unavoidably attacks defendants advertising and promotion and is inextricably related to smoking and health griesenbeck am.tobacco,a company attempt to notify its mass market of anything,whether a danger warning or a marketing effort,is considered advertising or promotion under the general usage of those terms,and a state can not impose requirements on such activities without running afoul of the clear language of cipollone.
this broad interpretation of the phrase advertising or promotion does not comport with the language of cipollone,nor does it square with the language and legislative history of the labeling act.by preserving some claims in cipollone that were based,in part,on the duty to communicate smoking and health information to the public,the communicative duties arising from voluntary activities and research activities,the plurality envisioned continued avenues for cigarette manufacturers to perform those duties through means other than the rigorously controlled avenues of advertising,promotion,and packaging.see harshbarger,at viewing the broad constructions given to the phrase advertising and promotion with skepticism.further,a fair but narrow reading of section b does not support the conclusion that the only method for a cigarette manufacturer to communicate directly with the public in general,and smokers in particular,is by way of packaging,advertising,and promotional materials.if there were no other way for a manufacturer to communicate with consumers regarding the dangers of smoking,the limiting advertising or promotion phrase in section b would be mere surplusage.finally,as the first circuit has noted,the legislative history repeated references to the narrow and limited nature of the preemption provision,also cut against the plausibility of the construction we are urged to adopt.id.at citing,at,reprinted in.
a trier of fact could find that philip morris had an obligation to warn consumers of the health risks of smoking outside of packaging,advertising,and promoting.we conclude that imposing such an obligation would be consistent with a fair but narrow reading of the labeling act section b and the plurality decision in cipollone.further,the rationale of those cases holding that public service announcements,lobbying,seminars,or educational programs are necessarily promotional is open to question under cipollone.
fraudulent concealment claim 
rivera fraudulent concealment claim is not preempted for similar reasons.rivera alleges that philip morris engaged in fraud by failing to disclose information relating to the addictive qualities of smoking and the true nature and degree of the health hazards associated with cigarettes through media unrelated to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes,such as the tobacco industry research committee.a plurality of the supreme court in cipollone agreed that fraudulent concealment claims escape preemption insofar as those claims rely on a duty to disclose material facts through channels of communication other than advertising or promotion,such as state statutes requiring a cigarette manufacturer to disclose material facts about smoking and health to an administrative agency.cipollone,at.the supreme court nonexclusive example of a hypothetical state law mandating disclosure of health information to a state agency does not preclude recognition of a duty to disclose material facts which arises under nevada common law.
the predicate of rivera fraudulent concealment claim is the general duty under nevada law not to conceal statements of material fact.the separate channel through which philip morris could communicate those facts was the tirc,which was established specifically to inform the public of the health risks of tobacco use.philip morris duty to disclose statements of material facts was imposed by state law and unrelated to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.rivera fraudulent concealment claim is not preempted 
rivera substantive claims 
strict liability claim 
having concluded that rivera strict liability claim is not preempted,we next determine whether his claim should have survived summary judgment.rivera appeals the dismissal of his strict liability claim,contending that the district court erred in two ways first,by taking judicial notice of the fact that the dangers of smoking were commonly known after,the year that the federal government strengthened the warning labels on cigarette packages and rivera started smoking and second,by holding,as a matter of law,that after cigarettes were not unreasonably dangerous under nevada law.
the parties agree that this strict product liability case is governed by nevada law.nevada has adopted the strict liability formula set forth in section of the restatement second of torts.see forest dupont de nemours,in light of nevada explicit recognition of section,particularly in failure to warn cases,the court concludes that the restatement is authoritative in this jurisdiction.stackiewicz nissan motor,ward ford motor.in nevada,strict liability is imposed on anyone who sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to consumers.a product is defective when it fails to perform in the manner reasonably to be expected in the light of its nature and intended function.ward,at see also ginnis mapes hotel.a product may be considered unreasonably dangerous if consumers are inadequately warned of an anticipated danger posed by a product of which the average consumer would not already be aware.yamaha motor arnoult.
to state a cause of action for strict product liability in nevada,rivera must show that the product has a defect which rendered it unreasonably dangerous,the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer,and the defect caused rivera injury.fyssakis knight equip.under the restatement approach to strict liability,a product is considered unreasonably dangerous when it is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it,with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.rest.torts cmt.i emphasis added.this test explicitly incorporates the common knowledge doctrine,which rests upon the premise that a product is not unreasonably dangerous if everyone knows of its inherent dangers.
the district court took judicial notice of the fact that the health risks and addictive nature of smoking have been common knowledge in nevada and,as a matter of law,concluded that cigarettes were not unreasonably dangerous.according to philip morris,courts have repeatedly dismissed claims brought by cigarette smokers because information regarding the health risks of smoking,including addiction,have long been available to,and known by,the public.philip morris argues that the district court correctly took judicial notice of this past awareness and granted dismissal of rivera strict liability claim.
the federal rules of evidence allow for judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.b.the notes of the advisory committee with regard to federal rule of evidence explain that a high degree of indisputability is the essential prerequisite to taking judicial notice of adjudicative facts and that the tradition of taking judicial notice has been one of caution in requiring that the matter be beyond reasonable controversy.a b advisory committee notes.because the effect of judicial notice is to deprive a party of an opportunity to use rebuttal evidence,and argument to attack contrary evidence,caution must be used in determining that a fact is beyond controversy under rule b.wright brooke group,d.
the nevada courts have not determined whether the common knowledge doctrine in the context of tobacco litigation would defeat rivera strict liability claim as a matter of law.we therefore make a reasonable determination of the results the highest state court would reach if it were deciding the case.aetna cas.sur.sheft,cir.would nevada courts take judicial notice of the fact that all the risks of smoking were commonly known after,four years after federal law first mandated warning labels on cigarette packages and the same year those warnings were strengthened,is the question.see,hearn reynolds tobacco,d.other courts considering this very issue have reached different results regarding when,if at all,assorted risks,namely general risks and risks of addiction,associated with smoking became common knowledge.wright,d at.
philip morris urges us to hold,as a matter of law,that the dangers of smoking were commonly known by.in guilbeault reynolds tobacco,d,the court concluded 
a fter thoroughly reviewing the facts regarding the evolution of the public knowledge of dangers,the court is satisfied that it can take judicial notice of the community common knowledge of the general health risks associated with smoking,including the risk of contracting cancer,as of.
id.at.several courts have also taken this approach and held,as a matter of law,that by there was common knowledge of the evils of smoking.see,glassner,at holding that plaintiff strict liability claims were barred as a matter of law because,between the time when the decedent began smoking in and when she died in,there existed a widespread public awareness of the health risks associated with smoking allgood reynolds tobacco,cir roysdon reynolds tobacco,cir applying common knowledge doctrine to affirm grant of summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff product liability claims spanning to hollar philip morris,d,dismissing two plaintiffs product liability claims,who began smoking in and respectively.
other courts deciding the issue have drawn a distinction between common knowledge of the general health hazards of smoking versus the common knowledge of specific illnesses or injuries allegedly caused by smoking.for example,in tompkin am.brands,cir,the sixth circuit reversed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant tobacco companies,holding that whether the dangers of smoking,namely the link between smoking and lung cancer,were common knowledge between and presented a question of fact for the jury.in reaching this decision,the court expressly stated 
the pertinent issue here is not whether the public knew that smoking was hazardous to health at some undifferentiated level,but whether it knew of the specific linkages between smoking and lung cancer.
id.at.the court narrowed the common knowledge inquiry to the question of whether the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was common knowledge,not merely whether the link between cigarette smoking and general health maladies was common knowledge.the court explained its reason for narrowing the inquiry 
it is one thing to be aware generally that a product might have an attenuated and theoretical connection with a deadly disease like lung cancer it is another altogether to comprehend that it is the cause of an overwhelming majority of lung cancer cases.the common knowledge requirement is emasculated if a defendant may show merely that the public was aware that a product presented health risks at some vague,unspecified,and undifferentiated level.
id.internal citation omitted.
the issue is unresolved in nevada,but there is a basis to conclude that nevada courts would narrow the inquiry and distinguish between knowing about general health risks of smoking and knowing about specific risks,like lung cancer or addiction,caused by tobacco products.see allison merck,plurality opinion recognizing nevada public policy grounds for holding manufacturers and distributors of defective products responsible for injuries caused by the defective products and rejecting the concept of unavoidably unsafe products as an exception to the rules of strict liability.such an inquiry is a question of fact to be decided by a jury.see tompkin,at.rivera alleged that philip morris tobacco products proximately caused the decedent lung cancer.the common knowledge inquiry should have been narrowed to whether the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was common knowledge,not simply whether the link between smoking and general health hazards was.it is at least premature on this record to take judicial notice of the fact that the link between smoking and specific illnesses allegedly caused by smoking was common knowledge during the relevant time.
philip morris urges us to affirm the district court based on the evidentiary record.the test for whether a product is unreasonably dangerous is an objective determination and is measured by the ordinary consumer for whom the product is designed.see mclennan am.eurocopter,cir insolia philip morris,cir.to get past summary judgment,rivera needed to present evidence showing that the ordinary consumer was unaware of the link between smoking and lung cancer after,the defendant product was more dangerous than was contemplated by the ordinary consumer.
rivera,through marvin goldberg,submitted an expert report highlighting public opinion polls conducted in and which found that o ver half of smokers believed that smoking was not hazardous or that only heavy smoking was hazardous.goldberg report also discussed various studies conducted by the tobacco industry that were allegedly concealed from the public but confirmed the relationship between heavy and prolonged tobacco smoking and the incidence of cancer of the lung.an inference can be drawn from this evidence that if the tobacco indu
