federal regulation of medical devices 
in enacting the medical device amendments of mda et to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act et,congress sought to to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use.medtronic,lohr,d medtronic.the mda divides medical devices into three classifications class i,class ii,and class iii.a.a class iii device,such as the ancure device,receives the most federal oversight,and requires premarket approval by the fda riegel medtronic,d riegel.this rigorous process requires an applicant to submit full reports of all studies and investigations of the device safety and effectiveness that have been published or should reasonably be known to the applicant a full statement of the device components,ingredients,and properties and of the principle or principles of operation a full description of the methods used in,and the facilities and controls used for,the manufacture,processing,and,when relevant,packing and installation of,such device samples or device components required by the fda and a specimen of proposed labeling.c.riegel,at.at.
the fda spends an average of hours on each premarket approval application.medtronic,supra,at.in determining whether to grant premarket approval of a class iii device,the fda must,among other things,weig h any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.a c.the fda will also rely on the conditions of use included in the proposed labeling as the basis for determining whether or not there is a reasonable assurance of the device safety and effectiveness.d a.in the event that the fda grants premarket approval,it may condition its approval on adherence to various requirements.d,e.after approval,the mda forbids the manufacturer to make,without fda permission,changes in design specifications,manufacturing processes,labeling,or any other attribute,that would affect safety or effectiveness.riegel,supra,at.at.
ii.statement of 
in the spring of,defendants filed a premarket approval application for the ancure device.on september,the fda approved the ancure device for commercial distribution,subject to certain conditions and requirements.
within the first year after the premarket approval of the ancure device,several serious problems arose.they included a limited recall of some units due to a monofilament problem serial numbers figure problem involving wire controls the cassini project involving several changes to the device promotion to the medical services group jacket retraction problem handle breaking technique to be used to retract device if it became stuck after the graph was implanted need for medical device report mdr policy aneurysm rupture processes and labeling.in october,several employees informed guidant about these problems.in response,guidant initiated both an internal investigation and one by outside auditors.
as of december,guidant was informed of significant weaknesses in the quality systems by the outside auditor.outside counsel also gave its opinion to guidant that the ancure devices currently being manufactured were at least technically adulterated under federal law,presented a potential risk to the public health,and guidant continued distribution of certain devices expose d the devices,the company and responsible individuals to potential fda regulatory action.
guidant assembled a team of employees under the supervision of steve wirkus to investigate the safety of the ancure device.the team reviewed ancure case experience forms,voice mail,and complaints.over patients were implanted with the ancure device,and approximately were submitted.though the contained check boxes for equipment malfunctions and comments,they did not contain a check box for injuries except where death was an outcome.according to wirkus,other injuries could be listed in the comment box,but the data in the comment box was sometimes missing due to the limited size of the box no one on the team contacted anyone with knowledge of the complaints.in summarizing the data,wirkus initially acknowledged that the data may be,but a later report stated that the data might be skewed.
after guidant became aware of an fda investigation,outside counsel to guidant wrote a memo indicating that guidant would stop shipment of the ancure device and recall the product due to deficiencies in the ges regulatory submission and communications with fda.on march,defendants recalled the ancure device.
on march,guidant provided evasive,if not false,information to the fda.in response to the fda request for an audit report,guidant also sent a report,which stated that it had found nothing that indicated any intent or desire to hide information from fda.
the fda subsequently reviewed several medwatch reports and approved premarket approval supplements.on august,the fda reapproved the ancure device.
in the fall of,the department of justice began an investigation and subpoenaed the independent auditor reports.guidant motion to quash was denied in july.the trial court noted guidant use of these reports for the purpose of influencing the fda.the trial court also cited the declaration of an fda representative,who stated that the existence of the reports persuaded the fda not to pursue additional regulatory measures beyond those proposed by the company.
in april,the fda approved an aortoiliac version of the ancure device,and approved and required additional language pertinent to its use.
though guidant played a central role in the fraudulent conduct,evt entered into a plea agreement in june.evt pleaded guilty to nine counts of shipping misbranded medical devices a,a arising from the shipping of nine devices between november,and september,and one count of making false statements,arising from the provision of incomplete information to an fda inspector in july.the plea agreement also states from september,to march,defendant introduced approximately devices into interstate commerce.between september,and march,defendant filed mdrs medical device reports for the delivery system of the ancure device.on or about march,defendant disclosed to the fda the existence of approximately additional mdrs concerning the delivery system of the ancure device that had not been previously reported to the fda,as required by law on or about march,defendant informed the fda that it had failed to seek prior approval to amend its instruction for use to include the handle breaking technique as legally required.the plea agreement required evt to forfeit million as well as pay a criminal fine of million and a civil settlement of million.
as of june,the ancure device was no longer available.
iii.statement of the case 
in august,mcguan filed a complaint in which he alleged that he suffered severe injuries after he was implanted with the ancure device on february.his complaint alleged eight causes of action strict product liability failure to warn strict product liability restatement second of torts negligence breach of express warranty breach of implied warranty fraudulent concealment punitive damages and violations of the consumer legal remedies act.in june,johnson filed a first amended complaint in which she alleged that she suffered severe injuries after she was implanted with the ancure device on may.her complaint alleged the same causes of action as those alleged in mcguan complaint.however,her complaint also added a cause of action for fraud and misrepresentation.plaintiffs complaints focus on defects in the design,testing,and manufacture of the ancure device,the failure to warn of all possible adverse side effects,and the fraudulent concealment of the dangers and defects of the product.the complaints do not refer to violations of federal law.
on september,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs claims were preempted by federal law.plaintiffs were granted leave to conduct discovery.on may,plaintiffs filed opposition to the summary judgment motion.the day after defendants filed their reply,plaintiffs brought motions to amend their complaints.
the trial court granted defendants motions for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs claims were preempted by section a of the mda.the trial court also ruled that plaintiffs could not avoid preemption by arguing that defendants engaged in because this claim was preempted under buckman plaintiffs legal comm,d buckman.the trial court subsequently denied plaintiffs motions to amend their complaints,and granted defendants motions to seal audit reports.following judgments of dismissal,plaintiffs filed timely notices of appeal.

federal preemption 
congress has the power under the supremacy clause of article vi of the federal constitution to preempt state law.s tate law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.cipollone liggett group,d,quoting maryland louisiana,d.as the united states supreme court has explained,federal law preempts state law in three circumstances.first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.english general electric,d.
the preemption provision of the mda states in relevant part n o state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement which is different from,or in addition to,any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device,and which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.a.
the united states supreme court considered the scope of this preemption provision in riegel,supra.in riegel,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant catheter,a class iii device,was designed,labeled,and manufactured in a manner that violated state common law,and that these defects caused severe injuries.riegel,at.at.the plaintiffs complaint stated claims for strict liability breach of implied warranty and negligence in the design,testing,inspection,distribution,labeling,marketing,and sale of the catheter.riegel,at.at.at issue was whether the preemption provision in the mda barred common law claims that challenged the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices which had received premarket approval by the fda.riegel,at.at.in resolving this issue,the court articulated a test whether the federal government has established requirements applicable to the defendant catheter,and if so,whether the claims are based upon state requirements with respect to the device that are different from,or in addition to the federal ones,and that relate to safety and effectiveness.riegel,at.at.
the court first found that premarket approval imposes federal requirements because it is granted only after the fda determines that a device offers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and because the fda requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application.riegel,supra,at.at.turning to the second question,the court,relying on medtronic,supra,at.concluded that tort duties under common law impose requirement s and would be by federal requirements specific to a medical device.riegel,at.at.as the court explained,excluding duties from the scope of would make little sense.state tort law that requires a manufacturer catheters to be safer,but hence less effective,than the model the fda has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect.indeed,one would think that tort law,applied by juries under a negligence or standard,is less deserving of preservation.a state statute,or a regulation adopted by a state agency,could at least be expected to apply analysis similar to that applied by the experts at the fda how many more lives will be saved by a device which,along with its greater effectiveness,brings a greater risk of harm a jury,on the other hand,sees only the cost of a more dangerous design,and is not concerned with its benefits the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court.riegel,at.at.accordingly,the court held that the plaintiffs common law claims were preempted by federal law.riegel,at.at.
here,though plaintiffs complaints are based,in part,on alleged defects in the design,testing,and manufacture of the ancure device as well as the failure to warn of all possible adverse side effects,they do not allege that defendants violated fda regulations.since the fda reapproved the ancure device prior to plaintiffs surgeries,the fda gave its approval of the device design,testing,intended use,manufacturing methods,performance standards,and labeling.thus,to the extent that plaintiffs complaints allege that the ancure device was unsafe and its warnings were inadequate,they are seeking to impose requirements that are different from,or in addition to the mda.consequently,the state law claims for strict product liability,negligence,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty,and violations of the consumer legal remedies act are preempted under the mda.
plaintiffs,however,focus on defendants alleged fraudulent conduct after march.they argue that their causes of action are not preempted,by virtue of fraud on the fda or,alternatively,their cause of action for fraud and misrepresentation is not preempted.defendants counter that plaintiffs have failed to plead claims and that any such claims are not legally cognizable.
we first note that mcguan complaint does not allege a cause of action for or fraud and misrepresentation.it states a cause of action for fraudulent concealment,which alleges that defendants had the duty and obligation to disclose to plaintiff and to plaintiff physicians,the true facts concerning the ancure device product that is,that said product was dangerous,defective,and likely to cause serious consequences to users,including injuries as herein occurred.this cause of action does not refer to the fda reapproval of the ancure device.nor does it allege that defendants violated any federal regulations or provided inaccurate informa
