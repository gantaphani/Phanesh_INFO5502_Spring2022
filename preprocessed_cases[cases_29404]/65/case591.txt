the economic loss rule bars recovery in tort for economic damages caused by a defective product unless those losses are accompanied by some form of personal injury or damage to property other than the defective product itself.t he economic loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover in strict products liability in tort when a product defect causes damage to other property,that is,property other than the product itself.the law of contractual warranty governs damage to the product itself.citations.jimenez superior court cal th,d,jimenez.
kb home filed this petition for writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its orders,based on the economic loss rule,precluding kb home from pursuing negligence and strict products liability theories to recover from real party in interest consolidated industries consolidated the cost of repairing and replacing defective furnaces manufactured by consolidated and installed in houses built by kb home.the challenged order was premised on the trial court conclusion,made as a matter of law without first permitting kb home or consolidated to present evidence,that the furnace itself is a single,integrated product and that physical damage caused by the furnace allegedly defective emissions control device a nox rod to different components of the furnace did not constitute damage to other property within the meaning of the economic loss rule.
determining the nature of the product at issue and whether the injury for which recovery is sought is to the product itself or to property other than the defective product,at least in cases involving damage,is generally the province of the trier of fact.see jimenez,supra,cal th at,d.because the trial court ruling thus deprived kb home of its right to have material issues of fact submitted to a jury,we grant the petition and direct respondent court to vacate its orders holding that the economic loss rule bars kb home from recovering tort damages for the cost of repairing and replacing the defective consolidated furnaces.
factual and procedural 
between and kb home installed approximately horizontal forced air furnaces manufactured by consolidated in homes it built in california.to meet california requirements limiting nitrous oxides emitted by residential furnaces in certain metropolitan areas,consolidated installed stainless steel nox rods above the burners in furnaces to be used in areas subject to these air quality standards 
neither the nox rods nor the clips used to secure them in place over the furnace burner were manufactured by consolidated.kb home characterizes the nox rod as an,emission control device that is a separate component from the heat exchanger,fire boxes and burners in the consolidated furnaces and notes that consolidated sold the furnaces identical to those at issue in this case outside california without the nox rod.
according to kb home expert,the nox rods were defective and generated excess heat that damaged other parts of the consolidated furnaces,including melting and cracking burners,cracking heat exchangers and heat exchanger expansion joints and causing fire box failures the united states consumer product safety commission cpsc issued a safety alert in september,warning that the consolidated nox rod furnaces present a substantial risk of fire.on july,the cpsc issued a recall of approximately furnaces manufactured by consolidated and sold in california.
as the safety risk posed by the consolidated furnaces became known and because consolidated itself was in bankruptcy and not responding to the problem,kb home initiated a program to identify and inspect homes it had sold with consolidated furnaces.in percent of the homes kb home inspected,the furnaces had bent or melted nox rods,cracked fire boxes,cracked heat exchanger,melted burners,separations at the control joints and rusted components.defective or damaged furnaces were replaced by kb home at a cost in excess of million.
on may,kb home sued consolidated and other defendants,alleging causes of action arising from kb home replacement of the defective furnaces,including tort claims for negligence and strict liability.on december,respondent superior court issued an order regarding threshold legal issues,requiring the parties to submit briefs addressing whether the cost to replace an allegedly defective furnace is recoverable under tort theories of strict products liability or negligence or is barred by the economic loss rule.the order stated the court decision will be made as a matter of law,and will not be a decision as to disputed facts.
pursuant to the schedule announced by the trial court,consolidated filed a motion regarding the economic loss rule and opening brief on january,kb home filed an opposition memorandum consolidated filed a reply brief.following this briefing and after hearing oral argument,on april,the court issued a minute order and statement of decision concluding that the furnaces themselves,which the court assumed were defective,are not other property for purposes of the economic loss rule and kb home costs for replacing the furnaces,including the costs incurred for the installation and removal of defective furnaces,are not recoverable in tort the court finds the economic loss rule precludes plaintiffs from recovering tort damages for replacement of the defective furnaces absent damage to other property directly caused by the defective furnaces.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the court found its ruling involved a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.
kb home filed a motion for clarification or,in the alternative,reconsideration on april,and also moved for a hearing pursuant to evidence code section on disputed factual issues not resolved in the court statement of decision and order.with its papers kb home provided an offer of proof,based on declarations from a retained expert and a senior kb home executive,which it argued establishes that the damages it seeks are recoverable under the economic loss rule as damages.the trial court denied both motions,but issued a further order specifying that it considered the furnaces a single manufactured product and did not consider the component parts of that integrated product as separate products.any damage to the furnaces heat exchangers or burners caused by the nox rods,in the court view,was damage to the product itself,not damage to other property properly recoverable under the economic loss rule.
kb home filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its orders holding that the economic loss rule bars it from recovering damages for the cost of replacing the defective consolidated furnaces on theories of strict liability and negligence.on july,this court issued an order to show cause why the relief requested by kb home should not be granted.having given the parties the opportunity to fully brief the issue,we address the merits of the petition.
contentions 
kb home contends the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that physical damage caused by the allegedly defective nox rod emission device to different components of the consolidated furnace did not constitute damage to other property within the meaning of the economic loss rule and that,at least on the facts of this case,the trial court also erred in failing to recognize a defect exception to the economic loss rule.
discussion 
standard of review 
relying on the supreme court decision in aas superior court cal th,d,aas,kb home describes the trial court ruling regarding the economic loss rule as the functional equivalent of a common law motion for judgment on the pleadings or a nonsuit and,as such,subject to de novo review.while a ruling excluding evidence is not ordinarily subject to review by writ citation and typically is reviewed for abuse of discretion on appeal citation,a motion to exclude all evidence on a particular claim is subject to independent review as the functional equivalent of a common law motion for judgment on the pleadings citations,or,if decided in light of evidence produced during discovery,a motion for nonsuit citation.id.at,d.
consolidated,in contrast,argues that the trial court order is limited to only one category of kb home alleged damages the cost of replacement of the defective furnaces in homes where there was no property damage to other parts of the structure and does not exclude all evidence on kb home tort is,the trial court ruling does not preclude kb home from asserting its strict products liability and negligence claims with respect to homes that actually suffered damage to other property within the meaning of the economic loss rule.accordingly,consolidated insists that the trial court ruling,in effect,granted only a motion in limine to one category of damage evidence and,therefore,is properly subject to more limited appellate review for abuse of discretion.see,people alvarez cal th,d,a n appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.
the parties disagreement as to the most appropriate functional label for the trial court order is ultimately without significance.the court itself indicated its ruling,made as a matter of law,raised a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion requiring appellate resolution pursuant to code of civil procedure section.we,of course,address questions of law under an independent review standard.people jones cal th,d,gunnell metrocolor laboratories,th,d.moreover,even when a decision by the trial court is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,we must determine at the outset whether the court applied the correct legal standard to the issue in exercising its discretion,which determination is also a question of law for this court.of course,t he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion citations.people parmar th,d.
the trial court erred in ruling as a matter of law that kb home could not recover in tort for the cost of replacing the defective furnaces 
under the economic loss rule a manufacturer or distributor may be liable in strict liability or negligence for physical injury to property caused by a defective product,but not for purely economic losses,seely white motor cal d,seely cronin olson cal d.economic loss or harm in this context has been defined as damages for inadequate value,costs of repair and replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits citation.jimenez,supra,cal th at,d.
in its landmark decision in seely,the california supreme court held a commercial trucker who had purchased a defective truck for use in his business could recover the purchase price and his lost profits on a breach of express warranty cause of action but could not pursue a strict products liability claim a manufacturer can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm.he can not be held for the level of performance of his products in the consumer business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer demands.a consumer should not be charged at the will of the manufacturer with bearing the risk of physical injury when he buys a product on the market.he can,however,be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will.even in actions for negligence,a manufacturer liability is limited to damages for physical injuries and there is no recovery for economic loss alone.citations.seely,supra,cal d at.
the seely court,however,agreed with the plaintiff contention that the doctrine of strict liability in tort should be extended to govern physical injury to plaintiff property,as well as personal injury physical injury to property is so akin to personal injury that there is no reason to distinguish them.citations.seely,supra,cal d at.nonetheless,on the record before it the court declined to permit recovery on a strict liability theory for damages to the plaintiff truck because the trial court found that there was no proof that the defect caused the physical damage to the truck.ibid.
prior to the supreme court decision last year in jimenez,supra,cal th,d,the predominant view in california was that tort recovery was available even when the sole physical injury caused by a defect is to the product itself.for example,in sacramento regional transit dist.grumman flxible d,the court rejected any products liability recovery because the plaintiff had failed to allege physical injury to its property apart from the manifestation of the defect itself the court explained,the rule imposing strict liability in tort for damage to property presupposes a defect and further damage to plaintiff property caused by the defect.when the defect and the damage are one and the same,the defect may not be considered to have caused physical injury.citation.ibid.division two of this court applied this understanding of the economic loss rule to permit tort recovery for physical injury to the defective product itself in international knights of wine,ball d,which held that the purchaser of bottled wine was entitled to seek tort damages for the loss of wine caused by corrosion of the metal caps sealing the bottles.similarly,in gherna ford motor d,the court recognized the plaintiff right to recover in tort for fire damage to an automobile caused either by defective wiring or the defective placement of the transmission dipstick.accord,stearman centex homes th,d c ourts of this state have fully examined the economic loss rule,drawn the line of demarcation between such loss and physical injury to property,including to the defective product itself,and allowed recovery of strict liability damages in the latter instance.
in jimenez the supreme court held a manufacturer of windows installed in a home during its construction could be strictly liable in tort for injuries to other parts of the structure in which the defective windows were installed.jimenez,supra,cal th at,d.nonetheless,in reviewing the application of the economic loss rule to the claims of the homeowners before it,the court emphasized that the economic loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover in strict products liability in tort when a product defect causes damage to other property,that is,property other than the product itself.the law of contractual warranty governs damage to the product itself.citations.id.at,d.tort recovery was permissible against the window manufacturer,the court explained,because california decisional law has long recognized that the economic loss rule does not necessarily bar recovery in tort for damage that a defective product,a window causes to other portions of a larger product,a house into which the former has been incorporated t he concept of recoverable physical injury or property damage ha s over time expanded to include damage to one part of a product caused by another,defective part.id.at,d,quoting aas,supra,cal th at,d.
under the holding of jimenez,to apply the economic loss rule we must first determine what the product at issue is.only then do we find out whether the injury is to the product itself for which recovery is barred by the economic loss rule or to property other than the defective product for which plaintiffs may recover in tort.jimenez,supra,cal th at,d.the court did not provide any direct guidance as to how that crucial evaluation was to be made,although it suggested an expansive approach to determining that the damage at issue was to other property and therefore recoverable in tort.see id.at,d,we have no occasion here to consider whether defective raw materials should be treated in the same manner as component parts or whether there may be situations in which the economic loss rule would bar recovery for damages that a defective component part causes to other portions of the finished product of which it is a part.
