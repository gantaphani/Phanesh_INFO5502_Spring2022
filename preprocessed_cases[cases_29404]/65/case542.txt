plaintiffs and appellants janice dicola,individually and on behalf of the estate of thomas dicola,gina dicola,by and through her guardian ad litem phyllis pearson,christopher dicola and daniel dicola appeal from summary judgments in favor of defendants and respondents white brothers performance products,white and tolemar,tolemar on plaintiffs wrongful death and products liability action stemming from an accident that was alleged to have occurred when a motorcycle side stand failed to retract.the trial court granted summary judgment on grounds the defendants evidence demonstrated neither white,a distributor,nor tolemar,a manufacturer,placed the allegedly defective side stand on the market plaintiffs evidence did not create a triable issue of material fact as to whether white and tolemar were the distributor and manufacturer,respectively,of an exemplar side stand example b that plaintiffs experts asserted was essentially identical to the subject side stand and defendants demonstrated they were not responsible for placing the subject side stand into the stream of commerce.in reaching its holding,the court rejected a declaration from plaintiffs counsel purporting to state that example b was a product manufactured by tolemar.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend white and tolemar did not meet their initial summary judgment burden to show they did not manufacture or distribute the subject side stand.plaintiffs further contend the court erred by excluding the entirety of their counsel declaration,but they in any event raised triable issues of fact preventing summary judgment with evidence that example side stand b was identical to the allegedly defective side stand and defendants manufactured and distributed the example.we affirm the judgments.
factual and procedural background 
thomas dicola was killed and his janice dicola injured following an accident that occurred while they were riding on thomas dicola motorcycle.thereafter,janice dicola,on behalf of herself and thomas dicola estate,and other dicola family members filed a complaint against custom chrome manufacturing,custom chrome and doe entities,alleging causes of action for wrongful death,negligence,breach of express and implied warranties,strict product liability and survivorship.in part,plaintiffs alleged thomas dicola was rounding a slight turn on northbound state route when the lowered side stand on his motorcycle the subject side stand came into contact with the ground and failed to automatically retract,causing him to lose control of and crash the motorcycle.plaintiffs eventually amended their complaint to substitute white and tolemar in as doe defendants.
white and tolemar each moved for summary judgment.the basis for white motion was that the subject side stand was not its product that it did not design,assemble,fabricate,test,inspect,manufacture,distribute,wholesale,ship or retail the subject side stand and it thus owed no duty and had no privity with plaintiffs.it presented declarations from white operation sales manager ken davie,tolemar president steve ramelot,materials science expert shahram sheybany,and gerald zamiski,an expert with degrees in mechanical and material engineering and a in mechanical metallurgy.davie explained that white manufactured exhaust systems only that it did not manufacture,assemble,or fabricate motorcycle side stands.further,white only sold to motorcycle dealers who sold products from storefront businesses,and davie review of white sales records showed it had never sold any motorcycle accessories to thomas dicola.according to davie,the only side stand that white purchased and sold that was remotely visibly similar in appearance to the subject side stand was its side stand,manufactured by tolemar for use on softail motorcycles.
tolemar president,ramelot,averred he had closely examined the subject side stand,which had been marked with an a,with four other side stands marked b,c,d,and ramelot stated that the c,d,and e side stands were manufactured by tolemar.basing his conclusions in part from the declarations of sheybany and zamiski,as well as his own visual inspection and knowledge of tolemar manufacturing process for the side stands,ramelot pointed to differences in the subject side stand with those manufactured by tolemar,and concluded tolemar did not manufacture the subject side stand.he stated that other companies manufactured side stands visually similar to tolemar side stand that were known as.
sheybany explained that the subject side stand as well as the exemplars underwent visual and microscopic examinations,plating thickness measurements,dimensional and geometrical analysis,and radiography.metallurgical mounts were taken after cutting for the subject side stand and example b and mechanical cutting was done on the other examples.these mounts were examined by a scanning electron microscope and underwent analysis with an energy dispersive microprobe.based upon all of the physical and metallurgical testing and analysis,sheybany observed a large number of significant differences between the accident side stand and the other side stands known to be manufactured by tolemar,and he stated those differences could only have been produced by a substantially different manufacturing practice other than tolemar consistently used computerized numerical controlled cnc manufacturing machines.he noted tolemar cnc machining kept geometrical characteristics and dimensional tolerances within a strict limit,and the subject side stand falls well outside of these accepted or established tolerance limits.sheybany concluded the subject side stand was not manufactured by tolemar based on the use of different manufacturing processes and procedures with different dimensions and tolerances,and also the fact the subject side stand had a machined weld that was then plated.zamiski reached similar conclusions.
submitting identical declarations from ramelot and zamiski,tolemar moved for summary judgment on the same ground that the undisputed facts demonstrated tolemar did not design,assemble,test,inspect,distribute,wholesale,ship or retail thomas dicola motorcycle or any of its component parts.
in opposition,plaintiffs sought to rebut defendants showing with declarations from experts thomas carnan and peter leffe both carnan and leffe inspected the subject side stand and compared it with the example b side stand.they also reviewed information from a testing laboratory that had conducted materials testing,as well as the declarations submitted by white and tolemar.carnan averred that all of the minor variations pointed out by defendants experts could have been manufacturing variations that do not affect the form,fit or function of the part.for example,he found certain groove marks on both parts were made from the same machining process and that other sanding marks were not evidence of a different machining process or manufacturer,but were consistent with the manufacturing process of a production part.he pointed out other variations could have been the result of differences in the sharpness or straightness of drill bits,or wear caused by other parts.he stated that similarities in the mounting brackets and bore holes demonstrated that the parts were consistent with parts made by the same manufacturer.he also found identical machining marks in the side stands legs to be conclusive evidence that the parts were made by the same manufacturer.as for the type of material,carnan stated both the subject side stand and example b were made from the same steel,whereas examples c and d were respectively made of and steel.according to carnan,that showed the bracket had been made of at least three different materials at different times,which was indicative of a manufacturing process with little consistency and the manufacturer ability to alter the specification or dimensions at any time.
leffe observed that the subject side stand and example b had the same general and overall dimensions,which a would not need to copy.however,he noted distortion and deformation of certain parts of the subject side stand due to the impact damage from the accident,which he maintained made measurements unreliable.he nevertheless concluded the mounting bracket bend radius and bushings,though distorted from the accident or use,were more likely than not identical,and had aspects that were signature s of the manufacturer.in addition to other conclusions,leffe concluded the parts were products of the same manufacturer based on similarity in manufacturing techniques,machining marks,bushings,dimensions and overall design of the part that while minor variations exist they are well within the limits of manufacturing tolerances.further,minor variations can be expected over time and within the evolutionary process of a production part manufactured for application.
the court tentatively denied white and tolemar motions,concluding plaintiffs had raised triable issues of material fact regarding whether certain aspects of the subject side stand were consistent with tolemar products.however,at oral argument on the matter,tolemar and white counsel pointed out as they had argued in their reply papers in the trial court that plaintiffs experts had limited their examination to a comparison of the subject side stand and example b,which they argued had not been proven to be a tolemar side stand.plaintiffs counsel responded that the example b side stand was originally produced by custom chrome and represented to us as a white brother product.faced with defense counsel argument that none of those facts were included in plaintiffs opposing papers and finding their position to be,the court,sua sponte,gave plaintiffs an opportunity to present evidence to substantiate the relationship of example b to the subject side stand.
plaintiffs thereafter refiled their opposing points and authorities,adding a new declaration from their counsel stacy king,an associate at macaluso associates.king averred that several months after plaintiffs filed their complaint against custom chrome,that company attorney of record,mortimer hartwell,and a custom chrome representative inspected thomas dicola motorcycle and subject side stand.according to king,hartwell represented to her at that time that the subject side stand was not one of theirs,but a part manufactured and distributed by white.a few days later,hartwell repeated that information to her in a letter.king averred custom chrome attorney then informed me that they had an exemplar of a white brothers side stand that was identical to the subject side stand.per our discovery request,hartwell provided our offices with a burly brands side stand.the side stand that was produced is exemplar b this side stand came in its original packaging for comparison to the subject side stand.exemplar b was in an,package when it arrived in our office.it was identified by the label burly brands across the top of the packaging.i opened the package and removed the side stand.inside the package was an instruction sheet for proper mounting of the side stand.on this sheet,the side stand indicated it was a white brothers product,part.
king averred that as a result of this information,plaintiffs eventually added white as a defendant,which in responses to special interrogatories identified their packaging of the side stand in an identical manner to the packaging of the side stand provided by custom chrome.king averred that white identified tolemar as the sole manufacturer of the,and stated,i am informed and believe,and thereupon allege that tolemar,is the sole manufacturer of the side stand,and that they only sell their product to white for distribution and sale.king declaration continued our offices provided this side stand to both tolemar and white for testing,upon which they tested the subject side stand identified as the subject side stand a,the side stand provided by custom chrome and represented as that of white identified as exemplar b sic.furthermore,defendants provided exemplar sic c,e,and sic.our experts were similarly given the subject side stand and exemplar b for testing.according to defendant chemical testing of all the side stands,and confirmed by plaintiffs experts,the side stands were all made from the same.plaintiffs experts have concluded that the subject side stand,exemplar a is identical in every way to the exemplar received from custom chrome,exemplar b which was identified by its packaging as a burly brothers side kickstand.i am informed and believe,and thereupon allege that the side stand given to my office by custom chrome was manufactured,distributed and packaged by defendant white brothers,and designed by tolemar.
in reply,both tolemar and white argued that the uncontroverted evidence before the court was that the subject side stand had significant differences between it and the tolemar manufactured side stands examples c,d,e,and demonstrating that they were manufactured by a different person or entity.they maintained summary judgment was properly granted in part because plaintiffs had failed under section,subdivision h to timely proffer king declaration,which was the only new evidence submitted by them and king declaration relied upon inadmissible hearsay,was based on speculation,assumed facts not in evidence and lacked foundation.white also asserted that king declaration contained improper legal conclusions.defendants filed written objections to the contents of king declaration.
in february,the court tentatively granted white and tolemar motions in a single minute order applicable to both defendants.in part,it ruled king declaration does not adequately prove the chain of custody establishes exemplar b is from defendants.the declaration contains hearsay statements from attorney hartwell that are not properly before the court.in march,the court issued a combined order and judgment in favor of white and in july,a separate judgment in tolemar favor containing no findings.as to white,the court ruled white had proffered evidence that neither it nor tolemar placed the subject side stand on the market plaintiffs efforts to create a triable issue of material fact by comparing example b with the subject side stand failed in that king declaration did not adequately prove the chain of custody establishing that white distributed or tolemar manufactured example b and the declaration contained inadmissible hearsay statements from hartwell and white demonstrated it was not responsible for placing the subject side stand into the stream of commerce.following entry of the judgments in white and tolemar favor,plaintiffs filed their respective appeals,which we consolidated at the parties request

ii.defendants burden 
plaintiffs contend defendants did not meet their threshold summary judgment burdens to establish they were not the manufacturer or distributor of the subject side stand.emphasizing we must strictly construe defendants evidence for purposes of summary judgment,they advance two reasons why their showings assertedly fail.first,plaintiffs argue defendants experts did not show sufficient dissimilarity between the subject side stand and the examples manufactured by tolemar in that the results of the materials testing showed the metallurgical and chemical differences between the subject side stand and the examples were minimal or nonexistent.second,plaintiffs maintain defendants did not establish that the examples their experts tested against the subject side stand were tolemar model that none of defendants experts specifically stated in their declarations that examples c,d,e,or were that particular model,and the ambiguity as to which side stands the experts were testing requires denial of summary judgment.
tolemar responds in part that plaintiffs misstate a product liability defendant burden of proof as to identity or causation and that plaintiffs in any event did not make these arguments in the trial court,thus waiving such a challenge on appeal.white likewise argues plaintiffs have waived these contentions,having made them for the first time on appeal.
though this court is bound to determine whether defendants met their threshold summary judgment burden independently from the moving and opposing papers,we are not obliged to consider arguments or theories,including assertions as to deficiencies in defendants evidence,that were not advanced by plaintiffs in the trial court.generally,the rules relating to the scope of appellate review apply to appellate review of summary judgments.citation.an argument or theory will not be considered if it is raised for the first time on appeal.citation.specifically,in reviewing a summary judgment,the appellate court must consider only those facts before the trial court,disregarding any new allegations on appeal.citation.thus,possible theories that were not fully developed or factually presented to the trial court can not create a triable issue on appeal.american continental ins.c z timber d.a party is not permitted to change his position and adopt a new and different theory on appeal.to permit him to do so would not only be unfair to the trial court,but manifestly unjust to the opposing litigant.ernst searle cal.
we reject plaintiffs assertion in reply that their opposition papers specifically addressed how defendants did not meet their initial summary judgment burden.to support that assertion,they block cite the entirety of their opposition papers,failing to point out precisely where those arguments were made.our review of their opposition papers reveals that while plaintiffs generally addressed tolemar burden,they made no argument challenging tolemar evidence as they do on appeal.plaintiffs responded to tolemar contention that there was no triable issue as to the fact it did not design,manufacture,assemble,fabricate,test,inspect,manufacture,distribute,wholesale,ship or retail the subject side stand by arguing they plaintiffs had presented evidence that tolemar had manufactured and sold the subject side stand that plaintiffs evidence showed t he geometrical design,dimensions,metallurgic similarities,and manufacturing similarities positively conclude sic that the defective side stand is identical to the defendant product.plaintiffs made identical arguments in opposition to white motion,and also argued broadly that white separate statement improperly contained legal conclusions.
there is no suggestion in plaintiffs opposition papers before the trial court that tolemar or white had not met their initial summary judgment burdens because they had not established sufficient metallurgical or chemical differences,or that their experts did not state that examples b,c,d,or were in fact models.we agree principals of forfeiture and theory of the trial prevent plaintiffs from making these arguments for the first time on appeal.see saville sierra college th,d north coast business park nielsen construction th,d,disagreed with on other grounds in san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank,th,d richmond dart industries,d.
were we to consider plaintiffs arguments on the merits,however,we would reject them.first,we agree with tolemar that plaintiffs misstate defendants summary judgment burden.as a general rule,a plaintiff claiming to have been injured by a defective product must prove that the defendant product,or some instrumentality under the defendant control,caused his or her injury.see sindell abbott laboratories,supra,cal d at,garcia joseph vince,supra,d at,citing,footnotes omitted,regardless of the theory which liability is predicated upon,whether negligence,breach of warranty,strict liability in tort,or other grounds,it is obvious that to hold a producer,manufacturer,or seller liable for injury caused by a particular product,there must first be proof that the defendant produced,manufactured,sold,or was in some way responsible for the product d,products liability.plaintiffs do not seek to fall within any exception to that general rule they did not for example allege the subject side stand was a generic item produced by several manufacturers,as in a situation where a plaintiff might seek to rely on a theory of market share liability.see ferris gatke th,fn,d footnote,ante.in a market share situation,a plaintiff need only allege inability to identify the actual manufacturer and join as defendants those manufacturers that compose a substantial share of the market th e theory shifts the burden of proof to each manufacturer to prove its innocence a defendant can avoid liability only by proving that it did not produce the specific product that harmed the plaintiff.ferris,at,fn,d.
thus,tolemar and white initial summary judgment burden was met merely by present ing evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding it was more likely than not the material fact,tolemar had manufactured and white distributed the subject side stand was true.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d.or,defendants could establish an element of the claim can not be established,by presenting evidence the plaintiff does not possess and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.ibid.here,defendants met their threshold burden with evidence from ramelot,who expressly stated in his declaration that examples c,d and e were manufactured by tolemar,and experts sheybany and zamiski,who tested and inspected the subject side stand as well as examples c,d,e,and.based on differences in established or accepted tolerances,dimensions and manufacture that according to the experts could not have occurred with tolemar computerized manufacturing process,ramelot,sheybany and zamiski concluded the subject side stand was not manufactured by tolemar.
contrary to plaintiffs arguments,sheybany and zamiski did not look solely to metallurgic and chemical differences in the subject side stand and the examples known to be manufactured by tolemar rather,their opinions were based upon a threshold understanding of tolemar manufacturing practices as recited in ramelot declaration and their comparison of the geometric dimensions and measurements,welding and finish markings,and plating differences of the example side stands.nor was defendants showing deficient for any failure to demonstrate that the example side stands were tolemar model.in his declaration,ramelot plainly identifies the examples,which were referenced in attached photographic exhibits,as model side stands.white operation sales manager davie averred in his declaration that the was the only side stand white sold that remotely resembled the subject side stand.
in sum,defendants evidence was sufficient prima facie evidence that tolemar did not manufacture and white did not distribute the subject side aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,thus meeting their initial summary judgment burden and shifting the burden of producing controverting evidence to plaintiffs.
iii.plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether defendants manufactured or distributed the subject side stand 
in opposing summary judgment,plaintiffs sought to raise triable issues of fact that the subject side stand was one manufactured and distributed by defendants with evidence from experts carnan and leffe,who testified about similarities between the subject side stand and the example b side stand.however,neither expert testified about example b origins,and the trial court sustained defendants objections to plaintiffs opposing evidence as lacking in proof linking example b to defendants products.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend they raised triable issues of material fact pertaining to the chain of custody of example b by king declaration,which they assert contained enough facts to prove that exemplar b was the defendants product,and that the court erred in rejecting the entirety of king declaration in the face of defendants objections.plaintiffs acknowledge that some portions of king declaration as to her conversations with attorney hartwell might have been correctly ruled hearsay,however,they maintain her declaration nevertheless provides factual assertions establishing the handling of the side stand,the description of its packaging,the procedure of opening the package,the contents,and what actions were taken by her after she opened the package.relying on newport city of los angeles d.for the proposition that in viewing a summary judgment declaration the court must look not only to its contents but also to documents it incorporates,they argue king declaration coupled with example b unopened,packaging and instruction sheet,established example b was a product manufactured by tolemar and distributed by white.
we review the trial court evidentiary rulings on summary judgment for abuse of discretion.alexander group limited th,fn,d jackson county of los angeles th,fn,d.as the parties challenging the court decision,it is plaintiffs burden to establish such an abuse,which we will find only if the trial court order exceeds the bounds of reason.in re marriage of king th,d.where a trial court has discretionary power to decide an issue,an appellate court is not authorized to substitute its judgment of the correct result for the decision of the trial court.ibid.we will only interfere with the lower court judgment if appellant can show that under the evidence offered,no judge could reasonably have made the order that he did.smith smith d.plaintiffs showing will be insufficient if it presents a state of facts which simply affords an opportunity for a difference of opinion.in re marriage of king,at,d.as we explain,we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining defendants hearsay objections to king declaration,which was the sole evidence by which plaintiffs sought to establish that example only side stand plaintiffs experts inspected,tested and compared to the subject side tolemar product.
hearsay evidence is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated,subd.a.generally,hearsay evidence is inadmissible unless the law provides an exception for its admission,subd.b.double hearsay is admissible if each level falls within an exception to the hearsay rule.people zapien cal th,d.statements that are not offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted do not constitute hearsay.
as stated,plaintiffs make no serious argument challenging the trial court hearsay ruling as to attorney king declaration recapping her conversations with custom chrome attorney hartwell and his statements about the manufacturer and distributor of the side stand identified as example those statements by king are plainly hearsay to the extent they are offered to prove the truth of hartwell statements.that is not the case with king statements describing how she handled the package and the fact it appeared unopened and sealed those are statements within her personal knowledge.however,king went on to state that example b was identified by the label burly brands across the top of the packaging and i nside the package was an instruction sheet for proper mounting of the side stand.she continued on this sheet,the side stand indicated sic that it was a white brothers product,part.appended to king declaration was a paper in part reading burly brand white brothers softail low bro side stand installation instructions part.thus,through king declaration,plaintiffs sought to use the package label and enclosed sheet to prove that the content of the a tolemar side stand distributed by white.the question at hand is whether the product package and enclosed instruction sheet constitute inadmissible hearsay if offered in this manner.
we answer the question in the affirmative.both defendants specifically objected to the statements of attorney king on hearsay grounds the package labeling reading burly brands as well as the instruction sheet in this case constitute hearsay because they are extrajudicial assertions offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,namely,that the box contained a burly brands model product.accord,in re michael th,d information on label relative to ingredients of spray can was hearsay,but properly admitted under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule under the compilation exception of evidence code section.when offered for this purpose,the written information on the package and instruction sheet and any reading of that information is inadmissible.king declaration purporting to recite this written information is inadmissible double hearsay.
plaintiffs did not argue in the trial court nor do they contend on appeal that king declaration on these points or the packaging should fall within a recognized hearsay exception we conclude the information on the packaging and sheet was hearsay not shown to fall within any possible hearsay exception,and thus the court properly excluded king declaration as to those matters.
none of plaintiffs contentions convince us to reach a different result.plaintiffs maintain that king declaration contains factual assertions but that argument ignores the hearsay nature of her recitation of example b packaging and its contents,and the hearsay nature of the packaging and instruction sheet themselves.nor does plaintiffs reliance on newport city of los angeles,supra,d.assist them.in newport,the court held that triable issues of fact could be raised by documents in the record that have been incorporated by reference into a supporting affidavit.id.at.however,we have previously acknowledged that newport predated statutory amendments mandating a separate statement.north coast business park nielsen construction th,fn,d.thus,newport viability is questionable,but we in any event fail to see how its holding assists plaintiffs.there is no indication here the trial court ignored the documents appended to king declaration in fact,its evidentiary ruling encompassed the entirety of her declaration,which included the attached documents.further,assuming newport proposition has not been abrogated by later statutory amendments,as a general proposition,a court assessing the sufficiency of an affidavit provided in support or opposition to summary judgment is not prevented from considering evidentiary challenges to documents appended to the declaration.
plaintiffs further assert without any analysis or authority that exemplar b itself was sufficient to establish that it was the defendants product.we decline to consider this point absent reasoned explanation.guthrey state of california th,d rejecting plaintiff summary judgment arguments in brief that cited only general legal principles without relating them to any specific facts or admissible evidence paterno state of california th,d an appellate court is not required to examine undevel
