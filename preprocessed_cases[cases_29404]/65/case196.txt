in this forum non conveniens case,we first consider whether the cap imposed by mexican law on the recovery of tort damages renders mexico an inadequate forum for resolving a tort suit by a mexican citizen against an american manufacturer and an american designer of an air bag.holding that its cap on an adequate alternative forum,we next consider whether the district court committed reversible error when it concluded that the private and public interest factors so strongly pointed to mexico that mexico,instead of texas,was the appropriate forum in which to try this case.finding no reversible error,we affirm the district court judgment dismissing this case on the ground of forum non conveniens.
in,while in houston,the plaintiff,jorge luis machuca gonzalez gonzalez saw several magazine and television advertisements for the chrysler lhs.the advertisements sparked his interest.so,gonzalez decided to visit a couple of houston car dealerships.convinced by these visits that the chrysler lhs was a high quality and safe car,gonzalez purchased a chrysler lhs upon returning to mexico.
on may,the wife of the plaintiff was involved in a collision with another moving vehicle while driving the chrysler lhs in atizapan de zaragoza,mexico.the accident triggered the air bag.the force of the air bag deployment instantaneously killed gonzalez son,pablo.
seeking redress,gonzalez brought suit in texas district court against chrysler,as the manufacturer of the automobile trw,and trw vehicle safety systems,as the designers of the front sensor for the air bag and morton international,as designer of the air bag module.gonzalez asserted claims based on products liability,negligence,gross negligence,and breach of warranty.as noted,gonzalez chose to file his suit in texas.texas,however,has a tenuous connection to the underlying dispute.neither the car nor the air bag module was designed or manufactured in texas.the accident took place in mexico,involved mexican citizens,and only mexican citizens witnessed the accident.moreover,gonzalez purchased the chrysler lhs in mexico although he shopped for the car in houston,texas.because of these factors,the district court granted the defendants identical motions for dismissal on the ground of forum non conveniens gonzalez now appeals.
the primary question we address today involves the threshold inquiry in the forum non conveniens analysis whether the limitation imposed by mexican law on the award of damages renders mexico an inadequate alternative forum for resolving a tort suit brought by a mexican citizen against a united states manufacturer.
we should note at the outset that we may reverse the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens only where there has been a clear abuse of discretion.baumgart fairchild aircraft,cir.
the forum non conveniens inquiry consists of four considerations.first,the district court must assess whether an alternative forum is available.see alpine view atlas copco ab,cir.an alternative forum is available if the entire case and all parties can come within the jurisdiction of that forum.in re air crash disaster near new orleans,on july,cir en banc,vacated on other grounds sub,pan am.world airways,lopez,d.second,the district court must decide if the alternative forum is adequate.see alpine view,at.an alternative forum is adequate if the parties will not be deprived of all remedies or treated unfairly,even though they may not enjoy the same benefits as they might receive in an american court.in re air crash,at internal citation omitted.
if the district court decides that an alternative forum is both available and adequate,it next must weigh various private interest factors.see baumgart,at.if consideration of these private interest factors counsels against dismissal,the district court moves to the fourth consideration in the analysis.at this stage,the district court must weigh numerous public interest factors.if these factors weigh in the moving party favor,the district court may dismiss the case.id.at.
the heart of this appeal is whether the alternative forum,mexico,is adequate 
the jurisprudential root of the adequacy requirement is the supreme court decision in piper aircraft reyno,d.the dispute in piper aircraft arose after several scottish citizens were killed in a plane crash in scotland.id.at.a representative for the decedents filed a wrongful death suit against two american aircraft manufacturers.id.at.the court noted that the plaintiff filed suit in the united states because laws regarding liability,capacity to sue,and damages are more favorable to her position than are those of scotland.id.the court further noted that scottish law does not recognize strict liability in tort.id.this fact,however,did not deter the court from reversing the third circuit.in so doing,the court held that a lthough the relatives of the decedent may not be able to rely on a strict liability theory,and although their potential damage award may be smaller,there is no danger that they will be deprived of any remedy or treated unfairly in scotland.id.at.thus,the court held that scotland provided an adequate alternative forum for resolving the dispute,even though its forum provided a significantly lesser remedy.in a footnote,however,justice marshall observed that on rare occasions this may not be true 
at the outset of any forum non conveniens inquiry,the court must determine whether there exists an alternative forum.ordinarily,this requirement will be satisfied when the defendant is amenable to process in the other jurisdiction.in rare circumstances,however,where the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory,the other forum may not be an adequate alternative,and the initial requirement may not be satisfied.thus,for example,dismissal would not be appropriate where the alternative forum does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.
id.at.emphasis added internal citation omitted.
citing the language from this footnote,gonzalez contends that a mexican forum would provide a clearly unsatisfactory remedy because mexican tort law does not provide for a strict liability theory of recovery for the manufacture or design of an unreasonably dangerous product and mexican law caps the maximum award for the loss of a child life at approximately days worth of wages at the mexican minimum wage rate.thus,according to gonzalez,mexico provides an inadequate alternative forum for this dispute.
gonzalez first contention may be quickly dismissed based on the explicit principle stated in piper aircraft.as noted,there the supreme court held that scotland failure to recognize strict liability did not render scotland an inadequate alternative forum.id.at.there is no basis to distinguish the absence of a strict products liability cause of action under mexican law from that of scotland piper aircraft therefore controls.accordingly,we hold that the failure of mexican law to allow for strict liability on the facts of this case does not render mexico an inadequate forum.
gonzalez second the damage cap renders the remedy available in a mexican forum clearly unsatisfactory is slightly more problematic.underlying this contention are two distinct arguments first,gonzalez argues that if he brings suit in mexico,the cap on damages will entitle him to a de minimis recovery clearly unsatisfactory award for the loss of a child.second,gonzalez argues that because of the damage cap,the cost of litigating this case in mexico will exceed the potential recovery.as a consequence,the lawsuit will never be brought in mexico.stated differently,the lawsuit is not economically viable in mexico.it follows,therefore,that mexico offers no forum much less an adequate forum through which gonzalez can or will seek redress.we address each argument in turn.
in addressing gonzalez first argument,we start from basic principles of comity.mexico,as a sovereign nation has made a deliberate choice in providing a specific remedy for this tort cause of action.in making this policy choice,the mexican government has resolved a among the competing objectives and costs of tort law,involving interests of victims,of consum
