rhonda hendrix alleges that her son,sustained traumatic brain injuries when a child restraint system manufactured by evenflo company,evenflo,malfunctioned during a minor traffic accident.hendrix further alleges that those brain injuries caused to develop autism spectrum disorder asd and a spinal cord defect known as syringomyelia.the district court excluded testimony from two of hendrix expert witnesses that the accident caused asd.the district court concluded that the methods used by hendrix experts were not sufficiently reliable under daubert merrell down pharmaceuticals.hendrix evenflo.the district court then granted partial summary judgment to evenflo on hendrix compensatory damages claim,determining that without the excluded testimony there was no reliable evidence to support hendrix theory that the accident caused asd.hendrix voluntarily dismissed,with prejudice,her remaining damages claims and filed a notice of appeal.
facts and procedural history 
the product at issue in this product liability case is the evenflo discovery model child restraint system the crs owned by hendrix.the crs,which was manufactured in december,consists of a plastic base that is secured to the vehicle seat by the safety belt and a padded plastic carrier.the carrier is either locked into the base or secured directly to the vehicle seat with a safety belt.the crs meets the requirements imposed by federal regulations.see.when used properly,the base is positioned in a rear seat with the carrier locked into the base so the child faces the rear of the vehicle.
on april,hendrix and her son,were involved in a minor traffic accident the accident while traveling at a speed of mph.hendrix claims that was properly strapped into the crs,and that the crs was located in the rear center position of her suv hendrix theory is that during the accident the seat dislodged from its base because it had been.a occurs when the mechanism that attaches the carrier to the base fails to properly latch even though the latch makes an audible click leading the person installing the seat to believe the seat is properly installed.hendrix argues that because of the the carrier separated from the base at impact and struck the console between the suv front seats.
it is undisputed that the carrier fractured during the accident.while it is also undisputed that suffered a injury as a result of the accident,the parties do dispute the severity of the injury and whether suffered brain damage.medical records reveal that he suffered,at the very least,a contusion on his forehead and bleeding in his brain.injuries do not appear to have caused immediate neurologic impairment,as exhibited no developmental problems at his,or.
nearly eighteen months after the accident,began to exhibit developmental problems.when occupational therapy failed to cause improvement,was referred to suhrbier,a pediatric neurologist.suhrbier administered a neurologic evaluation to address severe neurodevelopmental delay,impaired social interactions,and history of seizures.
approximately three years after the accident,suhrbier diagnosed with an asymptomatic spinal cord cyst.hendrix argues that the cyst is a syringomyelia,which can be caused by trauma but may not appear for several years following the causative trauma 
suhrbier diagnosed with asd in april,when was five years old.there is little information in the record regarding current impairments related to his asd diagnosis.a report filed in december by hendrix second medical expert,hoffman,describes as completely nonverbal,aggressive,lacking fine motor skills,and refusing or unable to use utensils,and as suffering from delayed,hyperactivity,constant motion,running away,and decreased response to pain.based on information provided by hendrix and his personal examinations of,hoffman concluded that has autism spectrum disorder,a behaviorally defined disorder with qualitatively impaired social interaction,qualitatively impaired communication not compensated by gesture,and restrictive repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior,interests and activities.evenflo medical expert,epstein,also examined and described impairments consistent with those described by hoffman.the experts all agree that,as a result of his asd,will never be gainfully employed.
on april,hendrix filed suit against evenflo both individually and on behalf of,claiming the defective crs caused to sustain injuries that ultimately led him to develop asd and syringomyelia.evenflo removed the case to the northern district of florida on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the parties then commenced discovery.
hendrix sought to introduce testimony by suhrbier and hoffman that the injuries sustained in the accident caused him to develop asd and syringomyelia.evenflo moved to exclude this testimony,citing as one basis for exclusion the fact that there is no scientifically reliable basis for the experts opinions,as required by daubert.
the district court assessed the admissibility of suhrbier testimony based on suhrbier deposition taken by evenflo in july,and suhrbier affidavit prepared on september.in his deposition,suhrbier stated that recognized causes of autism include genetic disorders,metabolic disorders,epileptic encephalopathies,structural injuries and malformations to the brain,as well as reasons that have not been fully elucidated.suhrbier also claimed that autism had been associated with severe head injury and stated his opinion that there was a high probability the accident had caused asd.when asked for scientific or medical literature relating autism spectrum disorders and trauma,however,suhrbier stated that he could not cite from memory any specific articles.
in his affidavit,suhrbier stated that his diagnosis of was based on 
personal examinations,interaction with and observations of,testing that i had performed on him,my review of some of his medical records,multiple interviews with his primary caregiver,my training,education and experience,my own base of knowledge and the utilization of the generally accepted medical methodology referred to as differential diagnosis.
suhrbier explained that d ifferential diagnosis,or differential etiology,is a standard scientific technique of identifying the cause of a medical problem by eliminating the likely causes until the most probable cause is isolated.suhrbier further stated that in performing his differential diagnosis,he determined that did not have the fragile x genetic disorder,the most common known cause of autism,and therefore concluded t his means,based on our current knowledge,that the cause of his autism is most likely not genetic in nature.in addition to the differential diagnosis method,suhrbier also stated that he sought a unifying mechanism to explain both asd and his syringomyelia.according to suhrbier,it was important and consistent with generally accepted methodologies within the field of the extent look for unifying theories of diagnosis in an effort to explain a presentation of symptoms.suhrbier stated that he was quite familiar with the concept that trauma is a recognized cause of autism and syringomyelia in very young patients.again,suhrbier provided no research or literature to support this statement.suhrbier stated i concluded that the most likely cause of autism and syringomyelia was the trauma that he sustained in that motor vehicle accident in april of.it was,and still is,my opinion that trauma was a substantial factor in causing the disabilities that is experiencing today.
hoffman first examined on march,approximately four years after the accident.the district court assessed the admissibility of hoffman testimony based on hoffman independent medical evaluation report prepared on december,a deposition taken by evenflo on january,and a supplemental report prepared on june.
in his independent report,hoffman stated 
has multiple neurodevelopmental impairments that will be handicapping lifelong.my medical opinion,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,is that medical conditions and neurodevelopmental impairments syringomyelia,autism,impaired adaptive behaviors are related and secondary to the closed head and central nervous system injury he sustained in the accident at age weeks.
in his supplemental report,hoffman presented ten points that he believes explain how the accident caused both asd and syringomyelia 
first,that the brain,including the cerebellum,is actively developing during the age that the injury occurred.second,that this active brain development particularly includes developing connections between the cerebellum and different regions of the cortex.third,that abnormalities in the cerebellum and in the connections between the cerebellum and the cortex,are strongly linked to autism.fourth,that the presence of syringohydromyelia presupposes abnormal cerebral spinal fluid pressure around the cerebellum at the site of the obex and foramen magnum.fifth,that neither syringohydromyelia nor borderline chiari i abnormalities were present when was age weeks and were certainly not present in utero when the target ultrasound was performed.sixth,that hydromyelia is almost always associated with hydrocephalus,which has never had,and zimmerman opinion that does have hydromyelia goes against the clinical records in this case and against the accepted knowledge about the difference between hyrdomyelia and syringomyelia.seventh,that the perinatal and neonatal intensive care literature does support the association between injury to the developing brain,including traumatic brain injury,and later occurrence of autism spectrum disorder.eighth,that did experience at age weeks enough head injury to cause,among other things,a forehead bruise,irritability,poor feeding,reduced opening of left eye,subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage,and soft tissue swelling in the parietooccipital region as well as likely hyperflexion neck injury.ninth,that taken together rather than in coincidental,idiopathic isolation the sequence of the injury to the brain,spinal cord,and surrounding tissues at that time then resulted in changes to csf flow in the cervical spinal cord and around the foramen magnum with subsequent development of syringohydromyelia and also related altered and impaired subsequent development of the cerebellum and cerebellar connections to the cerebral cortex resulting in autism spectrum disorder tenth,there is no evidence in the medical record of any specific genetic disorder as a cause for autism.
hoffman further stated that autism is not a result of chromosome abnormality nor of fragile x syndrome,nor of perinatal distress or insult,nor of neonatal illness.there is no sign or other indication of prenatal or perinatal insult or other apparent etiology for his autism.hoffman concluded autism is a direct result of the injuries he sustained to his head and developing brain during the motor vehicle accident.
in his deposition,hoffman stated that he has never been involved in any scientific studies on the causes of autism.when asked if he could cite any scientific research to support his opinion that traumatic brain injury or injury causes autism,hoffman responded 
i have pulled stuff for this report directly.i have thought about this before because i noted clinically,which is not what you are asking,that when i have done neonatal followup or seen children in followup from birth problems,as part of my clinical practice that have autistic features,wondering is there evidence in the literature linking brain injury or trauma to this.and so i have done some literature searches and there are reports,both animal models and persons showing this link i did include that in my report,so i could find you some of those.
if you ask what scientific basis,and what i was looking for was am i just coming up with this myself,or are there other people seeing this,too,and i reassured myself that other people are and it starting to show up in the literature.there is not,that i am aware of,like a major chapter or major article in the new england journal saying this is a primary cause.
prior to trial,the district court granted evenflo motion to exclude testimony by hendrix experts regarding the purported cause of asd.the court reasoned that the methods by which suhrbier and hoffman arrived at the conclusion that the accident caused asd were not sufficiently reliable under daubert.the district court also ruled that it would permit the expert testimony with regard to the cause of alleged syringomyelia.as a result of these rulings,the district court granted partial summary judgment to evenflo on hendrix compensatory damages claim for asd,while allowing hendrix compensatory damages claim for syringomyelia and her punitive damages claim to proceed to trial.instead of proceeding to trial on her remaining claims,hendrix chose to voluntarily dismiss with prejudice her remaining claims and file this appeal.

iii.discussion 
hendrix raises several issues on appeal.first,she argues that the district court erred in finding unreliable under daubert the experts testimony that the traumatic brain injury sustained in the accident caused him to develop asd.preliminary to this argument,hendrix objects to the district court focus on asd diagnosis,arguing that the court should instead have assessed the experts testimony as it pertains to individual neurologic impairments.second,hendrix argues that the district court erred in excluding a portion of the opinion of hendrix expert,gary whitman,relating to the lack of sufficient padding on the crs,thus eliminating one of hendrix theories of defective product.third,hendrix argues that the district court erred in denying her request for discovery on a recall of evenflo safety seats.
upon thorough review of the record and with the benefit of oral argument,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of hoffman and suhrbier based on the insufficient reliability of that testimony under daubert.because without the testimony of those two witnesses summary judgment was proper on hendrix compensatory damages claim for asd,and because hendrix voluntarily dismissed the remainder of her claims with prejudice,we do not reach the additional issues presented in this appeal 
characterizing neurologic impairments 
as a preliminary matter,we must address hendrix argument that the district court erred by asking whether the experts had established that traumatic brain injury could ever cause asd.hendrix argues that,instead,the district court should have determined whether traumatic brain injury could ever cause one or more of the individual neurologic deficits that led to asd diagnosis.as the experts in this case testified,asd is a disorder that is recognized and diagnosed based on its underlying impairments.the district court,however,did not discuss underlying neurologic deficits separately.instead,the court noted that a ccording to hendrix,suffers from asd and then went on to analyze the experts testimony in terms of that asd diagnosis generally.hendrix,at.
hendrix argues that the district court was required to assess the reliability of the expert testimony regarding causation of each of neurologic impairments.because asd is defined by its underlying deficits and behaviors,it might be difficult to isolate the deficits underlying asd diagnosis and determine whether traumatic brain injury could have caused each deficit individually.after a thorough review of the record,however,we conclude that the district court was not required to undertake that complicated task because hendrix herself failed to fairly present this issue to the district court.
hendrix experts both referred to individual deficits,but opined only that there was a causal link between traumatic brain injury and asd.neither expert described whether or how traumatic brain injury could cause individual deficits.for example,hoffman refers in passing to multiple neurodevelopmental impairments however,in describing his theory of how the accident contributed to injuries,hoffman stated the following 
abnormalities in the cerebellum,and in the connections between the cerebellum and the cortex,are strongly linked to autism 
the perinatal and neonatal intensive care literature does support the association between injury to the developing brain,including traumatic brain injury,and later occurrence of autism spectrum disorder 
the sequence of the injury to the brain,spinal cord,and surrounding tissues at that time then resulted in changes to csf flow in the cervical spinal cord and around the foramen magnum with impaired subsequent development of the cerebellum and cerebellar connections to the cerebral cortex resulting in autism spectrum disorder 
there is no evidence in the medical record of any specific genetic disorder as a cause for autism 
thus,hoffman applied his elaborate causation theory explicitly and unambiguously to asd diagnosis generally and not to impairments individually.
similarly,suhrbier notes underlying impairments but refers exclusively to asd and autism when discussing causation.suhrbier stated during his deposition that he had diagnosed with autism and that there is a high probability given the severe nature of injury and his subsequent development of other neurologic sequela,that the accident had caused asd.in his affidavit,suhrbier said he had diagnosed with a utism which is on the spectrum of a utistic s pectrum d isorder,and that we can reasonably conclude that it is more likely than not that suffered damage to his the posterior was,in turn,a substantial factor in causing his autism.suhrbier also stated that t rauma of various kinds is a known cause for autism as part of my treatment of,i concluded that the most likely cause of s autism was the trauma that he sustained in that motor vehicle accident in april of.
not only did hendrix two medical experts opine only about the cause of gp asd diagnosis taken as a whole,hendrix arguments to the district court also did not attempt to parse the causation issue with respect to any of gp individual impairments.accordingly,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in focusing on the issue which was fairly presented to,the reliability hoffman and suhrbier testimony that traumatic brain injury caused asd.moreover,in her initial brief before this court,hendrix did not argue that it was appropriate to focus on causation of neurologic impairments separately.therefore,we conclude that she has abandoned this argument on appeal.we now turn to the issue of whether the district court properly excluded testimony from hendrix experts that traumatic brain injury caused asd.
exclusion of expert testimony on causal link between traumatic brain injury and asd 
legal standards for admitting scientific evidence of causation 
hendrix seeks to admit expert testimony that the traumatic brain injury sustained in the accident caused his asd.because this is a diversity case,we apply florida substantive law regarding a plaintiff burden of proof on causation.mcleod am.motors,cir.under florida law,hendrix may recover damages upon showing that the trauma was a substantial factor causing asd.gross lyons,so d,hart stern,so d,dca.a purported cause is a substantial factor if it operates in combination with another cause,such as the negligent act of another or the plaintiff physical condition,to cause an injury.gross,so d at hart,so d at.
although the standards for finding causation are governed by florida law,we apply federal law to determine whether the expert testimony proffered to prove causation is sufficiently reliable to submit it to the jury.flury daimler chrysler,cir noting that in diversity cases,the federal rules of evidence govern the admissibility of evidence in federal court.the federal rules of evidence provide 
if scientific knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
unlike an ordinary witness an expert is permitted wide latitude to offer opinions,including those that are not based on firsthand knowledge or observation.daubert,at.at.t his relaxation of the usual requirement of firsthand knowledge is premised on an assumption that the expert opinion will have a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline.id.a trial court assessing the reliability of an expert evidence must therefore perform a gatekeeping function by conducting a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.id.at.at.we have offered district courts the following general guidance in determining whether to admit scientific evidence under daubert 
given time,information,and resources,courts may only admit the state of science as it is.courts are cautioned not to admit speculation,conjecture,or inference that can not be supported by sound scientific principles.the courtroom is not the place for scientific guesswork,even of the inspired sort.law lags science it does not lead it.
rider sandoz pharms,cir quoting rosen,cir.
this circuit requires trial courts acting as gatekeepers to engage in a rigorous inquiry assessing whether 
the expert is qualified to testify competently regarding the matters he intends to address the methodology by which the expert reaches his conclusions is sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated in daubert and the testimony assists the trier of fact,through the application of scientific,technical,or specialized expertise,to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.
united states frazier.the proponent of the expert testimony bears the burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the testimony satisfies each prong.see boca raton cmty,tenet health care,cir.here,the parties raise no issues regarding the first and third prongs.therefore,our analysis will focus on whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the expert testimony of hoffman and suhrbier upon finding that the testimony was not sufficiently reliable under daubert.
the daubert court described several factors trial judges may use to assess the reliability of proffered scientific testimony,including whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested,whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication,in the case of a particular scientific technique,the known or potential rate of error,and whether the theory or technique is generally accepted by the relevant scientific community.daubert,at.at see also rink,at discussing these factors in the context of assessing an expert particular scientific technique.this list,however,is not exhaustive,and district courts have substantial discretion in deciding how to test an expert reliability.rink,at.
in addition,the supreme court has noted that,in the context of this analysis,conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from one another.general joiner.although experts commonly extrapolate from existing data nothing in either daubert or the federal rules of evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.id.rather,the trial court is free to conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.id.
hendrix experts rely primarily on the differential etiology method to link traumatic brain injury to his asd diagnosis.differential etiology is a medical process of elimination whereby the possible causes of a condition are considered and ruled out,leaving only one cause remaining.see supra.hendrix argues that the experts opinions were reliable because differential etiology is a scientific method that has been accepted by many courts as a valid basis for expert testimony.see,best lowe home centers,cir mcclain,at clausen new carissa,cir.we have previously noted that,when applied under circumstances that ensure reliability,the differential etiology method can provide a valid basis for medical causation opinions.see mcclain,at.here,the reliability of the method must be judged by considering the reasonableness of applying the differential etiology approach to the facts of this case and the validity of the experts particular method of analyzing the data and drawing conclusions therefrom.see kumho tires,at.at t he specific issue before the court was not the reasonableness in general of a tire expert use of a visual and tactile inspection to determine whether overdeflection had caused the tire tread to separate from its carcass.rather,it was the reasonableness of using such an approach,along with carlson particular method of analyzing the data thereby obtained,to draw a conclusion regarding the particular matter to which the expert testimony was directly relevant.emphasis in original see also quiet tech.uk,cir.
a reliable differential etiology analysis is performed in two steps.first,the expert must compile a comprehensive list of hypotheses that might explain the set of salient clinical findings under consideration the issue at this point in the process is which of the competing causes are generally capable of causing the patient symptoms.mcclain,at quoting clausen new carissa,cir.second,the expert must eliminate all causes but one.see mccullock fuller,cir.
with regard to the first step,the district court must ensure that,for each possible cause the expert rules in at the first stage of the analysis,the expert opinion on general causation is derived from scientifically valid methodology.hollander sandoz pharm,cir quoting siharath sandoz pharms,d.this is because a fundamental assumption underlying differential etiology is that the final,suspected cause must actually be capable of causing the injury.mcclain,at.thus,the experts purported use of the differential etiology method will not overcome a fundamental failure to lay the scientific groundwork for the theory that traumatic brain injury can,in general,cause autism.see mcclain,at this approach,however,will not usually overcome the fundamental failure of laying a scientific groundwork for the general toxicity of the drug and that it can cause the harm a plaintiff suffered.
some specific principles arise in the context of establishing general causation in cases dealing with medical injuries.in mcclain,we distinguished cases in which the medical community generally recognizes that a certain chemical can cause the injury the plaintiff alleges from those in which the medical community has not reached such a consensus.at we stated that in the second category of cases,the district court must apply the daubert analysis not only to the expert methodology for figuring out whether the chemical caused the plaintiff specific injury,but also to the question of whether the drug or chemical can,in general,cause the harm plaintiff alleges.id.thus,the district court must assess the reliability of the expert opinion on general,as well as specific,causation.id.
hendrix does not contend that the medical community generally recognizes traumatic brain injury as a cause of autism.therefore,the district court was correct to apply the daubert analysis to the question of whether traumatic brain injury can,in general,cause autism we afford the district court substantial discretion to decide how to test the reliability of the general causation evidence presented by hoffman and suhrbier.rink,at.
in reviewing the district court reliability determination,we note that we have previously identified some of the scientifically valid methods for establishing general causation.for instance,we will admit expert opinions pursuant to daubert that are supported by epidemiological studies provided the expert explains how the findings of those studies may be reliably connected to the facts of the particular case.rider,at noting that,although they are not mandatory,epidemiological studies may be powerful evidence of causation see also,norris baxter healthcare,cir e pidemiology is the best evidence of general causation in a toxic tort case.an expert opinion will likely also survive daubert if the expert describes the physiological process,derived by the scientific method,by which a particular cause leads to the development of a given disease or syndrome.mcclain,at the underlying predicates of any medical testimony are that medical science understands the physiological process by which a particular disease or syndrome develops and knows what factors cause the process to occur.quoting black food lion,cir see also daubert,at.at noting that in order to qualify as scientific knowledge for the purposes of,an inference or assertion must be derived by the scientific method.
courts have also identified other methods that,when used alone,are unable to provide scientifically valid proof of general causation.for instance,in mcclain,we explained that the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy assumes causality from temporal sequence it is called a fallacy because it makes an assumption based on the false inference that a temporal relationship proves a causal relationship.mcclain,at.thus,a mere temporal relationship between an event and a patient disease or symptoms does not allow an expert to place that event on a list of possible causes of the disease or symptoms.case studies and clinical experience,used alone and not merely to bolster other evidence,are also insufficient to show general causation.see rider,at although a court may rely on anecdotal evidence such as case reports courts must consider that case reports are merely accounts of medical events.they reflect only reported data,not scientific methodology.internal citation omitted see also norris,at we can not allow the jury to speculate based on an expert opinion which relies only on clinical experience in the absence of showing a consistent,statistically significant association between breast implants and systemic disease.
in the second step of the differential etiology analysis,the expert must eliminate all causes but one.see mccullock,at.while the first step focuses on general causation,in the second step the expert applies the facts of the patient case to the list created in the first step in order to form an opinion about the actual cause of the patient symptoms,to determine specific causation.in clausen,the ninth circuit stated that an expert must provide reasons for rejecting alternative hypotheses using scientific methods and procedures and the elimination of those hypotheses must be founded on more than subjective beliefs or unsupported speculation.at internal quotation omitted.thus,a district court is justified in excluding evidence if an expert utterly fails to offer an explanation for why the proffered alternative cause was ruled out.id.quoting cooper smith nephew,cir.
with these principles in mind,we now review the district court determination that the experts testimony in this case was unreliable under daubert.
application of standards to hoffman testimony 
the district court determined that hoffman testimony regarding asd causation was insufficiently reliable under daubert to warrant admission of that testimony at trial.the district court identified errors in hoffman differential etiology analysis at both the rule in and rule out steps.specifically,the district court determined that hoffman fail ed to show how,by scientifically valid methodology,traumatic brain injury could ever be a possible cause of autism in anyone.hendrix,at.the court also found that hoffman failed to compile a comprehensive list of all possible causes of asd and accordingly that by failing to include all of the causes currently theorized in the medical literature in his comprehensive list of the possible causes of asd,hoffman failed to rule out all possible causes but one.hendrix,at.we agree with the district court that hoffman failed to rule in traumatic brain injury as a possible cause of asd.because our holding in that regard is a sufficient ground upon which the district court ruling may be affirmed,we need not address the district court decision that hoffman failed to rule out other known or plausible causes of asd.
hoffman sole support for his theory that,in general,traumatic brain injury can cause asd came from certain medical textbooks and epidemiological studies submitted by hoffman.the district court carefully considered all of the materials cited by hoffman and concluded that none of these works come close to providing useful evidence of a definitive causal link between traumatic head injuries and autistic disorders and none provide even marginal support for hoffman theory of a relationship between abnormal cerebral spinal fluid pressure and problems with cerebellum pressure,leading to autism.id.at.we have carefully and exhaustively reviewed the literature cited by hoffman and conclude that the district court conclusion with regard to each piece of literature was reasonable.we hold that the district court reasonably concluded that none of the literature supported the reliability of hoffman proffered physiological process,and that none of the literature supported hoffman opinion that a traumatic brain injury like gp could have caused or contributed to the development of asd.thus,we conclude that the district court was reasonable in determining that the literature overall does not provide the necessary support for hoffman opinions to render those opinions admissible under daubert.
rather than duplicating the district court persuasive analysis of the literature provided by hoffman,see hendrix at,we will focus on those pieces of literature emphasized by hendrix on appeal.at oral argument,hendrix counsel stated that the most compelling literature discussing the physiological process by which traumatic brain injury could cause autism is a chapter in a textbook edited by evenflo medical expert joel morgan.see gerry stefanatos wilson joe,autistic disorder,in textbook of clinical neuropsychology,joel morgan joseph ricker.we read this chapter carefully and failed to discern any suggestion that brain damage resulting from traumatic brain injury can cause autism spectrum disorders.we also saw no support for hoffman theory that abnormal cerebral spinal fluid pressure in the cerebellum could cause asd.the chapter states that certain learning and memory patterns found in autistic individuals have been interpreted as reflection of cerebellar pathology,but also notes that studies have shown that frontal lobe and basal ganglia are also involved in learning a memory,and that c onsequently,these findings could not rule out an explanation in terms of a dysfunction rather than anomalies of circuits.id.at.further on in the chapter,the authors discuss the role of the cerebellum in asd in general,and note that histological studies of the autistic brain have consistently implicated reduction of purkinje cells of the cerebellum.id.at.they do not,however,opine as to what might cause such a reduction of those cells.while these statements provide some support for the idea that the cerebellum is linked to autism in a very general sense,they offer no reliable support for hoffman theory that a traumatic brain injury like the one suffered could cause or contribute to the development of asd.we found no mention at all in the chapter of hoffman proposed physiological process involving abnormal cerebral spinal fluid pressure leading to asd.
notably,although the chapter catalogues the known etiological factors involved in asd,the section titled etiological considerations does not mention acquired trauma in the perinatal brain.id.at.the section discusses genetic factors at length,and then goes on to list extrinsic factors such as viruses the presence of other neurological conditions,such as epilepsy birthing complications teratogenic substances,such as cocaine and autoimmune factors.id.the section fails to mention traumatic brain injury,and the authors qualify even the factors they do list by noting that studies directed to examining etiologic factors in autism have suffered from limitations due to small sample sizes,inadequate specification of diagnostic categories,and significant heterogeneity of the autistic population.id.at.
hendrix counsel also noted as particularly persuasive an article titled late neurologic and cognitive sequelae of inflicted traumatic brain injury in infancy.barlow et,late neurologic and cognitive sequelae of inflicted traumatic brain injury in infancy,pediatrics.the article describes a variety of neurologic impairments,including many of the impairments from which suffers,found in children with inflicted traumatic brain injury,shaken baby syndrome.id.at.while hendrix criticizes the district court for discounting the article based on the distinction between inflicted and accidental traumatic brain injury,the article itself supports the notion that the two types of injuries are distinct.for instance,the article notes that mortality rates for infants with inflicted traumatic brain injury are greater than those for infants whose injuries were accidental.id.at.the article also its findings by pointing out the small sample size,the need for further study,and that the study lacked a control group.id.at.in fact,the authors mention that previous similar studies used children with an accidental traumatic brain injury as control subjects against which to compare those subjects with inflicted injuries.id.moreover,although one patient in the study developed autism spectrum disorder,the authors note that the asd patient may have had significant exposure to alcohol in utero.id.at.the district court identified these shortcomings and noted that significantly,nothing in the study purports to show or explain the physiological process by which brain injury produces autism.hendrix,at.the court therefore concluded that this study was insufficient to support hoffman assertion that the literature supports his theory of causation or even a general causal link between accidental traumatic brain injury and asd.we can not say that this determination was an abuse of discretion.
we found the most direct statement supporting the theory that traumatic brain injury can cause asd in a textbook submitted by hoffman that was not brought to our attention on appeal.that textbook states 
considerable precedent for deleterious effects of various perinatal insults on organizational events is provided by studies with experimental animals.initial studies of later cortical neuronal development in undamaged areas adjacent to ischemic cortical injury in human infants show dendritic aberrations that could contribute importantly to subsequent cognitive deficits and epilepsy.it is a clinical truism that some children affected by one or more perinatal insults may exhibit neurological sequalae that are more severe than might be predicted from the extent of injury recognized by the usual brain imaging or neuropathological techniques.
volpe,human brain development in neurology of the newborn at.in other words,this textbook provides some support for the idea that even minor injuries sustained by newborn brains can result in more severe neurologic impairments than one would expect from the initial extent of the injury.the textbook does not,however,link such injuries to asd,or provide any support for hoffman theory of asd causation involving abnormal cerebral spinal fluid pressure.
we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding,based on the literature hoffman himself provided,that there is no reliable support for hoffman assertion that perinatal and neonatal intensive care literature does support the association between injury to the developing brain,including traumatic brain injury,and later occurrence of autism spectrum disorder.because hoffman offers no other scientifically reliable basis for his opinion,his testimony is the type of speculation,conjecture,or inference that we have cautioned district courts not to admit.rider,at.
hendrix attempts to sidestep the deficiencies in the medical literature by focusing on hoffman experience and training.merely demonstrating that an expert has experience,however,does not automatically render every opinion and statement by that expert reliable.as an advisory committee note on federal rule of evidence states 
if the witness is relying solely or primarily on experience,then the witness must explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached,why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion,and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.the trial court gatekeeping function requires more than simply taking the expert word for it.
committee notes on amendment quoting daubert merrell dow,cir.taking the expert word for it is precisely what hendrix suggests the district court should have done in this case however,we have previously recognized that n othing in either daubert or the federal rules of evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.see mcclain,at quoting joiner,at.at.hoffman has not provided a reliable basis,derived by the scientific method,for concluding that traumatic brain injury can cause asd.we decline to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in failing to admit hoffman testimony based on his experience alone.
because the medical literature adduced by hendrix supports neither hoffman theory of causation involving abnormal cerebral spinal fluid pressure nor his ultimate opinion that a traumatic brain injury like gp can cause autism,and because hoffman offers no other scientifically reliable basis for his opinion we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that hendrix failed to establish general causation to support hoffman opinion.that is,hendrix has failed reliably to rule in traumatic brain injuries like gp as a plausible cause of autism.
because this is a sufficient basis on which to affirm the district court ruling excluding hoffman testimony,we need not address the district court decision that hoffman also failed to rule out other possible causes.the district court held 
hoffman claim that he ruled out genetics as a potential cause of gp asd based on gp normal fragile x tests ignores the possibility of other genetic conditions as a cause.given the plethora of genetic theories for autism,ruling out fragile x as a possible cause of gp asd far from eliminates all genetic causes of his asd,let alone the other multitude of factors that have been linked to autism or asd.
hendrix,at footnotes omitted.the medical literature indicates that there are a dizzying array of other factors that have been mentioned as possible causes,including as many as gene mutations that could play a role in the development of autism.see frank polleaux gean lauder,toward a developmental neurobiology of autism,mental retardation and dev.disabilities research.hoffman conceded in his deposition testimony that,unless one of the genetic chromosome anomalies that is known to cause autism is identified,medical science simply does not know what causes autism.obviously,in such a situation,the task of ruling out other plausible causes is extremely complex.in light of our decision that hoffman failed to reliably rule in his theory of asd causation,we need not in this case venture into the quagmire of attempting to define the parameters of a reliable process of ruling out other possible causes of autism.
application of standards to suhrbier testimony 
hendrix also objects to the district court exclusion of suhrbier testimony.suhrbier,treating physician,sought to testify as an expert witness under rule.in order to be admitted into evidence,suhrbier opinions must also be based on a scientifically reliable methodology under daubert.see united states henderson,cir.
suhrbier purported to both perform a differential etiology and to look for a unifying theory to explain asd and syringomyelia.like hoffman,he concluded that the most likely cause of autism and syringomyelia was the trauma that he sustained in that motor vehicle accident in april of.unlike hoffman,however,suhrbier did not even attempt to provide any evidence to support a general causal link between traumatic brain injury and asd.he presented no medical literature,described no relevant physiological process,and provided no other support for his conclusion that traumatic brain injury can cause autism.based on the daubert requirements for admitting expert testimony,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in determining that there was too great an analytical gap between suhrbier evidence and conclusions regarding asd diagnosis to submit those conclusions to the jury 
iv.conclusion 
under daubert,it is the unique role of the district court to determine whether an expert opinion is sufficiently reliable to allow it to be presented to a jury.here,the district court concluded that hendrix failed to present scientifically reliable evidence that traumatic brain injury can ever cause autism.thus,the district court excluded the experts theories because of a lack of reliable proof of general causation between the alleged injury and the purported cause of that injury upon thorough review of the record and with the benefit of oral argument,we conclude that the district court properly executed its gatekeeper function under daubert,and therefore the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the expert testimony.
we emphasize that we express no opinion regarding whether traumatic brain injury sustained in the perinatal or neonatal period can ever cause or contribute to later development of an autism spectrum disorder.rather,as we have previously stated the courtroom is not the place for scientific guesswork,even of the inspired sort.law lags science it does not lead it.rider,at quoting rosen,at.we emphasize also that our conclusion,and that of the district court,is based only on the evidence presented in this case.given the current state of scientific knowledge regarding the causes of autism spectrum disorders as it has been presented to us by the parties,we are unable to say that the district court abused its discretion in excluding this expert testimony.because without this testimony there is no genuine dispute of material fact regarding causation of asd,the district court grant of summary judgment on hendrix sole remaining claim was appropriate.
accordingly,the district court exclusion of expert testimony and grant of summary judgment are

in other words,hendrix second and third arguments relate solely to liability,and evenflo has no liability on hendrix claim for damages for asd.therefore,because hendrix asd claim is the sole claim remaining after hendrix dismissed all other claims,hendrix second and third arguments are moot.in other words,hendrix second and third arguments relate solely to liability,and evenflo has no liability on hendrix claim for damages for asd.therefore,because hendrix asd claim is the sole claim remaining after hendrix dismissed all other claims,hendrix second and third arguments are moot.

hendrix attempts to distinguish this case from mcclain on the grounds that ours is an ordinary trauma case whereas mcclain is a toxic tort case.although we are not dealing with a toxic tort,which is a civil wrong arising from exposure to a toxic substance,such as asbestos,radiation,or hazardous waste,black law dictionary ed,we are dealing with a medical injury allegedly arising from use of a defective product.in mcclain,as in our case,the court was required to analyze expert medical opinions regarding the cause of an injury thus,the relevant inquiry was similar.see mcclain,at holding that the district court erroneously admitted expert testimony that a supplement caused the plaintiff medical problems.because hendrix has provided no reason to distinguish between the causation evidence in mcclain and the instant case for the purposes of the daubert analysis,we conclude that the principles articulated in mcclain with regard to admitting expert medical testimony on the cause of an injury may properly guide our reliability inquiry on the causation issue.hendrix attempts to distinguish this case from mcclain on the grounds that ours is an ordinary trauma case whereas mcclain is a toxic tort case.although we are not dealing with a toxic tort,which is a civil wrong arising from exposure to a toxic substance,such as asbestos,radiation,or hazardous waste,black law dictionary ed,we are dealing with a medical injury allegedly arising from use of a defective product.in mcclain,as in our case,the court was required to analyze expert medical opinions regarding the cause of an injury thus,the relevant inquiry was similar.see mcclain,at holding that the district court erroneously admitted expert testimony that a supplement caused the plaintiff medical problems.because hendrix has provided no reason to distinguish between the causation evidence in mcclain and the instant case for the purposes of the daubert analysis,we conclude that the principles articulated in mcclain with regard to admitting expert medical testimony on the cause of an injury may properly guide our reliability inquiry on the causation issue.
hendrix argues that florida substantial factor test absolves her of establishing general causation between traumatic brain injury and autism.this argument appears to be based on a misunderstanding that the substantial factor test means that a substantial likelihood of causation is sufficient to impose liability.that is not the case.florida law substantial factor requirement is best understood to mean that hendrix could recover if a jury found that injuries were a partial or contributing cause of his asd.the district court did not exclude the expert testimony on the basis that it did not show that the injury was the only cause of asd rather,the district court found that there was no scientifically reliable evidence that such brain injuries,in general,could ever cause autism.even the substantial factor test requires the plaintiff to show a causal link based on reliable evidence between a purported cause and the alleged injury,as the district court required.gross,so d at.the district court failure to explicitly articulate florida causation standard was neither prejudicial nor an abuse of discretion.hendrix argues that florida substantial factor test absolves her of establishing general causation between traumatic brain injury and autism.this argument appears to be based on a misunderstanding that the substantial factor test means that a substantial likelihood of causation is sufficient to impose liability.that is not the case.florida law substantial factor requirement is best understood to mean that hendrix could recover if a jury found that injuries were a partial or contributing cause of his asd.the district court did not exclude the expert testimony on the basis that it did not show that the injury was the only cause of asd rather,the district court found that there was no scientifically reliable evidence that such brain injuries,in general,could ever cause autism.even the substantial factor test requires the plaintiff to show a causal link based on reliable evidence between a purported cause and the alleged injury,as the district court required.gross,so d at.the district court failure to explicitly articulate florida causation standard was neither prejudicial nor an abuse of discretion.
