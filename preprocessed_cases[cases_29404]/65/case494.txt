this is an appeal from final judgment after the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant and respondent ssw.the decedent in this wrongful death action,a california resident,died of mesothelioma,an cancer.the trial court granted summary judgment to ssw,a nebraska company,on two distinct grounds.first,the trial court found that,pursuant to the nebraska corporate survival statute,the decedent heirs are barred from suing ssw,because the company was dissolved in,over five years before it was brought into this lawsuit.second,the trial court found no triable issue of fact with respect to whether decedent had been exposed to an product manufactured,distributed or sold by ssw.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge both findings by the trial court and ask this court to reverse the judgment against them.for reasons discussed below,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
douglas robinson decedent died on november,at the age of from mesothelioma,a cancer linked to asbestos exposure.on november,decedent wife,carolyn robinson,and their three children,donna,aaron and paul robinson collectively,plaintiffs filed a complaint for wrongful death and survival,alleging that decedent death was caused by his occupational exposure to asbestos.the complaint,which was later amended,alleged in particular that decedent was harmed by boilers or boiler components manufactured,distributed or sold by nebraska boiler company,nebraska boiler.nebraska boiler,in turn,was a division of national dynamics corporation,which later became known as ssw,defendant or ssw.
decedent worked as a boiler tender and boiler repairman,first,in the united states navy from to and,second,at a fruit cannery in modesto owned by the signature fruit company,formerly known as tri valley growers tri valley from to and again from approximately to.at tri valley,the relevant work site for our purposes,decedent was in charge of maintenance,including all aspects of cleaning and repair,for all boilers housed at plant plant 
plant was just one of several plants located on the premises of tri valley in modesto.plant was constructed in with two brand new boilers.in,a third boiler was added and,by the early,there were four to five boilers housed within the plant.plant used these boilers to generate steam to,among other things,operate the fruit canning machinery.
in the early,tri valley purchased two boilers from nebraska boiler that were shipped to its modesto facility,one in and the other in.an ssw corporate representative acknowledged that,during this time period,some nebraska boilers may have been equipped with manway gaskets manufactured by third parties purchase orders and shipping invoices reflect that at least some of the components on the two nebraska boilers shipped to tri valley in and contained asbestos.the boilers did not contain warning labels advising of the health risks associated with asbestos.
on june,ssw,of which nebraska boiler was a division,dissolved as a corporation,publishing the requisite notice of dissolution in a nebraska newspaper.over four years later,on november,this lawsuit was filed in california court naming several defendants,but not ssw,as well as several doe defendants.ssw was then added as a defendant in a doe amendment filed february,
on august,ssw moved for summary judgment on two grounds.first,ssw asserted that,as a dissolved nebraska company subject to nebraska corporate survival statute,it was immune from suit.second,ssw argued there was no evidence decedent had any contact with an product placed into the stream of commerce by nebraska boiler and,thus,no evidence that ssw caused his injuries.
plaintiffs responded that ssw was subject to california corporate survival statute rather than nebraska statute,and thus was not immune from suit.in addition,plaintiffs offered the deposition testimony of one of decedent former at tri valley,lindon brumley.according to brumley testimony,decedent did a variety of repair and maintenance work on the nebraska boilers at plant from,i think until the,which work included tasks such as removing and replacing gaskets and removing insulation.plaintiffs also relied upon purchase orders and shipping invoices produced in this case by tri valley to show that nebraska boiler shipped products to tri valley modesto in and.finally,plaintiffs presented the declaration of expert william longo,who opined that decedent would have been exposed to asbestos while performing tasks on the nebraska boilers such as removing old refractory cement from inside the boilers and removing and replacing gaskets on the manholes of the boilers.
after a contested hearing on ssw summary judgment motion,the trial court found that plaintiffs lawsuit was barred by nebraska corporate survival statute for dissolved corporations.in so ruling,the trial court rejected plaintiffs argument that california corporate survival statute,corporations code section,controlled in this case.rather,the trial court ruled that the nebraska corporate survival statute controlled,reasoning that corporations code section applies only to domestic corporations,not to foreign corporations like ssw.further,the trial court found that even if corporations code section applied,ssw would nonetheless be entitled to summary judgment because there was no triable issue of fact regarding decedent exposure to products attributable to ssw.as such,the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of ssw,prompting this timely appeal.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs raise the same arguments they raised before the trial court with respect to corporate survivorship and asbestos exposure.for reasons set forth below,we conclude the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the ground that ssw is immune from suit under the applicable corporate survival statute to wit,nebraska revised statutes section.as such,we need not reach the asbestos exposure issue.in explaining our conclusion,we begin by setting forth the relevant legal framework for appealing an order granting summary judgment.
summary judgment standards.
a defendant moving for summary judgment has met its burden to show a cause of action lacks merit if the defendant can show the plaintiff can not establish one or more elements of the cause of action.code of civ,subd.o.in such a case,the defendant bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.if the defendant carries the burden of production,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to make his or her own prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of fact.ibid.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.fn.omitted.ibid.mcgonnell kaiser gypsum th,d.
in reviewing an order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant,we independently examine the record to determine whether there exists any triable issue of material fact.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.thus,like the trial court,we consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as the losing parties.this review requires us to resolve any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in the plaintiffs favor.id.at,d,see also,subd.c.purely legal issues,of course,are always subject to de novo review on appeal.farm raised salmon cases cal th,fn,d.
with these standards in mind,we turn now to the record before us.
ii.is this lawsuit barred by nebraska corporate survival statute 
the first issue we must address is a purely legal one to wit,whether plaintiffs lawsuit is barred by nebraska corporate survival statute for dissolved corporations.for reasons that follow,we conclude it is so barred.
the relevant facts are straightforward.ssw was a nebraska corporation formed in to acquire nebraska boiler,the manufacturer of at least some of the boilers alleged to have contributed to decedent death in this case.ssw dissolved in june.as such,under nebraska law,ssw could only be sued as a corporate entity for injuries arising out of its predissolution activities within five years of its date of dissolution or,until june.this lawsuit,not amended to add ssw as a defendant until february,therefore missed the survivorship period permitted under nebraska law.
plaintiffs,however,contend nebraska law is not controlling here.they reason that,because ssw was licensed to do business in california and is being sued for injuries sustained in california,california corporate survival statute,corporations code section,governs instead of nebraska statute section,unlike the nebraska statute,imposes no time limitation on suing dissolved corporate entities for predissolution activities 
in deciding which party has the better argument on this issue,we first turn to section.under section,subdivision a,a corporation which is dissolved nevertheless continues to exist for the purpose of winding up its affairs,prosecuting and defending actions by or against it subdivision b is even more direct no action or proceeding to which a corporation is a party abates by the dissolution of the corporation or by reason of proceedings for winding up and dissolution thereof,subds.a,b.
california appellate courts disagree on whether section,or the law of the state of domicile,applies to a dissolved foreign corporation sued in california such as ssw.in fact,our own appellate district,the first district,has spoken twice on this issue,with different results.
in riley fitzgerald d.riley,the second district court of appeal considered the applicability of section to foreign corporations in a case brought by the shareholders of a dissolved texas corporation against a number of california parties.although the parties had previously stipulated texas law would apply,the court nonetheless held that,even if the parties had not so stipulated,it would apply texas law because section does not apply to foreign corporations.the court reasoned that a dissolved foreign corporation has no higher standing or greater capacity to maintain an action in california than it would in its state of incorporation.id.at.the court also found persuasive the fact that section expressly identifies which corporations code provisions apply to foreign corporations to the exclusion of the law of the jurisdiction in which they are incorporated.conspicuous by its absence is section.id.at.
shortly after riley,a majority of a panel in division three of this district decided north american asbestos superior court d.north american ii.like this case,north american ii involved a foreign corporation sued in california for injuries.applying a analysis,the court decided that california significant interest in having its law applied to a foreign corporation causing injury to a california resident while transacting business in california trumped the other state interest in protecting one of its corporations from extended litigation after dissolution.significantly,in finding a conflict between california law and the law of the state of the foreign corporation domicile,the court noted that the keys to interpreting section lie in article xii,section of the california constitution adopted in and the circumstances of its repeal in north american ii,supra,d at.article xii,section,which was in effect when the predecessor to section was adopted civil code former section,forbade any law that would allow a foreign corporation to transact business in california on terms more favorable than a domestic corporation.although this constitutional provision was later repealed,the record of its repeal indicates that it was a housekeeping measure with no substantive effect on california law.according to the north american ii court,these circumstances proved the term corporation in section was intended to mean foreign and domestic corporations because,to interpret it otherwise would violate the law embodied by article xii,section id.at.cal,art.xii.
finally,we simply note the existence of another first district decision recently depublished pending california supreme court review.in this case,the court disagreed with both the analysis and conclusion of north american ii as inconsistent with the relevant statutory language 
despite the uncertainty surrounding this area of law,particularly in light of our high court ongoing review of a recent first district decision,the matter at hand requires us to join our colleagues in considering the applicability of section to foreign corporations.in doing so,we first note our agreement with riley that the question before us is one of statutory interpretation.see oklahoma natural gas oklahoma.corporations exist for specific purposes,and only by legislative act,so that if the life of the corporation is to continue even only for litigating purposes it is necessary that there should be some statutory authority for the prolongation.more specifically,we believe the applicability of section to a dissolved foreign corporation like ssw hinges on whether the legislature intended the term corporation in section to include all corporations,or just domestic corporations.in answering this question,we turn first to the list of defined terms set forth in division one of the corporations code,which is referred to as the general corporation law and includes section,subd.a.in particular,section defines corporation as follows corporation,unless otherwise expressly provided,refers only to a corporation organized under this division or a corporation subject to this division under the provisions of subdivision a of section.thus,rather than provide a direct answer,the statutory language presents us with two unresolved issues.first,what is a corporation organized under this division,under division one of the corporations code and,second,what corporations are subject to this division under section,subdivision a.we address each of these issues in turn.
organized under division one.
neither section nor any other section of division one contains a statutory definition of the term organized,but it is a relatively familiar concept in corporate law.the ballentine law dictionary,for example,defines the term organization of corporation in relevant part as the process of forming and arranging into suitable disposition the parts of the body to be created and of defining the objects of such body a process completed when the first meeting has been called,the act of incorporation accepted,officers elected,and bylaws providing for future meetings adopted.the ballentine law,lexisnexis italics added.consistent with this definition,chapter two of division one,entitled organization and bylaws,contains a series of provisions relating to these exact corporate processes to wit,filing articles of incorporation,electing officers and adopting bylaws section,the first provision of chapter two,identifies the most fundamental step of corporate formation filing the articles of incorporation and thereby triggering the start of a corporation legal existence.this provision,which expressly mentions both domestic and foreign corporations,states as follows 
one or more natural persons or corporations,domestic or foreign,may form a corporation under this division by executing and filing articles of incorporation.the corporate existence begins upon the filing of the articles and continues perpetually,subd.a,c italics added.
the provisions following section address other basic steps in the corporate formation process.for example,there are specific requirements for forming certain types of corporations,including banks,trusts and insurance companies,which must obtain special certificates of approval.there are also provisions governing the information required or permitted to be set forth in the articles of incorporation.this information includes,among other things,the corporate name and general purpose,the amount and classes of stock the corporation is authorized to issue,and the names and addresses of the corporation initial directors and agent for service of process.other provisions in chapter two set forth the basic powers a corporation possesses in carrying out its business activities and describe the evidence required to prove a corporation ex
