metalclad subsequently produced a document showing that it had performed work at the decedent workplace.in response,the plaintiffs amended their discovery responses,citing to specific facts linking metalclad to the decedent exposure to asbestos.nevertheless,the trial court granted summary judgment for metalclad.the plaintiffs now argue that the defendant did not meet its burden of proof as the moving party on summary judgment,and that plaintiffs have raised triable issues of material fact.we agree and reverse.
factual and procedural background 
mark ganoe ganoe worked as a utility man in department at the goodyear tire rubber company plant in los angeles from until.in september,he was diagnosed with mesothelioma.three months later,he filed the underlying action alleging that the disease was caused by his exposure to asbestos from when he worked at the goodyear plant.ganoe died during the pendency of this action and the case was converted to a survival and wrongful death action.
on october,metalclad moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiffs had no evidence that ganoe was exposed to asbestos for which metalclad was responsible.specifically,metalclad argued that the plaintiffs had served factually devoid discovery responses and had failed to identify any witnesses that could show that ganoe worked with or around any products supplied,installed or removed by metalclad.
in support of the motion,metalclad submitted the following evidence the plaintiffs boilerplate response to metalclad special interrogatory seeking all facts regarding ganoe exposure to product s supplied,installed or removed by metalclad a case report in which the plaintiffs identified richard ettress,ganoe former,as their sole product identification witness for metalclad products and services an excerpt from ettress deposition testimony in which he said he had never heard of metalclad and a declaration from metalclad person most knowledgeable,don trueblood,in which he stated that metalclad has no information,documents to suggest,or knowledge of having ever performed any work or supplied materials to be used at good y ear tire rubber company plant.
on december,approximately two years into this litigation,metalclad produced a document at trueblood deposition showing that it had performed insulation work on steam piping at the goodyear plant in.trueblood explained that metalclad had not performed a search of its records in response to the plaintiffs discovery requests but had initially provided discovery responses based on a search performed in another case involving goodyear tire rubber that was a couple of years prior to this case no documents relating to goodyear were produced in that case,and this newly produced document was only discovered when a search was conducted for a third case,one unrelated to goodyear.
the plaintiffs then served an amended discovery response to metalclad interrogatory with the following facts ganoe worked in department at the goodyear plant between and,in approximately,a new banbury machine and lay down machine were added to department which required new steam pipes to be installed and insulated as well as tied into the existing insulated piping and machinery,the required removal of old insulation,ganoe was present in department during all phases of this construction,the removal of old insulation released in the air dust that ganoe breathed,outside contractors performed the installation and insulation work,a ccording to ettress,the only work involving insulation performed in at the goodyear plant was the work associated with the installation of the new banbury and machines and associated piping,and metalclad,an insulation contractor,performed insulation work on steam piping in at the goodyear plant.
on january,the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion for summary judgment and submitted as supporting evidence this amended discovery response,excerpts from the depositions of ettress,ganoe and trueblood,a declaration by an expert witness,and a declaration by ettress.in ganoe deposition,he testified that the steam lines that went into the banbury machine s had insulation on them that looked like dirty chalk,that he was present when the insulation on the steam lines was repaired,that repairing the insulation was a dusty process,and that he breathed in that dust.
in ettress declaration,he stated that he worked at the goodyear plant in los angeles from until i worked in the same department as mark ganoe during these years.on or about,a new automated banbury machine was added in our department and a new lay down machine was added that tied into the existing banbury machine.when this construction took place,new steam pipes had to be installed and insulated as well as tied into the existing insulated piping and machinery.outside contractors performed the installation and insulation work i do not recall any other construction requiring installation of insulation during the period of time that i worked at the goodyear plant.metalclad asserted evidentiary objections to the declaration on the grounds that certain statements lacked foundation,contradicted previous statements in ettress deposition,and were irrelevant.the court overruled these objections 
the expert witness,charles ay,opined that prior to a rigid,whitish,chalky,half round pipe covering was almost certainly,and that if the material was used for hot pipes in industrial settings,such as a tire manufacturing plant,then t he probability in such circumstances would exceed percent that the material contains asbestos.ay further stated that it is more likely than not that the insulators who performed the insulation work associated with the installation of the new banbury and machines at the goodyear plant in performed the work to the existing piping and machines which required removal of existing insulation that more likely than not was.
in reply,metalclad argued that it had satisfied its burden on summary judgment based on ettress testimony that he could not identify metalclad as ever having performed work near ganoe,and the plaintiffs original boilerplate responses to metalclad discovery requests.metalclad also argued that the plaintiffs had failed to raise a triable issue of fact through their amended discovery response because it was speculative to conclude that metalclad had performed any insulation work in department or that such insulation work involved the removal of old insulation.
the court granted summary judgment.the court found that the defendant had met its burden of proof,and the plaintiffs had failed to raise a triable issue of fact because the document belatedly produced by metalclad did not show that it had performed work in the vicinity of ganoe as it did not identify specific dates when,and locations within the plant where,the work occurred,ettress had testified he had no information regarding metalclad,although ettress stated that he saw outside contractors perform insulation work,he did not identify metalclad as one of those contractors,and ay conclusions were speculative as he was not a percipient witness to the event and had no personal knowledge as to whether metalclad worked in the vicinity of ganoe.the plaintiffs timely appealed.
contentions 
the plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in finding that metalclad had shifted the burden of proof,and the plaintiffs had not raised any triable issue of material fact.
