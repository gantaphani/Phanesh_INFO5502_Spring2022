plaintiff colgan air,colgan appeals the district court order granting summary judgment for defendant raytheon aircraft company raytheon on colgan claims of negligence,strict liability,and breach of express and implied warranties arising out of the crash of a beech aircraft registration no.aircraft that resulted in the death of the pilot and copilot.colgan alleged that several errors in the maintenance manual for the aircraft,which was created and published by raytheon,caused the fatal crash.in a published decision awarding summary judgment for raytheon,colgan air,raytheon aircraft,d,the district court held that the used airliner airplane warranty,executed by colgan as part of its lease of the aircraft,contained a waiver of right,which barred all of colgan claims against raytheon.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
colgan is a virginia corporation that operates a regional air carrier in virginia.as part of its business operation,colgan contracted to lease several aircraft from both raytheon aircraft credit corporation racc and raytheon airline aviation services,llc,raas.racc financed and leased to colgan the aircraft that is the subject of this matter.
raytheon,a kansas corporation,manufactured the aircraft and also created,edited,and published the maintenance manuals for the aircraft.raytheon is a separate and independent company from the lessors of the aircraft however,raytheon and racc are both subsidiaries of raytheon aircraft holdings.raas is a subsidiary of racc and otherwise has no direct relationship to raytheon.
colgan executed several documents throughout the process of leasing the aircraft,including the definitive agreement,lease agreement,and side letter agreement that incorporated and modified the used airliner airplane warranty.on august,colgan,raac,and raas entered into the definitive agreement,whereby the parties agreed to certain terms that would govern transactions among them as they related to the leasing of several aircraft.essentially,the definitive agreement was the broad contractual statement regarding how all the aircraft were going to be leased by colgan from racc and raas.among other general provisions that would govern the leasing of aircraft,the definitive agreement stated that raas would provide to colgan support items,which included a maintenance manual additionally,the definitive agreement provided that the aircraft were to be leased pursuant to the terms of a form lease,which was attached to the definitive agreement as appendix and entitled operating lease agreement between raytheon aircraft credit corporation and colgan air,lease agreement.colgan and racc signed the lease agreement for the aircraft on january,and the aircraft entered service with colgan the very next day.
the lease agreement specifically provided that racc was not the manufacturer of the aircraft,stated that it was providing the aircraft as is,and disclaimed all warranties and liability.the lease agreement further provided that colgan was under an obligation to maintain the aircraft in accordance with the manufacturer maintenance manuals and in compliance with all applicable federal aviation regulations.the lease also stated that any manufacturer warranty would be subject to a separate contractual agreement,called the used airliner airplane warranty.
on january,raas supplied the used airliner airplane warranty pursuant to a side letter agreement between raas and colgan,which provided that the terms of the used airliner airplane warranty were otherwise applicable to the lease transaction.raytheon was not a party to this side letter agreement,although raytheon was the issuer of the used airliner airplane warranty.the used airliner airplane warranty stated that raytheon warrants that each part of the aircraft,except avionics equipment and engines,were free from defects in materials,workmanship,or design for a period of thirty days.at.the side letter agreement between colgan and raas extended the manufacturer warranty for the aircraft from thirty days to ninety days.at.
the used airliner airplane warranty also contained a disclaimer of warranties and an exclusive remedy provision.specifically,the used airliner airplane warranty stated the following 
to the extent allowed by applicable law,buyer waives as to raytheon and seller all other warranties,whether of merchantability,fitness or otherwise.there are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.
to the extent allowed by applicable law,the obligations of raytheon set forth herein shall be the exclusive remedies for any breach of warranty hereunder,and,to the same extent neither raytheon nor seller shall be liable for any general,consequential or incidental damages,including,without limitation,any damages for diminution of market value,loss of use or loss of profits,or any damages to the aircraft claimed by buyer or any other person or entity upon the theories of negligence or strict liability in tort.
on august,the aircraft crashed off the coast of massachusetts shortly after takeoff,destroying the aircraft and killing the only two passengers onboard the pilot and.immediately prior to the accident,colgan mechanics had performed a maintenance procedure installing a new elevator trim tab cable.colgan maintenance crew performed the procedure using the maintenance manual for the aircraft,which was published by raytheon the parties agree that colgan maintenance personnel,referencing the maintenance manual then in effect,installed the trim tab cable such that the trim tabs operated in reverse.
the reps manual contained a section within chapter entitled flight and operation,which included the following language 
proper winding of the cables on the pedestal and actuator drums,is shown in the elevator tab control cable winding illustration in chapter for elevator tabs,ensures against crossing the cables and causing improper trim tab movement.
at.clicking on the underlined portion of the language above led to figure of chapter,which depicted the forward trim cable drum backwards,or degrees from the properly installed position,and shows the open,keyed side of the drum,instead of the flat side.colgan claimed that its maintenance crew followed the reps manual directions as depicted in figure,resulting in the reversal of the action of the elevator manual trim system.
colgan also asserted that the table of contents for chapter failed to contain a reference or hyperlink to an operational check that would have revealed the problem with the trim tabs.because colgan maintenance personnel did not locate or find the appropriate operational check,which was included in both the paper and reps versions of the manual,they proceeded to devise their own check.their check was not sufficient to disclose the problem with the aircraft elevator trim system.colgan contended that these two defects with the reps reverse drawing and the missing caused the aircraft to crash.these defects appeared in all relevant versions of the manual,both electronic and paper.
as a result of the maintenance procedure,when cockpit controls were used to set the trim tabs at a nose up position,the trim tabs actually moved to a nose down position.because the trim tabs operated in reverse,the aircraft was unable to gain altitude following and ultimately crashed.neither maintenance crew nor the pilots discovered the error prior to the fatal flight.
colgan filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia on the basis of diversity of citizenship,alleging state law claims against raytheon for breach of express and implied warranties,negligence,and strict liability.raytheon disputed all claims and also asserted that any defects in the manual did not proximately cause the accident.raytheon also defended on the basis that the maintenance manual was part of the aircraft such that the claims were barred by the disclaimer in the used airliner airplane warranty.following discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.
in granting summary judgment for raytheon,the district court did not rule on the cause of the accident,but proceeded upon the premise that the defects in the maintenance manual existed and were the proximate cause of the crash.after considering the used airliner airplane warranty,the district court concluded the manual was part of the aircraft and therefore governed by the terms of the used airliner airplane warranty.consequently,colgan had no warranty rights against raytheon except the limited warranty,which had expired by the time of the crash.the district court also ruled that,by entering into the used airliner airplane warranty,colgan had waived all claims based on negligence or strict liability in tort that it might have had against raytheon.the court noted that its determination that colgan alone bore the risk of loss for the aircraft from any cause whatsoever was consistent with all the documents accompanying the transaction,including those executed by raas and racc and where raytheon was not a party.
in an alternative ruling,the district court rejected colgan argument that the language within the manual rose to the level of an express warranty and also concluded that massachusetts law did not permit colgan claim for strict liability.for these reasons,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of raytheon on all claims,and colgan timely appealed.
our standard of review in this case is.we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment and view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.beverati smith,cir.because we sit in diversity in this case,we must apply the substantive law of the forum state including its choice of law rules.klaxon stentor.erie tompkins.
because this action was filed in virginia,we look to that state laws to determine which state laws govern colgan claims.virginia law looks favorably upon choice of law clauses in a contract,giving them full effect except in unusual circumstances,none of which exist here.see,hitachi credit america signet bank,cir.here,the used airliner airplane warranty included a choice of law clause designating the law of kansas.thus,kansas law is applicable to our analysis regarding the application of the used airliner airplane warranty.
under virginia law,the rule of lex loci delicti,or the law of the place of the wrong,applies to decisions in tort actions.milton iit research,cir katz odin,feldman pittleman,d,dreher budget.under the rule of lex loci delicti,massachusetts law,the situs of the crash,applies to the analysis of the claims for negligence,strict liability,and breach of express and implied warranties.
colgan first contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment for raytheon pursuant to the used airliner airplane warranty,which the district court concluded barred all of colgan claims.the gravamen of colgan argument on appeal is that the law does not support a ruling that the maintenance manual was part of the aircraft.according to colgan,this faulty conclusion by the district court resulted in error in the court ultimate ruling that the disclaimer and waiver of rights contained in the used airliner airplane warranty precluded colgan claims against raytheon for defects contained in the maintenance manual.we agree.
the district court ruled that the maintenance manual was part of the aircraft as a matter of law for several reasons other courts have concluded that a product,such as an aircraft,and its maintenance or other operational manuals are a single,integrated product,colgan air,d at citations omitted the federal aviation regulations support the conclusion that an aircraft maintenance manual is an integrated part of the aircraft and the fact that colgan may have purchased the maintenance manual in a separate transaction is immaterial to determining that a maintenance manual and an aircraft are a single product.we address each of these conclusions in turn and deem them erroneous.
colgan first argues that the district court erred in concluding that the maintenance manual and the aircraft were a single,integrated product because the maintenance manual,like a flight manual,is indispensable to maintain the aircraft airworthiness certificate without which the aircraft can not be flown or used.id.at.for these reasons,according to the district court,the maintenance manual was part of the aircraft such that the used airliner airplane warranty also applied to bar claims arising from the use of the maintenance manual.
in support of its ruling on an issue of first impression under kansas law,the district court looked to various jurisdictions for guidance and broadly applied cases where the courts have suggested that a flight manual,which federal aviation regulations require to be onboard an aircraft at all times,was not a separate product from the aircraft.see alexander beech aircraft,cir holding that replacement flight manual was not a separate product for purposes of the indiana products liability act and the statute of repose see also caldwell enstrom helicopter,cir holding that flight manual is part of a helicopter that does not restart the applicable statute of repose within the meaning of the general aviation revitalization act.
nearly all of the cases cited by the district court generally considered the issue of whether a supplement to a flight manual,which failed to include a warning regarding defects in the aircraft,constituted a continuing failure to warn and could restart the statute of repose for limitations purposes.the courts in those cases held that the duty to warn arose at the time of the transaction involving the sale of the aircraft,and the failure to add a warning in subsequent updates to the flight manual could not be used to circumvent the statute of repose.see schamel,cir affirming district court dismissal of action for failure to warn of defective condition in engine of aircraft as being barred by the statute of repose alexander,at rejecting plaintiff argument that operator was replacement part for purposes of statute of repose holding the instruction page was not a separate product so as to recommence the running of the statute of repose.
none of the cases relied on by the district court presented facts where the defect existed in the flight manual alone but was not present in the aircraft.had the defect existed solely in the flight manual,these cases might carry more weight in the case now before us.see driver burlington aviation,recognizing that a manual can constitute a separate product from an aircraft for purposes of statute of repose when the defect only exists in the manual the relevant product liability act permits such a suit and the manual was obtained in a separate transaction apart from and following the lease or purchase of the aircraft.similar to driver,colgan has only asserted claims arising out of the defect in the manual and has not made any allegation that the aircraft itself was defective.thus,although its central issue concerns the statute of repose,driver is more analogous to the case at so than schamel,alexander,and other cases cited in the district court order.nevertheless,the controlling issues in these cases concerned a duty to warn and the statute of issues not before us in this matter.
these cases are further inapplicable because,for purposes of analysis under these facts,a maintenance manual is not sufficiently similar to a flight manual.a flight manual is used by the pilot and is necessary to operate the aircraft,caldwell enstrom helicopter,cir,whereas a maintenance manual outline s procedures for the troubleshooting and repair of the aircraft for the mechanic.emory mcdonnell douglas,cir.moreover,federal aviation administration faa regulations require a flight manual to be onboard the aircraft.see.because a flight manual must be onboard the aircraft,we understand why a court may consider it to be part of the aircraft for statute of repose purposes.on the contrary,we are unaware of any federal regulation requiring a maintenance manual to be onboard the aircraft.a maintenance manual,unlike a flight manual,can be used on multiple albeit identical model aircraft,which signifies the possibility that a maintenance hangar or other similar facility may be the appropriate place to keep a maintenanc
