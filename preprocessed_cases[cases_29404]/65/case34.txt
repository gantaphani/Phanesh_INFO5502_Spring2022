appellants are the widow and two sons of luis figueroa serrano,a longtime heavy smoker who collapsed and died suddenly after several years of suffering from hypertension they brought this diversity action against appellee reynolds tobacco company,invoking puerto rico tort law and alleging that the cigarette manufacturer was responsible for figueroa serrano death.the district court granted summary judgment on most of appellants claims,allowing only the sons claims arising prior to july,to go to the jury.after the jury ruled in favor of the sons,the court granted judgment as a matter of law for reynolds,concluding that,based on the evidence at trial,the jury was compelled to find that the risks of cigarette smoking were commonly known during the relevant time period.on appeal,the sons challenge the judgment as a matter of law.all three appellants challenge the summary judgment ruling to the extent that it found all claims preempted by federal legislation.irene cruz vargas also challenges the court ruling that the statute of limitations barred her claims.we affirm both of the district court rulings on the basis of common knowledge,making it unnecessary to reach appellants other arguments.
background 
the following facts are undisputed.the decedent was a native spanish speaker with no written or verbal english proficiency.he seldom watched television and rarely,if ever,read newspapers or magazines.figueroa serrano was a longtime heavy smoker with a documented medical history of hypertension,including several hospitalizations occurring between and his death on october.at the request of the family,no autopsy was performed.
appellants filed this suit against reynolds in october of,alleging that decedent smoking was responsible for his hypertension,which in turn was a substantial factor in his death.appellants brought a series of negligence and strict liability claims under puerto rico law,including failure to warn and design defect.they furthermore argued that reynolds failed to comply with its duty,which they alleged to be implicit in federal regulation,to print spanish language warnings on cigarette packages sold in puerto rico.
the district court granted reynolds summary judgment on all of irene cruz vargas claims,finding them.cruz vargas reynolds tobacco,d.with respect to the sons claims,the district court granted reynolds motion for summary judgment on claims of defective design and the inherent dangerousness of tobacco and cigarettes.id.at.the court denied reynolds motion as to the claims arising prior to july,the date that the amendments to the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act went into effect id.at.the court found claims based on conduct after july,preempted by the labeling act.
the sons proceeded to a jury trial on their remaining claims.reynolds defended at trial primarily based on evidence that the risks of cigarette smoking were common knowledge prior to,and thus no duty to warn existed.a jury found in favor of both sons,awarding each damages in the amount of.the district court subsequently granted reynolds motion for judgment as a matter of law,under.a,finding that appellants failed to offer any evidence demonstrating that the ordinary consumer lacked knowledge of the health risks and addictive nature of smoking.the district court held that the jury was not entitled to reject the unimpeached,uncontradicted testimony of reynolds expert witness,who stated his opinion that the puerto rican public was aware of such hazards prior to july.
appellants allege the district court action was improper because the evidence presented by reynolds was susceptible to conflicting inferences.in addition,they contest summary judgment on two grounds first,that the court erred in determining that the claims accrued at the time appellants learned of figueroa serrano injuries,rather than on the actual date of his death second,that it further erred in refusing to find that the absence of warnings in spanish rendered the required warnings of the labeling act ineffectual.

evidence regarding common knowledge 
this case calls for us to evaluate application of the common knowledge doctrine in the context of tobacco litigation.the doctrine stems from the principle that a manufacturer can not be held liable under either strict liability or negligence for failure to warn of a danger commonly known to the public.see,guevara dorsey,div.of sandoz,cir the duty to warn in general is limited to hazards not commonly known to the relevant public.aponte rivera sears roebuck,offic.trans,a manufacturer need not warn of a hazard if the average consumer ordinarily has knowledge of the dangers of the product.
to state a claim for negligence under the law of puerto rico,a plaintiff must prove that defendant owed a duty to prevent the harm by conforming to a reasonable standard of conduct defendant breached that duty through a negligent act or omission and the negligent act or omission caused the plaintiff harm.tokio marine fire ins.grove,cir.see also.puerto rico has also adopted,by judicial act and with a slight modification,the strict liability principles embodied in section of the restatement second of torts.volvo car,cir clarifying that claimant in puerto rico must show the product was unsafe rather than unreasonably dangerous rivera santana superior packaging,noting that puerto rico has adopted common law products liability principles to fill a gap in our body of laws.
a products liability plaintiff alleging failure to warn must prove the manufacturer knew,or should have known of the risk inherent in the product there were no warnings or instructions,or those provided were inadequate the absence of warnings made the product inherently dangerous the absence of adequate warnings or instructions was the proximate cause of plaintiff injury.aponte rivera,offic.trans.at.under the common knowledge doctrine,however,a defendant neither breaches a duty nor causes the product to be inherently dangerous when the allegedly omitted warning concerns a danger of which the public is well aware.
in an ordinary case on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law,plaintiffs point to evidence suggesting a genuine dispute of a material fact.see anderson liberty lobby,d standard for judgment as a matter of law mirrors that of summary judgment,and thus to withstand a motion under either inquiry,the evidence must indicate sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury.in other cases in which common knowledge was at issue,plaintiffs have successfully defended against summary judgment motions by pointing to evidence suggesting such a genuine dispute.see,tompkin american brands,cir plaintiff expert reviewed periodicals,polls,and industry and government reports from the relevant time period,concluding that smokers were not adequately informed of the risks little brown williamson tobacco,d,plaintiff sample authorities,including journals,reports and polls,created a jury question regarding common knowledge.appellants here take a different approach,contending that they did not have a burden to produce any evidence at all.the crux of appellants entreaty on appeal is that neither the strict liability nor the negligence claim requires any affirmative showing,and thus the burden rested entirely on reynolds.whether or not this is a correct view of the law,after searching the record we have found no evidence which supports appellants allegations that th
