on august,a jury awarded donna cisson in compensatory damages on a design defect and failure to warn claim against bard,bard,and awarded an additional in punitive damages.the punitive damages award was split pursuant to a georgia statute,with percent going to the state of georgia and percent going to cisson.this was the first jury verdict arising from litigation involving more than cases against the proprietors of transvaginal mesh medical devices used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and other pelvic issues,of whom bard is one.
we address several issues on appeal.the first issue raised by bard is the district court refusal to admit evidence relating to bard compliance with the food and drug administration fda section k product safety process k process.second,bard challenges the denial of its motion in limine asking the district court to exclude evidence and argument pertaining to a material data safety sheet msds produced for polypropylene,a key material in the avaulta plus surgical mesh.bard argues that the msds relied on by cisson was hearsay outside any exception.third,bard appeals the district court jury instruction on causation,arguing that under controlling georgia law the court should have told jurors that causation must be demonstrated by expert testimony stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability.bard also argues that,as a matter of law,the evidence cisson presented to prove causation was insufficient to meet this more rigorous standard.bard final challenge on appeal is to the constitutionality of the punitive damages award,which it argues is excessive and in violation of the due process clause.in a,cisson argues that the district court committed constitutional error by failing to find that the georgia statute violates the takings clause.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court on all issues.
cisson was implanted with the avaulta plus,a transvaginal mesh medical device developed and marketed by bard,on may,to address pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.the surgery was performed by brian raybon,a physician who had provided input to bard during the development of the avaulta plus and who trained other physicians to use the device.prior to her procedure,cisson received warnings about a number of risks that could result from the surgical implant and signed a consent form acknowledging these warnings.three months after the surgery,cisson doctor diagnosed an adhesion band of scar tissue running across her vagina that was taut like a banjo string and was causing cisson pain.raybon resected the mesh,which involved cutting out a thick band of scar tissue and mesh encased in the tissue.three weeks after the resection surgery,cisson returned to raybon who said she was healing well and should return in a year.instead,a few months later,cisson went to a different doctor who referred her to john miklos.miklos explanted the avaulta plus from cisson body,although complete removal of the mesh was not possible.
complaining that the surgical mesh marketed by bard caused ongoing loss of sexual feeling and severe pain with intercourse and otherwise,cisson filed a lawsuit against bard in march in the northern district of georgia.bard already faced suits from other claimants dating back to,and the judicial panel for multidistrict litigation had begun transferring these cases to the southern district of west virginia in.in re avaulta pelvic support.prods.liab.cisson suit was added to these and would later become the first to reach a jury verdict.
on june,bard won summary judgment on cisson claims for negligent inspection,marketing,packaging and selling,manufacturing defect,and breach of warranty.the district court allowed claims for design defect,failure to warn,and loss of consortium to proceed to trial.during the trial,cisson focused both her design defect and failure to warn claims on several alleged dangers presented by the avaulta plus.expert witnesses were brought to testify that the design of the device arms,used to anchor the avaulta plus inside a patient body,resulted in ongoing pain to a patient as long as the device was implanted.experts also testified that the pores in the mesh component of the avaulta plus were too small and that the mesh was subject to shrinking after implantation,with the result being a rigid scar plate and increasing tension on internal tissue.cisson experts further testified that polypropylene,from which the monofilament used in the avaulta plus mesh was made,may be attacked by the patient body,causing inflammation of the tissue and degradation of the mesh.slides were presented to the jury that cisson expert,bernd klosterhalfen,testified showed the polypropylene of the avaulta plus in cisson body was being attacked,causing a scar plate to form.
beyond presenting evidence that the avaulta plus had caused her injuries,cisson also painted a picture of bard as ignoring,and at times hiding from others,the warning signs that its product could cause injuries.there was substantial argument regarding a msds bard received from phillips sumika polypropylene company phillips,the corporation that manufactured the polypropylene pellets used to extrude the avaulta plus mesh.the msds contained an explicit warning that polypropylene should not be used in short or human implantations.internal showed that bard executives knew about the msds,and that they sought to prevent their monofilament suppliers from learning of the warning.in addition to raising its hearsay objection to the msds,bard countered that polypropylene had been used for decades in clinical settings and that the warning was with respect to polypropylene pellets,not to the extruded monofilament used in the avaulta plus.
bard argued to the jury that its product was similar to the avaulta predecessor surgical mesh device that bard contended had been safely used for that it had taken appropriate steps to ensure biocompatibility and product safety.bard argued to the judge on evidentiary motions that it was unfair to allow cisson to attack its product safety while bard was prevented from presenting evidence that it complied with the fda k process.
the jury ultimately credited cisson evidence,awarding damages for the design defect and failure to warn claims.the jury returned a verdict for bard on the consortium claim.bard timely noted this appeal.
bard first claim on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion by granting cisson motion in limine asking the court to exclude all evidence that bard had complied with the fda k process.bard sought to admit the evidence to show that its conduct was reasonable.bard argued that this was relevant to its defense to the design defect claim under georgia product liability case law,as well as to the question of punitive damages.the district court excluded the evidence under federal rule of evidence for lack of relevance,and under rule for being substantially more prejudicial than probative.we affirm the court ruling based on rule and therefore need not address its reliance on rule 
although rule will generally favor admissibility,united states wells,cir,district courts are granted broad discretion to decide whether the probative value of evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,misleading the jury,or confusion of the issues,minter wells fargo bank,cir.e xcept under the most extraordinary of circumstances,where that discretion has been plainly abused,this court will not overturn a trial court rule decision.united states simpson,cir quoting united states heyward,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
cisson claim for design defect is controlled by georgia product liability law.georgia uses a test for product liability claims,requiring the trial court to evaluate design defectiveness under a test balancing the risks inherent in a product design against the utility of the product so designed.banks ici americas.this test includes some reliance on negligence principles,and incorporates the concept of reasonableness,whether the manufacturer acted reasonably in choosing a particular product design,given the probability and seriousness of the risk,the usefulness of the product in that condition,and the burden on the manufacturer to eliminate the risk.id.at.bard argues that compliance with the k process was important to its design defect defense because it shows that the company conduct was reasonable.
assuming without deciding that the k compliance evidence is relevant,under georgia test the probative value of that evidence must depend on the extent to which the regulatory framework safeguards consumer safety.the k process allows some medical devices to avoid the strict safety testing requirements imposed by the medical device amendments mda to the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,so long as the device is substantially equivalent to a pre device already in use at that time.see medtronic,lohr.thus,devices approved under the k process may be marketed without premarket approval as would be required by the mda,although they are subject to special controls that are necessary to provide adequate assurance of safety and effectiveness.talley danek,cir quoting a b.in this respect,although the process is certainly not a rubber stamp program for device approval,it does operate to exempt devices from rigorous safety review procedures.
while some courts have found evidence of compliance with the k equivalence procedure admissible in product liability cases,the clear weight of persuasive and controlling authority favors a finding that the k procedure is of little or no evidentiary value.the supreme court has regarded product clearance accomplished through the k process as a qualification for an exemption rather than a requirement.riegel medtronic.this is in part because the process impose s no requirements with respect to the design of the device.duvall bristol myers squibb,cir.thus,even though the fda may well examine k applications with a concern for the safety and effectiveness of the device,the agency clearance rests only on whether the device is substantially equivalent to one that existed before before allowing it to be marketed without running the gauntlet of the mda premarket approval process.lohr,u.at.
bard points out that much of this precedent stems from the supreme court decision in lohr,and argues that the case and its progeny should not be controlling here.bard argues that because lohr held only that state common law claims were not preempted by the mda and the k process,and not that compliance with the k process was inadmissible as evidence to refute such claims,it is an inapposite precedent.however,the supreme court held that state law product liability claims were not preempted because the k does not amount to a safety regulation requiring device producers to meet any established design standards.id.the entire analysis turned on the court finding that the k exemption process was intended to maintain the status quo with respect to the marketing of existing medical devices and their substantial equivalents,not impose new regulatory requirements on devices.id.at.numerous courts,including this one,have relied on that reasoning in cases over the past two decades,and at a minimum the supreme court statements about the k process repeated most recently in are very persuasive as to whether and how compliance speaks to the relative safety of a device.
nor is bard helped by fda statements claiming that the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination that is the heart of the k review process.guidance for industry and staff the k program evaluating substantial equivalence in premarket notifications.such statements merely show that the fda believes an equivalence determination is sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness,id.at,but this was also the case when the supreme court found the k process insufficiently with safety to preempt state tort actions,lohr,at,and again when the court called the process an exemption and not a safety requirement,riegel,at.bald assertions by the fda do little to alter the analysis of the basic question how much information does k clearance provide a jury about the safety of the underlying product,and is the value of this information substantially outweighed by the possibility of prejudice in a particular case 
turning,then,to the district court ruling,it is clear that the court did not abuse its discretion by excluding bard evidence of k clearance.in one of several related rulings,the court stated that bringing in such evidence would result in a about the strengths and weaknesses of the process and whether bard had in fact made all of the disclosures it should have made during the process.bard evidence would have initiated a battle of experts bard was prepared to characterize the review process as thorough and robust and the fda clearance of the avaulta plus as an affirmative safety decision based on specific safety and efficacy findings.ja.cisson was prepared to argue,as she has done before this court,that these characterizations wildly inflate the significance of the process,and that in any event bard failed to make necessary disclosures to the fda.
all of this,the district court reasoned,presented the very substantial dangers of misleading the jury and confusing the issues.ja.the court expressed concern that subjecting the jury to many hours,and possibly days,of complex testimony about regulatory compliance could lead jurors to erroneously conclude that regulatory compliance proved product safety.in other words,having a could easily inflate the perceived importance of compliance and distract the jury from the central question before bard design was unreasonable based on any dangers it posed versus the costs required to avoid them.while k clearance might,at least tangentially,say something about the safety of the cleared product,it does not say very much that is specific.the vast majority of courts have said so,and having been thoroughly briefed not only by the parties but by several amici,we say so again today.as such,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that allowing the k evidence in on the question of design defect would be substantially more prejudicial than probative.
bard also argues that evidence of k compliance would have been particularly relevant on the question of punitive damages.under georgia law,punitive damages are available where there is clear and convincing evidence of willful misconduct,malice,fraud,wantonness,oppression,or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences.ann.b.and georgia courts have noted that regulatory compliance does tend to show this high willfulness standard has not been met.barger garden way.
although the question remains one of federal,not state,evidentiary law,federal courts are not likely to disagree with the georgia courts that evidence regarding regulatory compliance or is often relevant to the willfulness inquiry.see restatement third of torts,prod.liab.nevertheless,bard argument is ultimately unpersuasive.while such evidence may be relevant,the compliance at issue in this case was,at most,minimally so.again,the k process has been repeatedly characterized as something less than a safety requirement,gaining the applicant an exemption from regulation rather than subjecting the applicant to regulation.riegel,at see also almy sebelius,cir rodriguez.stryker,cir the k process does not comment on safety.thus,the decision to pursue k clearance was a choice to minimize the burden of compliance,potentially cutting in favor of punitive damages.see anastasi wright med,finding that defendant chose the fda k process to avoid the safety reviews,including clinical trials,required for approval under fda regulations.as such,the district court is entitled to put k evidence before the jury,but it is not obligated to do so.the court was within its discretion to determine that the value of putting the controversy over the k process,and bard compliance or with that process,before the jury was substantially outweighed by the likelihood of confusing the issues and misleading the jury.
this court does not reach the district court ruling that the k evidence could be excluded as irrelevant under rule because the evidence was properly excluded under rule.the district court rule ruling implicitly indicates that even if the evidence is relevant,it is insufficiently relevant to warrant admission.we agree that the district court was within its discretion in denying admission of the evidence using the lower standard in rule,and therefore decline to address the more difficult question presented by the rule ruling.
the second issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it overruled bard hearsay objections to the admission of a msds pertaining to polypropylene,a material used in the construction of the avaulta plus implanted in cisson body.there is,of course,a presumption that hearsay will not be admitted into evidence in federal courts.the msds in question in this case read in pertinent part as follows 
medical application caution do not use this material in medical applications involving permanent implantation in the human body do not use this material in medical applications involving brief or temporary implantation in the human body or contact with internal body fluids or tissues,unless the material has been provided directly from phillips under an agreement which expressly acknowledges the contemplated use.
the district court accepted cisson argument that the msds could come in as for the limited purpose of showing that the statement was made and that bard was aware of it.the court also ruled,sua sponte,that the msds was admissible for its truth under the hearsay exceptions contained in federal rules of evidence,and.
we review the district court applications of the hearsay rules,like applications of all federal rules of evidence,for abuse of discretion,and its interpretations of such rules de novo.precision piping instruments,du pont de nemours co,cir.doing so,we reverse the district court rulings as to the hearsay exceptions.however,we affirm the decision to admit the evidence as,finding that any use of the evidence by the plaintiff that went beyond the limited purpose for which it was admitted as resulted in harmless error and was not prejudicial to bard defense 
rule,titled market reports and similar commercial publications,creates an exception to the prohibition on hearsay for market quotations,lists,directories,or other compilations that are generally relied on by the public or by persons in particular occupations.the district court ruled that the msds qualified as an other compilation within this exception.we disagree.
the district court ruling relied on its interpretation of the term other compilation in rule.a question of interpretation going to the scope of the rule is reviewed de novo.see precision piping,at.our analysis is guided by ejusdem generis,a statutory canon of interpretation holding that where a statute contains an exemplary list of objects to which it applies,a general term that follows specific ones will be limited in its meaning by the more specific terms that preceded it.circuit city stores,adams.the district court reliance on the general term other compilations concluding rule s exemplary list makes the canon applicable.
the narrower terms listed by the rule market quotations,lists,directories are items that recite established factual information.in general,a msds might contain similarly factual information.but in this case,cisson sought to use a portion of the msds that was not factual but rather operated as a warning and disclaimer of liability for the issuing party.the warning from phillips that polypropylene should not be used in human implants was an opinion the company issued within the msds for reasons,and it therefore bears no resemblance to the factual,documents enumerated in rule.
an advisory note to rule states that t he basis of trustworthiness for evidence admitted under the exception should be the motivation of the compiler to foster reliance by being accurate,advisory comm.note.disclaimers of the sort in the msds are not typically so motivated,being intended instead to prevent any use of a product that might create a liability.cisson has offered no proof or argument that the disclaimer warrants the same presumption of reliability afforded to market quotations and directories,and a disclaimer clearly lacks the hallmarks of reliability that make market reports an exception.the district court therefore erred in holding the msds admissible for its truth under rule.
rule,titled statements in learned treatises,periodicals,or pamphlets,creates an exception to the prohibition on hearsay when a statement in such publications is called to the attention of an expert witness on or relied on by the expert on direct examination the reliability of that statement is established by the expert admission or testimony,by another expert testimony,or by judicial notice and the statement is read into evidence rather than being received as an exhibit.the district court ruled,again sua sponte,that the msds could come in for the truth of the matter asserted as a pamphlet within the exception.again,we disagree.we review this application of rule for abuse of discretion.
the msds,as used in this case,does not meet any of the rule three facial requirements.first,it was not relied on by an expert on direct examination,nor was it called to the attention of an expert witness on cisson expert witnesses did not address the msds,and bard witnesses attacked the msds on direct examination.second,the publication was not established as a reliable authority for the same cisson witnesses did not address the msds and bard witnesses attacked it,no witness testifying at trial ever sought to demonstrate the reliability of the msds finally,cisson introduced the msds as an exhibit rather than having it read into evidence as required by the rule.therefore,without addressing whether the msds presented in this case could have qualified as a pamphlet,we find that the district court abused its discretion by admitting it under rule because the reliability of the evidence was not established according to the rule requirements.
rule,titled the residual exception,creates a hearsay exception for certain statements not covered by any exceptions in rule or.for a statement to come under this exception it must contain circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,be used to prove a material fact,and be more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence available through reasonable efforts.id.we review the district court application of the rule here for an abuse of discretion,noting however that the residual hearsay exception was meant to be invoked sparingly.heyward,at quotation marks omitted.
as discussed in more detail below,the msds was hardly the best evidence available that polypropylene was potentially dangerous for human implantation.the relative dangers of polypropylene in pellet and monofilament form was an issue that received substantial attention from both parties experts who themselves relied on studies,reports,empirical evidence,and tissue sample slides evidencing cisson particular pathology.the warning in the msds,on the other hand,was nothing more than an assertion made by the manufacturer of polypropylene that the product should not be implanted in humans.the msds made no attempt to explain why polypropylene might be dangerous or how phillips had come to this conclusion.because there was ample other evidence available to address polypropylene viability as a material for surgical implants,we find that the district court abused its discretion in finding,again sua sponte,that the msds could come in for its truth under rule.
having reviewed and reversed the district court several sua sponte rulings that the msds could come in for its truth under various hearsay exceptions,we now turn to cisson original rationale for offering the msds that it was not offered as hearsay.cisson argued,and the district court agreed,that the warning in the msds would not be hearsay if it was offered to show only that phillips made,and bard received,the warning statement.bard does not dispute this on appeal,but argues instead that cisson used the msds for its truth during the trial and that it was therefore offered as hearsay without an exception.having thoroughly reviewed the record we have found no reversible error,and we therefore affirm the district court admission of the msds.
statements constitute hearsay only when offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.anderson united states.a statement that would otherwise be hearsay may nevertheless be admissible if it is offered to prove something other than its truth,and this includes statements used to charge a party with knowledge of certain information.gardner,cir finding statements admissible to show defendants knowledge of the harm their product could inflict,provided only that the statements were brought to the attention of the defendants see united states macias farias,cir.w hether an assertion is hearsay depends on its use at trial.david binder,hearsay handbook ed.
cisson originally sought to introduce the msds to show that bard had received the warning from phillips,one of many red flags she argued demonstrated bard knowledge that its product might be unsafe.this was used to support cisson argument that the company should have further investigated the safety of the avaulta plus rather than marketing the product immediately.cisson insists that during the trial she did not rely on the msds to show that polypropylene was unsafe or to prove causation.bard argues,however,that h aving secured a ruling that the msds was admissible for its truth,plaintiffs took full advantage of the rulings by using the document to show that polypropylene was unsuitable for implantation and contributed to cisson injuries.appellant br.cisson position ultimately proves more convincing for two reasons.first,throughout the trial cisson consistently limited use of the msds to establishing that bard received the warning and then responded either by ignoring it or withholding it from other parties.second,even if cisson did at any time use the msds for its truth,she did so in a way that did not prejudice the defendant.
roger darois,bard vice president of research and advanced technology,was the key witness cisson used to establish that bard had received,and then ignored and withheld,the msds warning regarding human implantation.throughout that testimony,cisson attorney pressed darois on bard response to the warning,pointing out that the company did not reach out to phillips to clarify why the warning had been added to the msds in after decades of polypropylene production,bard supplier of monofilament refused to continue supplying processed polypropylene for medical applications after it learned of the msds warning,and darois told bard staff members to take steps that would prevent phillips from learning that bard was implanting medical devices made with polypropylene into human patients.
as bard pointed out in its appeal on the k issue,georgia product liability law incorporates reasonableness principles,ici americas,at,and the punitive damages standard in georgia requires a jury to find the defendant was willful and wanton in its disregard for the safety of others,ann.b.it seems clear that cisson used the msds,at least with regard to the darois testimony which again was the most significant exchange involving the msds,to show bard conduct was not only unreasonable but would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences.id.none of the questions to darois went to proving the actual truth of the msds warning,that is,the testimony did not address whether polypropylene was actually dangerous or could have caused cisson injuries.
bard argues that cisson relied on the msds as substantive evidence of causation not only during the darois testimony,but throughout the trial,claiming that plaintiffs counsel went so far as to tell the jury that it could find for plaintiffs based solely on the msds.appellant br.it is first worth noting that this assertion stands in stark contrast to bard characterization of the msds testimony in its closing argument at trial 
the msds sheet.think about it.go back to your notes.think about it.not a single witness for the plaintiff talked about the msds sheet.nobody.t heir experts,brennan and klosterhalfen and hoyte,they did talk about it.nobody linked it up.nobody linked this issue up.
ja.at that time,bard apparently felt that the msds simply had not been used in a way that could support causation,but on appeal it argues cisson ubiquitously abused the district court mistaken ruling that the msds could be used for its truth,causing an incurable prejudice to bard.at oral argument bard counsel called the msds the centerpiece of cisson case to the jury.oral argument.having reviewed a great deal of the more than pages of record before us not only the portions cited by bard to support its contentions,but many more pages of testimony,transcripts,exhibits,and rulings,we find bard characterization generally overwrought.we tend to agree instead with their earlier statements to the jury that cisson never sought to link the msds to the question of causation.
there is,however,one statement made by cisson counsel that has given us some pause.after bringing up the msds during closing arguments,cisson trial counsel said,now,the interesting thing about that is you can dismiss all the experts.you can say,well,this expert is biased and that expert is biased.but phillips sumika,they do have a dog in the hunt.ja.on its face,the statement appears to instruct the jury that the msds is more reliable than the experts and can therefore establish causation.but we need not decide whether the statement was an attempt to use the msds to overcome adverse expert testimony on the question of causation,because that single stray comment was not enough to prejudice bard and require a new trial.federal courts of appeal review the fairness of district court proceedings without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.mcdonough power,greenwood.to find the alleged error harmless,we need only be able to say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.united states heater,cir quoting united states nyman,cir.
the alleged error in this case was harmless for three reasons.first,bard has pointed to only one actually problematic statement from cisson counsel over the course of a ten day trial.although bard cites several parts of the record it claims show the msds being used for its truth,the only one that is at all convincing is the dismiss all the experts statement.for example,bard argues that the msds was used as substantive evidence of causation in cisson opening argument,citing ja.that portion of the transcript,however,shows cisson attorney explaining to jurors that the msds was produced by the polypropylene manufacturer,that it contained a warning that material should not be used in implants,that the msds and its warning was in bard possession,and that bard should have taken the warning seriously by verifying that the material was safe for its medical device.none of that goes to causation,and all of it supports cisson contention that the msds was being used to show bard was warned about potential dangers and acted irresponsibly in response to that warning.bard cites other parts of the opening argument,but these show cisson attorney referring to the msds,not as scientific proof that polypropylene is unsafe,but rather as a red flag and a safety alert that should have put bard on notice to investigate further.
bard also points to a portion of the darois testimony at ja and a related exhibit at ja,but the questions and answers on those pages demonstrate only that bard was attempting to keep phillips in the dark about polypropylene being used in the avaulta plus after phillips added the implantation warning to the msds in.again,this evidence tended to show that bard reaction to the warning was unreasonable,not that polypropylene caused cisson injuries.the msds simply was not being used for its truth.the same is true of all bard citations to the record on this point,with the exception of the one statement we have noted.the fact that there was only one such insta
