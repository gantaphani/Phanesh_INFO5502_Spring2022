this is an appeal from a defense verdict in two cases tried concurrently in coordinated litigation against novartis consumer health,the manufacturer of pharmaceutical products containing phenylpropanolamine ppa.appellants claim the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that compliance with government standards can not be considered as a basis for assessing the safety of a product in a design defect claim.they claim the court erroneously allowed respondent to present evidence which did not meet the admissibility standards established in people kelly cal d,to challenge the findings of an epidemiological study on the safety of ppa.they assert the court erred in allowing novartis to present evidence implying that the food and drug administration fda affirmatively approved the marketing of novartis ppa products while precluding appellants from utilizing contradicting evidence in their opening statement or their case in chief.they also claim error in other evidentiary rulings.we find no error and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural summary 
we begin with background on ppa,the pharmaceutical ingredient which is at the center of this action.novartis used ppa as the active ingredient for nasal decongestion in two cough and cold products,triaminicin and because the ingredient was in commercial use prior to,it was grandfathered into fda approval,subject to a monograph process for determining whether it was safe and effective.under the relevant federal law,monographed drugs could be legally marketed pending the fda final determination on their safety and efficacy.
in,the fda began the first stage in the monograph process for cough and cold products,including ppa.in january,the fda issued its first formal position on ppa as part of the second phase of its process,the tentative final monograph for nasal decongestant products.the fda did not categorize ppa as safe and effective,due to concerns that it elevated blood pressure.at the same time,the fda tentatively approved another decongestant,pseudoephedrine,as safe and effective.because of fda concerns about the safety of ppa,in a pharmaceutical industry trade association proposed to the fda that an epidemiological study be conducted.association members funded the study,which came to be known as the yale study,or hemorrhagic stroke project.
in august,the fda published its final rule for nasal decongestant products,the third phase of its monograph process.the fda issued final approval of pseudoephedrine as safe and effective,but deferred categorization of ppa,explaining b ecause of still unresolved safety issues concerning phenylpropanolamine preparations,the agency is deferring action on this drug therefore,phenylpropanolamine preparations will not be categorized or further discussed in this document.
the yale study results were submitted to the fda on may.on october,members of the nonprescription drugs advisory committee for the fda center for drug evaluation and research conducted a hearing on the safety of ppa in light of the yale study findings.the panel concluded that ppa was unsafe and recommended to the fda that ppa be removed from the market.
on november,the fda advised ppa manufacturers that it intended to initiate rulemaking to classify phenylpropanolamine as nonmonograph not generally recognized as safe and effective for use and that as an interim measure to protect the public health,you should voluntarily discontinue marketing any drug products containing phenylpropanolamine.ppa manufacturers,including novartis,immediately removed all products containing ppa from the market.on august,the fda published in the federal register its proposal to withdraw approval,in which it declared its intention to withdraw approval of all products containing ppa because of the association of phenylpropanolamine with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
appellants are two women who suffered strokes which they attribute to their use of novartis products containing ppa.linda lutz was years old when she suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage in may.she had used triaminicin,a novartis product which contained ppa.lutz is confined to a wheelchair due to paralysis of the left side of her body.pearl suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage in march,following her first use of,a novartis product containing ppa.she was years old at the time.
and lutz each filed suit against novartis.their actions were consolidated with all other ppa cases.after consolidation,a master complaint and master answer were drafted and adopted.the and lutz cases were selected for a consolidated trial.the cases went to the jury on three causes of action strict liability design defect strict liability failure to warn,and fraud by concealment.after a lengthy trial,the jury returned defense verdicts on all causes of action.this is a timely appeal from the judgment in favor of novartis.
discussion 
appellants assert prejudicial error resulted from the court admission of fda evidence and its failure to limit the jury use of that evidence with respect to the design defect claim.we begin with the claim of instructional error.
appellants assert the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that compliance with government standards can not be considered as a basis for assessing the safety of a product in a design defect claim.at different points during the trial,appellants submitted special instructions which explained that compliance with fda rules does not preclude liability for design defect.they asked that the court instruct fda standards and regulations are only minimal in nature and do not establish the standard of care for a reasonable manufacturing company under the circumstances of this case.it is not a defense to a claim that a product is defective that the manufacturer built the product in accordance with government standards or specifications.appellants also requested that the court give the following instruction even if a manufacturer of over the counter products literally complies with fda regulations,it is not immune from liability under the laws of the state of california for injuries caused by its products.
the court refused these instructions,and instead instructed fda action or inaction,though not dispositive,may be considered to show whether a product is safe or not safe.appellants claim this instruction failed to inform the jury that government standards were not relevant to the design defect claim.this is not an accurate statement of the law.
in ramirez plough,cal th,d,the plaintiff sued a drug manufacturer,alleging that he contracted reye syndrome as a result of ingesting joseph aspirin for children,manufactured by defendant.he asserted two theories for products liability failure to warn based on lack of a warning,and failure to withdraw the product from the market.as to the lack of a warning,defendant argued that the standard of care for packaging and labeling nonprescription drugs,including the necessity of including foreign language label or package warnings,has been appropriately fixed by the dense layer of state and federal statutes and regulations that control virtually all aspects of the marketing of its products.id.at,d.while noting that c ourts have generally not looked with favor upon the use of statutory compliance as a defense to tort liability,the supreme court acknowledged there is room for such a defense where the evidence shows only the ordinary situation contemplated by the statute or administrative rule.id.at,d.
after a lengthy review of the regulatory process governing the labeling of nonprescription drugs,the supreme court observed that state and federal legislative and administrative bodies,including the fda,are able and willing to define the circumstances under which foreign language communications should be mandated.ramirez plough,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the prudent course is to adopt for tort purposes the existing legislative and administrative standard of care on this issue.the feasibility and advisability of labeling for nonprescription drugs will,no doubt,be reviewed periodically by the fda and other concerned agencies.indeed,we are conscious that our decision here may prompt review by the california legislature.that is as it should be,for further study might persuade the legislature,the fda,or any other concerned agency to revise the controlling statutes and regulations for nonprescription drugs.id.at,d.
ramirez is known primarily for this holding as to labeling.but the court also rejected plaintiff alternative ground for product liability,that defendant should not have marketed the children aspirin at all because the risks of reye syndrome outweighed any benefit to be derived from the product,particularly in light of the availability of nonaspirin pain relievers.see barker lull engineering cal d.the court held,as a matter of law,that defendant may not be held liable for failing to withdraw its product from the market in early,when plaintiff mother purchased and used it.defendant did cease distribution of the product effective december.although devastating,reye syndrome was then and remains now a rare and poorly understood illness.a few scientific studies had shown an association between aspirin and reye syndrome,but the methodology of those studies had been questioned and the fda had determined that further studies were needed to confirm or disprove the association.pending completion of those studies,the fda concluded that product warnings were an adequate public safety measure.although the fda conclusion is not binding on us,we think it deserves serious consideration.plaintiff has submitted nothing that causes us to doubt the fda judgment in this matter that in early aspirin could be considered a reasonably safe product for administration to children,when distributed with appropriate warnings.ramirez plough,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court properly incorporated the essence of this holding when it instructed the jury that action or inaction,though not dispositive,may be considered to show whether a product is safe or not safe.
appellants disagree,relying on mclaughlin sikorsky aircraft d.in mclaughlin,two members of the military were injured when their navy helicopter crashed.they sued the manufacturer,which had built the helicopter to navy specifications,alleging strict liability based on defective design.before trial,the plaintiffs obtained a ruling that compliance with owner specifications is not a defense to claims of strict liability in tort.id.at.despite this ruling,and over plaintiffs objection,the manufacturer presented evidence that it had complied with military specifications in designing the aircraft.the mclaughlin court held it was error to allow the jury to consider the military specifications as even a factor in determining design defect.id.at.
in light of this damaging evidence,the mclaughlin plaintiffs proffered,and the court refused,the following instruction it is not a defense to a claim that a product is defective that the manufacturer built the product,in this case,the helicopter,in accordance with government standards or specifications.mclaughlin sikorsky aircraft,supra,d at.the court held this,too,was error had the court precluded all evidence of government specifications,plaintiffs proffered instruction may not have been warranted.however,because the court allowed evidence of military specifications on the issue of whether the aircraft was defective,plaintiffs instruction was essential to the jury understanding of strict product liability.ibid.defendant counsel had argued,in spite of the court in limine ruling,that defendant complied with navy specifications in designing the aircraft,and that this was a factor showing the product was not defective.the court held that without a proper instruction,the jury was given the erroneous impression that defendant following of government plans and specifications was evidence there was no defect in the product.ibid.
we find the holding in mclaughlin inapplicable because it is based on an entirely different factual scenario.the governmental the owner for whom the helicopters were being manufactured.it furnished the specifications to the defendant,a government contractor,to have the helicopters built according to its plans.the government was not acting as a regulatory body in providing helicopter specifications to the manufacturer.in contrast,the government agency in our case,the fda,is the regulatory body charged with protecting the public health by ensuring that drugs are safe and effective.b fda brown williamson tobacco,d.while the fda standards and decisions do not immunize a drug manufacturer from liability,they are nevertheless entitled to serious consideration on the issue of the safety of ppa at the time of appellants injuries.see ramirez plough,supra,cal th at,d.
appellants argue the court refusal to give their requested instructions on consideration of fda standards and actions with respect to their design defect claims was even more prejudicial because of instructions given on their other theory of strict liability,failure to warn the court instructed fda action or inaction,though not dispositive,may be considered to show whether a risk was known or reasonably scientifically knowable.mere compliance with regulations or directives as to warnings,such as those issued by the united states food and drug administration may not be sufficient to immunize the manufacturer of the drug from liability.the warnings required by such agencies may be only minimal in nature and when the manufacturer knows of,or has reason to know of,greater dangers not included in the warning,its duty to warn may not be fulfilled.
contrary to appellants claim,these instructions did no harm to their design defect claim.they highlighted the limited effect compliance with fda regulations has on a manufacturer duty to warn of known or knowable dangers.but they did not suggest that fda regulations set the standard for determining whether there was a design defect.
we find no instructional error.
appellants claim the court committed prejudicial error by permitting novartis to challenge the validity of the yale study with scientific evidence that did not meet the admissibility standards established in people kelly,supra,cal d.they argue that in asserting that some of the cases in the yale study were misclassified,novartis was improperly permitted to hack at the a cell by looking for errors only on the risk side of the the group of cases classified as exposed to than following proper methodology by reviewing both exposed and control cases 
people kelly sets out the standards in california for admission of expert testimony based upon the application of a new scientific technique the reliability of the method must be established,usually by expert testimony,and the witness furnishing such testimony must be properly qualified as an expert to give an opinion on the subject.citations.additionally,the proponent of the evidence must demonstrate that correct scientific procedures were used in the particular case.people kelly,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.
appellants argument is focused on the testimony of two of novartis experts,mark alberts and donald goldmann both experts testified about the proper methodology for a case control study,and described certain aspects of the yale study which in their opinion deviated from that methodology.among their concerns was the possibility that three of the cases were misclassified,which would have had a significant impact on the study results,given the very small number of cases in the subgroup upon which the study conclusions were based alberts testified that in one case,the records indicated the focal time for the stroke preceded the patient use of the product.goldmann testified that the reclassification of that case from unexposed to exposed during the course of the study was inconsistent with the proper conduct of a case control study.he and alberts both testified that under the protocol for the study,a second case should have been excluded because the patient had a preexisting history of transient ischemic attacks.in his opinion,the case should have been submitted to an impartial panel to decide whether to include it.there also was an issue about whether that patient had been exposed to ppa because she initially stated she had taken sudafed,not.the witnesses also testified that a third case was possibly misclassified.
the kelly rule tests the fundamental validity of a new scientific methodology,not the degree of professionalism with which it is applied.citation.careless testing affects the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility,and must be attacked on or by other expert testimony.people cooper cal d.novartis evidence that some cases in the yale study were misclassified was not based on new scientific methodology it was a challenge to the professionalism with which the methodology was applied.the kelly standards for admission of new scientific methods do not apply.we find no error in the court admission of this evidence.
we also find no undue prejudice from admission of this evidence.appellants were not taken by surprise by the testimony of these experts novartis timely disclosed its intent to rely on their experts opinions criticizing the yale study,including identification of specific cases that may have been misclassified.novartis also provided deposition designations of its experts,which included portions questioning the methodology used in the yale study.in response to appellants request to exclude this evidence under evidence code section,as unduly time consuming and highly prejudicial,the court found the evidence too probative to exclude,but gave appellants additional time so that they could adequately address the criticism of the yale study.
appellants subjected these experts to extensive about their critiques of the yale study.through their,appellants addressed each of the criticisms the experts had about the study,including the claim that cases were misclassified.for example,appellants inquired whether the experts had looked at all the cases in the controls,as well as the exposed cases.the experts admitted they had not.
in their,appellants presented testimony by one of the coauthors of the yale study,edward feldmann.he testified that the ppa manufacturers were involved in every aspect of the design,all along,in the decision to perform the study in aspects of the study design,certainly representatives of the pharmaceutical industry were at all the meetings and they watched us conduct the study as we did the entire thing.asked whether there was any oversight for the conduct of the study,feldmann explained that the fda watched the entire study being conducted,and there also was a group of scientists called the scientific advisory group that was responsible for supervising the conduct of the trial.the purpose of the advisory group was to oversee the trial to make sure that its design and execution were consistent with the goals of the trial and that it was proceeding as planned.feldmann explicitly addressed the bases on which stroke patients were included or excluded from the study not everybody that reported use of was included in the analysis because study made an effort to rigorously define the use of the drug and not count everybody who just mentioned and proved exposure to and so there are a number of both cases and controls who do appear in the analysis,despite the fact that they said that they used and that perhaps the timing of use,just did meet the definitions that we had to include them into the trial.
appellants were given a full opportunity to put before the jury the strength and legitimacy of the methodology used in the yale study and to rebut the defense experts criticisms of the study.there was neither error nor undue prejudice in the admission of this evidence.
appellants claim the trial court erroneously allowed novartis to present massive fda evidence while limiting appellants fda evidence and restricting their use of that evidence to and rebuttal.
it is apparent from the record that both sides in this litigation recognized the relevance of evidence of the fda review of ppa products they both sought introduction of fda evidence favorable to their position,and sought to exclude fda evidence that could be harmful.for example,appellants objected to novartis use of fda evidence to show that the fda allowed products containing ppa to be legally marketed and did not order them removed from the market until long after appellants suffered their strokes.but appellants relied on the fact that the fda deferred action on categorizing ppa cough and cold products as safe and effective,pending the results of the yale study.they relied heavily on the results of that study,and on the fda action in asking the manufacturers to withdraw ppa products from the market in light of the yale study.
the record demonstrates that the trial court carefully considered admission of each piece of fda evidence,whether proffered by appellants or novartis.there is no indication that,as appellants claim,the court gave novartis unfettered discretion about what fda evidence to introduce and argue.
nor do we find that appellants faced unfair limitations on their ability to present evidence.they were precluded from obtaining the testimony of any officer or employee of the fda by code of federal regulations part a,which provides no officer or employee of the food and drug administration shall give any testimony before any tribunal pertaining to any function of the food and drug administration or with respect to any information acquired in the discharge of his official duties.novartis also was limited by this regulation.as the court instructed the jury,the regulation does count against either side,that just your federal government and a rule that happens to be in effect.
appellants do not actually claim they were prevented from introducing fda evidence at all they argue that the court refused to allow them to refer to that evidence during opening statement or in their.we find no unreasonable restriction.
in opening,appellants counsel argued the fda evidence you hear is this,that this product was what they called grandfathered by the fda.it was on the market in the early,and it stayed on the stayed on the market and was grandfathered in.in other words,they got a free pass as to safety,and you hear evidence that the fda never tested ppa.counsel proceeded to give a timeline,explaining the fda never found ppa was safe.that the evidence in this case.and all they did.they kept deferring ruling,and you going to hear why they deferred ruling.you going to also hear evidence that that division was overworked according to the documents from novartis,the defendants documents,that they were overworked and understaffed,inexperienced,that division.but,remember,the fda is not on trial here.under california law novartis is the one that has the responsibility and the duty to provide safety of the drug that they make,that they label,that they market,sell and profit from.the fda does none of those things so under our law we believe novartis is liable.
counsel then described the history of ppa monograph study,including the increasing concerns of the fda and its deferral of action.counsel argued that political pressure was placed on the fda to back off from labeling ppa as unsafe.counsel described the mounting evidence of injury from ppa and the fda delay in acting on it pending results of the yale study.counsel argued that instead of accepting the study and taking the drug off the market,novartis hired experts to attack the yale results.you going to see them do that in this courtroom,try and undercut the yale results,but you going to hear from the yale people saying,no,this is a good study the fda says it a good study,and they pressured yale not to release the preliminary data to the fda.according to counsel,after a delay,the yale study was given to the fda.the fda committee concluded that the study showed an association between ppa use and increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke,and issued a withdrawal of approval.
another of appellants attorneys described the fda role in greater detail.he explained that fda regulations are only minimum standards.he reviewed the history of ppa and the fda monograph process for older drugs such as ppa.counsel displayed a chronology prepared by an fda staff member,and explained that the fda produced only some documents,withholding others under claim of privilege.he stat
