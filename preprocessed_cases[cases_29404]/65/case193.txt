for her design defect claim under the mississippi products liability act,ann.et mpla,michelle guy challenges judgment as a matter of law awarded crown equipment corporation,following guy case in chief.guy contends the district court reversibly erred by excluding guy intended expert witness before trial and by excluding certain evidence offered during guy examination of crown expert,called as an adverse witness.in addition,guy claims she presented sufficient evidence during her case in chief to avoid judgment as a matter of law against her mpla design defect claim.affirmed.
in,guy was injured at work in mississippi while operating an electric lift truck,model,unit forklift,which was manufactured by crown and was shipped to guy employer in.pursuant to the forklift design,the operator enters the operator compartment at the end opposite the forks and,to operate the forklift,stands facing sideways to the forks.in that operating position,the compartment opening is to the left the forks,to the right.except for the compartment opening,which is wide enough for a person to enter sideways,the operator compartment is enclosed by four walls.the forks apparatus raises inches,and there is an overhanging roof that protects the operator from above.when operating the forklift,the operator leans back against a padded back and hip rest,which wraps around the wall the operator leans against.
when injured,guy was operating the forklift in a forks following manner opening moving forward and forks behind the forklift hit metal railings on a warehouse floor.in that operating mode,the opening was moving toward the railings when the collision occurred.the forklift maximum speed is six miles per hour guy testified she was traveling at about when she hit the railings.the distance from the opening to the operator left foot is approximately six inches.the impact caused guy to lose her balance,and her left leg came out of the operator compartment through the opening.guy left leg was crushed between the forklift and the railings.
guy sued crown in mississippi state court for,inter alia,strict liability under the mpla,claiming the forklift was defectively designed and crown failed to warn of the danger of a injury.crown removed the action to federal court,based on diversity jurisdiction.the parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge.see c.
in support of her primary mpla claim,guy intended to present expert testimony through john lohman that the forklift was defectively designed because it lacked either an operator restraint similar to a seat belt or a door for the opening.crown moved in limine to exclude lohman as an expert witness,asserting his testimony was unreliable and,therefore,inadmissible under federal rule of evidence testimony by experts and the test provided by daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.the district court granted the motion,ruling,inter alia,that lohman had not presented any definitive theory,opinion,or mpla feasible design alternative discussed infra that could be tested to prove the dangerousness vel non of crown forklift.
at trial,guy presented only mpla claims for design defect and failure to warn.to do so,guy called as an adverse witness dan dunlap,crown manager of product engineering a crown employee since.dunlap testified that one reason the forklift was designed without an door was to make it easier for the operator to exit the forklift in accidents,where the forklift falls on its side,and in accidents,where the operator mistakenly drives the forklift off a loading dock.
during dunlap testimony,guy offered as evidence reports,obtained from crown through discovery,of prior accidents involving all models of crown forklifts.there were approximately reports,but only concerned injuries like guy.the district court excluded injury reports.
along this line,guy attempted to question dunlap about a survey showing employees preferred using forklifts with doors.had purchased crown forklifts,similar to the one on which guy was injured,but with such doors.the district court excluded these surveys.
following guy case in chief,crown moved for judgment as a matter of law,under fed.civ.a,contending guy did not present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to decide in her favor under the mpla on either the failure to warn or design defect claims.the motion was granted.
the mpla substantive provisions became effective on july and apply to all actions filed after that date.see ann.note clark brass eagle,so d.the injured party must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that,when the product left the manufacturer t he product was defective that defect rendered the product unreasonably dangerous and that condition proximately caused the injury.see ann.a.a defect that renders a product unreasonably dangerous can result from several situations.in general,the product deviated in a material way from the manufacturer specifications did not contain adequate warnings or instructions was designed in a defective manner or breached an express warranty.ann.a i.here,guy presents only a design defect claim.
for a design defect to render a product unreasonably dangerous,the injured party must show that,when the product left the manufacturer control the manufacturer knew,or should have known,about the danger that caused the injury t he product failed to function as expected and there existed a feasible design alternative that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm.ann.f emphasis added.a feasible design alternative is a design that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm without impairing the utility,usefulness,practicality or desirability of the product to users or consumers.ann.f ii emphasis added.

the district court ruled that guy expert witness,lohman,did not satisfy.and daubert.because a district court has broad discretion in deciding the admissibility vel non of expert testimony,we will not find error unless the ruling is manifestly erroneous.general electric joiner,d see also,watkins telsmith,cir eiland westinghouse electric,cir.manifest error is one that is plain and indisputable,and that amounts to a complete disregard of the controlling law.sonolux records,cir citing black law dictionary ed see also andreiu ashcroft,cir beezer,concurring lacombe,cir manifest error where district court employed wrong standard in excluding a witness bank one,texas,d,a manifest error is an obvious mistake or departure from the truth internal quotation omitted.
rule,amended in,provides that a witness qualified as an expert may testify in the form of an opinion if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.amended rule reflects the supreme court decisions in daubert and its progeny emphasizing the district courts broad latitude in weighing the reliability of expert testimony for admissibility,daubert,at.kumho tire carmichael,d.kumho tire clarified that the rule daubert analysis applies to all proposed expert testimony,including nonscientific technical analysis and other specialized knowledge.at.
it goes without saying that daubert clarified a district court function the court must ensure the expert uses reliable methods to reach his opinions and those opinions must be relevant to the facts of the case.the supreme court listed several factors to guide courts in their screening function whether the proposed evidence or theory can be and has been tested whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication whether it has been evaluated in the light of potential rate s of error and whether the theory has been accepted in the relevant scientific community.daubert,at.
the daubert factors remain relevant to the determination of the reliability of expert testimony under rule,as amended.see fed.evid.advisory committee note amendment.the amendments to rule also reflect the supreme court determination that the reliability analysis must remain flexible not every daubert factor will be applicable in every situation and a court has discretion to consider other factors it deems relevant.kumho tire,at.although the daubert analysis is applied to ensure expert witnesses have employed reliable principles and methods in reaching their conclusions,the test does not judge the expert conclusions themselves.daubert,at.
to assist in proving a design defect rendered the forklift unreasonably dangerous,lohman intended to opine that a feasible design alternative existed for the rr model forklift that could have prevented guy injuries.toward that end,lohman submitted a preliminary report on january,reconstructing guy accident and suggesting alternatives that could have prevented the injury was deposed on april submitted a supplemental report on may and was again deposed on june.trial was set for,and began,on august.on july,approximately a month before trial,the district court granted crown motion to exclude lohman testimony.
lohman january report opined the forklift was unreasonably dangerous because it did not have a mechanism to restrain the operator to the operator compartment and either an closure metal or textile door or an operator body restraint could have prevented guy injuries.that report,however,did not state which design alternative lohman preferred did not refer to specific designs crown could adopt as alternatives did not estimate the cost to crown of either design and did not state whether the design alternatives would satisfy the standard for a mpla feasible design they would impair the usefulness,utility desirability,or practicality of the forklift.
in his april deposition,lohman stated he preferred an operator restraint device,as opposed to a door,as a safer design for the forklift discussed the idea of a metal bar enclosure as another design alternative admitted he had neither designed nor tested any of his suggestions and stated that his sketch for a metal bar across the operator compartment opening was a conceptual drawing,rather than a precise design or prototype.
lohman may supplemental report again recommended an operator restraint device,similar to a seatbelt,as the most effective means of retention of an operator of this type of forklift.to illustrate examples of a possible operator restraining device,he attached from an internet site selling airline seatbelt expanders.he also stated crown design process for the forklift was inadequate because crown had not tested the feasibility of a restraint device.
that supplemental report discussed the economic feasibility of including a restraining device on the forklift and again suggested a door as a design alternative.concerning a door,lohman discussed,for the first time,doors already manufactured by crown for use by ford on their crown rr model forklifts as a feasible design alternative concluded doors must be safe and economically feasible because crown already manufactured them and stated,without further discussion,that a door would not impair the utility,usefulness,desirability,or practicality of the forklift.
in his second final deposition june,lohman reiterated his preference for restraining devices as a design alternative noted toyota manufactured a forklift equipped with a restraining device stated crown could use a similar design in its forklifts and stated that his research on this design alternative consisted of reading toyota website the day before being deposed.
neither crown nor the district court judge questioned lohman expert qualifications but,in an extremely detailed and opinion,the court decided lohman opinions about both the restraining device and the door were untested and unreliable and thus failed the daubert analysis.the district court disapproved of the approach lohman used to reach his purported conclusions,finding he relied on unscientific conceptual sketches and broad ideas.it also disapproved of lohman failure to test any of his designs.
the district court did not exclude lohman solely on his failure to test.the court also found as close to the august trial as his april deposition,lohman had not reached any concrete conclusions about the best design alternative although lohman professed to prefer a restraining system to a door,he never specified which design he planned to support at trial,and,therefore,defendants did not have sufficient opportunity,before trial,to prepare a reply to his proposed opinions and lohman presented conceptual suggestions,instead of specifically formulated opinions.the district court ruled that these deficiencies,coupled with the lack of testing,rendered lohman expert opinion unreliable.
in his reports and depositions,lohman consistently advocated a restraining device as a feasible design alternative but he never presented a specific design.although he eventually suggested crown could adopt a restraining device similar to toyota,he never submitted a complete end product.t he proper methodology for proposing alternative designs includes more than just conceptualizing possibilities.watkins,at.as guy conceded at oral argument here,the district court acted within its broad discretion when it decided lohman conceptual suggestions about a restraining device as a feasible design alternative did not rise to the level of an admissible expert opinion.
regarding crown having manufactured,tested,and sold forklifts with doors,guy contends lohman was qualified to examine crown tests and designs and testify about their feasibility,including safety lohman supported the door as a feasible design alternative and the district court abused its discretion when it did not consider lohman suggestion to adopt crown door design as a feasible design alternative.
the district court did not fail to consider lohman qualifications to review crown door design and tests.instead,the court noted that crown tests on a forklift with a door were only in or scenarios,not scenarios,as was guy.therefore,lohman had reviewed only tests that did not concern injuries.
the district court did not base its decision on lohman inability to test the door design.instead,its decision was based on lohman inability,so close to trial,to definitively offer a specific feasible design alternative.it was not until his may second report that lohman mentioned,as a feasible design alternative,the door already manufactured by crown for ford.even then,he used equivocal language,showing he had not closely studied this design.for example,although lohman estimated the cost of the door,he only concluded cursorily,in the language of the mpla,that the door would not impair the forklift utility,usefulness,practicality or desirability.the district court did not commit manifest error in ruling inadmissible lohman proposed testimony concerning a door as a feasible design alternative.
for guy case in chief,during the adverse witness testimony by crown expert,dunlap,guy offered in evidence reports produced by crown concerning accidents involving its forklifts.guy did so in the presence of the jury.
upon crown objecting,a bench conference was held.guy maintained all of the reports formed the basis for dunlap expert opinions.crown responded that the reports were inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant.the district court sustained crown objection in part,admitting only reports concerning injuries like the one guy suffered.in so doing,the court stated i do want theatrics in this courtroom.so let talk about what the facts really are,and let do be throwing box after box,with the jury thinking every single one of the accident reports is an accident just like guy.later,after additional testimony,the court ruled the accident reports were not relevant.
guy contends the district court abused its discretion when it refused to admit all of the reports,even though she admits on appeal some concerned slip and fall accidents.she asserts all of those reports,not just those concerning injuries,formed the basis of dunlap expert testimony that an door would have caused more harm than good.guy contends this reliance makes all the repor
