jean daniel roulier appeals from a judgment of dismissal based on forum non conveniens.he contends that switzerland is not a suitable alternative forum,and that the balance of private and public interest factors weighs in favor of retaining jurisdiction in california.while we agree with the trial court that switzerland is a suitable forum,in the context of the unusual procedural history of this case,we also conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its original holding that the balance of private and public factors favors trial in california.we therefore reverse the judgment entered by the trial court in compliance with the alternative writ issued by this court.
factual and procedural summary 
jean daniel roulier is a resident of switzerland in,on a visit to california,he purchased a cannondale bicycle from defendant two wheels one planet two wheels.on july,he was seriously injured in switzerland while riding the cannondale bicycle.
defendant cannondale designs and manufactures bicycles.it is incorporated in delaware,with its principal place of business in connecticut.its products are manufactured in pennsylvania and connecticut.two wheels is a dba for mulrooney.it is a retail bicycle shop located in artesia,california.
on december,plaintiff filed a complaint in the los angeles superior court alleging causes of action for strict product liability,negligent product liability,and breach of warranty.he named cannondale and two wheels as defendants he alleged that the bicycle contained design or manufacturing defects that caused his accident.plaintiff sought general damages,medical and related expenses,loss of earnings,property damage,consequential damages,interest and costs.
cannondale answered the complaint in february,including an affirmative defense that the action should be dismissed on the grounds of forum non conveniens.two wheels answered the complaint and filed a in march.it did not raise forum non conveniens as an affirmative defense.according to the docket,cannondale answered the and filed its own.two wheels answered the cannondale.
in march,cannondale propounded over form interrogatories to plaintiff.plaintiff responded to the interrogatories the following month.experts for the defendants examined the bicycle in.plaintiff made himself available for deposition in august,but counsel for cannondale was unavailable.plaintiff attempted to arrange for his deposition and a medical examination in the week prior to a mediation scheduled for november.plaintiff filed two motions to compel based on defendants failure to respond to form and special interrogatories.
in october,cannondale filed a motion to dismiss or stay the action on the grounds of forum non conveniens.two wheels attempt to join in the motion was denied as untimely.cannondale argued that plaintiff case should be tried in switzerland because it is a suitable alternative forum since cannondale had offered to stipulate to jurisdiction in that forum and to waive the statute of limitations.it also contended that the second prong of the test,the weighing of private and public interest factors,favored trial in switzerland.it noted that swiss law would apply even if the matter were tried in california.plaintiff opposed the motion and it was denied.
in its findings,the trial court concluded that switzerland is a suitable alternative forum.but it also found that cannondale had not met its burden of demonstrating that the action should be stayed or dismissed.the court recognized that the accident occurred in switzerland and that plaintiff received his medical treatment there.it held however,the site of the accident is collateral to the issues raised by products liability and breach of warranty actions.having the matter heard in california will ease the access to evidence regarding the design and manufacture of the subject bicycle,both of which took place in the united states.unlike in the stangvik shiley cal d,d,case,the action here involves a single injury due to an alleged manufacturing defect.allowing the case to go forward will not burden the california court system or otherwise offend the public interest.
cannondale filed a petition for writ of mandate cannondale superior court,nonpub.opin.we issued an order directing it to lodge the joinder filed by two wheels and any other documents relating to an offer by two wheels to submit to personal jurisdiction in switzerland and to waive all statute of limitations defenses.after these documents were lodged,plaintiff filed a reply in which he argued that two wheels joinder was untimely,and that two wheels had failed to stipulate to swiss jurisdiction and to waive the statute of limitations defenses.cannondale then lodged a declaration by michael mulrooney,president of the bicycle retailer business,stating that it would stipulate to swiss jurisdiction and would waive the statute of limitations defense.plaintiff objected to consideration of this declaration.
on march,we issued an alternative writ of mandate ordering the trial court to hear a motion by cannondale for reconsideration,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,of the order denying the forum non conveniens motion.we provided that the motion was to be heard if such motion is based on the new and different circumstance that two wheels one planet has stipulated to submit to personal jurisdiction in the courts of switzerland and will waive all statute of limitations defenses it might assert to an action by plaintiff in switzerland alternatively,we directed the trial court to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue.
in response,the trial court set a hearing on a motion for reconsideration.cannondale renewed its motion to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens.it argued there were new circumstances as required for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section,including the facts that cannondale insurer had accepted the tender of defense by two wheels,and that two wheels had stipulated to swiss jurisdiction and had waived any statute of limitations defense.
plaintiff opposed the motion to renew,arguing that the court properly exercised its discretion when it denied the original motion.he argued that the new facts relied upon by cannondale did not justify a different result because they related only to the first prong of the test for forum non jurisdiction was proper in the trial court had originally resolved in cannondale favor.he also contended that cannondale was dilatory in bringing the motion nearly one year after the complaint was filed,and after it had engaged in discovery.
the trial court once again held that switzerland was a suitable alternative forum,but that cannondale had not shown that the balance of public and private factors favored litigation in switzerland.
cannondale filed a second petition for writ of mandate in this court in june,which was opposed by plaintiff cannondale superior court june,nonpub.opin.we issued an alternative writ on july,requiring the trial court to vacate the order entered may,which denied petitioner motion for reconsideration of the november,order denying its forum non conveniens motion,and make a new and different order granting that motion and staying the action to permit plaintiff claim to be litigated in switzerland 
the trial court complied with the alternative writ,vacating its order denying the renewed motion and granting the motion to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens.the action was dismissed and judgment of dismissal was entered.plaintiff filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
in stangvik shiley,supra,cal d,d,stangvik,a leading case on forum non conveniens,the supreme court explained the rule is an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.citation.id.at,d.
the defendant has the burden of proof.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.the first step in the analysis is whether the alternative forum is a suitable place for trial.id.at,d.a forum is suitable if there is jurisdiction and no statute of limitations bar to hearing the case on the merits.citation.a forum is suitable where an action can be brought,although not necessarily won.citation.chong superior court th,d,quoting shiley superior court th,d.we review a determination of this issue de novo.american cemwood american home assurance th,d.
both cannondale and two wheels have stipulated to jurisdiction of the swiss courts and to waive any statute of limitations defense.despite these stipulations,plaintiff argues that switzerland is not a suitable forum because the defendants did not stipulate to the enforcement of the judgment as the defendants did in stangvik and campbell th,d.plaintiff asserts that neither defendant has assets in switzerland.
defendants point out that there is no support in the record for plaintiff assertion that they have no assets in switzerland.furthermore,the stangvik court did not make enforceability of the judgment in the forum state a requirement.instead,the court concluded the judicial council comment makes it clear that the question of a suitable alternative forum depends not on the factors relevant to the convenience of the parties and the interests of the public,but on whether an action may be commenced in the alternative jurisdiction and a valid judgment obtained there against the defendant.citation.stangvik,supra,cal d at,fn,d,italics added.similarly,the court of appeal in campbell,supra,th,d,did not make enforceability of the judgment in the alternative jurisdiction a requirement.rather,the parties stipulated to satisfaction of a judgment or settlement.campbell,supra,th at,d.
plaintiff may seek enforcement of a swiss judgment by filing an action in california under the uniform foreign money judgments recognition act code civ,et.ahart,cal.practice guide enforcing judgments and debts the rutter group et.
plaintiff also argues that switzerland is not an available forum because he might not have a meaningful remedy there.he cites article of the swiss federal international private law act article product liability.claims based on a defect in a product or in its description shall,at the choice of the injured party,be governed by a the law of the state in which the perpetrator or the defective act is established or,where there is no such establishment,where he has his habitual residence,or b the law of the state in which the product was acquired unless the perpetrator can prove that the product has been marketed in that state without his consent.if the claims based on a defect in a product or in its description are governed by foreign law,no compensation can be awarded in switzerland other than that which would have been granted for such a prejudice under swiss law.italics added.
plaintiff position is contrary to stangvik.the supreme court rejected the argument that less favorable law in the alternative jurisdiction is a basis for denying a motion based on forum non conveniens.it held in our view,the fact that an alternative jurisdiction law is less favorable to a litigant than the law of the forum should not be accorded any weight in deciding a motion for forum non conveniens provided,however,that some remedy is afforded.citation.stangvik,supra,cal d at,fn,d.
we are satisfied that switzerland is a suitable alternative forum.
we turn to the balance of private and public interest factors.once again,the stangvik court set out the relevant principles t he next step is to consider the private interests of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining the action for trial in california.the private interest factors are those that make trial and the enforceability of the ensuing judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive,such as the ease of access to sources of proof,the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses,and the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses.the public interest factors include avoidance of overburdening local courts with congested calendars,protecting the interests of potential jurors so that they are not called upon to decide cases in which the local community has little concern,and weighing the competing interests of california and the alternate jurisdiction in the litigation.citations.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.these factors are to be applied flexibly,without giving undue emphasis to any one element.id.at,d.
the trial court balancing of these factors is entitled to substantial deference.chong superior court,supra,th,d.in denying the original motion the trial court noted that other than the plaintiff,there is only one percipient witness to the accident in switzerland that defendants did not arrange a physical examination while plaintiff was in california for two months the previous summer and that litigation in california would not burden the defendants.the court observed we dealing with products liability,warranty,all arising here in the united states.the bicycle was purchased here.california has an interest in products which are sold in california as so far as their safety and use.the court expressed concern about whether swiss or california law applies,and about the delay in bringing the motion.
at the hearing on the renewed motion,the trial court said that the new facts about two wheels stipulating to swiss jurisdiction and waiving the statute of limitations went only to whether switzerland is a suitable alternate forum.the court agreed that it was.but as to the balancing of public versus private interests,the court found no new evidence.it said a pplying the test the court must apply,i there is an alternative jurisdiction where the case could have been filed,and no doubt the plaintiff did forum shopping,which is not unlike what the moving party is attempting to do in this case,i do believe that the public interests of the state of california,the product sold in california,that there is substantial interest and that the case should continue here.the court repeated that the difference in remedies available in switzerland did not factor into its decision.
plaintiff relies heavily on brown clorox d,a case decided before stangvik,supra,cal d,d.in brown,residents of the state of washington filed a products liability action in california,where the product was manufactured.it was purchased in washington,the injury occurred there,and all medical treatment was rendered there.the court of appeal reversed the trial court order staying the action in california in favor of washington as an abuse of discretion.
the court in brown held that the plaintiff choice of forum should not be disturbed.brown clorox,supra,d at.assuming this reasoning is valid,it does not apply where the plaintiff is not a resident of the united states.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d,campbell,supra,th at,d.in addition,all three defendants had principal places of business in california,two were incorporated in california,and the third was a subsidiary of a california corporation.brown clorox,supra,d at.here,while two wheels is located in california,cannondale is incorporated in delaware with its principal place of business in connecticut.brown is not helpful to plaintiff.
plaintiff argues that private interests favor retention of the case in california.as we have discussed,these are factors that make trial and the enforceability of the ensuing judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive,such as the ease of access to sources of proof,the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses,and the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.
he asserts that two wheels is a california corporation,but his citations to the record to support this assertion do not bear him out.
there are relevant witnesses and documents available in both switzerland and california.plaintiff points out that the percipient and expert witnesses and documents regarding the design,production,testing,warranty,and sale of the bicycle are in california or may be compelled to testify or to be produced here.he has provided defendants his medical records,made himself available for medical examination here,and has stipulated to video depositions of any medical witnesses in switzerland.
defendants point out that th
