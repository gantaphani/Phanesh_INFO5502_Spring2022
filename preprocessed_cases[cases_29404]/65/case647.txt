in this products liability case,we hold that plaintiffs expert testimony was legally insufficient to establish a manufacturing defect,and accordingly reverse and render judgment in favor of petitioner cooper tire rubber company.
background 
in june,oscar mendez was driving a mazda minivan carrying six passengers down interstate in new mexico.the left rear tire,a radial tire manufactured by cooper tire,lost its tread.mendez lost control of the vehicle,and it rolled several times,ejecting all six passengers.mendez,the only occupant wearing a seat belt,was not ejected.four of the passengers died at the scene or shortly thereafter.when the tire was examined a nail hole was found in the tread.the nail had penetrated completely through the tire.
mendez and the survivors and estate administrators of three of those killed in the accident were plaintiffs below.they sued cooper tire and proceeded to trial on the theory that the tire tread separated due to a manufacturing defect,and the tread separation in turn caused the rollover and the resulting deaths and injuries.the jury found a manufacturing defect and awarded over million in damages.the trial court entered judgment on this verdict.the court of appeals affirmed.
ii.discussion 
cooper tire argues that the evidence of a manufacturing defect was legally insufficient to support the judgment.we agree.
expert testimony and proof of manufacturing defect 
in products liability cases,we have recognized three types of defect marketing,design,and manufacturing.am.tobacco grinnell.a manufacturing defect exists when a product deviates,in its construction or quality,from the specifications or planned output in a manner that renders it unreasonably dangerous.ford motor ridgway.a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective when it left the hands of the manufacturer and that the defect was a producing cause of the plaintiff injuries.id.
to establish proof of a manufacturing defect that caused the tread separation,plaintiffs relied on the expert testimony of richard grogan,and to a lesser extent on the expert testimony of alan milner and jon crate the theory presented by this trio was that the tire failed because the skim stock was contaminated with hydrocarbon wax at the plant where it was manufactured,causing the belts to separate.skim stock is a specially formulated rubber compound that coats the steel belts in a radial tire and through vulcanization holds them together.in re.cooper tire complains that the testimony of all three experts was inadmissible.
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.evid.
expert testimony is admissible if the expert is qualified,and the testimony is relevant and based on a reliable foundation.helena chem.wilkins,du pont de nemours robinson.if the expert scientific evidence is not reliable,it is not evidence.merrell dow,havner.the trial court determination that these requirements are met is reviewed for abuse of discretion.wilkins,at.the test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or principles.robinson,at.admission of expert testimony that does not meet the reliability requirement is an abuse of discretion.river auth.kraft.
in deciding whether an expert is qualified,the trial court must ensur e that those who purport to be experts truly have expertise concerning the actual subject about which they are offering an opinion.gammill jack williams chevrolet,quoting broders heise.scientific testimony is unreliable if it is not grounded in the methods and procedures of science,and amounts to no more than a subjective belief or unsupported speculation.robinson,at quoting daubert merrell dow,d.we have also recognized that expert testimony is unreliable if there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.gammill,at quoting joiner,d.we are not required to ignore fatal gaps in an expert analysis or assertions that are simply incorrect.volkswagen of,ramirez.a flaw in the expert reasoning from the data may render reliance on a study unreasonable and render the inferences drawn therefrom dubious.under that circumstance,the expert scientific testimony is unreliable and,legally,no evidence.havner,at.
in robinson,we identified six factors that trial courts may consider in determining whether expert testimony is reliable 
the extent to which the theory has been or can be tested 
the extent to which the technique relies upon the subjective interpretation of the expert 
whether the theory has been subjected to peer review publication 
the technique potential rate of error 
whether the underlying theory or technique has been generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community and 
the uses which have been made of the theory or technique.
robinson,at.we emphasized in robinson that these factors are and that rule contemplates a flexible inquiry.id.
in gammill,we recognized that the robinson factors can not always be used in assessing an expert reliability,but there must be some basis for the opinion offered to show its reliability.at.we further made clear in gammill that the robinson relevance and reliability requirements apply to all expert testimony.id.
the trial court is not required to admit opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.id.at quoting joiner,at.if the expert brings only his credentials and a subjective opinion,his testimony is fundamentally unsupported and therefore of no assistance to the jury.havner,at.rule,by its terms,only provides for the admission of expert testimony that actually assists the finder of fact.
under these standards,we review the testimony of plaintiffs experts grogan,milner,and crate.
richard grogan conceded that he is not a chemist,an engineer,or a tire designer.he obtained an ordinary national certificate,the british equivalent of a high school diploma,and holds no degrees.he does not consider himself an expert in accident reconstruction.he worked for many years for the dunlop tire company in england,in its technical department,tire examination lab,and technical service section,where he examined tires including tires that had failed.he left dunlop in.he has taught courses to police departments and independent accident investigators on tire failures.in he published a book entitled an investigator guide to tire failures.this book was revised and expanded in.he has also written many articles on tire failures.
grogan opined that the tire separated because the skim stock was contaminated.he believed hydrocarbon wax was the contaminant.he testified that the tread separation did not originate at the nail hole because he detected polishing in other portions of the tire layers,indicating that the separation started elsewhere.he described his observation of polishing at one point in his testimony as seeing how the rubber has been removed from the cords and then left quite bright and clean.he also asserted that the presence of liner marks,left by the canvas or other material on which rubber is placed before vulcanization,was further visual proof of his theory the presence of these marks,in his opinion,indicated faulty adhesion.grogan also offered reasons that the tire did not fail due to the nail,excessive vehicle weight,or ordinary wear.
assuming that grogan was generally qualified to testify on the subject of tire failures,he presented a theory of wax contamination that was unreliable and should not have been admitted.
although the robinson factors are not always useful in evaluating expert testimony in automobile accident cases,see,gammill,at,and although they do not provide a perfect template for evaluating the admissibility of grogan testimony,we turn to them initially for some guidance.as to the first and third robinson extent to which the theory has or can be tested,and whether the theory has been subjected to peer review record is devoid of any scientific testing or studies confirming the hypothesis that wax contamination causes radial tire belts to separate.see ramirez,at holding,in an automobile accident case,that expert testimony was unreliable because,among other reasons,the expert did not conduct tests or cite studies to support his theory.the only publication grogan could cite as supporting his theory was his own book support for the proposition that liner marks are indicative of poor adhesion.it is unclear from the record whether he was referring to his first book or his second book the first was not truly and the second was reviewed by a sachs who actually disagreed with the grogan opinions regarding adhesion.
considering the second robinson extent to which the technique relies upon the subjective interpretation of the note that grogan conducted nothing in the nature of a quantitative analysis of wax contamination,such as calculating the amount of wax improperly deposited on the skim stock or the amount necessary to cause a tire malfunction.he offered no testimony that the scientific community has determined the amount of wax needed to cause a tire failure.he admitted in his deposition that he had not done any type of mathematical calculations with respect to anything in this case.see ramirez,at noting that expert failed to perform calculations in support of his theory robinson,at holding that expert testimony regarding contamination of fungicide was unreliable where expert had no knowledge as to what amount or concentration of contaminants would damage pecan trees.
as to the fourth robinson factor,the technique potential rate of error is unknown because no testing of grogan wax contamination theory has been done.
the fifth robinson factor asks whether the underlying theory or technique has been generally accepted as valid by the relevant scientific community.the record is devoid of proof that grogan theory has achieved such general acceptance.there is no evidence of a general acceptance in the scientific community that wax contamination is a cause of tire belt or tread separations,or that liner marks and polishing are accepted as proof of such a theory.
the sixth robinson factor looks to the uses which have been made of the theory or technique.plaintiffs offered no proof that,outside of the world of litigation,the industry and expert community have recognized wax contamination as a cause of belt separation.the pending case stands in contrast to cases where plaintiffs successfully offered evidence of the alleged defect,torrington stutzman,evidence of helicopter bearing contamination included faa report prepared after earlier crash,and manufacturer tests conducted after that crash uniroyal goodrich tire martinez,alleged tire bead defect supported by patent application motors hopkins,internal manufacturer correspondence documented efforts to change carburetor design and indicated that engineers considered change an urgent safety matter,overruled in part on other grounds by turner motors,and duncan cessna aircraft.
grogan theory was also deficient because it postulated that the inner surfaces of the tire had been contaminated with wax,but the foundational proof of such contamination was lacking.see havner,at if the foundational data underlying opinion testimony are unreliable,an expert will not be permitted to base an opinion on that data because any opinion drawn from that data is likewise unreliable.plaintiffs failed to prove through direct evidence the occurrence of such contamination or a plausible basis for inferring that such wax contamination occurred.
grogan relied on a report prepared by british testing company rapra technology,although grogan conceded that,not being a chemist,i certainly do understand the chemistry in the report and t he detail of it passes me by.the report,based on an examination of samples of the tire,found wax on the skim stock.the report,however,citing two published articles,notes the migratory nature of hydrocarbon waxes and postulates,in direct contradiction of grogan theory,that the wax might have been present on the exterior surface of the tire and migrated over time into the areas tested.it expressly concludes that the wax detected on the failure surfaces may have migrated through from the tread,where wax is intentionally applied,and that further testing which was not done would assist in resolving this uncertainty.the report notes,and the experts on both sides agreed,that wax compounds are intentionally applied to the exterior tread and sidewall surfaces of tires to provide protection from ozone.one of cooper tire experts,harold herzlich,a chemical engineer and former tire compounder explained that the wax components identified in the rapra report included a compound known as,an antiozonant cooper tire applies to exterior surfaces,thus indicating the migration of the wax compounds through the layers of the tire.herzlich and two other cooper tire experts,jerry leyden,a chemist and former tire compounder and jean hoffman,the chief chemist at the plant where the tire was manufactured testified that wax migration is a normal,expected,and phenomenon,that it occurs during the manufacture and throughout the life of the tire,and that wax migration was not indicative of a defect.weighing conflicting admissible evidence is of course a matter for the jury,but we may consider the testimony of these opposing experts because an appellate court conducting a review can not consider only an expert bare opinion,but must also consider contrary evidence showing it has no scientific basis.city of keller wilson.i f an expert opinion is based on certain assumptions about the facts,we can not disregard evidence showing those assumptions were unfounded.id.grogan reliance on a report that undermines his hypothesis is another reason for concluding that his testimony was unreliable.havner,at palmer testimony is based on epidemiological studies that conclude just the opposite.
grogan postulated that the wax contamination found in the rapra report could have come from cutting machinery.this opinion was speculation on his part.he did not visit the cooper tire plant and has not visited an american manufacturing plant since leaving dunlop in.the rapra report on which he relied does not conclude that the wax was a form of contamination,but instead states that the wax could have migrated from other parts of the tire.grogan purported to rely on testimony of hoffman and richard angell for his conclusion that wax contamination originated with machinery at the cooper tire plant.however,hoffman,the chief chemist at the plant,testified that the waxes found in the rapra are not used to lubricate machinery,that waxes make poor lubricants,and that stearic acid essentially soap is used instead.stearic acid has a much shorter carbon chain than the waxes identified in the rapra report.angell had referred to the use of wax on cutting machinery in his deposition,but angell has no chemistry background and admitted that he did not know what the substance actually was.hoffman explained that what employees sometimes refer to as wax is actually stearic acid.other plant employees confirmed that the substance used to lubricate the machinery was stearic acid.plaintiffs expert jon crate testified that the rapra report did not find stearic acid on the tire.there was no evidence that stearic acid causes adhesion problems in tires herzlich explained that stearic acid is put in virtually every rubber stock that cured with sulfur,and percent of the stocks in tires are sulfur cured.grogan reliance on angell and hoffman for his wax contamination theory was as a factual matter unreliable.we are not required to ignore fatal gaps in an expert analysis or assertions that are simply incorrect.ramirez,at.see also burroughs wellcome crye,when an expert opinion is based on assumed facts that vary materially from the actual,undisputed facts,the opinion is without probative value and can not support a verdict or judgment.
in addition,grogan testimony lacked proof that hydrocarbon wax will cause lack of adhesion between the components of the tire after the tire is cooked in the vulcanization process.he stated that he had not c
