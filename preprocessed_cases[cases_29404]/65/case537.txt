introduction 
we hold an agreement by which a lender agreed to forbear from exercising the right of foreclosure under a deed of trust securing an interest in real property comes within the statute of frauds.we also conclude the borrowers in this case failed as a matter of law to establish estoppel to assert the statute of frauds.as a result,we affirm a judgment declaring valid a notice of default and election to sell under a deed of trust.
appellants luther secrest and charmella secrest the secrests are the borrowers on a note secured by a deed of trust on their home.respondents security national mortgage loan trust,jp morgan chase bank,and sn servicing corporation collectively,respondents are the current holders of the note and deed of trust.after respondents recorded a notice of default and election to sell under the deed of trust,the secrests filed this lawsuit seeking a declaration the notice of default was invalid and an injunction to stop foreclosure proceedings.
in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction,the secrests produced a purported written forbearance agreement made in january the january forbearance agreement between the secrests and ocwen federal bank,fsb ocwen,the holder of the note and deed of trust at the time.after the trial court issued a preliminary injunction,the parties agreed the trial would be conducted as a law and motion matter and would be limited to the issue whether the january forbearance agreement was enforceable in lieu of its predecessor,a written forbearance agreement made in april.on essentially uncontroverted facts,the trial court concluded the january forbearance agreement was unenforceable.based on that conclusion,a referee determined the amount of arrearages the secrests owed on the note secured by the deed of trust,and a judgment was entered declaring valid the notice of default against the secrests.
the secrests challenge the judgment by asserting the january forbearance agreement was enforceable for a variety of reasons.we conclude the january forbearance agreement is unenforceable under the statute of frauds,civil code section.the january forbearance agreement constitutes a modification of the note and deed of trust.because the note and deed of trust come within the statute of frauds,the january forbearance agreement also comes within the statute of frauds pursuant to civil code section.neither ocwen,the party to be charged,nor its agent signed the january forbearance agreement.
the secrests argue their making the downpayment on the january forbearance agreement is sufficient part performance to estop respondents from asserting the statute of frauds.but under principles of california law,payment of money alone is not enough as a matter of law to take an agreement out of the statute of frauds,and the secrests have legal means to recover the downpayment if they are entitled to its return.
in,the secrests borrowed from ge capital mortgage services,to purchase their home.the loan was evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust on the home.in,the note and deed of trust were sold to ocwen.
in april,the secrests and ocwen entered into a forbearance agreement the april forbearance agreement stating so long as the borrower s comply with all of the conditions set forth in the forbearance agreement,ocwen federal will undertake no affirmative steps to advance the foreclosure action.the april forbearance agreement had a reinstatement amount of and required a downpayment of with monthly payments of commencing june.the april forbearance agreement would terminate if the secrests fail ed to meet any of the terms of this forbearance agreement or the original note and mortgage.
there was evidence that by january,the secrests were in default.joseph neamon,a loan resolution consultant representing ocwen,sent a letter to the secrests regarding alternatives to foreclosure.in response,luther secrest telephoned neamon to discuss loan status and the secrests financial situation.during the telephone conversation,neamon offered the secrests another forbearance agreement if they made a downpayment.luther secrest said he could not pay but would agree to pay.neamon accepted that proposal and stated he would have a written forbearance agreement prepared and faxed to luther secrest.
on january,luther secrest received by facsimile a proposed written forbearance agreement.this proposed forbearance agreement was unsigned and contained provisions nearly identical to those of the april forbearance agreement.luther secrest noticed,however,the proposed forbearance agreement had a reinstatement amount of amount he knew could not be correct because it was the original amount of the loan.luther secrest also believed the monthly payment amount of in the proposed forbearance agreement could not be correct because it appeared to be based on the inaccurate reinstatement amount.
luther secrest telephoned neamon and reported those inaccuracies to him.neamon agreed the reinstatement amount and the monthly payment amount in the proposed forbearance agreement were incorrect and agreed to correct them.
during the same telephone conversation,luther secrest said he and his wife were not in arrears on the loan,or if they were,they were only in arrears by a few monthly payments and certainly no more than nine monthly payments.neamon responded by saying he was authorized by ocwen to negotiate and enter into forbearance agreements on its behalf.
neamon told luther secrest to modify the proposed forbearance agreement by crossing out the reinstatement amount,sign the agreement as modified,fax the signed agreement back to him,and to ocwen.neamon agreed that if luther secrest did those things,then he would immediately stop any collection efforts,perform a complete audit of our residential loan agreement from the date of the inception of the loan to the present to determine the correct amount of arrearage,if any,and subsequently negotiate the correct amount of any reinstatement amount,if any.neamon also told luther secrest that if the audit showed the secrests owed anything more on the loan,then he,on behalf of ocwen,would have a corrected forbearance agreement prepared and sent to me in which the reinstatement amount,if any,would be accurately stated based on the results of the complete audit of the residential loan from its inception.
luther secrest crossed out the reinstatement amount on the proposed forbearance agreement and signed it.after charmella secrest signed the agreement,he faxed it to neamon and to ocwen.
ocwen sold the secrest note and deed of trust to respondents.a loan audit was never conducted and a corrected forbearance agreement was never delivered to the secrests.
procedural history 
in september,respondents filed a notice of default and election to sell under the deed of trust securing the note.the notice of default stated the past due amount was.
in march,the secrests filed a lawsuit against respondents,ge capital mortgage services,ocwen,and others,for declaratory relief and injunctive relief to enjoin the foreclosure.the first amended complaint alleged the notice of default was void because it overstated the amount of the default.the complaint did not allege the january forbearance agreement.in october,the secrests sought,and were granted,a preliminary injunction to halt foreclosure proceedings.
in the reply memorandum in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction,the secrests produced the january forbearance agreement.respondents contended they had not seen that agreement before and the secrests had never informed them of it.
at a review hearing on november,the trial court renewed the injunction and ordered that it remain in effect until resolution of the case or further court order.the parties then entered into a stipulation identifying the sole contested issue,submitting the contested issue to the trial court for resolution in a law and motion proceeding,and,based on that resolution,having a referee determine the correct amount due and owing at the time the notice of default was filed.
the stipulation identified the contested issue as plaintiffs and defendants agree and stipulate that the only contested legal issue in this case is whether the last forbearance agreement dated in january of is enforceable between the parties to this action in lieu of its predecessor dated in april of and if the april agreement is effective,the amount due and owing as of the date of the forbearance agreement.the parties stipulated too,the issue of which forbearance agreement effective date is controlling and the amount of the note due and owing at that time if the april,agreement is effective would be decided by the trial court as a law and motion matter.
the parties agreed that once the trial court decided which forbearance agreement was controlling,a accounting referee would determine the amount of arrearages,if any,owed by the secrests.the parties agreed the referee would use april as the starting date for the accounting if the trial court decided the january forbearance agreement was controlling,and would use april,as the starting date for the accounting if the trial court decided the january forbearance agreement was not controlling.
the trial court approved the stipulation,and,in june,the secrests filed a special motion on the submitted issue.in support of the motion,the secrests submitted declarations from luther secrest and neamon.respondents did not controvert those declarations.in their opposition to the secrests special motion on the submitted issue,respondents asserted the january forbearance agreement was unenforceable under the statute of frauds.
the trial court found,the operative forbearance agreement is the april,agreement executed by the plaintiffs,that the total sum due and owing as of april,before application of the payment is the sum of which is comprised of principal plus,less in the suspense account.
an amended judgment declared the forbearance agreement dated april,is the enforceable forbearance agreement the amount due and owing by the secrests on the note was the notice of default recorded on september,was valid and enforceable the amount of arrearages on september,was and respondents were entitled to foreclose the deed of trust.
the january forbearance agreement is unenforceable under the statute of fraudsa.respondents raised the statute of frauds in the trial court.
the secrests argue respondents waived the statute of frauds by failing to object to the declarations of luther secrest and neamon specifically on that ground.we find no waiver because respondents presented the statute of frauds issue to the trial court.
the statute of frauds is treated as a rule of evidence which,if not properly raised,may be forfeited.in re marriage of benson cal th,fn,d,howard adams cal d,see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,the statute of frauds must ordinarily be asserted in the lower court,and can not be raised for the first time on appeal.the california supreme court explained,it is settled that a defendant waives his right to rely upon any provisions of the statute of frauds citation by failing to a demur to the complaint,b object to the introduction of testimony to prove the oral agreement at the time of trial,or c make a motion to strike such testimony.pao ch en lee gregoriou cal d.a general denial in an answer is sufficient to preserve a statute of frauds objection howard adams,supra,cal d at,as is a general demurrer witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
respondents could not have challenged the january forbearance agreement by answer or demurrer because the secrests did not allege that agreement in their complaint.rather,they first produced it with their reply brief in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.as the secrests argue,respondents did not pose statute of frauds objections to the luther secrest and neamon declarations.however,once the secrests produced the january forbearance agreement,the parties stipulated the only issue to be tried was whether it was enforceable in lieu of the april forbearance agreement.in effect,respondents posed statute of frauds objections by arguing in their opposition to the secrests special motion on the submitted issue that the january forbearance agreement was unenforceable under the statute of frauds.the issue of the statute of frauds was thus squarely presented to the trial court and was not waived.
b.the january forbearance agreement modifies the note and deed of trust.
a contract coming within the statute of frauds is invalid unless it is memorialized by a writing subscribed by the party to be charged or by the party agent.under civil code section,the party to be charged means the party to be charged in court with the performance to the obligation,the defendant in the action brought to enforce the contract.ulloa mcmillin real estate mortgage,th,d.here,the parties to be charged with performance of the january forbearance agreement are ocwen and respondents.neither ocwen nor its agent signed the january forbearance agreement.
an agreement for the sale of real property or an interest in real property comes within the statute of frauds,subd.a.a mortgage or deed of trust also comes within the statute of frauds.civil code section states a mortgage can be created,renewed,or extended,only by writing,executed with the formalities required in the case of a grant of real property.
a forbearance agreement does not create,renew,or extend a deed of trust.the january forbearance agreement states borrower s understand all the rights and obligations of the note and mortgage,except as expressly changed by this forbearance agreement,shall remain in full force.nothing contained herein shall be construed to impair the mortgage or effect or impair rights or powers under the note and mortgage to recover any sum due under the note,together with interest and costs.
the january forbearance agreement,though not creating,renewing,or extending the note and deed of trust,did modify them.an agreement to modify a contract that is subject to the statute of frauds is also subject to the statute of frauds,subd.a a contract in writing may be modified by a contract in writing collins marvel land d.a modification of a contract is a change in the obligations of a party by a subsequent mutual agreement of the parties.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts.
the january forbearance agreement attempted to modify the note and deed of trust in several ways.first,the january forbearance agreement substituted a new monthly payment for the monthly payment required under the note.second,the january forbearance agreement altered the lender ability to exercise a right to foreclose under the note and deed of trust due to the borrower default.the deed of trust states it secures a debt evidenced by borrower note dated the same date as this security instrument including all renewals,extensions and modifications of the note.the january forbearance agreement attempted to modify the note and therefore serves as additional evidence of the debt secured by the deed of trust.the january forbearance agreement was therefore subject to the statute of frauds.
a few courts in other jurisdictions have expressly concluded a forbearance agreement is subject to the statute of frauds.a pennsylvania appellate court,in atlantic financial federal orianna historic associates,held a forbearance agreement was subject to the statute of frauds,explaining in the present case,the alleged oral agreement not to foreclose was between the mortgagor and mortgagee.as between these parties,the mortgage represented an interest in land.the agreement not to foreclose was therefore an agreement to surrender an interest in land.as such,the agreement was within the statute of frauds.in glastonbury bank trust corbett construction,wl.lexis,a connecticut trial court used the same reasoning to conclude an agreement to forbear from foreclosing a mortgage involves an interest in real property therefore,such an agreement is within the purview of the statute of frauds and must be in writing.these cases provide limited guidance,however,because,in pennsylvania and connecticut,mortgages are considered conveyances of legal title.state hahn.in contrast,under california law,a mortgage or deed of trust is a lien on property.monterey partnership bangham,cal d,witkin,summary o
