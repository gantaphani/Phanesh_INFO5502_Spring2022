this appeal arises from a products liability case involving silicone gel breast implants.in march,mary grenier received breast implants manufactured by medical engineering corporation mec.eleven years later,grenier sued mec after learning that silicone gel had leaked or bled through the implant shell.the district court granted summary judgment for mec.grenier medical engineering,d.the district court concluded that the louisiana products liability act applied to grenier claims grenier could not prevail on her defective design and failure to warn claims because she had presented no evidence of a product defect and grenier redhibition claim was.we affirm.
mary grenier underwent breast augmentation surgery following a double mastectomy in march.the operating physician inserted silicone gel breast implants manufactured by mec.
by the early,grenier began experiencing health problems that she associated with her breast implants.in,after diagnostic tests indicated that the implant in grenier left breast might have ruptured,grenier physician surgically removed both implants.although the surgeon concluded that the left implant had not ruptured,he also discovered to cc of silicone gel outside the implant shell but within the scar tissue capsule in grenier left breast.the district court and the parties refer to this phenomenon of silicone gel pass ing through the shell of the implant without any noticeable structural defect in the implant shell itself as gel bleed.grenier,d at.
grenier filed a complaint against mec in the united states district court for the western district of louisiana in may.grenier case was then transferred to the litigation court in the northern district of alabama,where it remained for four and a half years.for reasons not relevant to this appeal,grenier case was remanded to the district court in louisiana in january.
grenier complaint listed fifteen theories of liability,including defective design,defective manufacture,failure to warn of the potentially dangerous nature of the product,breach of warranty,negligent misrepresentation,and redhibition.in april,the district court granted mec motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of grenier claims.grenier now appeals 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same substantive test set forth in federal rule of civil procedure c.see horton city of houston,cir.
the first issue on appeal is whether the louisiana products liability act lpla applies to grenier claims.this question is significant to the various theories asserted by grenier because the lpla establishes four exclusive theories of product liability defective design,defective manufacture,failure to warn,and breach of warranty.see.ann.west a claimant may not recover from a manufacturer for damage caused by a product on the basis of any theory of liability that is not set forth in the chapter.the lpla applies only to causes of action that accrued on or after september.brown reynolds tobacco,cir.therefore,the narrow question before us is when grenier cause of action accrued.
under louisiana law,a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff may bring a lawsuit.in a negligence action,for instance,the claimant must be able to allege fault,causation,and damages.id.at.in this case,the cause of action accrued when grenier suffered some physical injury because of her breast implants 
grenier has presented no medical evidence of when her injuries may have occurred.the only evidence remotely relevant to this question is grenier testimony that she began experiencing pain in her back and shoulders sometime after.in this respect,grenier case is indistinguishable from arabie reynolds tobacco,so d.cir,in which a smoker,who was diagnosed with lung cancer in,presented no evidence as to when the damage to his lungs began.a louisiana appeals court held that the lpla was the plaintiff exclusive remedy because he had failed to introduce a single piece of evidence supporting his claim that his lung damage occurred prior to.id.similarly,grenier has introduced no certainly no medical expert that she suffered any injury prior to september,when the lpla took effect.
grenier,relying exclusively on cole celotex,so d,argues that her cause of action accrued in march,when she received the breast implants.but cole is not relevant to the issue before us.cole involved a comparative fault statute that applied to claims arising from events that occurred after august.the louisiana supreme court explained that in occupational disease cases,the events contemplated by the statute would include repeated tortious exposures to asbestos or other agents.id.at.because the plaintiffs in cole were exposed to asbestos before august,the comparative fault statute did not apply.but,as the louisiana supreme court recently observed,the holding in cole turned on the unique language of the comparative fault statute.walls american optical,so d.to repeat,the comparative fault statute did not apply to causes of action that accrued after the effective date of the statute instead,the statute applied to causes of action arising from events occurring after the effective date.this unusual statutory language was highly significant in cole,where the plaintiff exposure to asbestos the events giving rise to the suit occurred many years before he suffered damages from the exposure and before his cause of action accrued.the lpla,on the other hand,applies to causes of action that accrued after the statute effective date.for this reason,the exposure rule of cole can not be read so expansively as to apply to lpla cases.
in sum,although the events giving rise to grenier injuries occurred in,that fact has no bearing on the question of when the injuries occurred and the cause of action accrued.as there is no evidence suggesting that the damages occurred before september,the lpla applies to grenier claims.
as noted above,the lpla establishes four exclusive theories of liability defective design,defective construction,failure to warn,and breach of warranty.the district court dismissed all of grenier lpla claims because she had failed to present any competent evidence of a defect.
grenier tried to prove that the implants were defective by calling the court attention to barrow medical engineering,wl,a lengthy district court opinion in a case involving a different type of implant and different injuries.grenier did not argue that mec was collaterally estopped from relitigating certain factual issues related to question of defect.see,recoveredge pentecost,cir.instead,in her complaint she simply adopt ed pages of the barrow court findings of fact.because this method of presenting evidence is not allowed under rule c or any other federal rule of civil procedure,the district court properly refused to consider the barrow opinion as evidence.
because the barrow opinion is not evidence,the record is devoid of proof regarding defective design or construction.this lack of evidence is fatal to grenier lpla claims because,as this court has noted,louisiana law does not allow a fact finder to presume an unreasonably dangerous design solely from the fact that injury occurred.krummel bombardier,cir quoting mccarthy danek medical,d.
grenier most plausible lpla claim is that mec failed to warn her or her physician about the possibility of gel bleed.
the district court dismissed grenier failure to warn claim because she had presented no evidence of a defect without an adequate showing of a dangerous defect,this court can not impose a duty to warn on mec.grenier,d at.the district court formulation of this rule may be somewhat misleading.the language of the lpla provides that a plaintiff may prevail on her failure to warn claim if the product possessed a characteristic that may cause damage and the manufacturer failed to use reasonable care to provide an adequate warning of such characteristic and its danger to users and handlers of the product.ann.west.thus,even if a product is not defectively designed or constructed,a manufacturer may still have a duty to warn consumers about any characteristic of the product that unreasonably may cause damage see,hesse champ serv.line,so d.cir dunne store
