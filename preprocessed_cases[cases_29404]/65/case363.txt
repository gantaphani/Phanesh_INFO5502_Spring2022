personal jurisdiction consumer fraud law 
the panel affirmed the district court dismissal of yamaha motor ymc for lack of personal jurisdiction,and fed.civ.b dismissal of claims against yamaha motor corporation,ymus,in an action alleging violations of federal and state warranty law and other claims,brought by appellants who purchased allegedly defective outboard motors that ymc designed and manufactured in japan and that ymus imported and marketed in california.
the panel held that the district court lacked general jurisdiction over ymc.specifically,the panel held that ymc itself did not have sufficient contacts with california for the exercise of general jurisdiction.the panel also held that appellants failed to plead sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case that ymc and ymus were alter egos.the panel noted that even assuming that ymus contacts could be imputed to ymc,that did not,on its own,suffice to establish general jurisdiction.
the panel held that the district court lacked specific jurisdiction over ymc.specifically,the panel held that appellants did not allege any action that ymc purposefully directed at california.assuming that some standard of agency continued to be relevant to specific jurisdiction after daimler ag bauman,the panel held that appellants failed to make out a prima facie case for any such agency relationship between ymc and ymus and its connections.
the panel held that appellants failed to plead a prima facie case of consumer fraud.the panel held that contrary to the district court,appellants adequately pleaded ymc and ymus presale knowledge of the alleged defect.the panel also held,however,that appellants failed to plausibly plead that the alleged defect caused an unreasonable safety hazard.
this appeal challenges two separate rulings by the district court the dismissal of yamaha motor ymc for lack of personal jurisdiction,and the dismissal of claims against yamaha motor corporation,ymus pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the district court on both accounts.
factual and procedural background 
appellants are a group of twenty named plaintiffs who purchased four stroke outboard motors the class motors manufactured by ymc from to.appellants brought suit against ymc,which designed and manufactured the class motors in japan,and ymc subsidiary,ymus,which imported and marketed them in california.appellants allege that the class motors contained an inherent design defect that caused severe,premature corrosion in the motors dry exhaust system.appellants assert that this defect caused the motors to fail after between to hours of use,even when properly serviced and maintained,when absent this defect an outboard motor would have an expected useful life of at least hours.although the alleged defect manifests early in an engine expected lifespan,the average recreational boater only uses her engine an average of hours per year.accordingly,the defect typically will not manifest until the warranty period has expired.appellants assert on appeal that appellees knew of the dry exhaust defect prior to the sales of the class motors to appellants,and that the defect poses an unreasonable safety hazard.
appellant williams filed the initial complaint on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated on july,naming ymc and ymus as defendants.the complaint asserted claims for violations of federal and state warranty law california consumer legal remedies act,california civil code and california unfair competition law,california business and professions code.
appellees filed a motion to dismiss,in response to which appellants filed an amended complaint.ymus then filed a second motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and ymc filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.while these motions were pending,the district court consolidated this matter with two similar cases and vacated all pending motions,after which appellants filed a consolidated class action complaint.the consolidated complaint contained,in addition to the claims asserted in the initial complaint,ten new statutory claims from five different states,as well as claims for negligence and unjust enrichment.
ymus subsequently filed a third motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,and ymc filed a second motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.on august,the district court granted in part ymus motion,dismissing appellants warranty and consumer fraud claims,and granting ymc motion in its entirety.appellants then filed their first amended complaint,to which ymus responded with a fourth motion to dismiss.the district court granted ymus motion entirely,but granted appellants leave to replead their consumer fraud claims.
finally,on february,appellants filed their second amended complaint sac,to which ymus responded with its fifth motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.on april,the district court granted ymus motion and dismissed appellants only remaining claims with prejudice.appellants now appeal the district court grant of ymc motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and its grant of ymus fifth motion to dismiss appellants consumer fraud claims.

i.the district court lacked general jurisdiction over ymc 
federal courts apply state law to determine the bounds of their jurisdiction over a party.see fed.civ.k a.california statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction to the full extent that such exercise comports with due process.cal.code civ.
under goodyear dunlop tires operations,brown,courts have general jurisdiction over a foreign corporation only if the corporation connections to the forum state are so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the forum state.id.at.a corporation continuous activity of some sorts within a state is generally not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.int l shoe washington.rather,in the paradigmatic circumstance for exercising general jurisdiction,the corporate defendant is incorporated or has its principal place of business in the forum state.goodyear,at.
in daimler ag bauman,the supreme court considered for the first time whether a foreign corporation may be subjected to a court general jurisdiction based on the contacts of its subsidiary.id.at.the plaintiffs sought to sue daimler,a german corporation,in california on the basis that daimler subsidiary contacts could be attributed to daimler under an agency theory,thereby establishing daimler continuous and systematic presence within california.id.at.daimler subsidiary,mbusa,served as daimler exclusive importer and distributor and had multiple california facilities.id.we found general jurisdiction over daimler under an agency theory,applying a test that asked whether mbusa services were sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them,the corporation own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services.bauman daimlerchrysler,cir.quoting doe unocal,cir.emphasis omitted.
the supreme court reversed our finding of general jurisdiction,emphasizing that the test for general jurisdiction asks whether a corporation is essentially at home in the forum state.daimler,at.the supreme court assumed that mbusa could be considered at home in california,and that its contacts could be attributed to daimler,but it rejected a theory that would permit the exercise of general jurisdiction in every state in which a corporation engages in a substantial,continuous,and systematic course of business.id.at.in so doing,the court noted that while general jurisdiction is not strictly limited to a corporation place of incorporation or principal place of business,those exemplars illustrate the need for predictability in jurisdiction and afford plaintiffs recourse to at least one clear and certain forum in which a corporate defendant may be sued on any and all claims.id.at.
subsequently,in ranza nike,cir,we considered whether an corporation contacts could be attributed to its foreign subsidiary to establish general jurisdiction over the subsidiary.see id.at.we stated that while daimler invalidated our previous agency test,it left intact the alternative alter ego test for imputed general jurisdiction.id.at.we made clear,however,that the relationship does not on its own establish two entities as alter egos,and thus does not indicate that general jurisdiction over one gives rise to general jurisdiction over the other.id.at citing dole food patrickson,united states bestfoods.rather,we held that the alter ego test may be used to extend personal jurisdiction to a foreign parent or subsidiary when,in actuality,the foreign entity is not really separate from its domestic affiliate.id.at emphasis omitted.to satisfy this test,a plaintiff must make out a prima facie case that there is such unity of interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the two entities no longer exist and that failure to disregard their separate identities would result in fraud or injustice.id.quotation marks and alterations omitted.
we first consider whether ymc itself has sufficient contacts with california for the exercise of general jurisdiction.we conclude that it does not.
ymc is incorporated and has its principal place of business in japan,and has no offices or employees in california.considering ymc california sales,the general jurisdiction inquiry examines a corporation activities worldwide not just the extent of its contacts in the forum state to determine where it can be rightly considered at home.ranza,at citing daimler,at.appellants own evidence indicates that ymc has consolidated subsidiaries located in at least different countries and spanning five continents.it further shows that in,net sales in north america a figure that includes sales in all states and canada,not merely in california accounted for approximately of ymc total net sales.while the california market may be important for ymc,appellants failed to submit evidence to support a finding that ymc is at home in california 
nevertheless,appellants argue that ymus california contacts may be imputed to ymc for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction.appellants fail,however,to plead facts sufficient to make out a prima facie case that ymc and ymus are alter egos.appellants complaint makes almost no factual allegations regarding the nature of the relationship,and the evidence appellants submitted in opposition to ymc motion to dismiss did not provide any additional clarity.
moreover,even assuming that ymus contacts could be imputed to ymc,this does not,on its own,suffice to establish general jurisdiction.in daimler,the court assumed that the subsidiary contacts could be imputed to the foreign parent,but nevertheless found the exercise of general jurisdiction inappropriate.at.
in short,the district court correctly found that it lacked general jurisdiction over ymc.
ii.the district court lacked specific jurisdiction over ymc 
the exercise of jurisdiction over a defendant requires that the defendant have certain minimum contacts such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at internal quotation marks omitted.in order for a court to have specific jurisdiction over a defendant,the defendant conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum state.walden fiore.the relationship between the defendant and the forum state must arise out of contacts that the defendant itself creates with the forum state.id.at quoting burger king rudzewicz.additionally,the requisite minimum contacts must be with the forum state itself,not with persons who reside there.id.
we will exercise specific jurisdiction over a defendant only when three requirements are satisfied the defendant either purposefully direct s its activities or purposefully avails itself of the benefits afforded by the forum laws the claim arises out of or relates to the defendant activities and the exercise of jurisdiction comport s with fair play and substantial justice,it is reasonable.dole food watts,cir.
addressing the first prong of the specific jurisdiction analysis,appellants do not allege any actions that ymc purposefully directed at california appellees submitted unrebutted evidence in support of their rule b motion that ymc does not conduct any activities within the state of california,nor does it target california via marketing or advertising.the only connection appellants identify between ymc and california is via ymus.accordingly,we must ask whether ymus connections may be attributed to ymc under an agency theory for the purpose of establishing specific jurisdiction 
while daimler voided our agency approach for imputing contacts for the purpose of general jurisdiction,it left open the question of whether an agency relationship might justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction.daimler,at agency relationships,we have recognized,may be relevant to the existence of specific jurisdiction.appellees point to walden emphasis on the necessity of a relationship between the defendant itself and the forum state to suggest that ymus relationship to california can not support specific jurisdiction over ymc.but walden did not address an agency theory of jurisdiction.rather,that case dealt with the scenario in which the connection between the defendant and the forum was provided only by the plaintiff,and could aptly be described as random,fortuitous,or attenuated.at citation omitted.this contrasts sharply with the circumstance at hand,in which the relationship between the entity and the defendant is that of a parent and a subsidiary purportedly acting as that parent agent.if an agency theory of imputable contacts survives daimler in the context of specific jurisdiction,then walden directive that contacts must be directly between the defendant and the forum is inapposite,because imputing an entity contacts to the defendant would necessarily establish that direct connection.
notwithstanding daimler express reservation on the question of agency theory application to specific jurisdiction,more than one district court within our circuit has expressed some uncertainty on that point,as the rationale set forth in daimler would seem to undermine application of our agency test even in specific jurisdiction cases.corcoran cvs health,supp,cal.quoting los gatos mercantile,dupont de nemours,wl,at cal.
as noted supra,our agency analysis asks whether the subsidiary performs services that are sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if it did not have a representative to perform them,the corporation own officials would undertake to perform substantially similar services.unocal,at internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court found in daimler that,f ormulated this way,the inquiry into importance stacks the deck,for it will always yield a answer anything a corporation does through an independent contractor,subsidiary,or distributor is presumably something that the corporation would do by other means if the independent contractor,subsidiary,or distributor did not exist.at internal quotation marks omitted.this criticism applies no less in the context of specific jurisdiction than in that of general jurisdiction.accordingly,daimler reasoning is clearly irreconcilable with the agency test set forth in unocal.see miller gammie,cir.holding that where a prior decision in our circuit is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority,a panel should consider itself bound by the later and controlling authority,and should reject the prior circuit opinion as having been effectively overruled.the daimler court express recognition of the potential viability of agency relationships for establishing specific jurisdiction does not alter our holding.while the court reserved judgment on the viability of agency theory as a general concept,it did not suggest that our particular formulation for finding an agency relationship should survive in the context of specific jurisdiction.to the contrary,the daimler court criticism of the unocal standard found fault with the standard own internal logic,and therefore applies with equal force regardless of whether the standard is used to establish general or specific jurisdiction.
assuming,however,that some standard of agency continues to be relevant to the existence of specific jurisdiction,daimler,at,appellants fail to make out a prima facie case for any such agency relationship.fundamental tenets of agency theory require that an agent act on the principal behalf and subject to the principal control.restatement third of agency see also batzel smith,cir.agency requires that the principal maintain control over the agent actions.accordingly,under any standard for finding an agency relationship,the parent company must have the right to substantially control its subsidiary activities.see,unocal,at murphy directv,cir.appellants neither allege nor otherwise show that ymc had the right to control ymus activities in any manner at all consequently,even assuming the validity of some formulation of agency analysis such that a subsidiary contacts could be attributed to its parent,appellants failed to establish specific jurisdiction over ymc.
iii.plaintiffs failed to plead a prima facie case of consumer fraud 
federal rule of civil procedure a requires only that a plaintiff provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,such that the defendant receives fair notice of the claims against it.bell atl.twombly,citation omitted.a sufficiently pleaded cause of action requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.id.rather,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.see also ashcroft iqbal.the requirement that a plaintiff provide plausible grounds for her claim does not,however,impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage.twombly,at.on the contrary,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
appellants sac asserts claims under a number of state consumer fraud statutes,each of which requires either an affirmative misrepresentation or an omission of material fact appellants allege no affirmative misrepresentation.rather,they rely entirely on ymus failure to notify consumers of the alleged dry exhaust defect.to state a claim for failing to disclose a defect,a party must allege the existence of a design defect the existence of an unreasonable safety hazard a causal connection between the alleged defect and the alleged safety hazard and that the manufacturer knew of the defect at the time a sale was made.apodaca whirlpool,jvs anx,wl,at cal,see also wilson,cir.holding that where a defendant has not made an affirmative misrepresentation,a plaintiff must allege the existence of an unreasonable safety hazard and a causal connection between the defect and the hazard.
contrary to the district court,we find that appellants adequately pleaded appellees presale knowledge of the alleged dry exhaust defect.however,we also find that appellants failed to plausibly plead that the alleged defect constituted an unreasonable safety hazard.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of appellants consumer fraud claims pursuant to rule b.
appellants adequately pleaded appellees presale knowledge of the alleged dry exhaust defect 
the sac alleges that ymus began receiving consumer complaints regarding dry exhaust corrosion as early as.it states that the complaints from owners regarding the dry exhaust corrosion in the first generation outboards were so frequent that individual customer relations supervisors personally handled as many as or different consumer complaints,or more,regarding the issue,which was an unusually high number of complaints for yamaha to receive regarding corrosion this soon in the life of the engines.the sac goes on to explain that the high volume of calls led to the creation of a customer relations service department in kennesaw,georgia,with approximately two dozen customer service employees to assist in handling the complaints,and identifies lindsey foster as the manager of customer relations who reviewed the complaints handled by the kennesaw facility.finally,the sac explains how consumer complaints were recorded and transmitted by the kennesaw facility so as to make ymus management aware of the number and substance of the complaints,and states that foster specifically reviewed the submitted complaints through ymus private customer relations management crm database.
the district court found that the alleged consumer complaints did not support a finding of ymus presale knowledge,and agreed with ymus characterization of appellants allegations of customer complaints as inherently inconsistent with their overarching theory of the defect because appellants had consistently alleged that the defect does not manifest until hours of use,which for a typical consumer using the boat hours a year would take five to seven years to achieve.williams yamaha motor,supp,cal.emphasis added by district court.the district court ignored,however,appellants allegation that the corrosion problem which typically took to engine hours to manifest had surfaced first primarily among heavy users who used their engines much more than typical recreational boat owners usage.it was not inherently inconsistent to allege that a subset of heavy users encountered the defect much sooner than the typical user otherwise would.
the district court also cited multiple cases,from within this circuit and elsewhere,to illustrate the disfavored nature of customer complaints as a basis for establishing a party presale knowledge.these cases are,however,distinguishable.the district court particularly cited wilson,cir,for its observation that s ome courts have expressed doubt that customer complaints in and of themselves adequately support an inference that a manufacturer was aware of a defect,because complaints posted on a manufacturer webpage merely establish the fact that some consumers were complaining.id.at quoting berenblat apple,jf pvt,jf pvt,wl,at cal.the facts of wilson,however,differ significantly from those alleged here wilson concerned fourteen complaints,and the plaintiffs did not identify where or how the complaints were made and did not provide dates for twelve of the complaints.id.at.we found that absent dates to indicate that the complaints were made,and some evidence that defendant actually received the complaints,it would be speculative at best to find that the defendant knew of the alleged defect.see id.at.here,by contrast,appellants gave at least approximate timing for the complaints,and explained in detail how those complaints were lodged,how ymus responded,and the mechanism through which information travelled from consumers to ymus management 
wilson did not hold that consumer complaints may never support an allegation of presale knowledge.on the contrary,it cited to and distinguished cirulli hyundai motor,no.sacv ag mlgx,wl cal.june,in which the plaintiff successfully alleged presale knowledge of a defect largely through its allegation that,
since,defendant has constantly tracked the national highway traffic safety administration database to track reports of defective sonata.from this source,defendant knew that its sonatas were experiencing unusually high levels of deterioration,steering control arm separation,steering loss,and highway accidents.
wilson,at quoting cirulli,wl,at.the facts alleged by the sac are remarkably similar to those alleged in cirulli,and provide an even stronger basis for finding presale knowledge because rather than tracking an outside database,ymus is alleged to have set up its own proprietary system to account for a similarly unusually high level of corrosion
