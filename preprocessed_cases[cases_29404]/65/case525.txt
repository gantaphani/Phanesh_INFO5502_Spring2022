appellants lee williams,sherrie powdrill and lee williams as guardian ad litem for minors kalonni and montice williams filed an action for personal injuries against respondent southern california gas company and other entities who are not parties to this appeal the action arose from the malfunctioning of a natural gas wall furnace in a home rented by appellants.respondent demurrer to the second amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend because the trial court concluded that discovery responses provided by appellants in a prior action were in conflict with the allegations of the complaint in this case.
we do not agree with the trial court ruling.we find,however,that respondent did not owe appellants a duty of due care.we therefore affirm the judgment.
background 
in substance,respondent demurrer was sustained because in a prior action,which was also predicated on the malfunctioning of the wall furnace,appellants provided discovery responses,which were inconsistent with the claim advanced in this action,that respondent negligence was the cause of appellants injuries.as an example,an interrogatory in the prior action asked appellants to identify the persons who were responsible for the maintenance,service and repair of the wall furnace.appellants identified such parties and respondent was not among them.
in ruling on the demurrer to appellants action,the trial court took judicial notice of the discovery responses in the prior action.the trial court minute order states that the prior discovery responses are not judicially noticed for the truth of the contents of the statements,but as evidence of a material inconsistency between those responses and the allegations of the second amend sic complaint.the trial court concluded that appellants should not be allowed to plead facts that contradict their prior discovery responses.we return to the details of the trial court ruling in a separate part below.
we turn first to the prior action and summarize its salient relevant aspects.
appellants prior action 
the prior action 
on april,appellants filed an action against hy chhun,brian kelly individually and as trustee of the kelly family trust,and the williams furnace company.in this action appellants alleged that a wall furnace manufactured by the williams furnace company was defective because it permitted an excessive amount of carbon monoxide to seep into the living quarters occupied by appellants.appellants were renting the property where the wall furnace was located.brian kelly and the trust were the former owners of the property and hy chhun was its current owner.the kelly defendants were dismissed because the defect was latent,as alleged in the complaint this left chhun and the williams furnace company.respondent was never named as a party in the prior action.
the interrogatories in the prior action and appellants responses thereto 
the discovery responses provided by appellants in the prior action can be grouped into responses dealing with the inspection of the wall furnace,who had knowledge of the condition of the wall furnace,and the persons responsible for the maintenance of the furnace.
we do not reproduce the interrogatories verbatim but rather state their substance.we refer to the interrogatories by their original numbers.we give the responses provided by williams and powdrill,the adults,whom we will refer to as appellants.
interrogatory asked whether appellants or anyone acting on their behalf inspected the wall furnace.the answer was that there was no formal inspection.interrogatory asked appellants to describe any inspection of the wall furnace conducted by them or anyone acting on their behalf.the answer was there was no formal inspection.i noticed that the cover,which was exposed to plain view,was discolored.interrogatory asked appellant to identify each person who inspected the wall furnace and appellants responded that they themselves had inspected the wall furnace.when asked by interrogatory to state the results of an inspection of the wall furnace,appellants again stated that there was no formal inspection.interrogatory asked appellants if anyone had tested or examined the wall furnace to see whether it was functioning properly the answer was no.and interrogatory requested appellants to state the facts that supported their claim that the wall furnace had not been inspected properly.the answer to this was that the former and current owners of the property had failed to properly inspect the wall furnace.
the former and current owners were also identified in response to interrogatory as the persons who had knowledge of the condition of the wall furnace.interrogatory asked appellants to identify the persons who had knowledge about the claim that the wall furnace had not been properly maintained,serviced or repaired.in addition to the former and current owners,the response listed jaime avila,an employee of respondent,and personnel from the los angeles city fire department.the latter and avila inspected the wall furnace after the incident that injured appellants.
finally,interrogatory asked appellants to identify the persons who were responsible for the maintenance,service or repair of the wall furnace.appellants responded by naming williams furnace company and the former and current owners.
the prior action is settled 
the prior action was settled by a payment of by the williams furnace company.chhun also settled but the record does not reflect whether he contributed to the settlement.there was a finding that the settlement had been entered into in good faith.the order approving the settlement was entered on august.the original complaint in the instant action was filed on november.
the allegations of the instant action 
the second amended complaint contains four causes of action,each brought by one of the four plaintiffs,against respondent the remaining seven causes of action are against the defendants who are not parties to this appeal.see fn,ante.
the four causes of action against respondent are identical.it is alleged that respondent is a utility company that supplies natural gas to southern california and that respondent makes inspections of residential premises supplied with natural gas.the premises rented by appellants had natural gas appliances which included a wall furnace,water heater and stove.
the complaint alleges that respondent agents were on the premises twice,once in may,three months before appellants moved in,and a second time between august and december when appellants were living there.the purpose of the visits was to inspect the gas water heater and for other purposes.in order to reach the gas water heater,respondent agent would have to enter into the small living room,and pass in front of the gas wall furnace before entering the closet where the gas water heater was located.on each of these occasions during when the respondent gas company personnel entered the premises,the gas wall furnace was covered with a long metal grate cover.on each of the occasions,the covering of the gas wall furnace was in plain view to anyone passing through the living room to enter the area where the water heater was located.the cover had a large visible black discoloration with soot on the grate.the discoloration of the wall furnace grate was a telltale sign to gas company personnel that the gas wall furnace was venting toxious sic and potential sic lethal carbon monoxide fumes into the living quarters of the premises.on each of the occasions the gas company personnel had actual constructive notice of the fact that the gas wall furnace was venting unsafe carbon monoxide fumes into the living quarters of the premises.the condition and appearance of the gas furnace grate was a clear indication to the gas company personnel that there was a problem with the gas furnace that required immediate attention and correction.
the complaint goes on to allege that respondent was negligent in inspecting,testing,servicing and repairing the gas wall furnace failing to warn appellants of the unsafe condition of the gas wall furnace failing to warn appellants of the significant hazard in the gas wall furnace of which respondent had actual or constructive notice,thus permitting the emission of lethal amounts of carbon monoxide from the gas wall furnace and allowing the gas wall furnace to remain in a dangerous condition.
the trial court ruling 
as we have already noted,the trial court concluded that appellants discovery responses in the prior action were inconsistent with the allegations of the second amended complaint.the trial court focused particularly on interrogatories,and.respectively,the responses to these interrogatories were that it was the former and current owners who had knowledge of the condition of the wall furnace that it was these two parties who were responsible for the maintenance of the wall furnace and that the same parties had knowledge about the claim that the wall furnace had not been properly maintained.respondent was not named in any of these responses.
the trial court noted that appellant powdrill had known all along that one of respondent agents had walked past the wall furnace before the incident that resulted in appellants injuries.
the trial court concluded that appellants should not now be allowed to contend that this visit by respondent employee gave rise to a duty to act upon what could be observed from walking past the wall furnace because that argument flatly contradicts their prior sworn responses to the contrary.
discussion 
the principle that is at issue is that of truthful pleading 
the principle on which the trial court ruling is based is that of truthful pleading.a basic statement of that principle appears in the classic pleading manual by david dudley field,which is set forth in relevant part in witkin,california procedure ed.pleading,section,page the pleadings must be true.that is to say,the pleader must set forth his case as he believes it the rule is universal and inexorable,that nothing whatever should be alleged which is not believed to be true and the lawyer who inserts any statement,no matter how trivial,which he does not believe,violates that rule,and with it,his duty as an officer of the law.witkin goes on to state that this pronouncement seems a little drastic because we permit inconsistent counts based on the same cause of action ibid,an observation that applies to this case,as we shall see.in any event,one of the several applications of the principle of truthful pleading is that f alse allegations of fact,inconsistent with annexed documentary exhibits citation or contrary to facts judicially noticed citation,may be disregarded,and factual contradictions within a verified complaint may result in admissions citation.id.at.
in cases when the pleading conflicts with facts judicially noticed,witkin states that the theory is that the pleader should not be allowed to bypass a demurrer by suppressing facts that the court will judicially notice.the principle is that of truthful pleading,and is applied for the same reason as in the similar situation of pleaded exhibits which contradict allegations.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading.
we examine the trial court ruling with these fundamentals in mind.
whether respondents knew of the defect in the wall furnace is not a proper subject of judicial notice 
appellants theory respondent is that there was visible black discoloration on the grate cover of the wall furnace,that an agent or employee of respondent had to walk past the wall furnace in order to get to the water heater,and that the significance of this discoloration was that it showed that the wall furnace was venting carbon monoxide into the living quarters.whether these are facts that respondent liability can be predicated,is another question to which we return below.here we note only the facts,or more properly the factual allegations,that constitute appellants case against respondent.
we begin by noting that there is nothing inconsistent between a claim asserted against the manufacturer of the wall furnace and the owners of the premises,based on the theory that the wall furnace malfunctioned,and a claim against respondent that is based on the visible discoloration of the grate cover of the wall furnace that should have been noted.these claims are not inconsistent.at most,they are alternative factual allegations relying on alternative legal theories this does not run afoul of truthful pleading.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading.
the fundamental flaw in the trial court decision is not that it took judicial notice of the discovery responses but that the court took two additional steps.first,the court inferred from the discovery responses that respondent was not aware of any defect in the wall furnace.appellants did not identify respondent as a party who had knowledge of the condition of the wall furnace interrogatory or as a party who had knowledge about the claim that the wall furnace had been maintained improperly interrogatory.second,the court concluded that the allegations of the complaint that we have summarized above were not truthful.both of these conclusions are flawed.
as far as respondent knowledge of the defects of the wall furnace is concerned,there are valid reasons why no mention was made of respondent in the discovery responses of the prior action.as an example,while appellant powdrill may have been aware of the visit by respondent agent,appellants may not have learned until after the discovery responses that the discoloration on the grate cover was significant and what it signified.if this is true,the discovery responses in the prior action were accurate and complete.in fact,we note that appellants state in their opening brief that they did not learn of respondent involvement until after the discovery responses in question were served.we do not pass upon the accuracy of this assertion we simply note that it is quite plausible.
it is also possible that appellants deliberately omitted mentioning respondent in the discovery responses in the prior action.while this was inappropriate,it is also true that appellants never stated affirmatively in the prior action that respondent did not inspect the wall furnace.be that as it may,all this amounts to is a violation of rules of discovery in the prior action.we do not think that barring what is presumptively a valid subsequent action is a sanction that is authorized for failure to make full discovery in a prior action.in other words,the court terminated this case for discovery abuse that occurred in the prior action.this is neither logical nor permissible be that as it may,if the omission was deliberate,it impugns the integrity of the discovery responses in the prior action and not the truthfulness of the pleadings in this action.
whether respondent was not mentioned in the discovery responses because appellants did not know of respondent potential liability or whether appellants deliberately omitted mention of respondent,it was not proper to conclude,based on the discovery responses,that respondent was not aware of any defect in the wall furnace.what respondent knew,and when respondent knew it,is not a proper subject of judicial notice.as the courts have noted,judicial notice of matters upon demurrer will be dispositive only in those instances where there is not or can not be a factual dispute concerning that which is sought to be judicially noticed.joslin ins.brokerage d,citing cruz county of los angeles d.respondent knowledge of the defects of the wall furnace is obviously a sharply contested fact.
nor was it permissible to conclude that the pleadings in this case are false because the truth is reflected in the discovery responses in the prior action,the truth being that respondent was not aware of any defect in the wall furnace.on appeal,respondent insists it was not aware of any defects in the wall furnace and supports this claim by citing discovery responses showing they did not inspect the furnace and the responses to interrogatories,and.
we are unaware,however,of any authority that would permit a trial court to decide on a general demurrer that a complaint is false in whole or in part.indeed,the rule is exactly to the contrary.a general demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,a court ruling on a general demurrer
