joint issues in the two appeals 
a.the damages awarded in the judgment were proper 
on march,the jury rendered its verdict in favor of plaintiffs,and the court ordered plaintiffs counsel to prepare and submit an agreed form of judgment.cadlo died on march,but plaintiffs counsel was not informed of the death until several days later.on march,the court signed an interim judgment the court entered the judgment on special verdict on april.the judgment stated,in relevant part the economic damages set forth above will be reduced by offsets for prior settlements and other payments or credits allowed by law,if any.said reductions as well as plaintiffs entitlement to ordinary and expert costs and prejudgment interest,if any,shall be determined by the court in subsequent proceedings.
on june,maxlyn cadlo filed a declaration pursuant to code of civil procedure section to permit her to continue commence any and all actions related to cadlo asbestos exposure that survive his death.
on july,maxlyn cadlo filed a motion for an order determining the application of proposition,and allocation of pretrial settlements so as to finalize judgment in this matter.
on july,metalclad filed a motion pursuant to section to partially vacate the judgment and enter a different judgment.metalclad relied on section to argue that because cadlo had died before the april entry of judgment,the judgment improperly included an award to cadlo of million in noneconomic damages,in future medical damages,and future economic damages that must be stricken from the judgment 
on august,maxlyn cadlo filed a motion to vacate the prior judgment and enter a new antedated judgment nunc pro tunc to march,pursuant to section so as to ensure that plaintiffs retain the legitimate fruits of this litigation and avoid a patent injustice.both defendants opposed this motion.
on september,the court granted maxlyn cadlo motion to vacate the prior judgment and entered a new antedated judgment nunc pro tunc to march.
on september,the court granted maxlyn cadlo motion regarding application of proposition and allocation of pretrial settlements.the court ruled that after offsets against economic damages,the net economic damage award was,for which metalclad and crane were jointly and severally liable.the order stated that the court would retain continuing jurisdiction to ensure defendants receive a similar offset from any future settlement monies received in satisfaction of this action and t his order is hereby made part of and incorporated in the judgment that was entered nunc pro tunc by this court on september.
on appeal metalclad and crane contend the court erred in awarding maxlyn cadlo damages for future economic loss and for pain and suffering since cadlo died before entry of the original judgment.resolution of this issue requires an evaluation of the interaction of sections,and.
the legal framework 
a the relevant statutes 
section provides in an action or proceeding by a decedent personal representative or successor in interest on the decedent cause of action,the damages recoverable are limited to the loss or damage that the decedent sustained or incurred before death,including any penalties or punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to recover had the decedent lived,and do not include damages for pain,suffering or disfigurement.though worded in the affirmative,this section effectively imposes a limit on the types of recoverable damages when the plaintiff dies before judgment.sullivan delta air lines,cal th,d,sullivan.
section provides in relevant part when trial by jury has been had,judgment must be entered by the clerk,in conformity to the verdict within hours after the rendition of the verdict,whether or not a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict be pending,unless the court order the case to be reserved for argument or further consideration,or grant a stay of proceedings.
section provides in relevant part if a party dies after a verdict upon any issue of fact,and before judgment,the court may nevertheless render judgment thereon.
section is directory rather than mandatory churchill louie cal,shapiro equitable life assur.soc.d,and,pursuant to sections and,the court could properly enter a judgment though cadlo had died.the parties differ on the applicability of section,and whether its limitation on damages prevails over the court inherent power to enter an amended antedated judgment nunc pro tunc to a date prior to that death.metalclad and crane rely on two cases to argue that the amended judgment was improperly entered because section creates a rule that barred the trial court from awarding the challenged damages williamson plant insulation th,d williamson and kellogg asbestos.th,d kellogg.an examination of these cases and sullivan leads us to the opposite conclusion.
b williamson 
in williamson,in the first phase of a bifurcated jury trial conducted in,the jury found that asbestos exposure was a legal cause of the plaintiff loss,and he was entitled to economic and noneconomic damages.williamson,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff died during the second phase,where liability and comparative fault were tried but,the trial continued and the jury found the defendant liable.the trial court entered judgment nunc pro tunc as of the day before the plaintiff death and included noneconomic damages in the judgment.id.at,d.
division three of this court reversed,concluding that,in,neither the common law power to enter judgments nunc pro tunc nor section permitted the trial court to enter the antedated judgment.williamson,supra,th at,d.the court reasoned that at the time of the plaintiff death the case was not ready for rendition of judgment since the evidentiary stage of the trial had not been completed,the jury had not been instructed,the attorneys had not argued and there was no verdict upon which judgment could be entered.id.at,d.because the trial court had no authority to enter the antedated judgment,former probate code section,subdivision c hereafter probate code former section c barred recovery of the noneconomic damages awarded by the jury williamson,at,d.
recognizing that former section c could appear arbitrary williamson stated,a line must be drawn if probate code former section c is to have any effect at all,and in that section,the legislature drew a clear line noneconomic damages do not survive if the plaintiff dies before judgment.the cases on nunc pro tunc entry of judgment push that line back a short distance,to the time when judgment could have been rendered even if it was not.that movement rests on a sound a party should not suffer from the court own delay in giving it would be neither wise nor within our authority to erase the line thus drawn.williamson,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.the court reversed the award of noneconomic damages to the plaintiff estate 
in kellogg,testimony was completed in a bench trial after which the parties argued and the matter was submitted subject to further argument.kellogg,supra,th at,d.approximately two weeks later the parties argued and the matter was finally submitted.five days later,on august,the plaintiff died.on april,judgment in favor of the plaintiff was entered,which included an award of damages for plaintiff pain and suffering.id.at,d.on appeal,the defendant,in reliance on former section c,argued that since the plaintiff died before final judgment,the judgment could not include an award of damages for plaintiff pain and suffering.in reliance on section,plaintiffs argued the damages were properly awarded.kellogg,at,d.
division four of this court held that pursuant to section,the trial court properly rendered judgment because the plaintiff died after trial and submission of the case.kellogg,supra,th at,d.however,the plaintiff death occurred before that judgment was rendered and,at no time did the kellogg plaintiffs request the trial court to exercise its authority to issue a judgment nunc pro tunc.id.at,fn,d.kellogg held that since the plaintiff died before judgment,former section c prohibited the trial court from awarding noneconomic damages for the plaintiff pain and suffering.kellogg,at,d.
d sullivan 
in sullivan,the plaintiff had been awarded a judgment for money damages that included pain and suffering,but the plaintiff died during the pendency of the appeal.the court concluded the damages limitation of code of civil procedure section did not apply in this context.sullivan,supra,cal th at,d.its analysis rested,in part,on section predecessor statute,former probate code section c,that had imposed the identical damages limitation w here a person having a cause of action dies before judgment.sullivan,at,d.because the california law revision commission,which drafted section,explained that section restates former section c without substantive change sullivan,at,d,the supreme court interpreted section to apply only when the person entitled to maintain the action died before judgment sullivan,at,d.the court then construed the phrase before judgment to mean before rendition of a judgment that is final in the fundamental sense that it leaves no issue to be determined between the parties except the fact of compliance.id.at,d.finality in this sense not only makes a judicial determination a judgment,it also makes that judgment appealable.id.at,d.
section does not limit damages in this matter 
as explained in sullivan,section prohibits the recovery of certain damages in an action brought or maintained on behalf of a plaintiff who dies before judgment.sullivan,supra,cal th at,d.
