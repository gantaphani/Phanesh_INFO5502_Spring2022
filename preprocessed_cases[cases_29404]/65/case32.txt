hyundai motor company hyundai appeals from a judgment entered in favor of the estate of eduardo cabrera the estate after a jury found hyundai liable for negligently testing or designing an airbag which killed eduardo in a car accident we affirm.
background 
the tragic circumstances that gave rise to this case occurred on the night of september,in nashua,new hampshire.eduardo cabrera,was a passenger in the front seat of his parents,jose and miriam cabrera,hyundai sonata cabrera was driving the sonata home from a family outing to the movies.at an intersection,the sonata was struck by another car on the right side.the collision pushed the sonata into a light pole.upon striking the light pole,the sonata driver and passenger airbags deployed.at the moment of impact,eduardo was located between three and ten inches from the airbag.the airbag hit eduardo under the chin with such force that it severed his spinal cord from his brain and killed him.
as a result of the accident,the estate invoked the federal court diversity jurisdiction and sued hyundai for wrongful death under new hampshire crashworthiness or enhanced injury doctrine the estate presented its case under two theories.first,the estate alleged that hyundai was strictly liable for eduardo death.under this theory,the estate complained that the airbag system which killed eduardo had an overly aggressive design and that this defective design caused eduardo death.second,the estate alleged that hyundai had negligently designed tested its airbag system and that these lapses proximately caused eduardo death.hyundai defended by introducing evidence tending to show,inter alia,that the airbag system was not defectively designed and that eduardo death was caused by his failure to wear his seatbelt at the time of the accident.
after an trial,the jury returned general verdicts exonerating hyundai on the strict liability count but finding it liable on the negligence count.the jury did not make any specific factual findings as part of these verdicts.immediately after the jury returned its verdicts,hyundai moved to set them aside as inconsistent and asked that the jury be recharged because it could not rationally have reached differing conclusions on the strict liability and negligence counts.see.b.the district court denied hyundai request,accepted the verdicts,and discharged the jury.hyundai subsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.the court denied the motion,and hyundai timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
hyundai raises three claims on appeal.first,it argues that the district court erroneously permitted the negligence count to go to the jury and that as a result of this error the jury returned inconsistent verdicts.second,it claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on the limited relevance of evidence showing that eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.third,it contends that the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence that,on two occasions prior to the accident,cabrera had been cited for violating new hampshire mandatory seatbelt for minors law.ann.a the seatbelt law.
a.the negligence count and the inconsistent verdicts 
hyundai makes two arguments concerning the negligence count.first,it argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the negligence count.hyundai believes that the district court should have declined to instruct the jury on this count because the existence of a defect is a determinative factor in both negligent design and strict liability design defect claims,which makes it unnecessary and confusing for the jury to consider both claims.second,hyundai asserts that the jury verdicts were inconsistent because both counts required the jury to find,as an essential element,that the airbag system contained a design defect.
hyundai claims are not new to this court.we recently decided two cases in which automobile manufacturers raised essentially these same arguments.see trull volkswagen of,cir,cert.denied,d babcock motors,cir.in those cases,we did not address the manufacturers arguments de novo because the manufacturers had failed to preserve them.we reviewed the claims only for plain error and permitted the verdicts to stand because the manufacturers had not met the stringent plain error requirements.see trull,at babcock,at.
unlike the defendants in trull and babcock,hyundai followed the strictures of.and preserved its contention that the district court should have withheld the negligence count from the jury.accordingly,we will review the district court decision to instruct the jury on the negligence count de novo.see crowley bean,cir.
in interpreting new hampshire law,our task is to ascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow under the circumstances,even if our independent judgment on the question might differ.cruz melecio,cir quoting blinzler marriott int l,cir.in performing this function,we hew closely to the path established by the state highest court.see doyle hasbro,cir we are reluctant to extend state law beyond its boundaries internal quotations omitted.we therefore turn to the new hampshire supreme court case law to determine whether,as a matter of law,the district court erred by submitting the negligence count to the jury.
the new hampshire supreme court has consistently declined to adopt the rule urged by a trial court may not instruct a jury on both strict liability and negligence counts in a product liability action.indeed,on several occasions,the new hampshire supreme court has approved of a jury being simultaneously charged on both counts.see trull,at cyr case,thibault sears,roebuck.as we observed in babcock,the most that can be said is that submission of both claims is frowned upon.at citing thibault,at while both counts are permitted,we do not recommend to plaintiffs that counts in both negligence and strict liability be submitted to the jury because of the confusion which is created.emphasis supplied.as this underscored language from thibault suggests,the decision whether to risk confusion by submitting both counts to the jury rests with the plaintiff,not the trial court.
to support its claim that new hampshire law required the district court to withdraw the negligence count from the jury,hyundai relies heavily on the new hampshire supreme court decision in greenland ford motor,greenland does not support hyundai position.
in greenland,the plaintiffs were injured when their car spun out of control.id.at.they asserted that their injuries were caused by a defective ball and socket assembly in one of the front wheels.id.at.at trial,they proceeded on a strict liability theory of design defect and a negligence theory that the defendant failure to test the vehicle permitted the design defect to persist.id.at.the trial court permitted the jury to consider the strict liability claim but dismissed the negligence claim.id.at.the plaintiffs appealed,arguing that the jury should have been instructed on both claims.greenland,at.
the new hampshire supreme court affirmed the decision to withhold the negligence claim from the jury.id.it concluded that when a negligence claim is premised on the same design defect as a strict liability claim,the trial court has discretion to exclude the negligence claim because asking the jury to consider both claims could be confusing.id.at.in the course of its discussion,however,the court observed that it is clear that a products liability action grounded on strict liability may be joined with an action grounded on negligence.id.at internal citations omitted emphasis supplied.thus,greenland stands only for the proposition that in cases where the negligence claim is premised on a design defect,a trial court may,in its discretion,withhold the negligence claim from the jury.it does not,as hyundai suggests,establish a rule that a court must keep the negligence claim from the jury in these circumstances.
in sum,the new hampshire supreme court permits a strict liability action based upon a theory of defective design to be joined with an action grounded in negligence.trull,at.thus,the district court did not violate new hampshire law by instructing the jury on both the strict liability and negligence counts.
having determined that the district court did not err in instructing the jury on both counts,we turn to whether hyundai is nonetheless entitled to relief because the jury verdicts finding negligence,but not strict liability,are inconsistent.we note,initially,our substantial reluctance to consider inconsistency in civil jury verdicts a basis for new trials.kavanaugh greenlee tool,cir quoting mcisaac didriksen fishing,cir.before disregarding a verdict,we must attempt to reconcile the jury findings,by exegesis if necessary.aponte,cir.to perform this analysis,we determine whether the jury,consistent with its instructions,could have found negligence but not strict liability under the facts taken in the light most favorable to the verdict.see merchant ruhle,cir.
the court instructed the jury that the estate had to prove four elements to hold hyundai strictly liable 
one,that the design of the hyundai sonata created a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user 
two,the condition existed when the product was sold by a seller in the business of selling such products 
three,the use of the product was reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer 
and,four,the condition caused eduardo death.
to find negligence,the court instructed the jury that the estate had to prove only two elements 
one,that hyundai failed to exercise reasonable care in designing and testing the airbag in the hyundai sonata,and 
two,that hyundai failure to exercise reasonable care in designing and testing the airbag in the hyundai sonata caused or contributed to the cause of eduardo death which would not otherwise have occurred in the accident.
there are at least two important differences between the district court negligence and strict liability instructions first,for negligence,the estate was not even required to prove that the airbag system contained a design defect.it was required to prove only that hyundai was negligent in testing or designing the airbag system and that this negligence caused or contributed to eduardo death.second,the instructions for each theory presented different standards for assessing the adequacy of the airbag system design.to find hyundai strictly liable,the jury was instructed that it had to perform a analysis in which it determined that the magnitude of the danger of the airbag system outweighed the usefulness and desirability of the product to the public as a whole.to find hyundai liable for negligent design,the jury was told that it had to conclude that hyundai failed to design the vehicle to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.
even assuming,as hyundai argues,that the jury necessarily based its liability verdict on a determination that hyundai negligently designed the airbag system,the jury,consistent with its instructions and the evidence,could have found negligence without finding hyundai strictly liable the jury could have rejected the strict liability count because it decided that,on balance,the benefit to the public of including the overly aggressive airbag system in the sonata outweighed the danger caused by the airbag system because the system saved many more lives than it took.
at the same time,however,the jury could have concluded that hyundai was negligent in failing to develop a less aggressive airbag system for the sonata.the jury heard testimony from an expert witness who testified that the sonata airbag system contained an unnecessarily aggressive inflator.the same expert also testified that other cars on the market in contained less aggressive airbag system designs.in light of this evidence,the jury could have decided that a less aggressive design was readily available and in use by other automobile manufacturers.under the circumstances,the jury efforts to apply the instructions were understandable and had some basis in the evidence.merchant,at.there is nothing before us to suggest that the jury was confused by its task or that it shirked its responsibility.indeed,it appears from the verdicts that the jury understood that the focus of strict liability is on whether the design itself was unreasonably dangerous whereas in a negligence case the focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer.trull,at.thus,we have no reason to reverse the judgment because the jury returned opposite verdicts on the strict liability and negligence counts.
instruction on seatbelt evidence 
hyundai second challenge concerns the district court instruction limiting the jury consideration of the evidence that eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.while the court permitted hyundai to introduce evidence that eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt,it instructed the jury that its consideration of e vidence of whether or not eduardo was seatbelted is for the limited purpose of deciding whether or not hyundai has proved the superseding cause defense.
hyundai asserts that the district court committed two errors in so limiting the jury consideration of this evidence.first,it claims that the court should have instructed the jury that it could consider this evidence for the purpose of evaluating whether the sonata airbag system was negligently designed second,it claims that the court should have instructed the jury that it could consider this evidence for the purpose of determining whether the negligently designed airbag system was a proximate cause of eduardo injuries 
the appropriate use of seatbelt evidence in crashworthiness cases has been a source of much controversy.see motors wolhar.for a long period,many courts refused to permit the introduction of evidence that a victim was not wearing a seatbelt in a product liability action.see madden owen,prod,ed.courts provided several reasons for this resistance there is no duty to mitigate damages prior to sustaining an injury a defendant must take the plaintiff as it finds him or her there is no common law duty to wear a seatbelt and seatbelt evidence leads to excessive speculation by experts and thus protracted litigation.see swajian motors.
state legislatures,in enacting mandatory seat belt laws,further complicated this issue by including limitations on the introduction of seatbelt evidence in civil trials.for example,new hampshire seatbelt law contains such a limitation.see.ann.a iv.the statute requires minors to wear seatbelts but prohibits a defendant from proving comparative negligence through evidence that the plaintiff was not wearing his or her seatbelt id.stating that a violation of the child passenger restraint law shall not be used as evidence of contributory negligence in any civil action.see forsberg volkswagen of.
more recently,some courts have relaxed their skepticism to the introduction of seatbelt evidence in product liability actions.see,jimenez daimlerchrysler,cir wolhar,at.however,in deciding whether to admit seatbelt evidence,courts carefully adhere to the limitations placed on the use of this evidence by state legislatures.see,rougeau hyundai motor,so d,ulm ford motor.
as discussed above,the new hampshire seatbelt law prohibits the introduction of seatbelt evidence for the purpose of establishing the comparative negligence of the plaintiff.see.ann.a.it does not,however,prevent the admission of seatbelt evidence for other purposes.see id.here,the district court permitted the jury to consider evidence that the cabreras sonata was equipped with seatbelts in assessing the overall design of the airbag system.the court concluded,however,that whether eduardo was actually wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident was not relevant to the safety of the design.thus,the court instructed the jury to ignore evidence that eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt for the purpose of deciding whether the sonata airbag system was negligently designed.
the district court analysis was correct.to find a negligent design,the jury had to conclude that hyundai failed to exercise reasonable care in designing a vehicle for those uses which could be reasonably foreseen in order to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.in assessing hyundai care in designing the airbag system,the jury could c
