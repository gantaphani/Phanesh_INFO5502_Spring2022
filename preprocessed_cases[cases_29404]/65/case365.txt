angela ebner plaintiff alleges that cosmetics and skin care products manufacturer fresh,fresh deceived consumers about the quantity of lip balm in its sugar lip treatment sugar product line.although sugar label accurately indicates the net weight of included lip product,the tube design uses a screw mechanism that allows only of the product to advance up the tube.a plastic stop device prevents the remaining from advancing past the tube opening.each sugar tube contains a weighted metallic bottom and is wrapped in oversized packaging.plaintiff brought a putative consumer class action against fresh,alleging that fresh label,tube design,and packaging are deceptive and misleading.the district court granted fresh rule b motion to dismiss plaintiff first amended complaint fac with prejudice.we affirm.
we accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint.skilstaf,cvs caremark,cir.according to the fac,sugar is a lip treatment that comes in a variety of flavors and tints and sells in retail stores and on the internet for approximately to per unit.over the past four years,plaintiff,a california resident,has purchased sugar at various locations in southern california.
sugar comes in an oversized dispenser tube that uses a screw mechanism to push the lip product to the top of the tube.the tube is packaged and sold in a large cardboard box.both the tube and the cardboard box have labels indicating the net weight of the included lip product.for an original size tube,the indicated product weight is g e oz.for the mini size,the label reads.g e oz.the fac does not allege that the sugar tube contains less than the stated quantity of product.rather,it alleges that the stated product quantity is false and misleading because only a portion of that product is reasonably accessible to the consumer.specifically,the tube screw mechanism permits only of the total lip product to advance past the top of the tube.a plastic stop device prevents the remaining of the product from being accessible to the consumer in its intended manner or any other reasonable manner.plaintiff alleges that the intended manner of application is to apply the product from the tube directly to the lips.by contrast,other lip balms using a dispenser tube,such as burt bees,make all or more of the advertised product weight accessible to the consumer.
plaintiff alleges that sugar vastly oversized tubes and boxes create the misleading impression that each unit has a larger quantity of lip product than it actually contains.each sugar tube also contains a gram metallic weight that is concealed at the base of the tube.collectively,the tube,cardboard box,weighted bottom,and grams of lip product in an original tube of sugar weigh approximately grams.plaintiff contends that as a result of fresh labeling,design,and packaging practices,she was misled as to the amount of lip product actually accessible in a tube of sugar and was deprived of the value of her purchases.
the fac asserts four causes of action violation of california false advertising law fal,cal.bus.et violation of the california consumers legal remedies act clra,cal.et violation of california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus.et and unjust enrichment.fresh moved to dismiss the fac under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion and denied leave to amend.this timely appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.skilstaf,at.we may affirm the district court dismissal on any ground supported by the record.asarco,llc union pac,cir citations omitted.dismissal is appropriate if the plaintiff has not allege d enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.turner city cty.of,cir quoting lazy y ranch behrens,cir.determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.ashcroft iqbal,d.
a court denial of leave to amend is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.alvarez chevron,cir.in dismissing for failure to state a claim,a district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made,unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.doe united states,cir citation omitted.
the district court divided plaintiff claims into two categories claims based on sugar labeling and claims based on sugar tube design and packaging.in dismissing the claims,the district court concluded that both california safe harbor doctrine and federal preemption under the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,et,were independently fatal to plaintiff claims.as for the design and packaging claims,the district court concluded that neither sugar tube design nor packaging were deceptive or misleading to the reasonable consumer.additionally,the district court concluded that the fac failed to plead a violation of the california fair packaging and labeling act fpla prohibition of nonfunctional slack fill,cal.bus.we discuss each of these in turn.
california safe harbor doctrine 
the ucl,clra,and fal,under which plaintiff deceptive labeling claims are brought,all prohibit unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business practices.see cal.bus,see also cal.in california,unfair competition claims are subject to the safe harbor doctrine,which precludes plaintiffs from bringing claims based on actions the legislature permits.cel tech commc ns,cellular,cal th,d,cal.to fall within the safe harbor,the challenged conduct must be affirmatively permitted by statute the doctrine does not immunize from liability conduct that is merely not unlawful.as the california supreme court explained 
there is a difference between not making an activity unlawful,and making that activity lawful acts that the legislature has determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law,but acts may,if otherwise unfair,be challenged under the unfair competition law even if the legislature failed to proscribe them in some other provision.
the fac alleges that,although the sugar label accurately states the net weight of lip product in the tube,only of that product is reasonably accessible.to the extent the fac challenges the sugar label accurate net weight statement,this claim is barred by the safe harbor doctrine.both federal and california law affirmatively require cosmetics manufacturers to include an accurate statement of the net weight of included cosmetic product.g the declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of cosmetic in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith.cal.bus.b the net quantity of contents in terms of weight or mass shall be separately and accurately stated upon the principal display panel of that label.because fresh complied with federal and state law requiring a net weight statement on sugar label,this conduct can not form the basis of an unfair competition claim.cal tech commc ns,d,at.
plaintiff other label claim is based on fresh omission of any supplemental or clarifying statement about product accessibility.this omission,plaintiff argues,renders the existing net weight label deceptive and misleading.unlike a claim seeking to alter the net weight declaration itself,this claim does not fall within the safe harbor because there is no law expressly permitting the omission of supplemental statements.see davis hsbc bank,cir t o fall under a safe harbor,the omission of the annual fee disclosure from defendants advertisements must be expressly permitted by some other provision.it is not enough if federal law merely fail s to prohibit such an omission.for that matter,federal regulations governing cosmetic labeling expressly permit supplemental statements at locations other than the principal display panel s describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents q.likewise,the fpla,cal.bus.et,permits supplemental statements describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents.cal.bus.becaus
