this appeal is from a judgment of wrongful death in which liability was established by application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.relying on findings of liability in an earlier personal injury action against it,the trial court precluded defendant and appellant exxonmobil oil corporation mobil from presenting any defense to respondents claims of exposure to asbestos,negligence,causation,and allocation of fault.the case went to the jury solely on the issue of damages.
appellant claims collateral estoppel was erroneously applied because through no fault of its own,it was unable to present a full defense in the earlier action,and intervening decisions of the supreme court changed the controlling legal standards and the new standards were not considered in the prior proceeding.
facts and proceedings below 
respondents decedent,george smith,a plumber and pipefitter,was exposed to asbestos at numerous jobsites from to.for about six months in and,smith worked at mobil refinery in torrance as an employee of procon,an independent contractor hired by mobil to construct an addition to the refinery immediately adjacent to the existing refinery complex.during the construction,procon employees,including smith,removed asbestos insulation from existing structures in order to gain access to underlying pipes and procon took no precautions to protect its employees from ingesting the dust that pervaded the area.at the same time,mobil own employees were working on adjacent premises and they too were removing asbestos insulation from pipes,resulting in additional asbestos dust.mobil failed to take precautions to prevent smith and other procon employees working nearby from being exposed to the asbestos dust generated by mobil employees.in september,after he learned he had lung cancer,smith commenced a personal injury action against numerous parties,including mobil,whose conduct allegedly contributed to his illness.his wife,hannah smith,also sued for loss of consortium.
in preparing for trial,mobil retained francis weir,an industrial hygienist and toxicologist,to provide expert testimony regarding the significance of smith exposure to asbestos.weir was prepared to testify that in his opinion smith exposure to asbestos at mobil torrance refinery was insignificant,and his only significant exposure occurred early in his career during work with transite pipe,which was different from and more dangerous than any work he engaged in at an oil refinery.weir was also prepared to state that,based on knowledge available at the time,none of the refinery exposures claimed by smith would have raised reasonable concerns about health hazards,and mobil conduct was well within what were then considered reasonable industrial hygiene practices.
a few days before he was scheduled to testify,near the close of mobil case,weir informed mobil he was unable to testify because his daughter had been killed in an automobile accident.because weir was the only expert it had on the issues just described,mobil and its attorneys immediately commenced a search for another industrial hygienist or toxicologist to replace weir however none of those they were able to contact were able to testify on such short notice.because the presentation of evidence was by then nearly completed,and smith was seriously ill and apparently near death,so that trial could not be significantly delayed beyond the few days that had been allowed by the court,mobil decided it had no alternative but to proceed without the testimony expected of weir.
by the end of trial all of the defendants except mobil had either settled or been dismissed,so the case was submitted to the jury only with regard to the smiths claims against mobil.in a special verdict,the jury attributed percent of smith injuries to mobil negligence,awarded george smith economic damages in the amount of and noneconomic damages in the amount of million.hannah smith was awarded million for loss of consortium.the trial court entered judgment accordingly,in the total amount of plus costs,subject to settlement credits to be determined by the court.the jury found mobil liable on the basis of two theories of negligence mobil failure to warn smith of a preexisting dangerous condition on the premises,and the failure of mobil employees to exercise ordinary care in the performance of their work mobil appealed and,in an unpublished opinion that issued on february,we affirmed the judgment.mobil inability to obtain weir expert testimony or that of a replacement witness was not an issue in that appeal.
during the pendency of the prior appeal,smith died.the present wrongful death action against mobil and others was commenced by respondents smith widow and six children on september.hannah died in late,and george and hannah daughter was substituted as the to her deceased father.in june,respondents moved in limine for application of collateral estoppel as to mobil with respect to four issues whether smith lung cancer was caused by exposure to asbestos whether mobil was negligent by failing to warn smith of a preexisting dangerous condition on its premises whether mobil was negligent because its employees failed to exercise ordinary care in the performance of their work and whether mobil was a cause of smith injury.mobil should be precluded from litigating these issues in the wrongful death action,plaintiffs maintained,because they had all been litigated and adjudicated adversely to mobil in the personal injury action.
mobil opposed the motion,arguing,among other things,that it would be unfair to apply collateral estoppel because weir sudden inability to testify at the personal injury trial,for which mobil was not responsible,prevented it from mounting a complete defense to the liability claim.collateral estoppel was also unjustified,mobil argued,because of changes in controlling legal principles.after the trial and appeal in the personal injury action,the california supreme court issued its opinion in viner sweet cal th,d,requiring an instruction on causation mobil claimed to be significantly different from that given in the personal injury action.mobil also called the trial court attention to the fact that the supreme court then had before it a case kinsman unocal cal th,d,presenting the question whether a hirer like mobil should be liable in a negligence action for injuries resulting from an allegedly concealed dangerous condition on its premises absent proof of fraudulent concealment.according to mobil,current law on that reflected in toland sunland housing group,cal th,footnote,d,a showing of fraudulent concealment,and the issue was likely to be clarified by the supreme court in kinsman.the application of collateral estoppel,mobil argued,would unfairly impair its ability to enjoy the benefit of the anticipated clarification.
the trial court was not persuaded by mobil arguments.at the hearing on the motion,the court ruled from the bench that the motion to apply issue preclusion is granted.i think we are in a damages only phase.
on july,the jury returned a special verdict finding damages for loss of george smith love,companionship,comfort,care,assistance,protection,affection,society,moral support,training and guidance,in the amount of.the judgment on special verdict,filed on august,recites it appearing by order of the court dated july,that the judgment in the earlier personal injury action,providing that mobil bears a share of liability for injuries suffered by plaintiffs decedent,acts as collateral estoppel and in the action,and precludes mobil from contesting the fact or proportional share of its liability in this action,plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against defendant mobil for total damages in the amount of plus recoverable costs.
mobil filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
collateral estoppel is one of two aspects of the doctrine of res judicata.in its narrowest form,res judicata precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a cause of action finally resolved in a prior proceeding.citations.but res judicata also includes a broader principle,commonly termed collateral estoppel,under which an issue necessarily decided in prior litigation may be conclusively determined as against the parties thereto or their privies in a subsequent lawsuit on a different cause of action.citation.thus,res judicata does not merely bar relitigation of identical claims or causes of action.instead,in its collateral estoppel aspect,the doctrine may also preclude a party to prior litigation from redisputing issues therein decided against him,even when those issues bear on different claims raised in a later case.moreover,because the estoppel need not be mutual,it is not necessary that the earlier and later proceedings involve the identical parties or their privies.only the party against whom the doctrine is invoked must be bound by the prior proceeding.citations.vandenberg superior court cal th,d.like res judicata,collateral estoppel has the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.parklane hosiery shore,d parklane.
collateral estoppel applies when the party against whom the plea is raised was a party or was in privity with a party to the prior adjudication,there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action and the issue necessarily decided in the prior adjudication is identical to the one that is sought to be relitigated.roos red th,d,citing coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d.conceding that all three factors are present in this case,mobil emphasizes the equitable nature of collateral estoppel and that even where the technical requirements are all met,the doctrine is to be applied only where such application comports with fairness and sound public policy.vandenberg superior court,supra,cal th at,d,white motor teresinski d.sandoval superior court d.
mobil also stresses that the offensive use of collateral estoppel is more closely scrutinized than the defensive use of the doctrine.white motor teresinski,supra,d at.see parklane,supra,at.collateral estoppel is used offensively when,as here,the plaintiff seeks to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action with another party.defensive use occurs when a defendant seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim the plaintiff has previously litigated and lost against another defendant.parklane,at,fn.see also vestal,judicata variables parties iowa,although some cases suggest that a trial court decision to allow the offensive use of collateral estoppel is an exercise of discretion to which an appellate court should give deference see,sandoval superior court,supra,d at,the predominate view in this state is that the trial court application of collateral estoppel is reviewed de novo.roos red,supra,th at,d,citing groves peterson th,d and campbell scripps bank th,fn,d.
respondents take the position that de novo review is appropriate with respect to the presence of the three elements essential to collateral estoppel,whether the necessary parties are the same or in privity,there was previously a final judgment on the merits,and the issues are identical and to whether the prior proceeding was of a type that should be given preclusive effect see,vandenberg superior court,supra,cal th at,d,private arbitration not given preclusive effect.they claim de novo review does not,however,apply to a trial court determination of the fairness of applying collateral estoppel,as to which respondents say the more deferential abuse of discretion standard should apply.respondents cite no authority for this proposition,and in the circumstances of this case we decline to accept it.while reasonable minds may differ as to the appropriateness of de novo review of a trial court determination of the applicability of an equitable doctrine that is made upon the basis of a factual inquiry and credibility assessment,the facts bearing upon the propriety of applying estoppel in this case,none of which involve questions of credibility,did not arise out of an independent evidentiary inquiry and are entirely uncontested.the trial court had no more information than is now before us and was in no better position than we are to evaluate that information.
as indicated,mobil contends that application of collateral estoppel in this case is unfair and bad policy,first,because of its inability at the prior adjudication to obtain expert testimony crucial to its defense on the issue of liability and,second,due to intervening changes in controlling law.our agreement with the first claim renders it unnecessary to address the second 
equitable justice is better than the legal kind,it has been said,because by looking to the circumstances of the matter under adjudication it can cure the error that may result from the universal application of a legal generality.aristotle,nichomachean ethics,book v,ch,pp.ostwald,bobbs merrill blackstone commentaries jones ed equity is the correction of that wherein the law by reason of its universality is deficient beley naphtaly.unlike law,equity can not afford and does not need to express itself in precise rules it speaks instead through principles,doctrines and maxims.see,the maxims codified in.for this reason,and because equity defines itself only through its application to peculiar circumstances so infinitely variable as frequently to defy classification there is some discomfort in the law with the resort to purely equitable solutions.see,pound,the decadence of equity.for example,with respect to the issue this case presents,we know that collateral estoppel does not apply when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim or issue.kremer chemical construction,d.the problem is that parties against whom a verdict is returned commonly feel they were denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims and,because no trial is perfect,it is usually not difficult for them to find a defect upon which to try to hang their hats.it is easy to say that the full and fair opportunity necessary to collateral estoppel is not that which is perfect,but not so easy to distinguish imperfect proceedings which are nonetheless acceptable from those which are not.
no case brought to our attention by the parties or that we can find has addressed the question whether the inability of a defendant at a prior trial to obtain the testimony of an assertedly crucial witness so unfairly denied him a full opportunity to litigate his claim that he should not be collaterally estopped from relitigating the matter the case law is not,however,altogether unhelpful.the united states supreme court discussed the factors that may have prevented a defendant from enjoying a full and fair opportunity to litigate a claim at a prior trial in parklane,supra,d and university of illinois foundation,d.in parklane,the court posited the situation in which the second action afforded the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result,as where the defendant in the first action was forced to defend in an inconvenient forum and therefore was unable to engage in full scale discovery or call witnesses.parklane,at,fn,italics added.was a patent infringement case and the court acknowledged that the unusual factual complexity of such litigation rendered it inordinately difficult to determine whether a patentee had had a full and fair chance to litigate the validity of his patent in the earlier case.included among the important factors that needed to be considered,the court said,is whether without fault of his own the patentee was deprived of crucial evidence or witnesses in the first litigation,at.parklane and,thus,both acknowledge that the unavailability of a crucial witness or evidence at the prior proceeding is a circumstance that may render it inappropriate to permit the offensive use of collateral estoppel.
the deprivation of crucial evidence or witnesses at the earlier trial is also among the considerations mentioned in the restatement second of judgments as militating against preclusion.section of the restatement states the familiar principle that a party is not precluded from relitigati
