this interesting product liability case was decided on demurrer.plaintiff and appellants are gill and francisca,and respondents are campbell fetzger company,fisher tool company and makita usa.the trial court found that the first amended complaint failed to state a cause of action.we reverse.
gill worked as a.he cut,sanded,and ground metal parts,working with and around mini die grinders,angle head die grinders,straight shaft die grinders,disc grinders,random orbital sanders,and saws manufactured by respondents.the complaint identifies each tool by manufacturer,and,for most of the tools,by model number.he developed interstitial pulmonary fibrosis as a result of exposure to airborne toxic substances produced and released from the metal parts and from the discs,belts,and wheels used on the grinders,sanders,and saws.
as to respondents the causes of action are negligence,strict liability based on failure to warn,strict liability based on design defect that the tools lacked exhaust ventilation systems,fraudulent concealment,breach of implied warranty,and with as plaintiff loss of consortium.
factually,the complaint alleged that the tools were specifically designed to be used with abrasive wheels or discs,for the intended purpose of grinding and sanding metals,that the tools necessarily operated with wheels or discs composed of aluminum oxide and other inorganic material,that when the tools were used for their intended purpose,respirable metallic dust from the metal being ground and from the abrasive wheels and discs was generated and released into the air,causing the injury,and that the specifically designed,intended,and reasonably foreseeable use of the tools resulted in the injury.
appellants describe the complaint as alleging that the discs and wheels do not create respirable metallic dust unless they are used with respondents power tools,because it is the speed and force of those tools which cause the dust to become airborne.this is perhaps not crisply alleged,but the complaint must be liberally construed king central bank cal d,and the allegation is certainly inferable from the complaint references to the force and abrasive action of the tools,alleged to create respirable dust.
the complaint alleges that respondents were aware of the danger,and that was not.
on the design defect cause of action,the allegations are that the tools lacked local exhaust ventilation devices necessary to prevent or minimize the release of metallic or inorganic dusts during the intended use of the tools.the allegations on the failure to warn cause of action are the usual ones,that the tools lacked warnings that their intended use would result in the release of dust capable of causing disease,and lacked instructions concerning such safety precautions as use of a respirator.the fraudulent concealment cause of action alleges failure to disclose and concealment of hazards.the allegations of the breach of implied warranty cause of action are similar.
legally,appellants relied on standard products liability law.they contended that respondents had a duty to warn of the known or knowable health hazards resulting from the intended use of their products.anderson fiberglas cal d,wright stang manufacturing th,d faultlessly made product is defective if unreasonably dangerous to place in the hands of a user without a suitable warning and there is no warning.on the design defect cause of action,they contended that they stated a cause of action under both the consumer expectations test and the risk benefit test.arena fiberglas th,d.
the gist of respondents demurrer was that they were not liable because the harm if any was caused by the wheels,discs,and belts,and not by their tools.that is,they contended that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because there was no allegation that the tools disintegrated or devolved into toxic the abrasives and the materials being ground did that.respondents made this argument under several legal theories,including causation under bockrath aldrich chemical cal th,d,the component parts doctrine,and uncertainty.citing jimenez superior court cal th,d,powell standard brands paint d,and other cases,they also argue that california has a rule that a manufacturer duty to warn is restricted to its own products.
we are not persuaded that any of those theories support judgment on a demurrer here,under the facts alleged.
discussion 
the component parts doctrine 
we begin with the component parts doctrine,the legal theory that is perhaps the best fit for respondents contention.that doctrine rests on a line of cases holding an entity supplying a nondefective raw material or a component part is not strictly liable for defects in the final product over which it had no control.bay summit community shell oil th,d citing lee electric motor division d.wiler firestone tire rubber d.and walker stauffer chemical d.under the rule of these cases,the manufacturer of a product component or ingredient is not liable for injuries caused by the finished product unless it appears that the component itself was defective when it left the manufacturer.lee electric motor division,supra,d at.springmeyer ford motor th,d rest d torts,products liability.
the policy reasons behind the component parts doctrine are well established m component and raw material suppliers should not have to assure the safety of their materials as used in other companies finished products.first that would require suppliers to retain experts in a huge variety of areas in order to determine the possible risks associated with each potential use.citation.a second,related rationale is that finished product manufacturers know exactly what they intend to do with a component or raw material and therefore are in a better position to guarantee that the component or raw material is suitable for their particular applications.citations.springmeyer ford motor,supra,th,d.
the restatement explains that a seller ordinarily is not liable for failing to incorporate a safety feature that is peculiar to the specific adaptation for which another utilizes the incomplete product.a safety feature important for one adaptation may be wholly unnecessary or inappropriate for a different adaptation.the same considerations also militate against imposing a duty on the seller of the incomplete product to warn purchasers of the incomplete product,or of the integrated product,of dangers arising from special adaptations of the incomplete product by others.rest d torts,products liability,com.d.
the doctrine applies to generic or components,as opposed to those which are really a separate product with a specific purpose and use.citation.springmeyer ford motor,supra,at,d.
respondents claim to be suppliers of generic parts,asserting in their briefs that their tools have many uses,could come into contact with a universe of grindable products,could be assembled using a variety of attachments from different manufacturers,and could be used to manipulate all types of materials,including wood,plastic,glass,and most types of metals.
as appellants argue,these facts contradict the allegations of the complaint,and have no relevance on demurrer.the facts before us are not that respondents manufactured component parts to be used in a variety of finished products,outside their control,but instead that respondents manufactured tools which were specifically designed to be used with the abrasive wheels or discs they were used with,for the intended purpose of grinding and sanding metals,that the tools necessarily operated with those wheels or discs,that the wheels and discs were harmless without the power supplied by the tools,and that when the tools were used for the purpose intended by respondents,harmful respirable metallic dust was released into the air.
the policy reasons identified in the case law and restatement have no application to these allegations.in order to provide warnings,respondents would not have to employ a huge variety of experts,but would only be required to know what happened when their tools were used for their sole intended purpose.respondents would not be required to incorporate safety feature unnecessary for most uses,because
