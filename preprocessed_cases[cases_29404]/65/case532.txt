appellant,guillermo arriaga,was injured when his finger became entangled in a glue spreading machine.this machine was in used condition when purchased by arriaga employer,orepak hardwood products,orepak.the accident occurred because a guard was removed from the glue spreader before orepak took possession.
respondent,citicapital commercial corporation citicapital is the successor in interest to jla credit corporation jla.jla financed the glue spreader through a finance lease for avp,avp.as a lessor under a finance lease,jla did not select,manufacture or supply the machine but,rather,purchased it for,and then rented it to,avp.orepak acquired the glue spreader from avp.
arriaga filed the underlying complaint for personal injury alleging causes of action for strict liability,negligence,and breach of warranty.arriaga named the manufacturer,retailer,and lessee of the glue spreader as defendants.citicapital was also included as the purported of the machine.
citicapital moved for summary judgment on the ground that,as a finance lessor and one time seller of the glue spreader,it was not part of the chain of commerce and thus not subject to strict products liability.citicapital further asserted that it had no duty to inspect the machine for defects before the machine was purchased by orepak and thus could not be held liable for negligence.similarly,citicapital argued that,in its role as a finance lessor,it could not be held liable for breach of implied warranty.
the trial court granted citicapital motion.the court concluded strict liability was inapplicable because citicapital neither manufactured nor assembled the glue spreader.further,assuming citicapital was a seller,and not merely a financing company,the court held that citicapital could not be held strictly liable because the tort does not apply to a seller of a used good who has not rebuilt or reconditioned the product.regarding the negligence claim,the court determined that,again assuming that a financing company is deemed the seller of a used good,citicapital had no duty to inspect or test the product for defects prior to its sale.similarly,under these circumstances,no implied warranties applied.
arriaga contends that citicapital is strictly liable for his injuries because citicapital was instrumental in placing the product into the stream of commerce.for this reason,arriaga argues,citicapital is not a seller of used equipment so as to exempt it from the application of strict product liability.arriaga further asserts that as the of the machine,citicapital was required to exercise reasonable care to inspect the machine before turning it over to the lessee.finally,arriaga argues that,if the machine was sold at all by citicapital,it was sold to orepak directly and an implied warranty of merchantability arose.
as discussed below,summary judgment was properly granted.citicapital was a finance lessor,not a commercial lessor.as the entity that merely provided the financing,citicapital was outside the direct chain of distribution.accordingly,strict liability as a lessor is inapplicable.further,if citicapital is considered to be the seller of the machine,it sold a used product that it had no connection to other than having obtained bare legal title through the financing mechanism.thus,citicapital can not be held liable under either strict products liability or negligence theories.therefore,the judgment will be affirmed.
background 
avp executed a lease agreement with jla to acquire a glue spreading and coating machine.the lease provided that jla,the lessor,was not a dealer or manufacturer of the machine and that the machine was of a size,design,capacity,description and manufacture selected by avp,the lessee.klor machinery,klor was designated in the lease as the supplier of the equipment.jla and avp expressly agreed that the lease was a finance lease as defined by commercial code section,subdivision a.
in the lease,jla disclaimed any warranties including liability to avp or any third party for consequential,incidental,special or exemplary damages arising out of or related to the transaction contemplated hereunder,whether in action based on contract,tort including negligence or strict liability or any other legal theory 
the lease required avp to maintain the equipment in good operating condition,repair and appearance and to protect it from deterioration other than normal wear and tear.further,avp could not modify the machine absent jla prior written consent and jla had the right to inspect the machine at any time.at the end of the lease term,avp had the option to purchase the machine as is for.
two days after the lease was executed,jla ordered the machine specified in the lease from klor.black,the manufacturer of the glue spreading machine,had sold the machine to klor and klor in turn sold the machine to jla.jla took title to the machine,paid for it,and leased it to avp.however,klor shipped the machine directly to avp.
avp used the machine for approximately five years.during that period,avp modified the machine by removing one corner of a safety guard.
near the end of the lease term,avp entered into an agreement to sell certain equipment to orepak.this sale included the glue spreader that had been leased from jla.the purchase price for the glue spreader was,the remaining obligation under the lease.orepak was to pay this amount directly to citicapital,jla successor in interest,and orepak would then own the equipment free and clear of any liens or obligations.orepak wired this amount to citicapital and,pursuant to a bill of sale from avp,took possession of the machine.
thereafter,arriaga,one of orepak employees,was injured while using the machine.arriaga finger became entangled where a portion of the guard had been removed by avp.if the guard had been in place,the accident would not have occurred.
discussion 
standard of review.
a defendant who moves for summary judgment under code of civil procedure section,must either negate a necessary element of the plaintiff cause of action or establish a complete defense to that cause of action.the moving party must demonstrate that a material question of fact requiring examination by the trial court does not exist under any possible hypothesis within the reasonable purview of the allegations of the complaint.if the moving defendant satisfies this obligation,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence creating a triable issue of material fact.code civ,subd.o brantley pisaro th,d.
the trial court properly grants summary judgment where it determines that no triable issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.merrill navegar,cal th,d.the appellate court reviews the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion,except that which the trial court properly excluded,and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.ibid.
citicapital is not strictly liable in tort.
a.the strict products liability doctrine.
under the strict products liability doctrine,a manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market,knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects,proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being.greenman yuba power products,cal d.such liability insures that the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to protect themselves.id.at.
beyond manufacturers,anyone identifiable as an integral part of the overall producing and marketing enterprise is subject to strict liability.vandermark ford motor cal d.accordingly,retailers engaged in the business of distributing goods to the public are strictly liable in tort for personal injuries caused by defects in those goods.ibid.this works no injustice to the manufacturer and retailer because they can apportion the costs of such protection in the course of their continuing business relationship.moreover,such strict liability leads to enhanced product safety since retailers are in a position to exert pressure on manufacturers.finally,by including the retailer as a defendant,the opportunity for an injured consumer to recover is increased.id.at.
similarly,courts have applied the doctrine to others involved in the vertical distribution of consumer goods.thus,lessors of personal property,wholesale and retail distributors,and licensors are subject to strict products liability.bay summit community shell oil th,d.although not necessarily involved in the manufacture or design of the final product,these defendants were responsible for passing the product down the line to the consumer and are able to bear the cost of compensating for injuries.ibid.
strict liability also applies where a nonmanufacturing party is outside the vertical chain of distribution of the product,but plays an integral role in the producing and marketing enterprise of a defective product and profit s from placing the product into the stream of commerce.bay summit community shell oil,supra,th at,d.imposing strict liability under these circumstances is an expression of policy that once an entity is instrumental in placing a defective product into the stream of commerce,then liability should attach without regard to conduct fault.ibid.
nevertheless,imposition of strict liability based on this stream of commerce or marketing enterprise theory is not limitless.the strict liability doctrine derives from judicially perceived public policy considerations,enhancing product safety,maximizing protection to the injured plaintiff,and apportioning costs among the defendants.vandermark ford motor,supra,cal d at,bay summit community shell oil,supra,th at,d.where these policy justifications are not applicable,the courts have refused to hold the defendant strictly liable even if that defendant could technically be viewed as a link in the chain in getting the product to the consumer market.bay summit community shell oil,supra,th at,d.in other words,the facts must establish a sufficient causative relationship or connection between the defendant and the product so as to satisfy the policies underlying the strict liability doctrine.id.at,d.
in bay summit community shell oil,supra,th,d,the court set forth the factors required to establish such a causative relationship or connection.the court concluded that to hold a defendant strictly liable under a theory,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant received a direct financial benefit from its activities and from the sale of the product the defendant role was integral to the business enterprise such that the defendant conduct was a necessary factor in bringing the product to the initial consumer market and the defendant had control over,or a substantial ability to influence,the manufacturing or distribution process.id.at,d.
b.the parties executed a finance lease.
a finance lease as defined in commercial code section,subdivision a,is the product of a transaction.the lessor does not select,manufacture,or supply the goods.rather,the supplier manufactures or supplies the goods pursuant to the lessee specifications.as explained in the california comment to this section,after the prospective finance lease is negotiated,a purchase order,sales agreement,or lease agreement is entered into by the lessor as buyer or prime lessee or an existing order,agreement or lease is assigned by the lessee to the lessor,and the lessor and the lessee then enter into a lease or sublease of the goods.cal,of the assem.com.on judiciary,west ann.ed.foll.the lessor usually performs a limited function and thus the lessee looks almost entirely to the supplier for representations,covenants and warranties.the focus of a finance lease is the transaction,not the status of the parties.ibid.moreover,finance lease status may be achieved by agreement of the parties.ibid.the california definition of a finance lease parallels the uniform commercial code.
california courts have not yet considered the distinguishing characteristics of a finance lease and commercial lease but some federal courts and other jurisdictions have.these opinions analyze uniform commercial code finance leases.since california has also adopted the uniform commercial code definition of finance lease,this court can look to those opinions for guidance.
to a substantial extent,a finance lessor may be analogized to a bank that loans money to its clients.rivera mahogony corporation d.however,rather than simply loaning the money for the purchase to the ultimate user of the equipment,the transaction is set up as a lease,with the lessor purchasing the equipment for the specific purpose of renting it to the user.ibid.accordingly,the finance lease can be thought of as a disguised security agreement,a secured installment sales contract,or a lease intended as security.nath national equipment leasing.normally,the lessor is unfamiliar with the particular equipment involved.rivera mahogony corporation,supra,at.further,although this security agreement is written in lease form,the finance lessor does not expect to retake the equipment at the end of the lease period.nath national equipment leasing,supra,at.therefore,the parties generally execute a contemporaneous option whereby the user can purchase title to the equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease period for an amount less than the then expected value of the equipment.rivera mahogony corporation,supra,at.
in contrast,the commercial lease is what is commonly meant by the word lease.with a commercial lease,the lessor supplies the particular equipment,selects the product and places it into the stream of commerce.in theory,the lessor allows the lessee to use the equipment for some fraction of its useful life but fully expects to retake the equipment at the end of the lease term and either resell or it.this right to possession of the equipment upon default or expiration of the lease is known as the equipment reversion.nath national equipment leasing,supra,at.
here,the lease for the glue spreader was clearly a finance lease.as detailed above,it was a transaction.avp selected the machine and it was supplied by klor.jla ordered the machine after the lease was negotiated and klor shipped the machine directly to avp.avp had the option to purchase the machine at the end of the lease period for the nominal sum of.moreover,the parties to the lease agreed that the transaction was a finance lease.
c.the policy considerations behind imposing strict products liability on those involved in the vertical distribution of consumer goods are not furthered by including finance lessors.
arriaga contends that citicapital is strictly liable for his injuries as the original purchaser of the glue spreader who introduced this product into the stream of commerce.according to arriaga,citicapital is an integral part of the overall producing and marketing enterprise that should bear the cost of injuries from this defective product.
generally,commercial lessors of personal property will be subject to strict liability because,as with manufacturers and retailers,lessors place the article on the market,knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects.price shell oil cal d.nevertheless,the lessor must be found to be in the business of leasing,in the same general sense as the seller of personalty is found to be in the business of manufacturing or retailing,engaged in the business of distributing goods to the public.id.at.
however,as noted above,strict liability is not imposed even if the defendant is technically a link in the chain in getting the product to the consumer market if the judicially perceived policy considerations are not satisfied.thus,a defendant will not be held strictly liable unless doing so will enhance product safety,maximize protection to the injured plaintiff,and apportion costs among the defendants.vandermark ford motor,supra,cal d at,bay summit community shell oil,supra,th at,d.
a finance lessor,such as citicapital,does not select the specific machine or manufacturer of the machine.accordingly,unlike a retailer or a commercial lessor,the finance lessor does not maintain an ongoing relationship with a particular manufacturer.thus,the finance lessor is not in any position to ei
