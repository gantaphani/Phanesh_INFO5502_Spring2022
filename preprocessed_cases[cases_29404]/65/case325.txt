royce dale young was injured while working as a die man at alexandria extrusion company aec.a die man loads dies into a die changer,here manufactured by pollock engineering group.a operates the die changer from a control panel,which was provided by computech about three years after the installation of the die changer.once activated,the die changer inserts dies into an extrusion press.
on the night of the injury,young was loading dies into the die changer while robbie joe betterman operated the control panel.not intending any harm,betterman activated the die changer,severely injuring young left hand.aec later installed a barrier guard or barrier fence around the die changer 
invoking diversity jurisdiction,young sued pollock for negligence and strict liability in defectively designing the die changer.young also sued for failure to warn of the dangers associated with the product.the district court granted summary judgment to pollock,computech,and lewis deland on all counts.on appeal,young attacks the judgment only as to pollock.this court affirms the summary judgment on the claim,but reverses as to the claims.
this court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.see essco geometric harvard,cir.summary judgment is affirmed where there is no genuine issue of material fact,and judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.see,citing.c.this court construes the facts in favor of the party.see rsbi aerospace,affiliated fm ins,cir,citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
a plaintiff asserting defective design under minnesota law must establish that the defendant product was in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous for its intended use.see bilotta kelley,en banc,citing lee crookston bottling.to determine whether there is enough evidence to submit the claim to a jury,the court must balance the likelihood of harm,and the gravity of harm if it happens,against the burden of the precaution which would be effective to avoid the harm.see bilotta,at,quoting holm sponco,en banc.see generally trost trek bicycle,cir summarizing minnesota law.
an important factor in this balancing test is the availability of a feasible,safer alternative design.see kallio ford motor,en banc.only in rare cases do claims succeed without showing a safer design.see id.at.conceivably,rare cases may exist where the product may be judged unreasonably dangerous because it should be removed from the market rather than be redesigned.id.in minnesota,successful plaintiffs,almost without fail,introduce evidence of an alternative safer design.id.at citing cases.
young relies on the affidavits of two expert witnesses,both mechanical engineers.tarald kvalseth,states that a number of feasible,safer designs could have prevented young injuries.as an example,pollock could have installed a barrier guard like the one installed after young injuries.kvalseth states that the barrier guard could be an effective safety device when used with an interlock switch that disables the die changer while the gate to the barrier guard is open.kenneth blundell,agrees that an alternative design could have prevented young injuries.like kvalseth,he proposes a barrier guard with an interlock switch.
although acknowledging the experts opinions,the district court granted summary judgment on the claims.the district court holds 
young does not contest that his proposed safety enhancements are external work area modifications available for purchase off the shelf,rather than mechanisms incorporated into the design of the die changer or permanently attached to the product.huber niagara mach.tool works,en banc.this fact readily distinguishes the instant case from that relied on by young,in which the court found a manufacturer could be liable for defective design based upon exclusion of an integral safety component from some of its models.bilotta,at.young does not suggest or reference an alternative die changer design that includes a safety device,and cites no authority for his proposition that the failure to recommend external safeguards made by different manufacturers can constitute a defect in design.accordingly,his claim is appropriately one of failure to warn and it will be addressed as such.summary judgment for pollock is thus warranted on the issue of defective design.
the district court reasoning is erroneous in two respects.first,young did not concede that his proposed modifications should not have been incorporated into the design of the die changer.in written suggestions young argued plaintiff experts have identified other feasible safety devices that could have been used to safeguard the die changer,and which should have been incorporated by pollock in its original design of the product.emphasis added.young restated his position during oral argument in the district court.
young position is supported by the affidavits of his expert witnesses,who advocate alternative designs of the die changer itself.in the same sentence where kvalseth says that the proposed safety modifications are available off the shelf,he also states that pollock should have incorporated them into the design.blundell agrees in his affidavit and attached report.
pollock counters that during his deposition,kvalseth agreed he was not proposing modifications to the functioning or configuration of the die slide itself and,his proposed modifications were not physically attached to the die slide.however,kvalseth later said in his deposition that industry standards do not permit a manufacturer to design an extrusion press and just leave out guards.kvalseth deposition,interpreted in young favor,says that the die changer itself was unreasonably dangerous.
blundell deposition,interpreted in young favor,is to the same effect.blundell,after opining that the manufacturer should provide safeguards,testified that pollock should have examined the die changer for hazards and identified the lack of safeguards.
pollock argues that the experts testimony is inadmissible because they failed to take measurements to determine the feasibility of the safety modifications they propose.testimony may be excluded if an expert fails to explain how a proposed safety modification would protect the machine operators without compromising the machine utility.see unrein timesavers,cir holding that the district court properly excluded kvalseth testimony regarding an industrial sander.however,in this case the experts did not need to conduct a detailed feasibility study of the barrier guard because aec had installed the barrier guard and used it successfully with the die changer.both experts explained that the barrier with a simple switch to cut the power to the die changer while the gate of the barrier guard is be an effective safety device.in sum,young presented admissible evidence supporting his allegation that the die changer itself was defective and unreasonably dangerous.see anderson,at.
second,the district court erroneously concluded that minnesota law recognizes a distinction between external work area modifications and integral safeguards,in design defect cases.for that conclusion,the district court cites huber,which was not a defective design case.rather,it held that the manufacturer of a component foot switch with a permanently attached safety device did not have the duty to warn users that the safety device should not be removed.see huber,at.
the closest minnesota authority is harmon contract glazing,which held that the plaintiff could not recover for defective design of a shipping brace that secured glass panes during transit because the brace was not an integral part of the product itself.id.unlike the brace in harmon,the barrier guard young proposes would have been integrated into the product during its normal use.see cerepak revlon,deodorant bottle holkestad bottling of,en banc bottle.
other than these cases,the distinction external versus integral or internal does not appear in the minnesota cases.in deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate as a matter of law,this court therefore follows the leading case,bilotta,where the minnesota supreme court states that allowing manufacturers to sell products without adequate s
