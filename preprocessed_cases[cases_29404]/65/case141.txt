on october,lova bryte died in a fire in her preston county,west virginia apartment.she was using an electrically heated throw at the time of the fire.several weeks later,plaintiffs,bryte personal representative and relatives,brought this action against defendant american household,formerly sunbeam,the manufacturer of the throw.plaintiffs alleged that the electric throw had a defective safety circuit and that this defect caused the deadly fire.at trial,the district court excluded various evidence,including expert testimony,offered by plaintiffs to prove the causation and defect elements of their claims.at the close of plaintiffs case,the district court granted defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that plaintiffs had not established sufficient evidence of causation.plaintiffs appeal from the district court evidentiary rulings and the ensuing judgment for defendant.we affirm.
though the record on appeal is extensive,the basic facts of this case are not disputed.bryte had begun using the electric throw in question about two years before the fire occurred,after having suffered a stroke.as a result of her stroke,bryte could not pick herself up from her recliner without assistance,and her movement was limited to shifting in the chair.also as a result of her stroke,bryte used the electric throw throughout the year to keep warm when sitting in her recliner.typically,she would have had placed over her a blanket or afghan and the throw would be laid on top of the blanket.when in use,the electric throw would be plugged directly in to a wall outlet on bryte left.when not in use,the throw was draped over the back of the recliner or a.the throw had not malfunctioned and there was no visible damage to it or its power cord.
other than the recliner,the living room of bryte apartment contained a,a television and vcr,a coffee table,a telephone,and a small table to the right of the recliner,which table had a lamp and a candle on it.bryte did not smoke.
the morning of the fire,bryte and her,donna miller,were in the apartment alone.during the late morning or early afternoon,miller assisted bryte into the recliner and then retrieved the electric throw from the back of the.miller covered bryte with a blanket,then with the throw,plugged the throw in to a wall outlet to the left of the recliner,and turned it on to the low setting.the throw was not tucked in around bryte sides.the power cord extended,at bryte feet,from the throw,and the temperature control rested on the floor to bryte left below her feet.bryte did not adjust the temperature control herself.at around,miller had lighted the candle that sat on the small table to the right of the recliner.according to miller,at that time the candle was partly burned,and,as far as she saw,the flame had not extended above the rim of the glass candle container.miller also testified that bryte was unable to reach the candle,or the lamp that also was on the table.bryte could,however,reach a part of the table for such things as a denture cup,a star magazine,a cookbook,a bible and her glasses.
miller left the apartment at to pick up bryte granddaughter from school,leaving the candle lighted and the electric throw turned on.miller returned to the apartment at,she estimated,at which time she heard bryte calling for help.upon entering the apartment,miller saw smoke and fire coming up the left side of bryte recliner and heard snapping and cracking.miller did not see any flames related to the power supply cord of the electric throw and she could not identify more specifically the source of the flames,other than the fact that the flame was down beside bryte chair and up on her leg.miller tried,but was unable,to extinguish the fire.while in the apartment,however,miller was able to see that the candle was still lighted and that neither it nor the lamp had been moved or overturned.the flames and smoke forced miller to flee the apartment to get the children out.
shortly after the fire was extinguished,and before the removal of bryte remains,assistant state fire marshall mack dennis was called to the scene.at that time,dennis had been employed by the west virginia state fire marshall office as a cause and origin investigator for over years.while he was not certified as a fire investigator,he had attended numerous courses in arson and explosive investigation.dennis investigation of the fire scene traced the fire path,starting from bryte left side and moving around the room.dennis took photographs of the fire scene and made a diagram of the room where the fire occurred,which located the large artifacts in the room.dennis took oral,not written,statements from the witnesses to the fire.
dennis diagram did not indicate the wall outlets located in the room.he did observe,however,that the wall outlet immediately to bryte left had an electrical service cord plugged into it,and the remains of that cord came over to bryte and was sic laying across her arm.dennis report later characterized the cord as wrapped around bryte left arm.he did not measure the cord or the exact distance between the wall outlet to her left and bryte body,but approximated the distance to be two and a half feet.dennis did not recover or photograph the service cord that he saw draped across bryte body.indeed,dennis did not know at first what this cord was for only later,after speaking with family members and miller,did he learn that bryte had been using an electric throw at the time of the fire.
dennis did not know that there was a lamp,or observe any other cord,plugged in to the same wall outlet as the cord found on bryte.but there was another cord,an extension cord running from a wall outlet behind the chair,to the lamp on the table.moreover,he did not inspect the outlet wiring.dennis nonetheless excluded the outlet,and also the table,candle,and lamp as potential origins of the fire based on his discussions with miller and family members.also,he made this determination without knowing how the candle had been lighted.
dennis only report,issued the day of the fire,concluded that the cause of the fire was improper use of an electric blanket.specifically,dennis recorded miller as having told him that the electric throw was around bryte.dennis later may have concluded,for reasons that are unclear due to interruptions in his testimony,that the throw may not have been used improperly.but he nevertheless maintained that the throw was the cause of the fire.
critically,dennis did not recover any artifacts or samples from the scene.dennis testified that he had no reason to do so,nor did he advise the brytes to preserve the fire scene or any of its artifacts,for the same reason i had no reason to believe it the fire was other than accidental.apparently no one,until his attorney did,instructed david,bryte son,about preserving evidence from the fire scene,and david removed the debris,including the recliner and electrical devices,and disposed of it at a landfill that he owned 
plaintiffs filed this suit about six weeks later,on december,in addition to dennis,plaintiffs retained cronenwett as an expert witness to offer opinion testimony regarding the specific cause of the fire.in his first deposition,cronenwett opined that the electric throw was the ignition source of the fire.he based that opinion on t he absence of any other ignition source in the area,the snapping and crackling that was heard,the fact that bryte was confined to her chair,did not smoke and had no opportunity or means to set herself on fire,and the fact that there been a number of instances where the sunbeam electrically heated bedding products have spontaneously burst into flames.more specifically,cronenwett testified that the blanket caused the fire due to defectively designed circuitry.he acknowledged,however,that his opinion that the defective circuitry in the throw had caused the fire rested wholly on the conclusion of dennis cronenwett attributed his inability to independently identify the specific source of ignition to the fact that there was no remaining physical evidence after the fire.
cronenwett was deposed twice,the second time in april.in addition to repeating his earlier questions,counsel for defendant repeatedly asked cronenwett whether he could identify evidence of a malfunction in the electric throw that could reliably support his conclusion that the electric throw caused the fire.to each such question with respect to various specific defects,cronenwett acknowledged that he could not,explaining,for example,that i never saw any physical evidence of the blanket,so i do know what the specific cause of the ignition was.moreover,when asked whether there was any evidence in this case that can reliably support a conclusion that there was any defect in any component part of the electric throw that caused the fire in this case cronenwett responded no.ja.
prior to trial,defendant moved for summary judgment based on failure of causation and plaintiffs spoliation of the physical evidence of the fire.defendant also moved to exclude the testimony of dennis and cronenwett and dallas and hull under.and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,on the related ground that neither had a reliable basis for his opinion that the electric throw or a defect therein had caused the fire.in his report and recommendation,the magistrate judge recommended denying defendant motions,except as to dallas,whose opinion he deemed unreliable.defendant objected to the report and recommendation the district court overruled those objections but treated the motions as pending,took them under advisement,and instructed the parties that it would rule on them at trial.
the case was tried on december.at trial,plaintiffs attempted to offer the expert testimony of dennis and cronenwett in support of the claims that the electric throw was the cause of the fire,and a design defect in the blanket was specifically responsible for ignition.contrary to the report and recommendation,the district court considered plaintiffs proffers and determined that,under daubert,neither expert had a sufficiently reliable basis for his opinion,and it thus excluded dennis and cronenwett testimony as to causation.the district court also excluded plaintiffs evidence about other,similar accidents and reports of defects.the district court then concluded that plaintiffs had not introduced evidence sufficient to permit a jury finding that the electric throw had caused the fire.therefore,at the conclusion of plaintiffs case the district court granted defendant rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law.this appeal followed.
plaintiffs assert five assignments of error 
i.the trial court failed to properly apply the malfunction theory of circumstantial evidence in products liability cases when the product is destroyed.
ii.the trial court misapplied the flexible daubert analysis of rule to exclude expert testimony from mack dennis and cronenwett because there was no testing.
iii.under the malfunction theory of circumstantial evidence,other relevant evidence of product defect and safety should have been admitted.
iv.either with or without the improperly excluded evidence,there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to submit the case to the jury.
v.the trial court conduct during trial demonstrated bias,prejudging of the case,and overall meddling in the presentation of evidence so as to deprive plaintiffs of due process and a fair trial before an impartial tribunal.appellants br.i,ii.
appellate review of a district court interpretation or application of state law is de novo.see james circuit city stores,cir.conversely,the district court has broad latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence,including expert opinion,and we will not overturn daubert evidentiary rulings with respect to relevance and reliability absent an abuse of discretion.see joiner,d.a district court abuses its discretion if its conclusion is guided by erroneous legal principles,or if it rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.see westberry gislaved gummi,cir.finally,we review de novo the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law,see freeman case,cir,cert.denied,d,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,see brown csx transp,cir.
taken together,we must determine whether the admissible evidence,viewed most favorably to plaintiffs,would have allowed the jury to render a verdict in their favor under west virginia law.
we first address assignments of error i and ii which state plaintiffs principal claim on appeal,which is that the district court erred in applying daubert rather than substantive west virginia law as to causation.in essence,plaintiffs rely on several west virginia cases and argue that,when a product allegedly causing a fire has been destroyed by that fire,plaintiffs are allowed to rely on the malfunction theory and circumstantial evidence to prove that a defect in that product caused the fire.the argument goes that evidence as to causation is not controlled by daubert and the federal rules of evidence,rather by the substantive law of west virginia which is claimed to embrace the malfunction theory of proof of causation.
plaintiffs characterize the district court decisions on evidence as reversible disregard for west virginia law.the following colloquy at trial succinctly illustrates plaintiffs argument and the district court explanation for rejecting it 
plaintiffs attorney t he law in the fourth circuit and in west virginia is that an expert need not review product remains to arrive at an opinion as to the probable defect in it.
court the evidence law is the federal rules of evidence.
as the transcript shows,plaintiffs essentially advocate applying west virginia law rather than the federal rules of evidence where,as here,claims,destruction of physical evidence,causation,and expert testimony converge.
the position of the district court was correct and has been decided in cavallo star enterprise,cir.in that case the district court,as here,entered a judgment for the defendant,having excluded expert testimony as to the cause of the various chronic illnesses of the plaintiff.the expert witnesses had offered testimony that the plaintiff exposure to petroleum vapors from jet fuel spilled or leaked by the defendant had caused the plaintiff illnesses,upon which she sued.the court excluded the evidence because it was not supported by appropriate validation,as required by daubert merrell dow,d.the position of the cavallo plaintiffs in virginia,similar to that taken here by the bryte plaintiffs in west virginia,was that virginia law should apply as to the admissibility of the testimony 
the cavallos assert that,because their claims are grounded in virginia state law and were originally filed in virginia state court,the admissibility of expert testimony should be governed by virginia law.
however,we followed our decision in scott sears,roebuck,cir and affirmed the district court,quoting from scott,at 
unlike evidentiary rules concerning burdens of proof or presumptions,the admissibility of expert testimony in federal court sitting in the diversity jurisdiction is controlled by federal law.state law,whatever it may be,is irrelevant.
this argument has been rejected by other courts of appeals in similar cases dependent on expert testimony.for example,in ealy,the defendants appealed the district court denial of their motion for judgment in a bendectin case.plaintiffs defended the verdict in their favor by arguing that erie railway tompkins,required the district court to follow an earlier district of columbia court of appeals decision that had affirmed a jury verdict for different plaintiffs based on the same four types of expert data relied upon by the federal plaintiffs.ealy,at.the circuit agreed with defendants that reliance on state decisional law was not required.ealy,at t he admissibility of expert testimony is a procedural matter which does not implicate the principles underlying erie citation omitted.the court explained its holding,that the district court abused its discretion in admitting unreliable expert testimony accepted by the state court,in terms applicable to this case 
unfortunately for plaintiffs,the only evidence they have on the issue of scientific causation is the testimony of their experts.once that testimony is deemed inadmissible,it is that the evidence is in
