background 
the employees sued to recover compensatory and punitive damages for alleged personal injuries suffered as a result of exposure to products at the stennis space center.they contend exposure to products have resulted in injuries,which include cbd and bes.on november,the district court consolidated this matter with paz brush engineered materials,in which the plaintiffs alleged a medical monitoring cause of action against brush and boeing.
brush and boeing jointly moved for dismissal on the medical monitoring cause of action,which the district court granted.paz brush engineered materials,d,paz i.the paz plaintiffs appealed to this court,which certified the question to the mississippi supreme court of whether mississippi law recognized a cause of action for medical monitoring without proof of physical injury.paz brush engineered materials,cir paz ii.the mississippi supreme court answered c reating a medical monitoring action would be contrary to mississippi common law,which does not allow recovery for negligence without showing an identifiable injury,and,further,strongly indicates that a claim for medical monitoring,as plaintiffs present it,lacks an injury.paz brush engineered materials,so d,paz iii.this court concluded the paz case was controlled by the mississippi supreme court holding in paz iii,and accordingly affirmed the district court decision.paz brush engineered materials,cir.
on september,brush moved for summary judgment on the employees remaining claims,arguing the employees failed to allege a compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law.boeing joined in brush summary judgment motion in august,eight months after brush filed for summary judgment,the employees filed a supplemental opposition to the summary judgment motion,claiming lisa maier maier,an expert in the field of cbd and bes,diagnosed pittman with cbd,in consultation with jerrold abraham abraham,and submitting maier testimony and report as evidence.brush sought discovery on the diagnosis.
the district court entered a discovery order on october,directing the employees to provide brush with slides and samples related to pittman biopsy by november,and permitting brush to depose maier and abraham.contrary to this order,the employees did not produce slides or samples related to pittman biopsy until may.on april,after brush had deposed maier and abraham,brush moved the district court to exclude maier testimony and report regarding pittman diagnosis.on june,brush moved the district court to exclude two slides of pittman biopsy because the employees failed to produce the slides in accordance with the october,discovery order.
in its october,order and reasons,the district court,relying on daubert,found maier testimony and report unreliable and excluded them.based on its rule discretion and the slides unreliability,the district court excluded the two slides.the district court concluded the mississippi supreme court would find bes is not a compensable injury as a matter of law.
the district court granted summary judgment on harris,pittman,lemon,sorapuru,and the wives claims.it found,however,there was a dispute of material fact regarding whether moran had cbd and denied summary judgment on moran claim.on november,the employees moved the district court to reconsider its entire october,order and reasons,which the district court denied in its entirety on november.on november,brush moved the district court to reconsider its denial of summary judgment on moran claim,which the district court granted.
the district court entered a final judgment,and the employees have appealed.on appeal,the employees contend the district court erred in excluding maier expert testimony and report excluding two additional slides from evidence finding bes is not a compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law and finding moran did not have cbd.

the district court found maier march,evaluation of pittman lung biopsy identified no interstitial or bronchial wall granulomas,but that further evaluation based on the presence of giant cells on biopsy was warranted.the district court determined maier sent four of pittman pathology slides and one of his tissue blocks to abraham,who examined the slides and reported on june,that lung tissues in the block revealed small granulomas.the district court found maier assumed abraham made additional cuts of the biopsy for his evaluation,and based on those additional cuts,maier concluded pittman had cbd,without additional evaluation.
the district court concluded maier testimony and diagnosis,as it related to pittman,should be excluded because it was unreliable pursuant to daubert.the district court found maier diagnosis of pittman to be unreliable because she had based it on a false assumption.she assumed abraham made additional cuts,upon which he noted granulomas,whereas abraham testimony confirmed he made no additional cuts.the district court found maier had not made her own independent evaluation of abraham findings,but rather based her diagnosis on abraham report,which he later was unable to substantiate.the district court determined maier testimony and report were based on insufficient,erroneous information,and excluded them as unreliable evidence.
alternatively the district court found maier diagnosis of pittman as having cbd based only on the presence of giant cells,without any indication of granulomas or mononuclear cellular interstitial infiltrates,was also unreliable under daubert.the district court found the employees proffer of articles,which stated a diagnosis of cbd could be based on the presence of giant cells found in combination with either or both granulomas and mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrates,was unavailing because none of the articles supported a diagnosis of cbd on the basis of giant cells alone.the district court found maier assertion that the presence of giant cells alone could lead to a diagnosis of cbd failed to satisfy the daubert standard because the basis of such a diagnosis had not been tested or subjected to peer review or publication,and otherwise was not generally accepted in the medical community,and her mere assurances her methodology for diagnosis was generally accepted in the scientific community was insufficient to render her testimony and report reliable pursuant to daubert.
the district court decision to exclude maier report and testimony was not an abuse of discretion.the record demonstrated maier sought abraham assistance in reviewing pittman biopsy.abraham acknowledged receiving only four slides from maier.the record indicated abraham report to maier noted small granulomas and no significant foreign material.the record revealed abraham could not remember making additional slides or cuts and could not recall noting small granulomas on the four slides he did receive.the record supported the contention that maier relied upon abraham finding of granulomas on biopsy.the record demonstrated maier believed abraham had made an evaluation of additional lung tissue,which did reveal small granulomas.the record showed abraham made no such slides.maier admitted in her own deposition testimony she was unaware of whether abraham made additional cuts and slides,but still believed abraham report was correct.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding maier report and testimony of pittman diagnosis with cbd was unreliable because it was based on erroneous information.the record demonstrated maier predicated her diagnosis of pittman,in part,on abraham supposed analysis of additional slides.maier diagnosis was fundamentally based on insufficient information,rendering her conclusion unreliable,see curtis,at.therefore,the district court properly excluded the testimony and report.
the district court committed no reversible error in finding maier reliance on the presence of giant cells to diagnose pittman with cbd was unreliable.the record demonstrated maier initial review of his biopsy revealed only giant cells which is concerning for progression to cbd and not granulomas on biopsy.during her deposition,maier confirmed she did not see granulomas on slides she reviewed at national jewish.
the district court reviewed the record to determine whether it supported a diagnosis of cbd based on giant cells.see knight,at finding expert testimony may be unreliable if not generally accepted in the scientific community.the district court reviewed the articles maier submitted to the district court to support her independent finding of cbd in pittman based on giant cells and found they did not support maier contention.the district court committed no reversible error because the record demonstrated maier own research asserts a diagnosis of cbd requires both an indication of bes and either granulomas or mononuclear infiltrates.newman et,beryllium sensitization progresses to chronic beryllium disease a longitudinal study of disease risk,am.of respiratory critical care medicine,newman et.i cbd was defined as evidence of bes with granulomas mononuclear cell infiltrates in lung tissue.the district court also found no evidence in the record that maier diagnosis based on giant cells had been tested or peer reviewed.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding maier testimony and report about her diagnosis of pittman as having cbd.
admissibility of pittman two additional slides 
in its order and reasons,the district court explained its october,discovery order required the employees to provide brush any tissue slides or samples relating to pittman by november.the district court found the employees failure to provide brush the two slides of pittman tissue,which were purportedly the subject of abraham report,a violation of the discovery order and reviewed the employees failure to comply under barrett test.barrett test includes consideration of 
the explanation,if any,for the party failure to comply with the discovery order 
the prejudice to the opposing party of allowing the witnesses to testify 
the possibility of curing such prejudice by granting a continuance and 
the importance of the witnesses testimony.
at citation omitted.
the district court found the employees failed to offer a persuasive explanation for their failure to provide brush the slides.the district court determined the introduction of the slides would materially prejudice brush because it could lead to a continuance,which would result in further delay and expense in defending the lawsuit.the district court acknowledged the potential importance of the slides to pittman had they been reliable.however,the district court found the slides were unreliable because it remained unknown who prepared the slides,where they were prepared,when they were prepared,or if they even originated from pittman biopsy.therefore,the district court concluded the additional slides should be excluded for plaintiffs unexcused failure to comply with the october,discovery order and their unreliability.the district court affirmed this decision in its denial of the employees motion to reconsider.
in light of the record as a whole,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the two additional slides.the district court found the employees explanation for the failure to obtain the slides for brush insufficient in light of the clear language of the district court october,discovery order.the record supports that maier,in her position at national jewish,had reasonable access to the slides to have them produced for brush 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the introduction of the slides into evidence would prejudice brush,despite the employees contention there would be no prejudice because the district court could simply order production of the slides.what the employees omit,in briefing this argument,is that the district court did order production of the slides in its october,discovery order.in fact,the district court ordered the employees to provide brush any tissue slides or samples relating to pittman by november.based on the employees previous violation of the october,discovery order,the district court reasonably concluded a second order would further delay the proceedings.
the record supported the slides were unreliable because abraham and employees counsel acknowledged abraham made no additional cuts on pittman biopsy,and therefore there should have been no additional slides to review.the district court reasonably concluded there was no information regarding where,when,and who prepared the slides and whether they even contained pittman tissue.maier asserts the chain of custody had been followed,but her own email disputes the chain of custody remained intact.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the two additional slides to be unreliable and exercising its rule discretion to exclude the slides.

possible injuries to maintain any of the employees claims 
pursuant to mississippi law,claims of negligence,products liability,and breach of warranty all require an identifiable injury according to maier,bes is by definition the demonstration of an abnormal immune response to beryllium,usually,though not always based on an abnormal beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test belpt.the belpt is used to determine whether an individual is at risk for developing cbd.stange et,the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test relevant issues in beryllium health surveillance,am.of industrial medicine,citations omitted.according to the employees evidence,bes is diagnosed with the presence of two positive belpts id.at.the admissible evidence in the record shows an appropriate diagnosis of cbd includes the presence of either granulomas or mononuclear cell infiltrates and bes.maier own body of research supports this 
based on a de novo review of the record,pittman sorapuru lemon and are sensitized to beryllium.the evidence in the record demonstrates there is a dispute of material fact regarding whether harris has been sensitized to beryllium the record reveals pittman sorapuru lemon and moran do not have cbd.in its october,decision,the district court held there was a dispute of material fact regarding whether moran had cbd,and therefore denied brush motion for summary judgment on moran claim.in addressing brush motion for reconsideration,the district court reversed its previous ruling and found harber possible cbd diagnosis for moran to be unreliable,where there was no indication of granulomas or mononuclear infiltrates.
on appeal,the employees dispute the district court finding regarding moran claim.based on a review of the record,however,the employees argument is unavailing.no evidence submitted by any of the parties demonstrates moran exhibits the diagnostic criteria for cbd absent a finding of granulomas or mononuclear cellular infiltrate on biopsy for moran,the evidence demonstrates there is no dispute of material fact that moran has cbd.see newman et.i,supra,at.therefore,the district court did not err in granting brush motion for reconsideration and summary judgment on moran claims.
is bes a compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law 
the issue that remains before the court is whether the bes moran,sorapuru,lemon,and pittman exhibit is a compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law,therefore rendering the district court grant of summary judgment inappropriate.the district court found mississippi law had not spoken on whether bes was a compensable injury,but determined,a bsent clear guidance from mississippi courts,and due to the conflicts among states as to the necessary showing for a compensable injury,it could not find that an immune response such as bes creates a new or separate compensable injury or cause of action under mississippi law.
the employees argue bes is a present injury and the beginning of an actual disease process,specifically the beginning stage of cbd,and therefore there is a reasonable probability of future consequences from bes.brush contends bes is not an injury mississippi law recognizes,and therefore any future consequences from bes are not compensable.brush argues the employees characterization of bes as an injury is irrelevant because the issue of whether it is compensable is a question of law and not of fact.
the employees expert,maier,is an occupational pulmonologist maier believes bes is a present injury,which is an important precursor to the impairing lung disease,cbd.maier concludes bes is a physiologic immune response or injury that occurs to those individuals who have been exposed to beryllium in the workplace or from spouse or community exposure due to industrial beryllium facilities.
maier own chapter on beryllium,however,states bes precedes the formation of granulomas and clinical illness.lee newman lisa maier,chapter beryllium,in clinical environmental health and toxic exposures,john sullivan,gary krieger,ed.maier work also indicates i ndividuals with bes exhibit evidence of an immune response to beryllium but have no evidence of lung pathology or impairment.martyny et,industries historical perspective,in occupational,industrial,and environmental toxicology,michael greenberg et eds,ed.likewise,during her deposition,when describing the nature of cbd,maier distinguished between bes and cbd,noting a difference between the disease itself and health effects.
brush expert,repsher,is a pulmonary physician repsher opines bes is a response in the immune system,which makes an individual capable of having a reaction to beryllium.repsher explains bes is the response of a person immune system to a material it recognizes as an antigen,however he notes a person with bes has no impairment or injury until the person develops cbd.
the evidence clearly establishes excessive exposure to beryllium provokes a physical change in the body,causing bes,and both parties experts agree this takes place that there is a change,however,is not relevant for purposes of determining whether the employees may proceed past the summary judgment phase with their claims.the quintessential issue is whether any physiologic change in the body rises to the level of compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law.the mississippi supreme court holds where there is no dispute as to the facts of a case,the issues to be decided become questions of law.total,of shores,so d,citations omitted.the question of whether bes is a compensable injury,therefore,is a question of law.
mississippi law does not recognize a cause of action for fear of possibly contracting a disease at some point in the future.brewton reichhold,so d,citations omitted.although,the mississippi supreme court has previously acknowledged where it is established that future consequences from an injury to a person will ensue,recovery may be had,but such future consequences must be established in terms of reasonable probabilities.entex,rasberry,so d,citation omitted.where a party fails to proffer substantial proof of exposure and medical evidence that indicates the plaintiffs may contract any disease at any point in time in the future summary judgment is appropriate.brewton,so d at citation omitted.
based on the record,there is simply no dispute the rate of progression from bes to cbd is unknown to any degree of reasonable medical certainty the employee own evidence demonstrates this best.the record is rife with maier and other experts mere conjecture that bes leads to cbd.this speculation is premised upon studies that at best show it is possible for bes to lead to cbd.mere possibility is insufficient.daughtery conley,so d,t estimony in terms of medical probability,rather than possibility,is required by mississippi law.reasonable medical certainty is required.catchings state,so d,o nly opinions formed by medical experts which can be stated with reasonable medical certainty have probative value.therefore,the employees argument there is a reasonable probability of future consequences from bes is simply not backed by evidence in the record.
nonetheless,the mississippi supreme court has held damages could be assessed where physical injury is absent if a defendant conduct was outrageous and foreseeably would cause emotional distress or there wa s a resulting physical illness or assault upon the mind,personality or nervous system of the plaintiff which is medically cognizable and which requires or necessitates treatment by the medical profession.leaf river forest,ferguson,so d,citations omitted.in ferguson,the plaintiffs feared disease from dioxin but failed to produce any evidence of their exposure to it.id.the mississippi supreme court found the plaintiffs lack of evidence of exposure to dangerous or harmful agent s and the lack of medical evidence pointing to possible or probable future illness failed to sufficiently support either type of emotional distress claim.id.ferguson guidance here is unavailing because the record is devoid of any allegation or evidence of intentional or outrageous conduct leading to emotional distress in the employees,nor have the employees shown resulting physical illness or assault upon the mind,personality or nervous system which is medically cognizable and which requires or necessitates treatment by the medical profession.id.
the mississippi supreme court decision in paz iii provides the best insight into whether bes is a compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law.the mississippi supreme court faced the question of w hether the laws of mississippi allow for a medical monitoring cause of action,whereby a plaintiff can recover medical monitoring costs for exposure to a harmful substance without proving current physical injuries from that exposure paz iii,so d at.the mississippi supreme court framed the issue as this plaintiffs claim they should be able to recover damages in the form of medical monitoring costs solely on the basis that they have been exposed to harmful levels of beryllium and are in danger of suffering from latent diseases.id.at citation omitted.
in answering the certified question,the mississippi supreme court made clear that whether it would answer in the affirmative depended upon whether the cause of action includes a compensable injury.id.at.the mississippi supreme court noted exposure to a dangerous substance is not an injury.id.citation omitted.in particular,the mississippi supreme court found e xposure to a potentially harmful substance does not in itself constitute a personal injury.id.citation omitted.
the question before the mississippi supreme court in paz iii was based on allegations very similar to what the employees have alleged in this matter.for instance,the employees in the instant matter have alleged 
h armful exposure to the hazardous substance beryllium causes various personal injuries from,cellular,and damage,to acute and chronic lung disease,dermatologic disease and cancer.respiratory diseases are most commonly seen from harmful exposure to beryllium and manifest themselves on a continuum from acute inhalation injury to acute pneumonitis to bes and the chronic indolent form of cbd.
the paz plaintiffs similarly alleged h armful exposure to the hazardous substance beryllium causes various personal injuries from,cellular,and damage,to acute and chronic lung disease,dermatologic disease and cancer.likewise,they alleged r espiratory diseases are most commonly seen from exposure to beryllium and manifest themselves on a continuum from acute inhalation injury to acute pneumonitis to bes and the chronic indolent form of cbd.
the employees in the instant matter also allege 
a s a foreseeable,direct and proximate result of their exposure to the hazardous substance beryllium,those plaintiffs and other stennis space center workers,contract or outside workers,invitees,and their families already suffer and will suffer in the future personal injuries in the form of,cellular,and damage and some have suffered from acute and chronic lung disease,and cbd.
similarly,the paz plaintiffs alleged 
a s a foreseeable,direct and proximate result of their exposure to the hazardous substance beryllium,plaintiffs and other boeing and dcma employees who work or have worked at stennis and canoga park,and their families,already have suffered and will suffer in the future personal injuries in the form of,cellular,damage,and some will suffer from acute and chronic lung disease,dermatologic disease,and cbd.
hence,the allegations before the district court in this matter were strikingly similar to the allegations before the mississippi supreme court in paz iii.
in answering this court certified question in paz iii,the mississippi supreme court stated a claim for medical monitoring,as plaintiffs present it,lacks an injury.so d at emphasis added.the mississippi supreme court concluded that because mississippi requires the traditional elements of proof in a tort action,it has refused to recognize a category of potential illness actions.id.at emphasis added.the mississippi supreme court noted n one of the plaintiffs ha d suffered physical injury from the alleged exposure.id.at emphasis added.pursuant to mississippi law,exposure is a claim for harm which is not compensable under mississippi law.id.at.
the mississippi supreme court decision in paz iii appears to answer the question of whether bes is a compensable injury as a matter of mississippi law.based on the nearly identical allegations,including and changes,which none of the parties dispute,and which the mississippi supreme court refused to recognize as physical injur ies,the logical conclusion is bes is not a compensable injury pursuant to mississippi law.the mississippi supreme court refused to recognize the same injuries in paz iii to afford those plaintiffs a cause of action for medical monitoring.this court can not circumvent that holding by declaring bes,the same,cellular,and changes alleged by the paz plaintiffs,can now constitute a legal injury,without completely ignoring the mississippi supreme court holding in paz iii.
nonetheless,because the holding in paz iii is not directly on point,this court may look to other available sources,such as treatises and legal commentaries.see centennial ins,at.mississippi courts rely on the restatement,and therefore,its provisions warrant review in an attempt to shed light on how the mississippi supreme court might act.
the restatement defines injury as the invasion of any legally protected interest of another,restatement second of torts,which is distinguishable from harm,the existence of loss or detriment in fact of any kind to a person resulting from any cause id.injury connotes a legally protectable interest.id.cmt.a.according to comment d of section,h arm,like injury,is not necessarily actionable.id.cmt.h arm gives rise to a cause of action only when it results from the invasion of a legally protected interest,which is to say an injury.id.
the parties agree when an individual has bes,a physiologic change in the blood has occurred.but even if this could be construed as a harm pursuant to the restatement,this does not necessarily lead to the conclusion bes is actionable.a review of
