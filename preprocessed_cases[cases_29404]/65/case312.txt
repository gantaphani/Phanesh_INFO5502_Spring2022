michelin opposed the motion to remand,arguing the allegations against shackelford were a failed attempt to allege a supplying a dangerous instrumentality claim under missouri law.michelin argued the missing part of the wilkinson complaint was an allegation shackelford knows or has reason to know that the chattel is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied.app.shackelford also opposed the motion,contending the only allegation against him was that he placed the tires on his vehicle and that he knew the tires were used.id.at misquoting of wilkinson complaint.shackelford argued the complaint failed to allege any facts showing he had actual or constructive knowledge the tread would separate from the tire.shackelford asked that he be dismissed from the suit based on the complaint failure to state a claim against him.
