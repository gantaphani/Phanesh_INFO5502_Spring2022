in this diversity action involving a products liability claim,robert esposito challenges the district court decision to grant summary judgment to the defendants,dewalt industries,black decker,and home depot.esposito argues on appeal that the case was improperly removed to federal court and that the district court erroneously precluded his expert witness.we reject the argument based on improper removal,but we agree that,in the circumstances of this case,the expert witness should not have been precluded.accordingly,we vacate the district court entry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
in march,while he was operating a power saw manufactured by dewalt industries dewalt,robert esposito left hand came into contact with the saw unguarded blade.the saw severed three of his fingers,none of which could be reattached.in march,esposito filed a complaint in rhode island state court against dewalt,black decker the company that packaged the saw,and home depot the company that sold the saw.esposito claimed that the saw was defective because its blade guard did not engage properly and that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for his injury.home depot was served with the complaint on march.the other defendants were served on march.
on april,two of the defendants,dewalt and black decker,filed a notice of removal in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.on april,the other defendant,home depot,filed its answer in federal court.
on may,esposito moved to remand the matter back to the state court.in support of his motion,he claimed a defect in the removal process in that home depot had not consented to removal within the period as required by statute.see b.that failure,esposito claimed,breached the unanimity requirement that each defendant in a case consent to removal within thirty days of receiving service.the defendants opposed esposito motion.
the district court denied the motion,concluding that home depot answer,which had been filed in federal court within the thirty day period,constituted consent to removal under the circumstances.esposito home depot,d.
in july,the district court set discovery and disclosure deadlines,including a deadline for the written disclosure of experts under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.these deadlines were pushed back twice first at the request of the defendants and second at the request of esposito.the second extension required the parties to wrap up fact discovery by may,esposito to disclose experts by june and the defendants to disclose experts by july.dispositive motions were due by august.
operating under this revised timetable,the parties and their respective experts arranged to participate in a joint examination of the saw.at this examination,which took place on april,steven thomas inspected the saw on esposito behalf.thomas curriculum vitae had been sent to the defendants prior to this examination.when the time came to disclose thomas as his expert,however,esposito failed to do so.instead,on august,he filed a motion requesting that the court further extend the relevant deadlines by ninety days.the defendants opposed esposito extension request and on august they filed a summary judgment motion premised on the plaintiff lack of an expert.
the magistrate judge denied esposito request for a further extension,and esposito appealed this decision to the district court.expressing reluctance,the district court nevertheless endorsed the magistrate judge decision and denied esposito motion for an extension.the court recognized that the denial of the plaintiff request for an extension amounted to a dispositive ruling,noting that both of the parties acknowledge that the decision to exclude esposito expert as a result of missing the discovery deadlines will,without much doubt,effectively dispose of the case.nevertheless,the district court concluded that the denial of the extension,which precluded esposito expert,was justified.in so concluding,the district court noted that esposito had failed to offer a legitimate reason for missing the deadline.the court also expressed its concern that lesser sanctions,such as the imposition of fines and costs,might send the message that noncompliance or inattention to deadlines can be purchased for a price.
as predicted,the district court ruling sounded the death knell for esposito case.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the defendants motion for summary judgment and the district court agreed,entering judgment for the defendants this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we first examine the removal issue,turning then to the sanction question.
under the removal statute,a defendant in a state court action may remove the action to federal court so long as the plaintiff could have originally filed the action in federal court.see permitting removal of cases where the federal court would have had original jurisdiction.where the action involves multiple defendants,however,the right of removal is subject to the unanimity requirement.see chicago,rock island pac.ry.martin.this requirement is at issue in this case.
the unanimity requirement is derived from,which sets forth the procedure for removing a state action to federal court.loftis ups,cir.in a case where a plaintiff has sued multiple defendants in state court,an all for one and one for all rule applies with respect to removal.see chicago,rock island pac.ry,at.that is,subject to a few exceptions not applicable here,all defendants must consent to remove the case for removal to be effected.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure.ed.ordinarily,all of the defendants in the state court action must consent to the removal.
the requirement of unanimity serves the interests of plaintiffs,defendants and the judiciary.plaintiffs are advantaged,because,were the right to removal an independent rather than joint right,defendants could split the litigation,forcing a plaintiff to pursue its case in two separate forums.see sansone morton mach.works,d,citing getty oil,div.of texaco,ins.of,cir.defendants also stand to benefit from the requirement,as it precludes one defendant from imposing his choice of forum on a.id.citation omitted.and the unanimity requirement prevents the needless duplication of litigation,thereby preserving court resources and eliminating the unattractive prospect of inconsistent state and federal adjudications.spillers tillman.
the defect in the removal process resulting from a failure of unanimity is not considered to be a jurisdictional defect,and unless a party moves to remand based on this defect,the defect is waived and the action may proceed in federal court.see loftis,at see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure after the expiration of the period following the filing of the removal notice,the right to object to nonjurisdictional defects in the removal process is considered waived.
here,esposito timely objected to the perceived failure of the defendants to comply with the unanimity requirement.before the district court,as he does now,esposito argued that home depot failed to consent to removal within the statutorily prescribed period.the district court rejected this argument.as noted above,it concluded that home depot answer in federal court,filed within the applicable thirty day period,constituted consent to removal under the circumstances of the case.our review of this conclusion is de novo.loftis,at.
although the unanimity requirement itself is,the various ways that it may be satisfied are less so.we have not spoken directly to the question,but a number of guideposts do exist.
the removal statute itself speaks generally to the manner of removal.in relevant part,section a provides that 
a defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action from a state court shall file in the appropriate district court of the united states a notice of removal signed pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal,together with a copy of all process,pleadings,and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.
consistent with this statute,a defendant may express its desire to remove by signing the notice of removal filed by.but,the consensus among courts is that conduct less explicit than joining the notice will suffice.see pritchett cottrell,cir e ach defendant need not necessarily sign the notice of removal.citation omitted getty oil,div.of texaco,at this does not mean that each defendant must sign the original petition for removal see also sansone,d at tate usa,d.
although a few courts have gone so far as to say that a defendant may orally consent to removal before the district court,colin schmidt,clyde data,courts typically require some type of writing that evinces consent,loftis,at a ll defendants in the action must join in the removal petition or file their consent to removal in writing within thirty days emphasis added see also pritchett,at gillis louisiana,cir roe,cir tate,d at.
what type of writing will be satisfactory engenders yet another divergence of opinion.some courts have held that an answer by a defendant that is silent on removal may nevertheless establish consent,while other courts have reached the opposite conclusion.compare hernandez six flags magic mountain,holding that an answer silent on removal can establish consent,and glover grace,same,with local union dick,d,holding that an answer filed that fails to expressly consent to removal does not satisfy the unanimity requirement,and unicom,louis,d,same.at least one court has held that a defendant answer is insufficient to establish consent to removal even where it explicitly acknowledges the removal of the case to federal court.prod.stamping.cas.
although mindful of the principle that removal statutes are to be narrowly construed,shamrock oil gas sheets,we nevertheless are not inclined to establish a wooden rule,regardless of whether such a rule would have the benefit of promoting clarity.and in this particular case,even assuming that home depot answer failed to satisfy the unanimity requirement,resulting in a technical defect in the removal process,the defect was subsequently cured when home depot opposed esposito remand motion,thereby clearly communicating its desire to be in federal court.see harper autoalliance int l,cir in addition,the fact that the defendant opposed the plaintiff motion to remand cured any purported defect in the removal petition.because this cure occurred prior to the entry of summary judgment,a remand to the state court was not required.caterpillar lewis,d see parrino fhp,cir citing caterpillar,at,for the proposition that a procedural defect existing at the time of removal but cured prior to entry of judgment does not warrant reversal and remand of the matter to state court.
in a case such as this one,where the parties have already invested valuable resources in pursuing this litigation in federal court and where a remand to state court would not serve the purposes of the unanimity requirement,reaching an opposite conclusion would place form before function.parrino,at glover.at,wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure t he preferable result seems to be to continue to allow procedural defects in the removal procedure be cured so the removed action can remain in federal court.a contrary conclusion does not seem consistent with the statutory character of the removal right and seems too technical.we refuse to do so,and thus uphold the denial of the remand motion.
of course,it is undoubtedly the better practice for a defendant who wants to be in federal court to join the removal notice explicitly,either by signing the notice itself or by filing its consent.by failing to do so in this case,home depot ran the risk that the district court might find a breach of the unanimity requirement and remand this action to the state court,a decision we would have been powerless to review.d a district court order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is unreviewable on appeal or otherwise things remembered,petrarca,d williamson dickie,cir.
discovery sanction 
the federal rules of civil procedure provide the basic framework for disclosure of experts.rule requires a party to disclose to other parties the identity of any person who may be used at trial to present expert evidence.a a.where a district court has established a disclosure date,as in this case,a party must disclose the expert identity at this ordered time.id.at a c.if a party expert disclosure is untimely,the party is not allowed to use that witness or relevant expert information to supply evidence on a motion,at a hearing,or at a trial,unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.c.
preclusion,however,is not a strictly mechanical exercise.laboratorio clinico y de referencia del este,cir.and,in its discretion,the district court may choose a less severe sanction.see also batlle,cir d istrict courts have broad discretion in meting out sanctions for rule violations.citation omitted.
where a district court does opt in favor of preclusion,we review that decision with reference to a host of factors,including the history of the litigation the sanctioned party need for the precluded evidence the sanctioned party justification or lack of one for its late disclosure the ability to overcome the late disclosure adverse,the surprise and prejudice associated with the late disclosure and the late disclosure impact on the district court docket.macaulay anas,cir see also,at.when reviewing the district court sanction decision we must keep in mind that district courts are generally in a better position to determine the propriety of a particular sanction and,accordingly,our review of the district court ultimate choice is deferential.anas,at because trial judges tend to have an intimate knowledge of the variables that enter into the equation,appellate review of sanctions orders is deferential.citations omitted fashion house,k mart,cir.consistent with this deference,we review a district court decision to exclude expert evidence for an abuse of discretion,understanding that the sanctioned party shoulders a heavy burden when attempting to show that such an abuse has occurred.see,at 
here,the district court was undoubtedly entitled to impose some type of sanction on esposito.esposito failed to comply with a deadline that he himself had suggested,and he could not offer a legitimate justification for his.and despite esposito argument that the appearance of his expert at the inspection of the saw constituted an informal disclosure,the rules require formal disclosure for a reason without it,parties like the defendants in this case may be hindered in their ability to prepare effectively for trial.see.a b establishing that,u nless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court,the formal disclosure of an expert must be accompanied by a written report that contains a host of information relevant to the expert testimony.
nevertheless,whether the facts here justified the actual sanction preclusion of the expert a closer question.we start by stating the obvious.the sanction here had serious consequences.esposito need for the expert was so great that the magistrate judge decision to preclude the expert,although technically not a dismissal of esposito case,effectively amounted to one.see primus united states,cir.the district court acknowledged as much when it affirmed the magistrate judge imposition of the sanction,observing that both of the parties acknowledge that the decision to exclude the plaintiff expert as a result of missing the discovery deadlines will,without much doubt,effectively dispose of the case.
because all parties acknowledged that the sanction carried the force of a dismissal,the justification for it must be comparatively more robust.young gordon,cir to be sure,dismissal ordinarily should be employed as a sanction only when a plaintiff misconduct is extreme.tower ventures,city of westfield,cir recognizing that dismissal should not be granted casually.after considering the other relevant factors described above,we conclude that the circumstances here do not justify such strong medicine.
in reaching this conclusion,we view the history of the litigation as particularly enlightening.this is not a case of a party repeatedly balking at deadlines.esposito missed one deadline and requested an extension of the and trial dates after missing that deadline,albeit several weeks after the deadline had passed.compare,at noting,in upholding the preclusion of a expert witness,that the sanctioned party dereliction was both obvious and repeated and that t he record makes manifest that the plaintiff was guilty of several discovery violations besides those related to her expert witness.nor is this a case where the sanctioned party ignored warnings from the district court.see young,at.nor does this case involve,from all appearances,an act of calculated gamesmanship on the part of the sanctioned party.neither the defendants nor the district court in this case have characterized esposito failure to comply with the disclosure deadline as strategic in nature.
to be sure,not every factor cuts in esposito favor.first,he never offered a legitimate reason for his late disclosure.see macaulay,at finding that the district court preclusion of the expert evidence was appropriate where,among other things,the appellant had not advanced any real justification for the tardy emergence of the expert report.second,although the defendants here do not discuss in any great detail how the late disclosure prejudiced them,they obviously went through the pains of preparing a dispositive summary judgment motion premised on esposito lack of an expert in an case.see gagnon teledyne princeton,cir p rejudice also exists in the defendants having prepared a dispositive motion for summary judgment predicated on the preclusion of the expert testimony.primus,at.and finally,esposito failure to disclose his expert by the scheduled date had a clear effect on the district court docket.in his motion to extend,esposito sought to push back the relevant and trial dates by ninety days,requiring the district court to further move dates that had already been extended twice.
even taking these considerations into account,however,we still must face up to the fact that we are presented with a fatal sanction levied for a single oversight.we have not been able to uncover a case from this circuit sustaining a comparable sanction under similar circumstances.see,cir defendants do not cite to us,and we have been unable to find,a case from this circuit sustaining a dismissal with prejudice imposed solely for a single allegation of noncompliance with a single albeit discovery least where that was never brought to the plaintiffs attention by the court prior to dismissing the case.see also malot dorado beach cottages,cir same.in our view,a less severe remedy could have easily achieved the same aims as the preclusion of the expert while still giving esposito,potentially the innocent victim of a defective product,his day in court.malot,at recognizing the strong presumption in favor of deciding cases on the merits young,at referencing the salutary policy favoring the disposition of cases on the merits.
the defendants urge us to uphold the district court sanction.they rely principally on our decisions in tower ventures,and young.in both of these cases,we upheld a district court decision to dismiss the case of a party that had failed to comply with deadlines.tower ventures,at young,at.in each of those cases,however,the conduct of the sanctioned party was measurably more egregious than esposito conduct was here.
in tower ventures,the sanctioned party,tower ventures,had committed serial violations of the court scheduling order.at.the violations were missed discovery deadlines,and the final one was particularly flagrant tower ventures waited days after the discovery deadline had passed,and eighteen days after its motion for summary judgment was due,to ask the court for a further extension.id.by that time,the district court had already issued a show cause order,asking tower ventures why its action should not be dismissed with prejudice.id.
in young,the district court dismissed young case because of young repeated failures to comply with court orders.at.in particular,young i failed to join the opposition in filing a joint statement containing a proposed pretrial schedule as ordered by the court ii did not respond to the opposition until the court warned him that his failure to do so could result in a dismissal and iii refused to appear for his own deposition,even after the court ordered him to appear and warned him that a failure to do so could result in a dismissal of his action.id.at.
here,by contrast,esposito missed only one deadline,and his behavior was not nearly as brazen as the behavior of the sanctioned parties in either of those cases.he neither engaged in the same level of as was present in tower ventures,nor sloughed off a warning from the district court like the plaintiff in young.
we do not wish to casually discount the district court concern that a lesser sanction,such as the imposition of fines or costs,might send a message to other litigants that inattention to deadlines can be purchased for a price.the deterrence value of a sanction may certainty factor into a district court calculus.but,allowing the general interest in deterrence to hold too much sway in the analysis runs afoul of the principle that sanction s must be handled on a basis.young,at.in other words,the punishment must approximately fit the crime.here,it did not.in the absence of a greater conviction that parties will indeed attempt to purchase their way out of discovery compliance as a result of our holding in this case,we are not persuaded that the sanction here was justified.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons provided above,we affirm the district court denial of the motion to remand,but we reverse the exclusion of the expert testimony,vacate the entry of summary judgment,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,including the possible imposition of sanctions within the district court discretion.the parties shall bear their own costs.
i concur fully with the majority thoughtful resolution of the removal issue.i disagree,however,with the majority conclusion that the district judge abused his discretion by precluding esposito expert witness because i believe that,in reaching this conclusion,the majority has applied a higher dismissal standard to a rule c discretionary sanction.i respectfully dissent.
two standards dismissal and rule c witness preclusion 
a.the dismissal standard 
dismissal with prejudice is different from other sanctions,at describing dismissal as the harshest sanction,cir describing dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute as drastic,cir describing dismissal as the most severe sanction.a district court is allowed to employ dismissal as a sanction only when a plaintiff misconduct is extreme.young,at.dismissal as a sanction is reserved for cases of extremely protracted inaction measured in years,disobedience of court orders,ignorance of warnings,contumacious conduct,or some other aggravating circumstances,at quoting cosme nieves deshler,cir.concerns of fairness underlie this heightened standard,since the law favors disposition on the merits,at,and the party should be given notice and an opportunity to be heard,at.further,where the case is close,courts should prefer less severe sanctions that preserve the possibility of disposition on the merits.pomales celulares telefonica,cir.
b.the rule c sanction standard 
the imposition of a lesser sanction under rule c,such as witness preclusion,is not held to the high dismissal standard and does not require egregious and repetitive misconduct.instead,rule c requires the near automatic exclusion of rule information that is not timely disclosed.wilson bradlees of new england,cir.though the automatic nature of the preclusion sanction is softened by the macaulay factors,witness preclusion is not held to the rigorous standards of dismissal.see macaulay,at listing as factors the history of the litigation,the proponent need for the challenged evidence,the justification if any for the late disclosure,the opponent ability to overcome its adverse effects such as surprise and prejudice,and court docket considerations.
