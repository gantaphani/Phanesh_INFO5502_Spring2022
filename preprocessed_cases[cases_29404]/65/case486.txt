appeal from an order of the superior court of los angeles,amy hogue,judge.affirmed as modified.
simon greenstone panatier bartlett and brian barrow for plaintiffs and appellants william pfeifer and anne pfeifer.
farella braun martel,john cooper,racheal turner and deborah barron for defendant and appellant john crane.
william and anne pfeifer asserted claims for negligence,strict liability,and loss of consortium against john crane,jci,alleging that its products caused william pfeifer mesothelioma.during the trial,the court rejected jci proffered instructions regarding its sophisticated user defense,and directed a verdict on the defense.after the jury returned a verdict in the pfeifers favor,a judgment was entered awarding them compensatory and punitive damages.the trial court subsequently entered orders,inter alia,crediting jci with an offset for settlements,and awarding expert fees to the pfeifers.jci appealed from the judgment and certain related orders,and the pfeifers.
regarding jci appeal,we conclude that the trial court correctly declined to give jci requested instructions on its sophisticated user defense,which stated that employees of a sophisticated user are deemed to be sophisticated users.we hold that when a manufacturer provides hazardous goods to a sophisticated intermediary that passes the goods to its employees or servants for their use,the supplier is subject to liability for a failure to warn the employees or servants of the hazards,absent some basis for the manufacturer to believe the ultimate users know or should know of the hazards.with respect to jci other contentions,we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support the jury findings regarding comparative fault,and that the award of punitive damages was supported by the evidence and was not excessive in amount.we dismiss jci appeal insofar as it challenges an award of expert fees to the pfeifers,as jci filed no notice of appeal from the award.regarding the pfeifers,we affirm the trial court determination of jci credit for the settlements.
we otherwise find no error in the judgment and related orders,with the exception of an error both sides acknowledge regarding the determination of the pfeifers net recovery of economic damages.we therefore dismiss jci appeal in part,modify the judgment to reflect the correct determination of the pfeifers net economic damages,and affirm the judgment and related orders,as modified.
relevant factual and procedural background 
pretrial proceedings 
beginning in,jci manufactured and sold packing used in valves and pumps,and distributed gaskets used in flanges and pipe systems.some of these products contained asbestos.jci sold packing and gaskets containing asbestos to the united states navy and to the united states government.from to,william pfeifer served in the navy.after leaving the navy,he worked for the united states government as a boiler technician until.in,he was diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma,a type of cancer usually caused by exposure to asbestos.
on june,the pfeifers filed their complaint for negligence,strict liability,and loss of consortium against approximately suppliers of products.the complaint alleged that william pfeifer mesothelioma resulted from his exposure to asbestos from the defendants products.the pfeifers sought compensatory and punitive damages.
prior to trial,the pfeifers entered into settlements with several defendants.at a result of the settlements and other dispositions,on november,at the commencement of jury selection,jci was the sole remaining defendant in the action.trial was bifurcated with respect to punitive damages.
first phase of trial 
a.the pfeifers evidence 
william pfeifer testified that after he entered the navy in august,he served as an apprentice fireman and boiler tender aboard destroyers.his responsibilities included removing and replacing gaskets and packing containing asbestos.the air he breathed often became dusty when he scraped away old gaskets and packing and replaced them.the navy neither supplied him with a respirator nor provided training regarding dusty environments.from to,after leaving the navy,pfeifer worked as a boiler technician at several united states government sites.during that period,he replaced gaskets and packing in addition,he sometimes repaired boilers with an jci product that he did not encounter in the navy,namely,a gasket that released dust when he put it in place.in may or june,he learned that he had mesothelioma.
according to pfeifer,jci was a key supplier of the gaskets and packing he encountered in the navy and as a boiler technician.among the jci products he frequently used were sheet gaskets.pfeifer estimated that jci supplied percent of the gaskets he removed,percent of the materials from which he made replacement gaskets,and to percent of the packing he removed and replaced.
james millette,an environmental scientist,testified that he examined jci products identical or similar to those william pfeifer encountered.according to millette,jci products showed exposed asbestos fibers,even though the products embedded the fibers in graphite or other materials.in addition,millette opined that the cutting,scraping,and other operations that pfeifer performed on the products released asbestos fibers into the air.
carl andrew brodkin,a specialist in diseases,opined that pfeifer exposure to asbestos substantially contributed to his mesothelioma.brodkin further testified regarding the evolution of medical knowledge concerning diseases.according to brodkin,as early as,researchers knew that exposure to asbestos dust caused the noncancerous lung disease called asbestosis.in the,and,research studies linked asbestos to certain cancers,namely,lung cancer and mesothelioma.by,it was generally accepted that exposure to asbestos caused mesothelioma.at the time,the hazards of asbestos were reported in medical journals and the popular media,including magazines such as newsweek.
george springs,a retired jci vice president,testified as jci designated representative regarding its response to the hazards of asbestos.he stated that from to,jci sold gaskets and packing containing asbestos.during that period,jci conducted no research into whether its products were hazardous.
springs further testified that jci first became aware of asbestos health hazards in,when it learned that handling raw asbestos enhanced the risk of lung problems for workers who smoked.in,to comply with regulations propounded by the federal occupational safety and health administration osha,jci began monitoring the air in its factories for asbestos particles,and used engineering controls to help keep dust levels down.in,pursuant to the osha regulations,jci created a safety data sheet regarding the gaskets,which stated that overexposure to asbestos caused asbestosis and cancer.because jci prepared the safety data sheet for the benefit of its employees,customers received a copy only when they asked for it.in,jci began placing warnings on its products regarding the hazards of asbestos.
according to springs,the absence of warnings on jci products was consistent with the osha regulations,which required no labels when the asbestos fibers in a product were encased in bonding materials such as graphite,grease,oil,or rubber,unless it was reasonably foreseeable that their use would release concentrations of asbestos fibers exceeding certain defined limits.springs acknowledged that jci knew that its customers sometimes replaced gaskets using methods that created asbestos dust or fragmented old gaskets.he stated that jci recommended other methods which,if properly applied,released little dust.springs also acknowledged that jci never tested its products to determine whether the bonding agents prevented the release of asbestos fibers.
david todd fractor,an economist,estimated that william pfeifer lost earnings,benefits,and household services totaled.the parties stipulated that william pfeifer past medical expenses were,and robert cameron,a thoracic surgeon who treated william pfeifer,opined that asbestos exposure caused pfeifer mesothelioma,and that his future medical expenses ranged from to several million dollars.anne pfeifer testified regarding the pfeifers injuries.
jci evidence 
james paul delaney,who served as an apprentice fireman and machinist mate in the navy,testified regarding the navy procedures for replacing gaskets and packing.he stated that the navy required personnel to wear respirators in dusty environments,that the navy began an asbestos abatement program in the,and that warning labels first appeared on products bought by the navy in the.according to delaney,the navy specifications for a product regulated the words placed on the product.
allan feingold,a lung specialist,opined that william pfeifer mesothelioma arose from his exposure to specific types of asbestos fibers not found in significant quantities in the relevant jci products.according to feingold,those types of asbestos fibers were present in thermal insulation and other items the navy bought from other suppliers.
the jury returned special verdicts in favor of the pfeifers on their claims for negligence,strict liability,and loss of consortium.the jury found that william pfeifer had suffered in economic damages,including in past medical expenses,and in noneconomic damages.the jury also found that anne pfeiffer had suffered in noneconomic damages for loss of past and future consortium.the jury allocated jci a percent share of comparative fault,and found that it had acted with malice,oppression,or fraud.
second phase of trial 
pursuant to a stipulation,the pfeifers counsel presented information to the jury regarding jci assets and liabilities for the and fiscal years derived from jci annual report and financial statement.the jury awarded the pfeifers in punitive damages.
judgment and post judgment orders 
on february,a judgment was entered in favor of the pfeifers awarding damages totaling.the trial court deferred determining the extent to which the pfeifers settlements required an adjustment of the jury award of economic damages to william pfeifer.
in early march,anne pfeifer became the personal representative for william pfeifer,who died on february.on march,the trial court granted jci motion to reduce the award to william pfeifer for his past medical expenses from the amount stipulated at trial to.the court later awarded jci a offset of against the award of economic damages to william pfeifer,as adjusted by its march ruling,and denied jci motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
on april,jci appealed from the judgment and certain related orders.on april,the pfeifers noticed their from the judgment and the related orders.on the same date,the trial court granted in part and denied in part jci motion to tax costs,insofar as the pfeifers sought an award of expert fees under code of civil procedure section.
discussion 
ijci appeal 
jci contends there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings regarding comparative fault the trial court erred in rejecting jci proffered instructions regarding its sophisticated user defense,and directing a verdict on the defense the award of punitive damages is unsupported by the evidence and is excessive in amount and the court erred in issuing an award of expert fees to the pfeifers.for the reasons explained below,we reject jci first three contentions,and conclude that we lack jurisdiction to examine the remaining contention.
comparative fault 
jci contends that the jury findings regarding comparative fault fail for want of substantial evidence.the immediate targets of jci challenge are the findings regarding jci,william pfeifer,the united states navy,and flexitallic,which manufactured a type of gasket known as a gasket.jci further argues that because those findings are interwoven with the jury other findings regarding liability,a new trial is necessary.
governing principles 
the comparative fault doctrine is designed to permit the trier of fact to consider all relevant criteria in apportioning liability.the doctrine is a flexible,commonsense concept,under which a jury properly may consider and evaluate the relative responsibility of various parties for an injury whether their responsibility for the injury rests on negligence,strict liability,or other theories of responsibility,in order to arrive at an equitable apportionment or allocation of loss.citation.rosh cave imaging systems,th,rosh,quoting knight jewett cal th.for this reason,comparative negligence does not lend itself to the exact measurements of a.rosh,supra,at,quoting daly general motors cal d.generally,a defendant has the burden of establishing that some nonzero percentage of fault is properly attributed the plaintiff,other defendants,or nonparties to the action.see sparks owens illinois,th,sparks.
here,the special verdict form asked the jury to determine whether william pfeifer was negligent in his work with jci gaskets or packing,and if so,whether his negligence was a substantial factor in causing his harm.the special verdict form also requested findings regarding the percentage of fault attributable to jci,pfeifer and several other parties,including the united states navy,the manufacturers and suppliers of thermal insulation that pfeifer encountered,and two manufacturers of gaskets,namely,garlock and flexitallic.the jury found that although pfeifer was negligent,his conduct was not a substantial factor in the causation of his injuries.the jury allocated fault as follows percent to jci,percent to pfeifer,percent to the navy,percent to the manufacturers and suppliers of thermal insulation,percent to garlock,and percent to flexitallic.
we review these findings for the existence of substantial evidence.sparks,supra,th at rosh,supra,th at.on review for substantial evidence,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving that party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment.citation.nordquist mcgraw hill broadcasting th.under this standard,the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the jury or set aside the jury finding if there is any evidence which under any reasonable view supports the jury apportionment.citation.rosh,supra,at,quoting hyatt sierra boat d.for this reason,courts rarely disturb the jury apportionment of fault.ibid.
finding regarding jci 
jci challenges the finding allocating it a percent share of fault for william pfeifer cancer,arguing that there was undisputed evidence that pfeifer was exposed to asbestos from numerous sources,many of which were not listed in the special verdict form.pfeifer testified that from to,he encountered to gaskets,percent of which were made by jci,and to valve packings,to percent of which were made by jci.however,pfeifer also acknowledged that in,he sued numerous manufacturers and suppliers of products other than jci,and received compensation through settlements.in addition,the jury heard certain interrogatory responses from the pfeifers listing the suppliers of products that william pfeifer had encountered.jci contends this evidence required the jury to allocate a smaller share of comparative fault to it.we disagree.
aside from the evidence regarding the potential comparative fault of the suppliers named in the special verdict,the record discloses no evidence quantifying pfeifer exposure to asbestos from the other sources identified in his complaint and the pfeifers interrogatory responses.in the absence of such evidence,the jury reasonably allocated a percent share of comparative fault to jci.stewart union carbide th,stewart despite plaintiff admission that he was exposed to asbestos from many sources,jury reasonably allocated share of comparative fault to asbestos product manufacturer that submitted no evidence detailing plaintiff exposure from other sources sparks,supra,th at jury reasonably found that defendant product was sole of plaintiff mesothelioma when defendant submitted no evidence specifying extent of plaintiff exposure to asbestos from other manufacturers products.
findings regarding william pfeifer 
jci maintains the jury was required to find that william pfeifer share of fault exceeded zero percent.regarding this contention,the record establishes that pfeifer sometimes removed jci gaskets and packing with power wire brushes or compressed air.those practices were contrary to jci recommendations and the navy training,as they increased the risk of damage to valves and eye injuries to workers.as jci further notes,the pfeifers experts testified that the use of power wire brushes released far more asbestos dust that ordinary scraping,and that mesothelioma is a cumulative disease,that is,each exposure to asbestos increases the risk of mesothelioma.
jci argues that this evidence compelled the jury to find that pfeifer share of fault for his injuries was greater than zero percent.we reject this contention.under the principles of comparative fault,a person negligent conduct may be assigned a share of fault greater than zero percent only when the conduct was a substantial factor in the causation of the pertinent injuries.stewart,supra,th at chakalis elevator solutions,th.as explained below,the trial evidence does not compel a finding that pfeifer conduct was a substantial factor in the causation of his cancer.
generally,california applies the substantial factor test to determinations.rutherford owens illinois,cal th,rutherford.under this test,a force that plays only an infinitesimal or theoretical role in the causation of injury is not a substantial factor.id.at.in the context of injury claims based on exposure to asbestos from multiple sources,plaintiffs may establish that asbestos from a specific defendant product was a cause in fact of their cancer by showing that the asbestos was a substantial factor contributing to the risk of developing cancer.id.at.to make this showing,plaintiffs need not demonstrate that the specific asbestos particles from the defendant products actually caused the cancer.rather,the showing may be based on expert testimony regarding the size of the dose or the enhancement of risk attributable to exposure to asbestos from the defendant products.id.at,fn.nonetheless,plaintiffs must demonstrate conduct that was a substantial factor in contributing to the aggregate dose of asbestos the plaintiff inhaled or ingested,and hence to the risk of developing cancer.id.at,italics omitted.
under these principles,jci contention fails,as the trial evidence does not compel the inference that pfeifer use of power wire brushes and compressed air was a substantial factor in causing his cancer.pfeifer testified that the air became dusty when he used hand powered tools to make new gaskets and remove old gaskets and packing.according to pfeifer,he used a power wire brush only when a gasket was difficult to remove,and sometimes resorted to compressed air.
absent from the record is evidence establishing the extent to which pfeifer use of power wire brushes and compressed air contributed to his aggregate dose of asbestos particles.rutherford,supra cal th at.there is no evidence regarding how often pfeifer resorted to power wire brushes or compressed air,and no expert opined that pfeifer use of these tools was,by itself,a substantial factor in the causation of his cancer.the pfeifers experts opined only that pfeifer cumulative exposure to asbestos caused his cancer,and that his exposure to asbestos from jci products substantial ly contribut ed to that illness.
because jci bore the burden of proof at trial regarding pfeifer negligence and comparative fault,jci was obliged to present evidence that the aggregate dose of asbestos particles arising from pfeifer use of power wire brushes and compressed air constituted a substantial factor in the causation of his cancer.this jci did not do.accordingly,the jury was not required to find that pfeifer share of fault exceeded zero percent.see stewart,supra,th at sparks,supra,th at.
finding regarding flexitallic 
pointing to william pfeifer testimony that flexitallic supplied percent of the gaskets he encountered,jci contends the jury was obliged to find that flexitallic share of fault was greater than percent.we disagree.
the evidence at trial established that flexitallic manufactured a type of gasket called a gasket.unlike jci gaskets,which were made from flat sheets containing asbestos and used in low pressure systems,flexitallic gaskets were designed for use in high pressure systems.they consisted of a spiral of coiled metal containing asbestos fiber material as a filler.their flexible metal construction permitted them to provide a seal while absorbing the shocks to which warships were subject.
the evidence further established that of the gaskets and packing that pfeifer encountered,flexitallic gaskets generated the least amount of asbestos dust.the pfeifers expert witnesses testified that working with a gasket released approximately or less the number of fibers produced by scraping away a sheet gasket with a hand tool,and that other activities involving sheet gaskets produced even greater exposures to asbestos fibers.
in view of this evidence,the jury was not compelled to conclude that flexitallic gaskets were a substantial factor in causing pfeifer cancer.the testimony described above supported the reasonable inference that pfeifer cumulative exposure to asbestos from flexitallic gaskets was far less than his cumulative exposure to asbestos from jci products.moreover,jci offered no expert testimony that pfeifer aggregate dose of asbestos from flexitallic gaskets constituted a substantial factor in causing his cancer.accordingly,the evidence did not mandate a finding that flexitallic share of fault exceeded zero percent.sparks,supra,th at.
finding regarding the navy 
jci contends the jury allocation of a percent share of fault to the navy fails for want of substantial evidence,arguing that the navy knew that jci products endangered pfeifer,yet exposed him to those products while he served in the navy from to.we reject this contention.
to begin,we note that over half of william pfeifer exposure to asbestos from jci products occurred after he left the navy.the pfeifers predicated their claims on william pfeifer cumulative exposure to jci products from to,a period that encompassed both pfeifer service in the navy until and his later work as a civil boiler technician.generally,the jury was permitted to consider the relative culpability of the parties in assessing comparative fault.scott county of los angeles th.accordingly,the jury could properly adjust its determinations of comparative fault to reflect pfeifer period of service in the navy.
furthermore,the jury was permitted to increase jci share of liability because it determined that jci misconduct was more egregious than the navy misconduct.scott county of los angeles,supra,th at.as we explain further below,the evidence supported the inference that jci was consciously indifferent to the dangers that its products posed to consumers see pt,post,while the navy was merely negligent regarding those dangers during pfeifer period of service see pt,post.the evidence was thus sufficient to support the jury allocation of comparative fault,in view of the differences in the length and gravity of jci and the navy misconduct.see daly general motors,supra,cal d at observing that the principles of comparative fault elevate justice and equity above the exact contours of a mathematical equation.
sophisticated user defense 
jci contends the trial court improperly rejected its proposed instructions on what jci characterizes as its sophisticated user defense,and directed a verdict on the defense.according to the proffered defense,jci was not liable for its failure to warn william pfeifer regarding the hazards of asbestos while he served in the navy because the navy allegedly had greater knowledge of those hazards than jci.as explained below,we find no error in the trial court ruling.
types of sophisticated user defense 
the term sophisticated user defense has been applied to at least two potentially overlapping defenses traceable to section of the restatement second of torts section,which specifies when a supplier of goods is subject to liability for providing dangerous items lacking suitable warnings to users either directly or through a third person.mack general electric d,mack see johnson american standard,cal th,johnson persons salomon north america,d,persons.the first defense is reflected in comment k accompanying section,which states that the supplier duty to warn arises only when the supplier has no reason to expect that the item user will realize the danger involved rest d torts,com.johnson,supra,cal th at.the second defense is reflected in comment n accompanying section,which states that when the supplier provides items to a third party that will pass them to the user,the supplier may in some circumstances discharge its duty to warn the user by informing the third party of the item dangers rest d torts,com.see persons,supra,d at.although section addresses only suppliers of goods,sections and of the restatement second of torts extend the application of section and impliedly,the two defenses to manufacturers and sellers.
in johnson,supra,cal th at page,our supreme court recognized the defense based on comment k accompanying section.there,a trained and certified heating,ventilation,and air conditioning hvac technician suffered injuries due to his repeated exposure to r,a refrigerant.johnson,supra,at.the technician asserted claims for personal injury against several manufacturers and suppliers,alleging that they had failed to warn him of the dangers of r.id.at.after one of the defendants obtained summary judgment on the ground that the technician was aware of the risks of r,the supreme court held that the sophisticated user defense,as reflected in comment k to section,was applicable in california.johnson,supra,at.
in so concluding,the court stated a manufacturer is not liable to a sophisticated user of its product for failure to warn of a risk,harm,or danger,if the sophisticated user knew or should have known of that risk,harm,or danger.it would be nearly impossible for a manufacturer to predict or determine whether a given user or member of the sophisticated group actually has knowledge of the dangers because of the infinite number of user idiosyncrasies however,individuals who represent that they are trained or are members of a sophisticated group of users are saying to the world that they possess the level of knowledge and skill associated with that class.if they do not actually possess that knowledge and skill,that fact should not give rise to liability on the part of the manufacturer.under the should have known standard there will be some users who were actually unaware of the dangers nonetheless,even if a user was truly unaware of a product hazards,that fact is irrelevant if the danger was objectively obvious.citations.thus,under the sophisticated user defense,the inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff knew,or should have known,of the particular risk of harm from the product giving rise to the injury.johnson,supra,cal th at.
in stewart,the appellate court distinguished the defense recognized in johnson from the defense reflected in comment n to section,which it called the sophisticated intermediary doctrine.stewart,supra th at.in that case,a plumber asserted claims against a supplier of raw asbestos,alleging that his lengthy contact with manufactured products containing the supplier asbestos caused his mesothelioma.id.at.at trial,the court refused the supplier request for instructions on a sophisticated user defense,which relied not on the theory that plumber had an opportunity to discover the hazards of using products,but on the theory that the manufacturers of the products were aware of them.id.at.
in affirming the ruling,the appellate court concluded there was no evidence to support any type of sophisticated user instruction.the court stated that no instruction was warranted under johnson,as that decision did not impute an intermediary knowledge to the plaintiff,or charge him with any knowledge except that which had been made available to him through his training and which,by reason of his profession and certification,he should have had.stewart,supra,th at.the court further determined that the sophisticated intermediary defense reflected in comment n to section was inapplicable,reasoning that the defendant had provided no warnings to the intermediary manufacturers.stewart,supra,at.the court also rejected any sophisticated purchaser defense predicated on the relationship between a sophisticated user intermediary and its employees,in view of the fact that the plaintiff was not an employee of the intermediary manufacturers.id.at.
underlying proceedings 
prior to trial,jci requested special instructions regarding its sophisticated user defense,which relied on william pfeifer relationship with the navy during his naval service.the instructions stated that a defendant has no duty to warn a sophisticated user or its employees of the potential hazards of its products,and that the employees of a sophisticated user are deemed to be sophisticated users 
following the presentation of evidence at trial,the pfeifers sought a directed verdict on jci defense.they argued that under the circumstances of the case,jci was obliged to show not only that the navy,as an alleged sophisticated intermediar y,knew or should have known of the dangers of asbestos,but that jci reasonably relied on the navy to pass that information to pfeifer.in granting the motion,the trial court appears to have concluded that jci proposed instructions reflected no recognized defense,and that there was insufficient evidence to support instructions on any sophisticated intermediary defense.the court stated it was going to refuse to give the jury instruction with respect to a sophisticated intermediary defense,which effectively is a directed verdict as to that defense.
jci contention 
as explained below,we see no error in the trial court ruling.generally,a directed verdict is proper on a defense if there is insufficient evidence to support the defense furthermore,although a defendant is entitled upon request to correct instructions on any defense shown by the evidence,soule general motors cal th,the court may reject an instruction that contains incorrect statements of law levy zentner southern pac.transportation d,and need not correct the instruction unless the failure to do so would deny the jury guidance on a fundamental legal principle applicable to the case paverud niagara machine tool works d,overruled on another ground insoule general motors,supra th at.as explained below,jci proposed instructions were erroneous,and there was insufficient evidence to support the defense,properly stated 
our inquiry is focused on the defense recognized in johnson,as it is undisputed that jci provided no warnings to the navy.in directing a verdict on jci proffered defense,the trial court declined jci request to instruct the jury that a defendant has no duty to warn a sophisticated user or its employees of the potential hazards of its products,and that the employees of a sophisticated user are deemed to be sophisticated users.on appeal,jci does not suggest that william pfeifer was a sophisticated user,that is,that he knew,or should have known,of the hazards of asbestos.rather,jci argues that t he logical application of johnson is that a manufacturer who sells its products to a sophisticated user has no duty to attempt to warn that sophisticated user employees of hazards of its products.italics added.
jci contention presents an issue not examined in stewart,namely,the extent to which a defendant may assert the sophisticated user defense identified in johnson against employees or servants of a sophisticated user intermediary who purchased the defendant goods stewart,supra th at.the crux of jci contention is that as a matter of law,the intermediary knowledge or potential knowledge of the hazards associated with the goods shields the supplier from liability to the intermediary employees or servants arising from a failure to warn 
there is a division of authority regarding this question in other jurisdictions.see mack,supra,d at discussing division.some courts have held that the existence of an relationship between the sophisticated intermediary and the plaintiff does not,by itself,screen defendants from liability for a failure to warn.thus,in in re brooklyn navy yard asbestos litigation cir,workers in navy shipyards sued manufacturers and suppliers of products,alleging that their exposure to the products caused cancer and other illnesses.like jci,the defendants maintained that the navy superior knowledge of the dangers of asbestos shielded them from liability for their failure to warn the workers.id.at.noting comment n to section,the second circuit rejected the defendants contention given that the record supports neither a finding that defendants actually relied on the navy to warn its workers,nor a finding that any such reliance would have been justifiable,the presence of the navy as an alleged sophisticated intermediary or knowledgeable user does not call into question the jury finding of defendants duty to warn.ibid.
other courts have determined that an relationship may preclude the supplier liability for a failure to warn,provided that the relationship involved employee training or experience rendering both the intermediary and the employee sophisticated users.in strong dupont de nemours,cir,strong,a construction supervisor for a natural gas company died when a pipe carrying natural gas exploded as he inspected it.the eighth circuit concluded that the pipe manufacturer was not liable for a failure to warn regarding dangers associated with the pipe,as the hazards were well known throughout the industry,and both the supervisor and his employer were aware of them.id.at.
finally,some courts have concluded that a sophisticated intermediary knowledge or potential knowledge of an item hazards is properly imputed to its employees or servants.in akin ashland chemical cir,akin,workers at a united states air force base asserted claims against a manufacturer of chemical products,alleging that they suffered injuries while using the products to clean jet engine parts.after determining that the air force was a knowledgeable purchaser regarding the chemicals hazards,the circuit held the manufacturer had no duty to warn the plaintiffs because they were deemed to possess the necessary level of sophistication.id.at see also davis avondale industries,cir,concluding that under louisiana law,manufacturer has no duty to warn employees of sophisticated purchaser.
johnson does not directly resolve this division of opinion,as the case involved no sophisticated user intermediary,and as noted in stewart,the supreme court did not expressly authorize the imputation of an intermediary sophistication to the ultimate user stewart,supra,th at.furthermore,an examination of johnson establishes that the court recognized the issue now before us,but did not decide it.
the discussion in johnson manifests the supreme court awareness of the issue.the court referred to several cases,including akin and strong,as well as a treatise stating that the defense usually precludes liability to a sophisticated purchaser and its employees.johnson,supra,cal th at.the court also noted that california law limits the duty to warn users in a situation not involving an employment relationship,remarking that manufacturers of prescription drugs need not warn patients of dangers readily known and apparent to their physicans.id.at,quoting plenger alza th,plenger.furthermore,the court discussed two cases applying california law in which the sophisticated use defense had been extended to employees,namely,fierro international harvester d fierro and in re related asbestos cases,asbestos cases.
in discussing fierro and asbestos cases,however,the supreme court signaled its intention not to decide the issue before us.in fierro,a manufacturer sold a skeletal truck consisting of an engine,cab,and chassis to a packing company,which modified the truck by adding a refrigerator powered by the truck battery.fierro,supra,d at.five years later,an employee of the packing company died when the truck caught fire during an accident.ibid.after the employee survivors asserted claims against the manufacturer for negligence and strict liability,a jury returned verdicts in favor of the manufacturer.ibid.on appeal,the plaintiffs contended that the jury should have been instructed that the manufacturer had a duty to warn that attaching the refrigerator to the truck battery could create a fire hazard.ibid.the appellate court concluded that the plaintiffs had forfeited that contention by failing to raise it adequately at trial.id.at.nonetheless,the court stated that under the circumstances,the manufacturer had no duty to warn because a sophisticated organization like the packing company does not have to be told that gasoline is volatile and that sparks from an electrical connection or friction can cause ignition.id.at.in johnson,supra,cal th at page,our supreme court observed only that the appellate court had impliedly adopted the sophisticated user defense,without discussing the propriety of the defense as applied.
in asbestos cases,shipyard workers employed by the navy initiated an action against suppliers of products,alleging that exposure to the products caused their injuries.asbestos cases,supra.at.in permitting the defendants to assert a sophisticated user defense based on the navy superior knowledge of the dangers of asbestos,the federal court predicted that our supreme court would recognize such a defense,with the qualification that plaintiffs would be authorized to rebut it by demonstrating that the defendants might have foreseen the navy alleged negligence.johnson,supra,cal th at.
in johnson,the supreme court addressed the qualification proposed in asbesto cases,stating the federal court prediction that this court would adopt the sophisticated user defense on the condition that a plaintiff could negate it by showing that the sophisticated user misuse of the product was foreseeable is not at issue here,and we do not address it at this time.johnson,supra,cal th at,fn.the supreme court thus declined to decide whether a plaintiff employment or servant relationship with a sophisticated intermediary user necessarily shields defendants from liability.
we therefore turn to that issue.in our view,to the extent johnson provides guidance on the issue,it impliedly repudiates jci contention.as noted above see pt,ante,the supreme court concluded that under the sophisticated user defense,the inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff knew,or should have known,of the particular risk of harm from the product giving rise to the injury.johnson,supra,cal th at,italics added.thus,in actions by employees or servants,the critical issue concerns their knowledge or potential knowledge,rather than an intermediary sophistication.
this conclusion flows directly from section itself.under section,a supplier of a dangerous item to users directly or through a third person is subject to liability for a failure to warn,when the supplier has no reason to believe that those for whose use the item is supplied will realize its dangerous condition.accordingly,to avoid liability,there must be some basis for the supplier to believe that the ultimate user knows,or should know,of the item hazards.in view of this requirement,the intermediary sophistication is not,as matter of law,sufficient to avert liability there must be a sufficient reason for believing that the intermediary sophistication is likely to operate to protect the user,or that the user is likely to discover the hazards in some other manner.the fact that the user is an employee or servant of the sophisticated intermediary can not plausibly be regarded as a sufficient reason,as a matter of law,to infer that the latter will protect the former.we therefore reject jci contention that an intermediary sophistication invariably shields suppliers from liability to the intermediary employees or servants 
under the authority discussed above,suppliers may provide the additional required showing in many ways,which we do not attempt to enumerate in a definitive manner.in lieu of showing that warnings were issued to the intermediary,a supplier may offer evidence that it reasonably believed that the intermediary would warn the users in re brooklyn navy yard asbestos litigation,supra,at that the employees or servants knew or should have known of the dangers,in view of their experience or training strong,supra,at or that the specific dangers were so readily known and apparent to the intermediary that it would be expected to protect its employees or servants see plenger,supra,th at fierro,supra,d at.
the trial court thus properly declined to give jci proposed instructions,as they erroneously stated that employees of a sophisticated user are,by virtue of their employment,deemed to be sophisticated users.furthermore,there was insufficient evidence to support any legally correct version of the sophisticated user defense.the evidence at trial established only that by the,medical researchers agreed that asbestos caused cancer that jci issued no warnings regarding its products while william pfeifer served in the navy from to that pfeifer had no training or knowledge regarding the dangers of asbestos,that the navy had a medical staff with access to research on asbestos that studies of navy workers in the,and disclosed some hazards from asbestos dust,and that in the early,the navy began an asbestos abatement program aimed at containing dust from asbestos insulation.
notably absent is any evidence that jci had reason to believe the navy would issue warnings to pfeifer regarding jci products while he served in the navy,or that it was then readily known and apparent to the navy that the amounts of dust released from jci products were hazardous plenger,supra,th at.during pfeifer period of service,the navy studies appear to have classified jci gaskets and packing as nondusty.although the evidence at trial may have shown that the navy,as a sophisticated user intermediary,was negligent regarding jci products,the evidence supported no reasonable inference by jci that the navy would warn or otherwise protect pfeifer from the dangers of jci products.accordingly,jci had no reason to believe that pfeifer would realize their dangerous condition.rest d torts,b.in sum,the trial court properly declined to give jci proposed instructions and did not err in directing a verdict on its sophisticated user defense 
punitive damages 
jci challenges the award of punitive damages on several grounds,contending that there was insufficient evidence regarding jci egregious conduct and ability to pay,that the evidence concerning jci financial condition was improperly admitted,and that the award was excessive.as explained below,we reject the contentions.
malice,fraud,or oppression 
we begin with jci challenge to the jury finding that jci acted with malice,fraud,or oppression.
governing principles 
generally,punitive damages may be awarded only when the trier of fact finds,by clear and convincing evidence,that the defendant acted with malice,fraud,or oppression,subd.a.as nonintentional torts support punitive damages when the defendant conduct involves conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,our focus is on malice and oppression.see gawara united states brass th.as defined in the punitive damages statute,m alice encompasses despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others,and o ppression means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person rights,subds.c,c.the term despicable,though not defined in the statute,is applicable to circumstances that are base,vile,or contemptible.college hospital,superior court cal th,quoting oxford english dict.ed.
under the statute,malice does not require actual intent to harm.citation.conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.citation.malice may be proved either expressly through direct evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws inferences.citation.angie superior court th.
in addressing jci challenge,we inquire whether the record contains substantial evidence to support a determination by clear and convincing evidence citation.shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th.under that standard,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the pfeifers,give them the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolve all conflicts in their favor,with due attention to the heightened standard of proof.ibid.
we find guidance regarding jci contention from stewart,supra,th.there,the evidence established that the defendant,a supplier of raw asbestos,was aware of the dangers of asbestos as early as.id.at.the defendant warned its workers,but decided to minimize its disclosure of information regarding the dangers of its type of asbestos to customers and workers who used products containing it.ibid.in affirming the jury finding of malice,fraud,or oppression,the court concluded that the evidence showed that the defendant did not share its knowledge of the dangers of asbestos with its customers or with individuals who would,predictably,be exposed to dust from its products,and that it instead sought to downplay the risk.id.at.
the evidence below presented a similar situation.to begin,the evidence showed that during the,jci knew that asbestos dust was hazardous,and it took action to protect its own employees from the hazards.george springs,jci representative,testified that in,jci learned that handling raw asbestos was hazardous to certain workers.in,osha promulgated regulations requiring manufacturers of products to monitor the concentrations of asbestos fibers in the air in their factories.in compliance with the regulations,jci began monitoring the air in its factories for asbestos particles,and used engineering controls to suppress dust levels.later,in,pursuant to the regulations,jci prepared a safety data sheet for the gaskets warning its employees that exposure to asbestos caused asbestosis and cancer.
the evidence also supports the inference that jci knew that its products were likely to pose a danger to users,whom it did not warn.under the osha regulations,manufacturers were required to place warning labels on their products unless the asbestos fibers had been modified by a bonding agent so that during any reasonably foreseeable use,no airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers in excess of specified exposure limits would be released.according to springs,jci knew that users replaced gaskets using methods that created asbestos dust or fragmented old gaskets,yet it never tested its products to determine whether those methods generated concentrations of asbestos fibers exceeding the regulatory limits.millette,the pfeifers environmental scientist,testified that the bonding agents in jci products did not fully encapsulate the asbestos fibers in addition,he stated that certain operations that pfeifer performed on the products released concentrations of asbestos fibers many thousands greater than ordinary background levels.
we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to show malice,that is,despicable conduct coupled with a conscious disregard for the safety of others.in view of jci compliance with the osha regulations regarding its own workplace,jci fully understood that asbestos dust endangered workers,but it did not issue warnings to customers until,notwithstanding its awareness that they used the products in ways that generated considerable asbestos dust.indeed,although jci informed its employees that the asbestos used in making gaskets caused cancer,jci provided that information to customers only when they asked for the safety data sheet.the evidence thus established that jci carried on despicable conduct with an awareness of the probable dangerous consequences,and willfully fail ed to avoid those consequences.angie superior court,supra,th at.
jci maintains that there is insufficient evidence of malice or oppression,pointing to evidence supporting the inference that jci sold its products with the good faith belief that they were safe.jci argues that it reasonably believed that the bonding agents in the products fully encapsulated the asbestos fibers that its manufacturing experience and the osha regulations supported its belief that the products were safe that no specific study showed that the products were unsafe and that its failure to test the products was consistent with practices.
in so arguing,however,jci misapprehends our role as an appellate court.review for substantial evidence is not trial de novo.citation.ocm principal opportunities fund,cibc world markets th.when there is substantial evidence to support the jury actual conclusion,it is of no consequence that the jury believing other evidence,or drawing other reasonable inferences,might have reached a contrary conclusion.bowers bernards d,italics omitted.
the jury rejected the inferences that jci proposes on appeal,and the trial evidence supports its decision to do so.generally,the existence of governmental safety regulations does not bar an award of punitive damages for egregious misconduct that they are ineffective in preventing.grimshaw ford motor d.nor does evidence suggesting that a manufacturers failure to warn may have been consistent with industry practices necessarily preclude an award of punitive damages.see id.at.
here,the osha regulations effectively obliged jci to determine whether its products were exempt from the osha warning requirement,as the requirement applied to any product during the reasonably foreseeable use of which airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers in excess of specified exposure limits would be released.jci knew that its customers used the products in ways capable of generating dangerous levels of asbestos dust,yet it neither attempted to determine such levels nor issued warnings.according to springs,jci knew that users like pfeifer replaced gaskets using power wire brushes and compressed air,which generated asbestos dust and caused the old gaskets to disintegrate.moreover,the evidence showed that jci could have assessed those levels,as springs testified that in the,jci monitored the concentration of asbestos particles in the air of its factories and used engineering controls to suppress dust levels,in order to comply with the osha regulations in view of the testimony from brodkin,the pfeifers expert on diseases,there was ample evidence that during the,it was widely accepted that asbestos dust was carcinogenic.the osha regulations,which were admitted into evidence,stated no one has disputed that exposure to asbestos of high enough intensity and long enough duration is causally related to asbestosis and cancers.the evidence was thus sufficient to support the jury conclusion that jci did not market its products with a good faith belief in their safety.
jci also contends that it can not be subject to an award of punitive damages for providing gaskets and packing to the navy pursuant to its specifications.we recognize that under the military contractor defense,a supplier of military goods may be exempt from liability arising from a failure to warn regarding the dangers of its products when military specifications preclude such warnings.jackson deft,d.however,jci does not argue and the evidence does not support that the navy specifications precluded warnings regarding the dangers of asbestos.moreover,as discussed above,the evidence supporting the award primarily concerns jci conduct after pfeifer left the navy,and there is no evidence that the products he used as a civilian boiler technician were subject to specifications that barred such warnings.see bullock philip morris usa,th,bullock affirming punitive damages awarded based on defendant cigarette manufacturer misconduct during limited portion of plaintiff entire period of cigarette use.we therefore reject jci contention.in sum,there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding of malice,fraud or oppression.
jci financial condition 
jci challenges the pfeifers showing regarding its financial condition.generally,an award of punitive damages can not be sustained on appeal unless the trial record contains meaningful evidence of the defendant financial condition.adams murakami cal d,adams.jci argues that the trial court erred in ordering jci to produce evidence of its financial condition,and that the pfeifers showing was inadequate to support the award of punitive damages.
underlying proceedings 
prior to trial,the pfeifers served requests on jci under code of civil procedure section to produce evidence at trial regarding its financial condition.the requests sought testimony from springs and certain specified documents.jci objected to the requests on the ground that they did not comply with subdivision c of civil code section,which governs pretrial discovery regarding a defendant financial condition.
after the jury returned its special verdicts in the first phase of trial,the pfeifers asked the trial court to order jci to produce the requested evidence,for purposes of the second phase.relying on mike davidov issod th mike davidov,they argued that under subdivision c of civil code section,a court may direct a defendant to produce evidence of its financial condition after a jury has found that it is subject to an award of punitive damages,even when the plaintiff made no pretrial efforts to obtain the evidence.over jci objections,the court ordered it to produce springs as a witness and two documents regarding jci financial condition,namely,a balance sheet and an income statement,both dated july.
jci produced the financial documents,but not springs.regarding springs failure to appear,jci counsel informed the trial court simply that springs is not here.jay stuemke,the pfeifers counsel,argued that jci refusal to provide a witness frustrated his presentation of the financial documents to the jury,as they assigned million to a undefined category described only as an asbestos litigation set aside.in response,jci counsel agreed to stipulate that the funds be characterized to the jury as set aside to pay for asbestos litigation,including defense costs and asbestos liabilities.jci counsel further objected to the admission of the documents themselves,but said that the information within them could be provided to the jury in a demonstrative manner.following a discussion,the parties agreed that stuemke would present information from the documents to the jury using a demonstrative board.
before stuemke presentation to the jury,jci counsel voiced a concern that the set aside for asbestos litigation should not be described as a cash provision.according to counsel,the set aside was properly regarded as a reserve against assets.in response to the trial court inquiries,jci counsel explained that his concern focused on the use of the word cash.the court directed stuemke to refer to the set aside as funds or money.
stuemke then spoke to the jury,stating i going to write down numbers on this board for the year in this column and the year in this column.jci assets in.for,in assets.cash on hand in.cash on hand in,liabilities for.liabilities for.leaving their net worth for at negative,and for,negative 
stuemke further stated included in these liabilities is money that jciœ has set aside for asbestos litigation like this,money they set aside to pay lawyers and to pay verdicts and judgments.the money set aside in.for,money set aside for asbestos,so if you subtract from their liabilities the money they set aside for asbestos in,their net worth is a positive.and for,positive.
jci counsel raised no objection to this presentation,and no other evidence was submitted to the jury during the second phase of trial.during closing arguments,stuemke argued that jci nerve endings for feeling pain were in its bank account,where it had set aside money to pay asbestos claims.jci counsel objected to this remark,contending that it suggested that the money set aside for asbestos litigation was in a bank account.the trial court sustained the objection and admonished the jury to disregard stuemke reference to money in an account,stating,there no evidence of that.following stuemke rebuttal argument,which made no mention of cash or a bank account,the trial court repeated the admonishment.
order to produce witness and documents 
jci contends the trial court erred in ordering it to produce evidence under subdivision c of civil code section subdivision c.that provision states in pertinent part no pretrial discovery by the plaintiff shall be permitted with respect to evidence of the defendant financial condition unless the court enters an order permitting such discovery pursuant to this subdivision upon motion by the plaintiff supported by appropriate affidavits and after a hearing,if the court deems a hearing to be necessary,the court may at any time enter an order permitting the discovery otherwise prohibited by this subdivision if the court finds,on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented,that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to section.jci maintains the trial court erred in ordering the production of evidence,arguing that the pfeifers did not comply with the motion procedure specified in subdivision c.
we find dispositive guidance on jci contention from mike davidov.there,the plaintiff conducted no discovery regarding the defendant financial condition prior to the bench trial on the plaintiff claims.mike davidov,supra,th at.after the court found that the defendant had engaged in fraud and awarded compensatory damages,it asked whether the plaintiff had any evidence of the defendant financial condition,for purposes of an award of punitive damages.id.at.the plaintiff acknowledged that he had no such evidence,and requested a hearing and an opportunity to conduct discovery into the defendant financial condition.ibid.when the court ordered a hearing and directed the defendant to produce his financial records,the defendant raised only a single objection,namely,that the plaintiff had neither sought pretrial discovery into the records nor subpoenaed them for trial.ibid.later,the defendant failed to produce his records at the hearing,and the court issued an award of punitive damages to the plaintiff.id.at.
on appeal,the defendant challenged the award of punitive damages on several grounds,including that the plaintiff had presented no evidence of financial worth,and that the plaintiff had not complied with the pretrial discovery procedure specified in subdivision c of civil code section.mike davidov,supra,th at.after concluding that the defendant had forfeited contention,the appellate court rejected contention.id.at.the court stated s ubdivision c allows the trial court,at any time,to enter an order permitting the discovery of a defendant financial condition,if the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that he or she can prevail on a claim upon which an award of punitive damages can be based.while it is true that subdivision c states that such an order may be made u pon motion by the plaintiff supported by appropriate affidavits and after a hearing,that subdivision clearly presupposes that such motion procedure is required where the plaintiff has not actually prevailed on his or her claim at trial.however,once there has been a determination of liability by the trier of fact based on an actual weighing of the credibility of witnesses,this kind of procedure is patently superfluous.so long as the trial court allows the defendant sufficient time,following a determination of liability,to collect his or her financial records for presentation on the issue of the amount of such damages to be awarded,there is nothing prejudicial or unfair about using such a process to try the issue of the amount of punitive damages.if anything,this method serves the purpose behind civil code section,to wit,to protect against premature disclosure of the defendant financial condition.citation.ibid.
we conclude that jci was properly ordered to produce evidence of its financial condition,even though the pfeifers did not comply with the motion procedure specified in subdivision c.as noted in mike davidov,that procedure was rendered superfluous by the jury finding regarding jci malice,oppression,or fraud.
jci urges us to depart from mike davidov,arguing that its discussion of subdivision c is merely incorrectly reasoned dicta.we disagree.to begin,the discussion constitutes a holding,as it addressed a nonforfeited contention.moreover,we find it persuasive.generally,in interpreting a statute,courts seek the legislative intent underlying the statute,looking first to the ordinary meaning of its language.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d.furthermore,the statute must be given a fair,reasonable and common sense interpretation,and one that is practical rather than technical and that leads to a wise policy rather than to mischief or an absurdity.people hinojosa d.
it is well established that civil code section was enacted to protect against the premature disclosure of a defendant financial condition when punitive damages are sought.torres automobile club of california cal th.as noted in mike davidov,the language of subdivision c manifests a legislative intent to authorize a discovery order at any time.mike davidov,supra,th at.furthermore,in view of the first sentence of subdivision c,it is clear that the legislature intent was to permit pretrial discovery through the motion procedure.however,requiring the motion procedure after the factfinder at trial has determined the defendant liability for an award of punitive damages would create an absurdity people hinojosa,supra,d at.generally,motions are confined to question s collateral to the main object of the action lewis superior court th,quoting people sparks d,whereas a trial constitutes the ultimate method of resolving the action eagle oil ref.prentice cal d.accordingly,it makes little sense to compel the plaintiff to show a substantial probability of prevailing on the claim for punitive damages by means of a motion after that claim has been definitively determined at trial.
jci reliance on adams,supra,cal d and amoco chemical certain underwriters at lloyd of london th amoco chemical is misplaced.in adams,our supreme court held that the plaintiff has the burden of proving the defendant financial condition,for purposes of an award of punitive damages.cal d at.in so concluding,the court stated u nder subdivision c,the plaintiff is allowed,on a proper showing,to subpoena documents or witnesses to be available at the trial for the purpose of establishing the profits or financial condition of the defendant.that plaintiff may also obtain pretrial discovery of that information we see no reason why it is even slightly unfair to require a plaintiff to use the procedures available.id.at.however,the court did not mention the motion procedure or examine whether it applied to discovery after the trial on the defendant liability for punitive damages.for this reason,adams provides no guidance on the question before us.ginns savage cal d,fn.language used in any opinion is to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.
the same is true of amoco chemical.there,the plaintiff initiated an action for breach of contract and bad faith against several insurers,seeking punitive damages.amoco chemical,supra,th at.throughout the litigation,the plaintiff never invoked subdivision c of civil code section to obtain discovery into the insurer financial condition.amoco chemical,supra,at,fn.instead,prior to the trial,the plaintiff served requests on the insurers under civil procedure section to produce evidence at trial regarding their financial condition,but the insurers did not respond to the requests and declined to produce the evidence after the trial court ordered them to do so.amoco chemical,supra,at.as a result,the court issued an award of sanctions against the insurers.id.at.later,following the trial,a jury awarded the plaintiff punitive damages.ibid.
the appeal in amoco chemical was limited to a single issue,namely,the propriety of the sanctions.amoco chemical,supra,th at.after determining that the plaintiff had not complied with the procedural requirements of code of civil procedure section,the appellate court reversed the sanctions order.amoco chemical,supra,at.the court sole reference to subdivision c of civil code section occurred in the following remarks despite the exhaustive pretrial discovery conducted in this case,the plaintiff elected to forego its pretrial right to inquire about the insurers financial worth,subd.c whatever merit there might be to that approach in other cases,it was an unfortunate choice in this one.no holding in amoco chemical bears remotely on the propriety of the court order in this case.for the reasons discussed above,we conclude that the trial court properly applied subdivision c.
c.the pfeifers showing 
jci maintains that the pfeifers showing was inadequate to establish its financial condition.we reject this contention.
generally,evidence of the defendant financial condition is required to establish the defendant ability to pay an award of punitive damages.adams,supra,cal d at.the function of this requirement is to ensure that the amount of punitive damages does not exceed the level necessary to properly punish and deter.id.at.the ultimately proper level of punitive damages is an amount not so low that the defendant can absorb it with little or no discomfort citation,nor so high that it destroys,annihilates,or cripples the defendant.citations.rufo simpson th.
our supreme court has prescribed no rigid standard for measuring the ability to pay.adams,supra,cal d at,fn.although net worth is the most common measure,its application is not mandatory,as net worth is subject to easy manipulation.lara cadag th,fn.nonetheless,i n most cases,evidence of earnings or profit alone are not sufficient without examining the liabilities side of the balance sheet.citations.normally,evidence of liabilities should accompany evidence of assets,and evidence of expenses should accompany evidence of income.baxter peterson th.
under these principles,a defendant may have the ability to pay the award of punitive damages,even though the defendant net worth is negative.in zaxis wireless communications,motor sound th,the evidence showed that the defendant total revenues exceeded million per year for three successive years,but that it suffered a net loss of million in each of the years.in addition,the evidence established that the defendant had million in a banking account and the ability to borrow million.id.at.the appellate court concluded that this evidence was sufficient to demonstrate the defendant ability to pay a award of punitive damages,pointing to its large yearly revenues and ability to borrow.ibid.
here,the pfeifers showing presented a similar set of circumstances regarding jci ability to pay.according to that showing,in and,jci had hundreds of millions of dollars of assets including considerable sums of cash and a net worth exceeding million,disregarding the funds that jci itself had set aside for asbestos litigation.moreover,the million award of punitive damages constituted approximately percent of the funds set aside for asbestos litigation costs and judgments in.in view of jci large revenues and the funds set aside for absestos litigation,the award can not be regarded as so high that it would destroy or cripple jci.
jci maintains that stuemke exceeded the scope of the parties stipulation,arguing that he improperly told the jury that jci net worth was positive if one removed the funds set aside for asbestos litigation from jci total liabilities.jci failed to preserve this contention.generally,an appellant forfeits the right to attack error by expressly or impliedly agreeing at trial to the procedure objected to on appeal.redevelopment agency city of berkeley d.before the trial court,jci counsel never objected to stuemke presentation on the ground raised on appeal on the contrary,following the presentation,jci counsel stated,that fine,your honor.jci objections targeted only stuemke remarks during closing arguments suggesting that the funds set aside for asbestos litigation were held as cash in a bank account.as noted above see pt,ante,the trial court sustained the objections and admonished the jury to disregard the remarks.there is no reason to believe the jury disregarded the court instruction.jci has thus failed to show error in stuemke presentation of the stipulated information to the jury.
jci also contends the pfeifers were obliged to present testimony from an accounting or financial expert to establish jci ability to pay.we disagree.generally,after the party with the burden of proof on an issue produces evidence of such weight that a determination in that party favor would necessarily be required,the burden of producing evidence is transferred to the other party.witkin,cal.evidence ed.burden of proof and presumptions,italics omitted.here,stuemke identified jci total assets and total liabilities for and,characterized the funds jci had set aside for asbestos litigation as a liability,and described their function.in our view,this showing was sufficient to shift the burden of producing evidence regarding jci ability to pay to jci.if jci believed that additional evidence was needed to explain the set aside for asbestos litigation,it was free to call an expert.this jci did not do.in sum,the pfeifer show was sufficient to show jci financial condition.
constitutional limits on punitive damages 
jci contends the award of punitive damages contravened applicable constitutional standards regarding such awards.as explained below,we disagree.
fair notice regarding award of damages 
jci maintains that civil code section,as applied in this case,was unconstitutionally vague,as it authorized an award of punitive damages without adequate notice to jci.under the due process requirements of the federal constitution,state statutes authorizing punitive damages must give tortfeasors fair notice of the damages that may be awarded for misconduct.philip morris williams,roby mckesson cal th,roby.jci contends the award of punitive damages is constitutionally infirm on the facts of this case,arguing that its conduct was consistent with numerous objective indicators,including its manufacturing experience,the osha regulations,and the navy specifications for its products.
generally,a challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute may be of two types a facial challenge and an challenge.citation a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.in contrast,an challenge seeks relief from a specific application of a facially valid statute or ordinance to an individual or class of individuals who are under allegedly impermissible present restraint or disability as a result of the manner or circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied.citation.san francisco unified school dist.city and county of san francisco th,quoting tobe city of santa ana cal th,tobe.
here,jci challenges civil code section,as applied.we thus look to the facts of the case,and consider whether in those particular circumstances the statute application deprived jci of a protected right.tobe,supra,cal that.in examining jci contention,we defer to the jury findings on historical facts that are supported by substantial evidence,and then independently review the constitutionality of the statute under those facts.people mitchell th.
under these standards of review,jci contention fails.as explained above see pt,ante,there was sufficient evidence to support the jury determination that jci acted with malice,fraud or oppression,notwithstanding the evidence to which jci directs our attention.accordingly,civil code section,as applied in this case,provided jci with adequate notice of the award of punitive damages.
no constitutionally excessive punishment 
jci also contends that the amount of punitive damages was excessive under the applicable constitutional standards.
governing principles 
generally,the due process requirements of the federal constitution prohibit grossly excessive or arbitrary awards.simon san paolo holding,cal th,simon,quoting state farm mut.auto ins.campbell,state farm.thus,courts must examine the amount of an award by reference to three constitutional guideposts,namely,the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.simon,supra,cal th at,quoting state farm,supra,at.we review the award de novo in light of these factors.simon,supra,at.nonetheless,we defer to the jury findings of historical fact,which are reviewed for the existence of substantial evidence.ibid.
ii.amount of award 
jci maintains that its conduct was insufficiently reprehensible to support the million punitive damages award in our view,this contention fails in light of bankhead arvinmeritor th,bankhead,and stewart,supra,th,which involved facts resembling those presented here.
in bankhead,a worker was employed for thirty years in automobile maintenance facilities,where he handled a manufacturer brake systems that used asbestos linings.bankhead,supra,th at.although the manufacturer knew of the dangers of asbestos and protected its own employees from asbestos dust,it sold its products for a lengthy period without warnings.ibid.after the worker developed mesothelioma,he and his wife asserted claims for negligence,strict liability,and loss of consortium against the manufacturer and other suppliers of products.id.at.in affirming a million punitive damages award,the appellate court held that the manufacturer conduct displayed a high degree of reprehensibility,which continued over many years,and evinced an indifference to or reckless disregard of the health and safety of the plaintiff and those similarly situated.id.at.
similarly,in stewart,a worker and his wife asserted claims for negligence,strict liability,and loss of consortium against a supplier of raw asbestos and other defendants.stewart,supra,th at.in affirming a million award of punitive damages,the appellate court rejected the supplier contention that its conduct was at the low end of reprehensibility,as the plaintiffs had shown that the supplier profited from the sale of a dangerous substance,that it knew the dangers of its product,that it failed to warn consumers of those dangers,and that the plaintiff developed a fatal cancer as a result.id.at.
although the award here is larger than in bankhead and stewart,it is comparable in amount to awards against other defendants whose conduct in marketing dangerous products displayed a high degree of reprehensibility.bullock,supra,th at,affirming million award against cigarette manufacturer boeken philip morris,th,modifying judgment against cigarette manufacturer to reduce million punitive damages award to million,and affirming judgment as modified romo ford motor th,disapproved on another ground in johnson ford motor cal th,affirming million award against manufacturer of defective vehicle that caused death of plaintiffs family members.we therefore conclude that jci conduct was sufficiently reprehensible to support the amount of the award.
iii.ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages 
jci maintains that the ratio of the punitive damages to the compensatory damages was impermissibly high.we reject this contention.
generally,california courts have adopted a broad range of permissible ratios from as low as one to one to as high as to depending on the specific facts of each case.bankhead,supra,th at.relevant considerations include whether the compensatory award included a punitive element in the form of substantial emotional distress damages,and the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct.id.at.in roby,the defendant misconduct manifested a low degree of reprehensibility and approximately of the award of compensatory damages was for the plaintiff distress which included a physical component.roby,supra,cal th at.relying on state farm,our supreme court held that a ratio was the federal constitutional limit applicable in the case.id.at.in contrast,in bullock,the appellate court approved a punitive damages award exemplifying a to ratio in a case involving extremely reprehensible conduct that resulted in the plaintiff death,and an award of compensatory damages that included only a small amount for pain and suffering.bullock,supra,th at.
instructive here are bankhead and stewart.in bankhead,the jury awarded the plaintiffs million in economic damages,million in noneconomic damages,and million in punitive damages.bankhead,supra,th at.following an adjustment reflecting the jury determinations of comparative fault,the defendant was determined to be liable for million of the damages,comprising million in economic damages and in noneconomic damages.id.at.the award of punitive damages million was thus approximately times greater than the award of compensatory damages million.id.at.noting that the defendant conduct was highly reprehensible,the appellate court concluded that the ratio was well within the range for comparable cases and not extraordinarily high,even though the jury award of compensatory damages contained a punitive component.ibid.
in stewart,the jury awarded the plaintiffs million in economic damages,million in noneconomic damages,and million in punitive damages.stewart,supra,th at.following adjustments for the defendant share of comparative fault,the defendant was responsible for compensatory damages totaling million,comprising million in economic damages and in noneconomic damages ibid.the appellate court approved the award of punitive damages,which represented a ratio of approximately two to one.id.at.in so concluding the court rejected the defendant contention that a ratio was the federal constitutional maximum in the case,pointing to the defendant reprehensible conduct.ibid.
here,jci is liable for million in compensatory damages,for purposes of determining the applicable ratio.this total comprises million in economic damages reflecting the adjustment for william pfeifer past medical expenses and million in noneconomic damages reflecting an adjustment for jci share of comparative fault the award of punitive damages million is therefore approximately times the pertinent amount of compensatory damages million although the jury award of noneconomic damages was relatively larger than in bankhead and stewart,a ratio is not the maximum allowable under the circumstances,in view of jci highly reprehensible conduct.see stewart,supra,th at.as the overall ratio is comparable to those cases and within the range of permissible ratios,the award of punitive damages was not excessive in relation to the award of compensatory damages.
iv.absence of civil penalties 
jci contends the award of punitive damages was excessive,noting the absence of civil penalties related to products during william pfeifer naval and civil service.we disagree.generally,civil penalties for acts comparable to the defendant misconduct may demonstrate the existence of fair notice that wrongful conduct could entail punitive damages.grassilli barr th.however,as our supreme court has explained,the guidepost regarding civil penalties is of limited use in cases involving only common law tort duties.simon,supra,cal th at.indeed,in bankhead,which closely resembles the action before us,the appellate court determined that the civil penalty guidepost was essentially irrelevant.bankhead,supra,th at,fn.we therefore conclude the absence of civil penalties does not establish that the award of punitive damages was excessive.in sum,the award did not contravene federal constitutional standards.
expert fees 
jci challenges an award of to the pfeifers for expert fees under code of civil procedure section.regarding the award,subdivision d of code of civil procedure section provides if an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award in any action,the court,in its discretion,may require the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover postoffer costs of the services of expert witnesses,in addition to plaintiff costs.the pfeifers maintain the fee award is beyond our review because jci filed no notice of appeal regarding it.we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over jci contentions concerning the award.
the record discloses that on february,the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the pfeifers awarding damages totaling.the judgment further provided that the pfeifers were entitled to prejudgment interest in the amount of,and costs in the amount of.on march,jci filed a motion to tax costs,which challenged the pfeifers request for the expert fees described above.on april,while that motion was pending,jci filed its notice of appeal,which specified that the appeal was from the judgment,the denial of its motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and t hose pretrial,intermediate and rulings involving the merits of the action which necessarily affected the judgment the notice contained no reference to the motion to tax costs.on april,in ruling on jci motion to tax costs,the trial court denied jci challenge to the pertinent component of the pfeifer request for expert fees.
the key issue before us is whether jci was obliged to notice a separate appeal from the april,ruling.generally,i f a judgment or order is appealable,an aggrieved party must file a timely appeal or forever lose the opportunity to obtain appellate review.citations.norman krug real estate investments,praszker d,italics omitted,quoting eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs rutter group.furthermore,w here several judgments orders occurring close in time are separately appealable,each appealable judgment and order must be expressly specified in either a single notice of appeal or multiple notices of appeal in order to be reviewable on appeal.sole energy petrominerals th,quoting dezerega meggs th.this requirement circumscribes our jurisdiction to review postjudgment orders colony hill ghamaty th.
a judgment is final and appealable if all that remains is a determination of costs and interest.amwest surety ins.patriot homes,th,fn.thus w here the judgment is modified merely to add costs,attorney fees and interest,the original judgment is not substantially changed and the time to appeal it is therefore not affected.citations.torres city of san diego th,quoting eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil writs and appeals the rutter group.for this reason,when a party intends to challenge the judgment and a postjudgment order related to costs,the normal procedure is to file separate appeals from the judgment and the postjudgment order.torres city of san diego,supra,at.this is because the postjudgment order ordinary constitutes a final order regarding a matter collateral to the judgment see robinson city of yucaipa th.
the normal procedure is subject to a limited exception.in grant list lathrop th,grant,the appellate court concluded that when a judgment awards costs and fees to a prevailing party and provides for the later determination of the amounts,the notice of appeal subsumes any later order setting the amounts of the award.ibid.the court reasoned that when the judgment expressly provides for an award of costs or fees,the determination of the amount of the award is not a collateral matter unrelated to the judgment validity and finality,but in essence defines the scope of the judgment itself.id.at.
in fish guevara th,fish,the appellate court held that expert fee awards under code of civil procedure section fall outside the grant exception.there,the defendants prevailed in the action,and a judgment was entered in their favor,stating that they were entitled to all costs,expenses,and disbursements allowed by law fish,supra,th at.after the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the judgment,the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion to tax costs,which challenged the defendants request for an award of expert fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.fish,supra,at.the defendants noticed no appeal from the fee award.ibid.
in concluding that the notice did not subsume the award of expert fees,the appellate court rejected the application of the grant exception,stating grant has no bearing on this case.the judgment in grant awarded costs and attorney fees to the prevailing party as a matter of right.the subsequent order merely set the amount of those costs and fees.citation.since the prevailing party right to costs and fees was determined by the judgment,the propriety of the award was not a collateral issue but was merely incidental to the judgment.citation.fish,supra,th at.the court further explained an award of expert witness fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section is not incidental to the judgment but is instead a separately litigated issue.citation.prevailing parties do not recover their expert witness fees as a matter of right.when the opposing party has rejected a settlement offer and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment,the trial court may,in its discretion,make an award of expert witness fees.citation.because expert witness fees are not incidental to the judgment,the propriety of a postjudgment award of expert witness fees can not be reviewed on an appeal from the judgment.id.at.
fish is dispositive here.jci notice of appeal specified the judgment and other orders,but did not mention the pending motion to tax costs.although the notice referred to orders involving the merits of the action which necessarily affected the judgment,the award of expert fees is not such a ruling.the notice of appeal thus did not subsume that award,notwithstanding the policy of construing notices of appeal liberally in favor of their sufficiency.colony hill ghamaty,supra th at.accordingly,the award is beyond the scope of our review.
jci contends that fish is wrongly decided.we disagree.subdivision b of code of civil procedure section provides that e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.italics added.in contrast,code of civil procedure section augments the costs allowed under code of civil procedure section.code civ,subd.a.moreover,as noted above,subdivision d of code of civil procedure section consigns awards of expert fees exclusively to the trial court discretion.for this reason,such an award is collateral to the judgment.in sum,jci appeal must be dismissed insofar as it challenges the award of expert fees.
the pfeifers cross appeal 
the pfeifers challenge the trial court determinations related to jci credit based on the settlements by other defendants.as explained below,we reject the pfeifers contentions,but conclude that the court determination of the pfeifers net recovery of economic damages must be modified to correct an error that both sides acknowledge.
governing principles 
the amount of compensatory damages for which jci is responsible is subject to two distinct constraints.under civil code section,jci liability for noneconomic damages is limited by its share of comparative fault.jones john crane,th,jones.that provision expressly encompasses damages for loss of consortium.hackett john crane,th,hackett wilson john crane,th,wilson.in contrast,jci liability for economic damages is not subject to an adjustment for its share of comparative fault.hackett,supra,th at.however,under code of civil procedure section,jci was entitled to a credit against its liability for economic damages based on any portion of the settlements properly attributable to the claims for economic damages resolved at trial.hackett,supra,th at.
our inquiry is focused on the determination of the credit when,as here,the settlements were never found to be in good faith.see jones,supra,th at.as explained in espinoza machonga th,espinoza and greathouse amcord,th,greathouse,the credit determination is straightforward when the settlements address only the claims resolved at trial and the settlement funds are undifferentiated,that is,the settlements do not apportion the funds between the claims resolved at trial.in such cases,the credit may be calculated in the following manner.first,the trial court determines what the parties before us call the greathouse ratio,that is,the ratio of the economic damages to the total compensatory damages,as awarded at trial.espinoza,supra,th at greathouse,supra,th at.second,the credit is determined by multiplying the amount of the settlement funds by the greathouse ratio.espinoza,supra,th at greathouse,supra,th at.thus,in the simplest cases,the credit mirror s the factfinder apportionment of damages.hackett,supra,th at.
refinements in determining the credit are required,however,when the settlements purport to encompass claims not resolved at trial or specify an allocation of the settlement funds.jones,supra,th at.we limit our discussion to the refinements applicable in personal injury actions involving married plaintiffs,one of whom is awarded only noneconomic damages for loss of consortium.in such cases,the court must assess the extent to which the settlements allocate funds to claims not resolved at trial.hackett,supra,th at wilson,supra,th at.in addition,to the extent the settlements purport to allocate some portion of settlement funds among the claims resolved at trial,the court is obliged to decide whether the allocation should be used in calculating the credit.jones,supra,at wilson,supra,at.these questions are consigned to the court discretion.jones,supra,at.
if the court finds that some portion of the settlement funds applies to claims not resolved at trial and that the settlement does not govern the allocation of the remaining funds,the court must calculate the credit solely on the basis of the funds assignable to the claims resolved at trial.hackett,supra,th at.this calculation may be carried out by several mathematically equivalent methods,fn.see jones,supra,th at,fn.these methods produce essentially the same result,except for slight differences caused by rounding.hackett,supra,at,fn.see jones,supra,at,fn.
the most straightforward method is to multiply the amount of the settlement funds assignable to the plaintiffs claims by the ratio of the economic damages to the total compensatory damages including the loss of consortium damages,as determined at trial.hackett,supra,th at,fn.see jones,supra,th at,fn.in effect,this method applies the greathouse ratio.thus,if the court has decided that all the settlement funds concern the claims resolved at trial,the method reduces to the calculation described in espinoza and greathouse.
underlying proceedings 
the jury found that william pfeifer had suffered in economic damages,including in past medical expenses,and in noneconomic damages that anne pfeiffer had suffered in noneconomic damages for loss of consortium and that jci had a percent share of comparative fault.later,jci filed a motion to to reduce the award to william pfeifer for his past medical expenses from the amount stipulated at trial to.
on february,while jci motion was pending,the trial court conducted a hearing on the entry of a judgment and jci credit based on the settlements.on the same date,the court entered a judgment in favor of the pfeifers awarding damages totaling,but deferred the determination of jci credit 
on february,jci filed a motion for a credit.in opposing the motion,the pfeifers maintained that although the settlement funds totaled million,only million of the funds were assignable to their claims at trial,as the settlements expressly allocated of the funds to those claims and to wrongful death claims by william pfeifer heirs.
on march,after granting jci motion to reduce the award to william pfeifer for his past medical expenses,the trial court issued its ruling regarding the credit.in determining the credit,the court declined to adopt the allocation of funds stated in the settlements,and found that all the settlement funds were applicable to the claims resolved at trial.after noting that william pfeifer economic damages had been reduced to through the adjustment to his past medical expenses,the court found that jci was entitled to a credit of.in applying the credit,the court reduced the award of economic damages by percent that is,jci percentage of comparative fault,and then applied the credit,resulting in a net recovery of in economic damages.
c.the pfeifers contentions 
the pfeifers contend the trial court erred in setting aside the allocations stated in the settlements and in calculating the credit.they argue that only half the settlement funds that is,million were properly assignable to their trial claims.they further argue that following the reduction of the medical expenses portion of the award of economic damages to william pfeifer,the appropriate greathouse ratio was percent the ratio of,the adjusted economic damages,to,the adjusted total compensatory damages.they maintain that the correct credit,calculated in light of their proposed greathouse ratio,was,resulting in a net recovery of economic damages totaling that is,minus.
allocation in settlements 
we begin with the pfeifers challenge to the trial court ruling regarding the allocation in the settlements.courts have wide discretion in allocating prior settlement recoveries to claims not adjudicated at trial.jones,supra,th at.under this standard,we examine the court findings,whether express or implied,for the existence of substantial evidence.roddis all coverage ins.exchange d,see wilson,supra,th at.
generally,an allocation in a settlement that has not been judicially approved does not bind the trial court.jones,supra,th at.rather,the party seeking the benefit of the allocation has the burden of presenting evidence that the allocation in the settlement is reasonable.ibid.thus,the party must ordinarily show,by declarations or other evidence,that the allocation reflected a reasonable valuation of the pertinent claims,or that the allocation was reached in a sufficiently adversarial manner to ensure a reasonable valuation.id.at,quoting erreca superior court th.absent such evidence,the court may properly reject the allocation in a settlement.jones,supra,at.
an instructive application of these principles is found in jones.there,a navy serviceman who was exposed to jci products developed mesothelioma following his naval career.jones,supra,at.after he and his wife initiated an action against jci for personal injury and loss of consortium,the jury awarded economic and noneconomic damages,including damages for the wife loss of consortium claim.ibid.in calculating jci credit for settlements,the trial court rejected the express allocation specified in the settlements for wrongful death claims.id.at.the appellate court affirmed the ruling,noting that the plaintiffs presented no evidence regarding the potential value of wrongful death claims by the heirs.id.at.
here,the pfeifers offered little or no evidence regarding the reasonableness of the allocation in the settlements other than the terms of the settlements themselves in rejecting the allocation,the trial court found that the settlements,by themselves,did not constitute persuasive evidence to assist the court.the court further noted that there was no showing regarding william pfeifer relationships with his offspring,for purposes of determining the value of their claims.in view of jones,we find no abuse of discretion in the court ruling.
hackett,upon which the pfeifers rely,is distinguishable.as in jones,hackett involved an action for personal injury and loss of consortium against jci by a former navy serviceman and his wife.hackett,supra,th at.the pertinent settlements encompassed wrongful death claims not resolved at trial,but unlike those in jones,allocated no specific portion of the settlement funds to them.id.at.after evidence was presented to the trial court that the heirs had a close relationship with him,the trial court found that percent of the settlement funds were properly allocated to potential wrongful death claims.id.at.on appeal,jci maintained only that the trial court had allocated an excessive amount of the settlement funds to those claims.id.at.the appellate court affirmed the ruling,concluding that there was ample evidence to support it.id.at.
in contrast with hackett,the pfeifers maintain on appeal that the trial court was obliged to allocate of the settlement funds to the wrongful death claims,as specified in the settlements.to establish this contention,they must identify evidence sufficient to require the trial court to accept that allocation.see wilson,supra,th at.as explained above,the record discloses no such evidence.in sum,the trial court did not err in rejecting the allocation in the settlements.
calculation of credit 
the pfeifers contend the trial court calculated jci credit by means of an incorrect method.we disagree.in calculating the credit,the trial court applied a method approved in jones jones,supra,th at.as explained there,the method is mathematically equivalent to greathouse ratio based method advocated by the pfeifers.id.at,fn.indeed,multiplying the total amount of the settlement funds million by the pfeifers proposed greathouse ratio percent results in a credit essentially identical to the credit determined by the trial court 
comparative fault 
the pfeifers contend the trial court erred in adjusting their recovery of economic damages to reflect jci percent share of comparative fault.jci does not dispute that the pfeifers net economic damages should be calculated without reference to jci comparative fault,but asserts that the pfeifers have forfeited their contention by failing to raise it expressly in their opening brief in the 
we decline to find a forfeiture.generally,the function of the forfeiture rule on appeal is to ensure that issues are adequately argued in the opening brief,for the benefit of the reviewing court and the respondent.duncan ramish cal,see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.here,the pfeifers opening brief in the asserts that with respect to the award of economic damages,the court erroneously appl ied the jury allocation of fault percentage,which is a factor only applied to the noneconomic damages portion of the verdict it also proposes a calculation of the net recovery of economic damages that omits the improper application of jci share of comparative fault to the economic damages,and notes that before the trial court,jci also suggested a calculation that omitted that application.furthermore,although jci asserts a forfeiture on appeal,it again proposes a determination of the pfeifers net economic damages that omits any reference to jci share of comparative fault 
because the error here is clear and not in dispute,we conclude that the pfeifers net recovery of economic damages should be determined without any adjustment for jci share of comparative fault.accordingly,we will modify the net award of economic damages to that is,the award of economic damages,as reduced with respect to william pfeifer past medical expenses,minus jci credit.
disposition 
jci appeal with respect to the award of expert fees is dismissed.the judgment is modified to reflect that the pfeifers net recovery of economic damages is,and the judgment and related orders are affirmed in all other respects.the pfeifers are awarded their costs on appeal.
in a related contention,jci suggests that the pfeifers advocated the theory that each exposure to asbestos dust was a substantial factor contributing to william pfeifer risk of developing cancer jci notes that during closing arguments,the pfeifers counsel stated,o ur experts told you about the fact that each and every exposure to asbestos caused pfeifer cancer.in our view,the pfeifers relied on no such theory,notwithstanding the remark quoted above.shortly after making the remark,the pfeifers counsel argued that the experts said that each exposure contributed to pfeifer cancer,that no single exposure could be singled out as a cause,and that it is the total dose that puts the person at risk.in addition,counsel observed that according to the experts,pfeifer exposure to asbestos from jci products was a substantial contributing factor of his mesothelioma.

on appeal,jci does not contend that any employer of william pfeifer other than the navy was a sophisticated user.
a directed verdict may be granted only when,disregarding conflicting evidence,giving the evidence of the party against whom the motion is directed all the value to which it is legally entitled,and indulging every legitimate inference from such evidence in favor of that party,the court nonetheless determines there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support the claim or defense of the party opposing the motion,or a verdict in favor of that party.citations.howard owens corning th.the trial court ruling is reviewed de novo.brassinga city of mountain view th.
as jci does not suggest that the trial court was obliged to correct its proposed instructions,jci has forfeited any contention that the jury should have received modified instructions.
we granted a request from the civil justice association of california cjac to submit a brief as an amicus curiae.
cjac proposes that we apply section of the restatement third of torts products liability,rather than section.however,as the latter section has been adopted as law in california johnson,supra,cal th at,we decline to do so.nonetheless,section of the restatement third of torts products liability would not dictate a contrary result were we to consider it.comment i to section states there is no general rule as to whether one supplying a product for the use of others through an intermediary has a duty to warn the ultimate product user directly the standard is one of reasonableness in the circumstances.among the factors to be considered are the gravity of the risks posed by the product,the likelihood that the intermediary will convey the information to the ultimate user,and the feasibility and effectiveness of giving a warning directly to the user.thus,when the purchaser of machinery is the owner of a workplace who provides the machinery to employees for their use,and there is reason to doubt that the employer will pass warnings on to employees,the seller is required
