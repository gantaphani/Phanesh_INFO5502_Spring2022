howard and nancy nease commenced this product liability action against ford motor company,alleging that howard suffered serious injuries in an accident caused by a design defect in the speed control system of his ford ranger pickup truck.over ford objection,the neases offered the expert testimony of samuel sero that the speed control cable in the ranger is susceptible to getting stuck or bound while the throttle to which it is linked is in the open position,thus preventing the driver from slowing down the vehicle.the neases claim that this is precisely what happened while howard was driving his ranger.a west virginia jury awarded the neases in damages.ford made several motions,including a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in its motion,ford renewed its argument that sero testimony was inadmissible under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,and should have been excluded.in the alternative,ford sought a new trial on the basis that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on strict liability under west virginia law and erroneously admitted evidence of prior incidents involving ford vehicles.
the district court denied ford motions.ford now appeals.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that sero testimony should not have been admitted.and,without any other expert testimony to establish that the ford ranger was defectively designed and that there were safer alternative designs available that a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have adopted,the neases can not prove their case under west virginia law.accordingly,we must reverse and remand for entry of judgment in ford favor.
on november,howard was driving his recently purchased,used ford ranger pickup truck on route in albans,west virginia.according to howard,he was traveling mph when he discovered his vehicle would not slow down when he released the accelerator pedal.he tried to slow the pickup truck by applying the brakes,but to no avail.in order to avoid running into pedestrians or other cars,howard turned the ranger off the road,drove over a curb,and crashed into a brick car wash building.for about seconds after the pickup truck hit the brick wall,the tires reportedly continued spinning until the engine shut down.howard ranger had approximately miles on it at the time of the accident,and there is no indication in the record that the vehicle had ever manifested problems with the accelerator,cruise control or throttle.the neases thereafter filed this action against ford motor company,alleging that ford defectively designed the accelerator assembly of the ranger pickup truck.the complaint asserted causes of action for strict liability,negligence,and breach of warranty.
the general design and function of the throttle control system in the ford ranger is typical of any modern passenger vehicle.the driver controls engine speed by depressing the accelerator pedal,which is linked to the throttle,which,in turn,regulates the amount of air flowing into the engine.when the accelerator pedal is depressed,the throttle opens and engine speed increases when the accelerator pedal is released,the throttle closes,airflow is restricted and engine speed decreases.
in the ford ranger,the accelerator pedal is linked to the throttle body by a steel accelerator cable.the accelerator cable is attached to a lever on the throttle body the lever operates the throttle valve and the throttle valve controls the engine air intake.as the accelerator pedal is depressed,the accelerator cable which is attached to the throttle lever is pulled to open the throttle valve and increase the engine speed.in essence,the accelerator pedal,the accelerator cable and the throttle lever form a pulley system that opens the throttle.as a safety feature,the throttle lever is equipped with return springs that exert pounds of continuous force to pull the throttle closed when the driver takes his foot off of the accelerator.
in addition to the accelerator assembly,another means by which the driver of a ranger can open the throttle is the cruise control system.this system is operated by a speed control actuator and a speed control cable.the cruise control system incorporates an electric motor that operates a steel cable the speed control cable to open and close the throttle.the speed control cable and the accelerator cable are attached to the same throttle system that operates the throttle valve.when the speed control actuator receives input from the cruise control switch on the steering column,the motor manipulates the speed control cable to pull the throttle lever independently of the main accelerator cable.
the throttle control design takes into account that both cables are attached to the same throttle.in order to prevent significant stress to the speed control cable that could potentially occur when the cruise control is not engaged and the throttle lever is being controlled by the accelerator pedal and cable,ford incorporated a lost motion configuration for the speed control cable assembly.in this design,the steel speed control cable runs from the motor in the speed control actuator through a plastic guide tube,and is attached to the throttle lever by a plastic connector.id.the connector and the guide tube move with the throttle lever when it is being operated by the accelerator cable.the speed control cable itself stays stationary while the guide tube moves up and down the cable and in and out of a stationary plastic casing tube,called a casing cap,which is attached to the motor.id.the gap between the moving guide tube and the stationary casing cap is approximately inches.
following the accident,plaintiffs hired samuel sero,an electrical engineer,to examine the engine and the throttle assembly in howard ford ranger.sero approached his examination with the view that in cases,the issue is often one of mechanical binding and that a investigation should look at the accelerator cable,to see if there anything on it that bound up and prevented it from closing the throttle when the accelerator pedal was released,looking for any kind of grime,grit,or anything that could bind that one.sero indicated that a investigation should therefore look for the presence of contaminants and particles that could lodge between the speed control guide tube and the casing cap and create a wedging effect.sero used a borescope to inspect the speed control assembly.
a borescope is essentially a tube equipped with a light that a mechanic or an engineer can insert into an inaccessible area of the engine and view a given component without having to disassemble the engine.when he examined the speed control cable in the neases pickup,sero did not find any materials wedged between the guide tube and the cap.in fact,he noted that the speed control cable moved freely.nevertheless,sero concluded that contaminants had entered and built up in the casing cap over time,causing the guide tube to stick and,therefore,the throttle plate to remain open.sero testified that he was able to identify a lot of contaminant deposited in the casing cap,and along the guide tube.sero also noticed gouges or striations on the guide tube.from this observation,sero believed that there had been a rough,abrasive material between the interior of the casing cap tube and the surface of the guide tube,indicative of binding.sero surmised that sufficient debris had accumulated to create the wedging effect needed to keep the throttle open after the accelerator pedal was released.however,sero had no way of knowing precisely how much contaminant was present in the casing cap or whether it was enough to lodge in the between the cap and the guide tube such that the throttle would be stuck in the open position.the borescope is simply a viewing tool it does not afford a means for determining the amount of the contaminant that can be seen with the device.
to bolster his opinion,sero pointed to a document ford had prepared in identifying potential risks ford engineers should consider addressing in the design of particular vehicles in the future.this document is called a failure mode and effects analysis fmea.according to ford potential failure mode and effects analysis handbook,a n fmea can be described as a systemized group of activities intended to a recognize and evaluate the potential failure of a and its effects,b identify actions which could eliminate or reduce the chance of the potential failure occurring,and c document the process.the primary purposes of an fmea include identify ing potential failure modes and rat ing the severity of their effects and help ing engineers focus on eliminating product and process concerns and help ing prevent problems from occurring.id.an fmea is meant to be a action,not an exercise.id.
sero testified that the fmea directly addresse d the fact that dirt,grease or ice has formed between cable and cable sheath and therefore demonstrated that ford was well aware of the problem of binding in the lost motion cable.sero asserted therefore that the fmea proved the speed control assembly in the ford ranger was susceptible to binding.sero was apparently unaware,however,that the fmea did not even apply to the ford ranger.the fmea dealt with a speed control system that was not present in the ranger.
based on his borescope exam and the fmea,sero opined that the ford ranger design was not reasonably safe and that there were several alternative designs that ford could have utilized in the design of the speed control assembly 
it is my opinion,within a reasonable degree of engineering certainty that 
nease ranger experienced a failure to decelerate by reason of the binding of the lost motion portion of the cruise cable while the throttle was substantially open 
the cable design employed by ford in the subject ranger permits dirt,grease and grime to enter the conduit through which the cable passes and is known to cause sticking or binding of the cable 
the subject cable is defectively designed 
the binding of the cable was caused by particles of dirt debris typically found under the hood of motor vehicles 
the condition almost immediately deplete d the vacuum assist to the brakes 
the condition,accompanied by loss of vacuum assist,required the application of brake pedal forces beyond the physical capabilities of nease 
the binding of the cable was the proximate cause of the crash of the nease vehicle 
safer,feasible alternative designs were available and known to ford motor company at the time the ranger was manufactured.
prior to trial,ford moved to exclude sero opinions under daubert on the grounds that sero opinions were not based on any reliable methodology and that sero had not established through testing or other means,such as scientific literature,that the binding of the speed control assembly could actually occur.see daubert,at explaining that the district court must ensur e that an expert testimony rests on a reliable foundation emphasis added.ford also argued that sero,as an electrical engineer,was unqualified to render an expert opinion on matters of automotive design.the district court denied ford motion to exclude sero testimony,concluding that sero was sufficiently qualified by means of his experience design ing and operat ing mechanical systems in a variety of settings.the court also determined that in arriving at his opinion,sero employed standard engineering methodology to conduct his physical inspection and reach his opinions.id.this methodology included physically inspecting the vehicle parts,understanding how they are designed to operate,observing evidence of whether some material interfered with the operation of the cable,and opining how that could and did occur here.id.at.
the case proceeded to trial and sero offered his opinions.ford attacked sero opinions on cross examination and offered its own expert testimony.sero acknowledged that when he performed his inspection of the speed control cable in the neases ranger,he did not find any materials actually wedged between the guide tube and cap,and he noted that the speed control cable moved freely.sero further admitted that he had never actually found a bound speed cable assembly in any vehicle that he had inspected.
in contrast to sero professed inability to determine how much debris was present in the casing cap because the borescope does not provide a way to determine the scale of the contaminants,ford experts performed tests on the neases vehicle and were able to quantify the size of the contaminants found on the ranger guide tube.steven maclean,an expert in the field of mechanical engineering,used a scanning electron microscope to determine that the thickest region found on nease guide tube was approximately microns in thickness.for perspective,maclean explained that a piece of paper is about microns thick,making it microns thicker than the contaminants found on the guide tube in the speed control assembly.either one is far smaller than the inch gap between the casing cap and guide tube.and,with respect to the gouge marks sero noticed during the borescope exam that he believed were indicative of binding,maclean testified that his analysis indicated that these marks are from the manufacturing process,the molding process of these parts,not a binding event.
sero agreed that he had never conducted any testing to determine whether enough debris could accumulate in the casing cap during normal operation to resist the pounds of force exerted by the return spring and to cause the throttle to stick open.sero simply relied upon his observations during the borescope exam,which was videotaped.at trial,however,sero was unable to distinguish between the video of the nease borescope and a borescope exam for a previous case in which sero had testified that the speed control cable did not bind.he could not tell the borescope of the cable that he said did bind from the borescope of the cable that he said did not bind.in other words,he could not tell one from the other.
with regard to the fmea process that was so central to sero opinion,ford presented evidence that potential failure modes identified in the fmea had not occurred during actual vehicle operation.for example,maclean explained that a fmea is a common engineering tool,used before marketing a new product to the public to proactively try to determine what are all of the possible failure modes for that particular new design.id.according to maclean,an fmea is not a record of existing problems but rather a tool for a new product.when an fmea is performed,the manufacturer bring s in design engineers,analysis engineers,manufacturing engineers,people from all different disciplines,and the group tries to come up with a very comprehensive and exhaustive list of failure modes and seek to determine how likely it is to occur,and what does my system do to possibly detect it and prevent it from happening.similarly,karl stopschinski,a registered professional engineer and member of the society of automotive engineers,testified that the fmea process is akin to a brainstorming session to identify any potential failure modes.emphasis added.additionally,ford engineering experts indicated that the fmea on which sero relied did not even apply to the neases ranger pickup truck.rather,james engle,a design analysis engineer,indicated that it is the fmea that applies to the ranger because it was originated in february of and carried forward.
finally,sero testified that several alternative speed control cable designs were available at the time and that ford could have made the ranger safer by incorporating one of these designs.he admitted,however,that he had not tested any of these alternative designs to determine whether any of them would have prevented the accident in question.in sero opinion,testing of the alternative designs he identified was unnecessary because the designs had been in use in other vehicles for years and were therefore proven commodit ies.
the district court instructed the jury that on plaintiffs strict liability claim,plaintiffs had to prove that the design of the ford ranger was not reasonably safe for its intended use.although the court explained that the plaintiffs are only entitled to a reasonably safe product,not to an absolutely safe product,the court then instructed,over ford objection,that i f a product can be made safer and the danger may be reduced by an alternative design at not substantial increase in price,then the manufacturer has a duty to adopt such a design.id.during closing argument,plaintiffs counsel highlighted the safer alternative design instruction 
if a product can be made safer and the danger reduced by an alternative design or device at no substantial increase in cost,then the manufacturer has a duty to adopt such design.all that means is if you find that one of the other designs was safer and it was going to cost very much t hen you can find that ford breached its duty.
the jury returned a verdict for the neases on the strict liability count and awarded damages of.the jury returned defense verdicts on the negligence and breach of warranty counts.
after trial ford filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule b.first,ford argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict for strict liability because the claim was dependent upon the testimony of plaintiffs expert sero.and,ford argued,as it had prior to trial,that sero testimony should not have been admitted because sero was unqualified to testify as an expert and that sero opinions should have been excluded under daubert.specifically,ford argued that sero never demonstrated unidirectional binding of nease speed control cable,he did not attempt to simulate his theory,he did not conduct any tests that a foreign substance could withstand the spring pressure,and he did not demonstrate alternative designs were equally or more safe.the district court denied the rule motion,concluding that sero methodology was reliable because he used the fmea methodology used by ford and that the borescope examination was consistent and trustworthy and what historically was used in failure to decelerate cases.
alternatively,ford moved for a new trial pursuant to rule a a,arguing that the verdict should be set aside because the district court issued an improper duty to adopt jury instruction as to safer alternative designs.ford also contended that the district court erroneously admitted evidence of other incidents involving ford vehicles with an allegedly defective speed control assembly unit.the district court denied the motion for a new trial on both grounds.the court did not expressly reject ford position that the duty to adopt instruction was incorrect under west virginia law.instead,the district court concluded that even if the jury instruction was erroneous,it was harmless because the jury found that the product was defective and not reasonably safe,and thus the jury did not need to reach the question of the duty to adopt a safer alternative design.additionally,the district court noted that the jury instructions were otherwise correct and informed the jury that the neases were not entitled to an absolutely safe product.finally,the district court ruled that even if the admission of evidence regarding other incidents was erroneous,it was harmless in view of court limiting instruction to the jury that it only consider the alleged other incidents for the limited purpose of determining whether ford had notice of the defect and not as evidence that the ford ranger was defective.
ford appeals,arguing that the district court incorrectly admitted sero expert testimony in contravention of the requirement that such testimony be reliable under daubert and its progeny that the district court erroneous duty to adopt jury instruction was not harmless in view of the fact that it was the only instruction that counsel for nease highlighted in his closing argument to the jury and that the erroneous admission of other incident evidence was not rendered harmless by the district court limiting instruction because the limiting instruction did not apply to the other incidents at issue.to resolve this appeal,we need only address ford daubert argument.
ford contends that the district court erroneously denied its motion to exclude sero opinion that ford design of the speed control assembly in the ford ranger was defective and that ford could have used a different design that would have prevented nease accident.we review the district court application of daubert for abuse of discretion.see anderson westinghouse savannah river,cir.if the district court makes an error of law in deciding an evidentiary question,that error is by definition an abuse of discretion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a district court likewise abuses its discretion in deciding a daubert challenge if its conclusion rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.bryte ex rel.bryte american household,cir.
daubert applicability 
we first must visit the question of whether daubert even applies under these circumstances.the neases insist that it does not.we disagree daubert clearly applies here.
in daubert,the supreme court addressed an evidentiary issue that had long divided federal courts whether the admissibility of expert scientific testimony was governed by the general acceptance test established in frye united states,cir.or the standards set forth in federal rule of evidence,see at.daubert held that the federal rules of evidence superseded frye and that the admissibility of scientific evidence no longer was limited to knowledge or evidence generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community.see at.
thus,daubert made clear that the governing standard for evaluating proposed expert testimony was set forth in rule,which at the time provided if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.daubert,at.implicit in the text of rule,the daubert court concluded,is a district court gatekeeping responsibility to ensur e that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.id.at emphasis added.
relevant evidence,of course,is evidence that helps the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.id.at internal question marks omitted.to be relevant under daubert,the proposed expert testimony must have a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.id.at.
with respect to reliability,the district court must ensure that the proffered expert opinion is based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge and not on belief or speculation,and inferences must be derived using scientific or other valid methods.oglesby motors,cir.daubert offered a number of guideposts to help a district court determine if expert testimony is sufficiently reliable to be admissible.first,a key question to be answered in determining whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be and has been tested.at.a second question to be considered by a district court is whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication.id.publication regarding the theory bears upon peer review t he fact of publication or lack thereof in a peer reviewed journal will be a relevant,though not dispositive,consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology on which an opinion is premised.id.at.third,in the case of a particular scientific technique,the court ordinarily should consider the known or potential rate of error.id.fourth,despite the displacement of frye,general acceptance is nonetheless relevant to the reliability inquiry.id.widespread acceptance can be an important factor in ruling particular evidence admissible,and a known technique which has been able to attract only minimal support with the community may properly be viewed with skepticism.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.daubert list of relevant considerations is not exhaustive indeed,the court has cautioned that this list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case,kumho tire carmichael,and that a trial court has broad latitude to determine whether these factors are reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case,id.at.
the neases contend that we can affirm because the district court was not obliged to perform its daubert gatekeeping function in the first place because the daubert test for assessing the validity of scientific evidence applies only to novel scientific testimony,it does not apply in the expert field of engineering.brief of appellees at.this bifurcated argument is dead wrong on both counts.
first,daubert itself makes clear that its application is not limited to newfangled scientific theory,explaining that we do not read the requirements of rule to apply specially or exclusively to unconventional evidence.daubert,at.the court recognized the premise that propositions are less likely to be challenged than those that are novel,but clearly never suggested that longstanding theories are immune to a daubert analysis.
second,the supreme court made clear more than years ago in kumho tire that daubert was not limited to the testimony of scientists but also applied to testimony based on technical and other specialized knowledge.at.despite having cited kumho tire in their brief,the neases are apparently unaware that the very issue there involved the application of daubert to the testimony of a mechanical engineer.see id.at this case requires us to decide how daubert applies to the testimony of engineers and other experts who are not scientists.emphasis added.the kumho court concluded that rule applies to all expert testimony as its language makes no relevant distinction between scientific knowledge and technical or other specialized knowledge.it makes clear that any such knowledge might become the subject of expert testimony.id.at.the kumho court affirmed the district court application of daubert and decision to exclude the engineering expert testimony as unreliable.see id.at and,finally,if kumho were not enough,this court has also sanctioned the application of daubert to assess the reliability of expert engineering testimony.see oglesby,at affirming district court application of daubert principles to testimony of a mechanical engineer and concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the engineer opinion as unreliable.
accordingly,we conclude that daubert most certainly applies to sero testimony.we now turn to consider whether,under daubert,the district court properly admitted sero testimony.
b.the district court application of daubert to sero opinions 
as we already explained,rule imposes a special gatekeeping obligation on the trial judge to ensure that an opinion offered by an expert is reliable.and although a trial judge has broad discretion to determine reliability in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the particular case,kumho,at,such discretion does not include the decision to abandon the gatekeeping function,id.at scalia,concurring.
in ruling on ford motion in limine to exclude sero testimony as unreliable under daubert,the district court simply dismissed e very argument raised by ford as go ing to the weight,not admissibility,of sero testimony.the court did not use daubert guideposts or any other factors to assess the reliability of sero testimony,and the court did not make any reliability findings.indeed,the district court referred neither to rule nor to daubert.we are forced to conclude that the court abandoned its gatekeeping function with respect to ford motion in limine.
in denying ford rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law which renewed ford argument that sero opinion should have been excluded under daubert,the district court again found that ford arguments go to the weight the jury should afford sero testimony,not its admissibility.although the district court this time cited daubert and stated that,according to sero,the methodology he employed is consistent and trustworthy and what historically is used in failure to decelerate cases,the court repeatedly emphasized that ford effectively raised its objections to sero opinion through.for the district court to conclude that ford reliability arguments simply go to the weight the jury should afford sero testimony is to delegate the court gatekeeping responsibility to the jury.the main purpose of daubert exclusion is to protect juries from being swayed by dubious scientific testimony.in re zurn pex plumbing prods.liab,cir.the district court gatekeeping function under daubert ensures that expert evidence is sufficiently relevant and reliable when it is submitted to the jury.rather than ensure the reliability of the evidence on the front end,the district court effectively let the jury make this determination after listening to ford cross examination of sero.
in sum,the district court did not perform its gatekeeping duties with respect to sero testimony.the fact that an expert witness was subject to a thorough and extensive examination does not ensure the reliability of the expert testimony such testimony must still be assessed before it is presented to the jury.mcclain metabolife int l,cir.thus,we are of the opinion that the district court abused its discretion here by failing to act as a gatekeeper.see kumho,at scalia,concurring t discretion in choosing the manner of testing expert reliability is not discretion to abandon the gatekeeping function or to perform the function inadequately.
sero testimony should have been excluded under daubert 
sero testimony that the speed control assembly was not reasonably safe because it was susceptible to binding 
a plaintiff may not prevail in a products liability case by relying on the opinion of an expert unsupported by any evidence such as test data or relevant literature in the field.oglesby,at internal quotation marks omitted.a reliable expert opinion must not be based on belief or speculation.id.at.one especially important factor for guiding a court in its reliability determination is whether a given theory has been tested.according to daubert,a key question to be answered in determining whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be and has been tested.at.
sero opinion had three critical components that the speed control assembly in the ford ranger was vulnerable to binding because the design allowed for contaminant to lodge between the speed control guide tube and the casing cap that such binding in fact occurred while howard was driving his ranger,resulting in the accident and that there were safer alternative speed control assembly designs available to ford for use in the ranger.
testing was of critical importance in this case as sero conceded that the speed control cable in the neases ranger was not bound or wedged the cable moved freely when sero performed a inspection of the neases ranger.in fact,sero admitted he has never seen any vehicle with binding.sero,however,conducted no testing whatsoever to arrive at his opinion.specifically,he has never tested a ford ranger to determine whether it is actually possible for enough debris to accumulate in the casing cap during normal operation to resist the pounds of force exerted by the return springs to pull the throttle closed.sero conceded that he never ran any tests to confirm his theory 
now,as i understand it,you have not demonstrated your unidirectional binding theory on nease speed control cable,have you 
no,i have not.
q.you have not even attempted to simulate your speed control binding theory on nease speed control cable,have you 
q.you have not demonstrated your unidirectional binding theory using another ford ranger,have you 
q.you have not even attempted to simulate your speed control malfunction theory with an exemplar ford ranger,have you 
no,i have not.
sero failure to test his hypothesis renders his opinions on the cause of howard accident unreliable.although sero theory is plausible and may even be right,it is no more than a hypothesis,and it thus is not knowledge,nor is it based upon sufficient facts or data or the product of reliable principles and methods applied reliably to the facts of the case.tamraz lincoln,cir.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.generally,scientific methodolo
