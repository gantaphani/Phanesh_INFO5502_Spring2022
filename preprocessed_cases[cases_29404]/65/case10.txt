in this toxic tort case,we previously considered the admissibility of testimony from the plaintiffs general causation expert.at issue in the present appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of the plaintiffs specific causation expert.we conclude that the district court ruling was a supportable exercise of its discretion,and we therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment to the defendant following that evidentiary ruling.
background 
brian milward worked as a pipefitter and refrigerator technician for over thirty years.during the course of his employment,milward was exposed to varying levels of benzene from paints and other products manufactured by among others rust oleum corporation.in,he was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia apl.three years later,milward and his spouse sued a number of defendants on the theory that their negligence caused milward disease.the only remaining defendant is rust oleum.
to succeed against rust oleum,the milwards had the burden of establishing,through expert testimony,general and specific causation.in other words,they needed to show that exposure to benzene can cause apl general causation,and that exposure to benzene was,in fact,a substantial factor in the development of brian apl specific causation.the district court bifurcated the proceedings it planned first to address the admissibility of expert testimony on general causation,and then to consider the specific causation issue.
in a ruling,the district court excluded the milwards general causation expert.accordingly,it entered judgment in favor of the defendants without proceeding to the second phase of the case.the milwards appealed that decision and,for reasons specific to their general causation expert,we reversed.see milward acuity specialty prods,cir.we remanded the case to the district court to proceed to the specific causation question.
under the supervision of a different district court judge,the parties engaged in discovery on the subject of specific causation.relevant here,the milwards retained occupational medicine physician sheila butler to serve as their expert witness the admissibility of her opinion testimony is at the heart of this appeal,and thus additional background on her opinion is in order.
butler,an employee of the veterans administration,specializes in clinical assessments of environmental and occupational exposure in veterans.in her proposed testimony,butler presented three theories.
first,she testified that although benzene is naturally occurring,there is no safe level of benzene exposure.this was her predominant theory,and she consistently reiterated her hypothesis.she emphasized that she reached this conclusion by examining the biology,the pathophysiology,what the substance does to the person and the disease process.and,she noted,she was able to do so without relying on any of the relevant epidemiological studies.given this level theory,butler maintained that milward exposure as detailed by stewart was likely the cause of his apl.the district court rejected this hypothesis because it could not be properly tested with any known rate of error.the milwards do not meaningfully challenge the district court conclusion on appeal.accordingly,we assume that the ruling was correct and bypass further discussion of the issue.see mills bank,na,cir.
second,butler rather cursorily concluded that even beyond the level hypothesis,certain epidemiological studies have established that an individual relative risk of developing apl increases when exposed to specified amounts of benzene.she then compared milward exposure levels to those that had been found to be dangerous in that research.since milward exposure was higher than the amounts found to be hazardous,butler reasoned that benzene exposure was likely the cause of his apl.notably,she did not explain why she chose the studies on which she relied,nor did she address any study with contrary findings.in fact,during butler deposition,defendant counsel asked her a number of questions about her ability and willingness to engage with the relevant epidemiological research.for instance,counsel asked,are you aware of any studies which find that there is no relationship between benzene exposure and apl,to which she answered yes the literature has support for both.counsel then asked,do you intend in this case to weigh the different epidemiological studies and offer an opinion as to which ones we should rely on and which ones we should discount,to which she replied,no.
finally,butler engaged in a differential diagnosis to conclude that benzene exposure likely caused milward apl.through this method essentially a process of elimination butler ruled out some of the more common factors associated with apl,among them obesity and smoking.she then determined that since benzene exposure was a potential cause,she could also rule out an idiopathic diagnosis or,a diagnosis without a known cause.thus,since benzene exposure was the only significant potential cause remaining,she concluded that it was likely the culprit.
procedural history 
back in court,rust oleum moved both to exclude butler testimony and for summary judgment.the district court evaluated,and rejected,each of the theories that butler put forward to establish specific causation.for reasons discussed below,the judge ultimately ruled that butler testimony was inadmissible under federal rule of evidence.since the milwards could not establish specific causation without butler testimony,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rust oleum.this timely appeal followed.
we review the district court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion.see united states shay,cir noting that we will only reverse a decision if the district court based the decision on an incorrect legal standard or we have a definite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment.predicate factual findings are reviewed for clear error,while pure questions of law engender de novo review.milward,at.as for the district court ultimate decision to grant rust oleum summary judgment,because the milwards are proceeding under theories of liability,we apply massachusetts law,see philibotte nisource.servs,cir,and review the decision de novo,see samaan joseph,cir.
as in the district court,our admissibility inquiry is guided by federal rule of evidence,which provides that 
a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if 
a the expert scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue 
b the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data 
c the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and 
d the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
in applying rule,the district court serves as the gatekeeper for expert testimony by ensuring that it both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.daubert merrell dow,d.the party seeking to introduce the evidence has the burden of establishing both its reliability and its relevance.see id.at see also,advisory committee note.
as noted above,the district court rejected each theory that butler put forward to establish specific causation.we now focus on the two theories that the milwards press on appeal butler relative risk conclusion and her differential diagnosis 
relative risk 
the district court rejected butler relative risk testimony because she had expressly disavowed her intent,and minimized her ability,to analyze conflicting epidemiological studies.the district court reasoned that without such analysis,it was impossible to ensure that the studies she cited were actually based on a reliable methodology.the milwards challenge this decision in three ways.
first,they assert that in rejecting the testimony,the district court relied on an incorrect premise that conflicting epidemiological studies existed.they note that there were studies establishing an increased risk of apl after a certain level of exposure,such as.see,deborah glass et,the health watch case control study of leukemia and benzene,ann.acad.sci,richard hayes et,benzene and lymphohematopoietic malignancies in humans,am.indus.med.the milwards also acknowledge that other studies found no increased risk of leukemia with exposure at any level less than.see,robert rinsky et,benzene and leukemia an epidemiologic risk assessment,new england med.they argue,however,that since the rinsky study did not affirmatively find the absence of a relationship,the studies were not actually in conflict.
while it is certainly true that,at least in some cases,the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence,it is not similarly true that the studies must present diametrically opposing conclusions to be in tension with one another.here,a number of studies have been identified that show a correlation between apl and benzene exposure at a specific level,while other studies do not show that correlation.in order to establish specific causation by the relative risk method,butler was required to choose a study,or studies,to serve as a baseline to which she could then compare brian milward case.there can be no serious question that choosing a study that showed a correlation above a specific level,the in the glass study,rather than one that did not exhibit any such correlation,the in the rinsky study,yields a vastly different comparison.the district court did not clearly err in finding that the studies were sufficiently distinct from one another such that utilizing one,rather than another,would necessarily lead to different testimony.
the milwards next argue,albeit summarily,that butler did not actually disavow her willingness to consider the divergent studies.instead,they allege that the district court took her statements out of context.
we make quick work of this argument given the clarity of the record.butler anchored her testimony to her threshold hypothesis,a theory that did not turn on the validity of any of the epidemiological studies.indeed,given that she acknowledged that she based that theory on the biology,the pathophysiology,and what the substance does to the person and the disease process,it was consistent for her to then state that she had neither the need nor the intent to compare the competing epidemiological literature there was no error in the district court decision to give her statements their plain meaning.
finally,the milwards argue that even if the district court did not err in these respects,butler testimony was nevertheless still based on reliable evidence,and it was therefore admissible.in support of this contention,the milwards defend the studies that butler invoked in her testimony.they also cite schultz akzo novel paints,llc,cir,which they maintain is closely analogous to this case.
generally,where an expert medical opinion is grounded exclusively on scientific literature,a district court acts within its discretion to require the expert to explain why she relied on the studies that she did and,similarly,why she disregarded other,incompatible research.see,kuhn wyeth,cir permitting testimony where the expert witness relied on methodologically reliable studies and provided an explanation for why those studies were chosen norris baxter healthcare,cir noting in the context of a general causation finding that the expert witness inability to address contrary views made the opinion unreliable.it is that,when an expert engages in a relative risk analysis in the manner that butler did here,the district court is on firm ground in requiring such an explanation,since the validity of the approach depends on the reliability of the studies chosen.see mod.sci.evidence ed.discussing the use of the relative risk approach in establishing specific causation.that is,if the expert is comparing the plaintiff condition to a study,and the study is based on an unreliable methodology,then the comparison itself is futile.
schultz,the case on which the milwards rely,is consistent with this view.in that case,the seventh circuit reversed a district court decision to exclude specific causation expert testimony about an individual exposure level to benzene.at.the seventh circuit found that the testimony was reliable because the expert focused specifically on the amount of benzene to which the plaintiff had been exposed and related this amount to the scientific literature.id.at.importantly,the expert in schultz did not simply point to favorable studies showing an increased risk of leukemia at low levels of exposure.instead,the expert in that case explained why he believed that a conflicting study was unreliable and why,based on his knowledge of the literature,he chose to rely on the studies that he did.id.at.
here,the relevant studies were not only in tension with one another,but expressly cast each other into doubt.see,epa office of research and development,carcinogenic effects of benzene an update,at april.given that,the district court reasonably ruled that there needed to be some indication of why butler utilized the studies that she did.indeed,her complete unwillingness to engage with the conflicting studies irrespective of whether she was able to or not made it impossible for the district court to ensure that her opinion was actually based on scientifically reliable evidence and,correspondingly,that it comported with rule.not only does this render this case readily distinguishable from schultz,but it also justifies the district court decision 
differential diagnosis 
the district court also rejected butler differential diagnosis.although the judge did not question butler decision to rule out obesity and smoking as causes of brian milward apl,the court was concerned about the utility of the approach given the high percentage of apl cases that are idiopathic according to the record,roughly of all apl diagnoses.the judge also stated that butler reasoning was circular she ruled out an idiopathic apl by ruling in benzene as a cause,but she had failed to provide a scientifically reliable method of ruling in benzene in the first instance.the milwards contend that in making this decision,the district court ignored our case law that has blessed an expert use of a differential diagnosis to establish causation.
even if the milwards scanty argument in their opening brief were sufficiently developed as to avoid a waiver finding,see united states oladosu,cir b ecause the argument is underdeveloped,it is waived,we nonetheless see no abuse of discretion in the district court decision.the milwards are certainly correct that a differential diagnosis can be a reliable method of medical diagnosis.milward,at see also granfield csx,cir.but,they still must show that the steps taken as part of that analysis the ruling out and the ruling in of causes were accomplished utilizing scientifically valid methods.see ruggiero warner lambert,cir.
since butler was only able to rule out an idiopathic apl because she had ruled in benzene as a cause,the validity of her differential diagnosis turns on the reliability of that latter conclusion.see ruggiero,at noting that an expert must use reliable scientific methods to rule in causes see also best lowe home,cir glastetter novartis pharm,cir.indeed,the reliability of that decision is particularly critical here given the extensive number of apl cases that are idiopathic.under such circumstances,eliminating a number of potential causes without properly and explicitly ruling in a cause is simply of little assistance.restatement third of torts phys.emot.harm,cmt.c.
butler appears to have ruled in benzene exposure solely by relying on her two other theories.but,as explained above,the district court found both of these theories to be unreliable.as we agree with the district court conclusion regarding the relative risk methodology,and since the milwards have not challenged the district court threshold determination,they have failed to show how butler could have reliably utilized either method to rule in benzene exposure.nor,we note,have they pointed to other evidence in the record that butler could have conceivably used to rule in benzene.
given that the record does not contain a s
