this appeal and arise from a diversity action brought under colorado state law by the owners of colorado homes homeowners against defendants chiles power supply,heatway radiant floors and snowmelting heatway and goodyear tire and rubber company goodyear.after a jury trial and motions,many,but not all,of the homeowners were awarded damages against goodyear only.we affirm the district court amended judgment in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
in the,heatway began selling parts for hydronic radiant heating systems.these systems use hose to circulate warm fluid under indoor flooring as an alternative to conventional heating systems,or under driveways and sidewalks to melt snow and ice.heatway originally contracted with dayco rubber products company dayco to produce the hose,entran,used in heatway radiant systems.in,heatway contracted with goodyear to manufacture a new hose,entran ii.by,heatway discontinued dayco as a supplier and thereafter used goodyear as its sole supplier of hose.goodyear made entran ii until and supplied it exclusively to heatway.
as early as,some homeowners began noticing problems with their hydronic heating systems,including cracking,leaking and sediment in their entran ii hose.in many cases,these problems required the removal and replacement of the hose in its entirety,as well as the replacement of most other parts of the hydronic heating system.by,heatway began receiving complaints from homeowners about hardening of the entran ii hose and leaks in the installed heating systems.believing that the entran ii hose was causing the leaks,heatway stopped paying goodyear for hose shipments.as a result,goodyear sued heatway in in federal district court in ohio the ohio action.heatway filed a counterclaim alleging that the entran ii hose was defective.goodyear had by this time manufactured feet of entran ii hose.the ohio action went to trial on the issue of the merchantability of all feet of entran ii hose.the jury returned a verdict for goodyear,whereupon heatway declared bankruptcy.
between and a number of suits were filed in colorado state and federal courts by homeowners against goodyear,heatway,or both.eight of these cases were consolidated.homeowners sought recovery from goodyear for sale of a defective product,negligence,negligent failure to warn,violation of the colorado consumer protection act ccpa,and civil conspiracy.homeowners claimed that goodyear was liable for the costs of removing and replacing the entran ii hose installed in their homes,the diminution in value of their homes,and other costs and losses.four glas,robert julian,corey bender mindlin,and jane and charles upton the heatway plaintiffs also sought recovery against heatway for violation of the ccpa and civil conspiracy.goodyear and heatway asserted against one another for contribution or indemnification under ohio law.goodyear against heatway for deceit fraud,and heatway against goodyear for sale of a defective product.
after the close of evidence,goodyear moved,pursuant to.a,for judgment as a matter of law as to the claims of three homeowners who sold their homes prior to trial james and nikki holzwarth the holzwarths,janet sutterley and randy kilgore,and glas.the district court denied goodyear motion as to the claims of the holzwarths and.however,the district court granted the motion as to glas,reasoning that her damages were too speculative.glas filed a motion asking the court to alter or amend the judgment in her favor and for a new trial concerning damages.the district court denied the motion.
with the exception of one homeowner,william gorog,the jury returned verdicts in favor of all homeowners and against goodyear on three theories of recovery sale of a defective product,negligence,and negligent failure to warn.the jury awarded homeowners damages in the aggregate of.at.the jury found in favor of goodyear and heatway on all claims for violation of the ccpa and civil conspiracy.neither goodyear nor heatway prevailed on its against the other.the jury did,however,apportion fault evenly between goodyear and heatway as to all prevailing homeowners.
with respect to the jury apportionment of fault to heatway,homeowners filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to.b and e respectively.homeowners argued that because the jury did not find heatway liable on any of the heatway plaintiffs claims or on goodyear,damages were not appropriately apportioned to it as a nonparty at fault.at.the district court denied the motion.
as to the holzwarths,the jury awarded them in reasonable repair replacement costs.the jury awarded in other reasonable costs or losses.after the district court entered judgment on the jury verdicts,goodyear renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the claims of the holzwarths and,pursuant to.b.goodyear argued that the holzwarths and presented evidence and were awarded damages for future repair costs that they had not incurred and would never incur because they had already sold their homes.at.the district court construed the motion as a.e motion and granted it.as such,the district court amended the judgment and reduced the holzwarths jury award to and jury award to,thereby eliminating the portions of their awards which the district court interpreted as representing future repair costs.
with respect to gorog,the only homeowner against whom goodyear had asserted a statute of limitations defense,the jury found in favor of goodyear on all claims.but the jury did not answer the questions on the verdict form about goodyear statute of limitations defense.the district court entered judgment against gorog.after entry of judgment,gorog moved for judgment as a matter of law,to alter or amend the judgement or for a new trial.the district court denied the motion.
after trial,homeowners moved for prejudgment interest.the district court held that homeowners were entitled to prejudgment interest from the date on which the hydronic heating systems,containing entran ii,were originally installed in the homeowners respective homes.the district court awarded prejudgment interest in the aggregate of.
homeowners appeal from the district court order contending that the jury rendered inconsistent verdicts and the district court attempt to reconcile the verdicts conflicts with the jury instructions and colorado law,and the district court erred in reducing the jury award of damages to the holzwarths and,in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of goodyear on glas damage claims,and in granting judgment in favor of goodyear on gorog claims when the jury failed to answer the questions about goodyear limitations defense.goodyear arguing that the district court erred in determining that prejudgment interest should be calculated from the date of installation of the heating systems.goodyear also conditionally contending that the district court erred in instructing the jury on design defect.goodyear asks us to address its conditional in the event we reverse the fifty percent apportionment of fault to heatway or order a new trial on the claims of the holzwarths,glas or gorog.we deal with each issue in turn.
discussion 
apportionment of fault 
homeowners contend that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or to alter or amend the judgment.homeowners argument on appeal is twofold first,the jury rendered inconsistent verdicts and second,the district court attempt to reconcile the verdicts conflicts with the jury instructions and colorado law.
as a preliminary matter,goodyear asserts that homeowners motion never raised the argument that the jury verdicts were inconsistent.upon review of homeowners motion,goodyear response,and the district court order relating thereto,we are satisfied that the issue was adequately raised.see united int l holdings,wharf holdings,cir rule does require that the grounds for a motion be stated with sufficient certainty to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the movant position with respect to the motion.internal quotations and citations omitted.homeowners did not,however,make a rule a motion on the grounds that goodyear evidence was insufficient as to heatway fault at the close of all the evidence.accordingly,relief under rule b is unavailable.see.b trotter todd,cir.
whether homeowners rule e motion may be used to secure the relief sought is a closer question.a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment should be granted only to correct manifest errors of law or to present newly discovered evidence.phelps hamilton,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.although this circuit has not directly addressed whether a rule e motion,in its role of correcting manifest errors of law,may be used to contest verdict inconsistencies,other circuits have so allowed.see munafo metro.transit,cir top of iowa.schewe,cir turyna martam const,cir.on such authority,we are persuaded that homeowners rule e motion was appropriate to raise the issues presented here.
this court reviews the district court ruling on a rule e motion for abuse of discretion.minshall mcgraw hill broadcasting,cir.accordingly,we will not reverse the decision of the district court unless the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.id.citations omitted.the abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.jennings rivers,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.
in order to protect the jury function,courts must reconcile the jury findings,by exegesis if necessary,before they are free to disregard the jury special verdict and remand the case for a new trial.johnson ablt trucking,cir quoting gallick baltimore ohio,d.when reviewing claims that a jury verdict is inconsistent,the reviewing court must accept any reasonable view of the case that makes the jury answers consistent.heno mgmt,cir quoting patton tic united,cir.the consistency of a jury verdict must be considered in light of the instructions given to the jury,among other factors.see harvey by and through harvey general motors,cir.when the jury provides answers that are irreconcilably inconsistent,the court can not enter judgment without choosing between the conflicting findings of fact and thereby overturning one of them.johnson,at.to be irreconcilably inconsistent,the jury answers must be logically incompatible,thereby indicating that the jury was confused or abused its power.id.quoting stone chicago,cir.a jury verdict may not be overturned merely because the reviewing court finds the jury resolution of different questions in the case difficult,though not impossible,to square.id.
verdict inconsistencies 
with the exception of gorog,the jury returned the following verdict the apportionment verdict for each homeowner 
apportionment of fault 
taking as percent the combined fault that caused the damages or losses,what percentage of plaintiff damages was caused by the fault of each person or entity identified below.enter the figure of zero,for any person or entity who you have found to be not at fault.
the jury found in favor of heatway on all claims asserted against it as a party,including violation of the ccpa,civil conspiracy,and fraud the no liability verdict.homeowners maintain t hese findings necessarily meant that heatway was not at the apportionment verdict instruction to enter zero for any party found not to be at fault was applicable.aplt.op.br.at.homeowners therefore argue that the jury allocation of fifty percent fault in the apportionment verdict is irreconcilably inconsistent with the no liability verdict and the correct resolution is to disregard the apportionment verdict as surplusage and give effect only to the jury finding that heatway was not at fault.id.
the district court rejected the homeowners argument that the jury was somehow precluded from assessing fault to heatway.it concluded that goodyear was not required to against heatway and prevail on claims against it in order to have the jury instructed as to apportionment of fault.in any event,the district court observed that homeowners never objected to the verdict forms on this basis.the district court further reasoned 
plaintiffs did not pursue claims against heatway based on the sale of a defective product,negligence or negligent failure to very claims upon which the jury found goodyear liable.here,it is not only plausible,but likely that the jury concluded heatway and goodyear to both be for negligence,negligent failure to warn,and sale of a defective product,but not liable for violation of the ccpa or for civil conspiracy.the verdict is wholly consistent 
at.we agree.
homeowners attempt to manufacture a conflict where one does not exist.as noted,the instruction within the apportionment verdict actually stated that the jury was to enter zero for any person or entity found not at fault,not any party found not at fault.at emphasis supplied.the actual instruction properly preserves the distinction between heatway role as a party to certain claims and a nonparty to other claims.although heatway was found not liable for the claims asserted against it as a party ccpa,civil conspiracy and fraud,the jury was still required to address its fault as a nonparty to the claims successfully asserted against goodyear sale of a defective product,negligence,and negligent failure to warn.thus,the verdicts are not irreconcilably inconsistent.
district court verdict reconciliation 
homeowners argue that the district court conclusion that the jury likely concluded heatway to be at fault for the claims successfully asserted against goodyear rests on the erroneous assumption that the jury was instructed to assess heatway fault as a nonparty as to these claims.homeowners further maintain that to the extent the verdict was sustained on these grounds,heatway could not be considered a nonparty to these claims because goodyear failed,under colorado law,to plead and prove as such.
jury instructions 
homeowners maintain,on several grounds,that the jury was instructed to consider heatway fault only with respect to claims asserted against it as a defendant.first,homeowners point to the jury instruction repeated reference to heatway and goodyear in their capacity as defendants.aplt.op.br.at.yet,the repeated reference to heatway as a defendant does not compel the conclusion that the jury was foreclosed from considering heatway fault as a nonparty with respect to the claims asserted against goodyear.no instruction to that effect was given,nor did homeowners request one.
second,paragraph of instruction directed the jury to compare the fault,if any,of goodyear heatway with that of the nonparties.homeowners argue that i f this reference to heatway were not meant to refer to heatway in its capacity as a defendant,this sentence would be confusing at a minimum it would ask the jury to compare the fault of heatway as a defendant with the fault of heatway as a nonparty.aplt.op.br.at.however,with regards to status in this context,persons and entities are nonparties in their relation to claims,not the litigation.heatway was a nonparty with respect to the claims asserted against goodyear by homeowners.heatway was a party to the claims asserted against it by the heatway plaintiffs.thus,the jury was not asked to compare the fault of heatway as a defendant with the fault of heatway as a nonparty.
third,paragraph of instruction omits,from the list of theories that could constitute fault,any mention of fraud.homeowners assert that if goodyear had chosen to include theories beyond those urged by the heatway plaintiffs ccpa and civil conspiracy and including sale of a defective product,negligence and negligent failure to warn,goodyear surely would have demanded that fraud be added to the list.this argument is wholly speculative.goodyear may not have listed fraud as a theory of fault because it asserted a against heatway based on fraud,both heatway and goodyear were already parties to the fraud claim.regardless,the absence of fraud in the list does not control this issue.
last,homeowners argue that the district court assumption that the jury could have found heatway at fault for negligence,negligent failure to warn,and sale of a defective product was incorrect because its reliance on the term fault,as defined in instruction,was misplaced.homeowners maintain that the definition of the term fault was merely a convenient checklist for the jury of all the theories of liability asserted against one or both of the defendants,goodyear and heatway,and that it was not intended to supersede all of the other instructions and submit to the jury theories of fault against heatway that had not been raised.this argument is unavailing.the jury instructions defining the elements of the claims asserted against goodyear specifically required the jury to consider goodyear defense of the fault of others.at.thus,to the extent that the district court relied on the definition of the term fault,within instruction,its reliance was supported by the underlying elements of the claims instructions.accordingly,we find no inconsistency between the verdicts and the jury instructions.the construction by the homeowners borders on tortured.
colorado law 
homeowners also argue that to the extent the district court upheld the jury apportionment of fault to heatway as a nonparty to the claims successfully asserted against goodyear,it adopted an interpretation of the verdict that conflicts with colorado law.homeowners maintain that in order for the jury to apportion fault to heatway based on the claims asserted against goodyear,goodyear was required to plead and prove that heatway was at fault as a nonparty on these grounds yet it failed to do so.
in redden sci.funeral,and barton adams rental,the colorado supreme court set forth the relevant requirements of the colorado apportionment statute.first,a party must sufficiently designate the nonparty by making a brief statement of the basis for believing such nonparty to be at fault.redden,at quoting.b.to satisfy this requirement,the party must allege the basis for believing the nonparty is legally liable to the extent the acts or omissions would satisfy all the elements of a claim.id.at.courts should construe designation requirements strictly to avoid a defendant attributing liability to a from whom the plaintiff can not recover.id.at.second,the defendant seeking the allocation of fault must present sufficient evidence at trial to support a finding on each of the essential elements of the claimed basis for a finding of fault.see barton,at.
goodyear initial designation of heatway as a nonparty at fault stemmed from its to allegations it made in its answer to plaintiffs complaint goodyear answer and against heatway goodyear.at.goodyear answer contained no allegation of fault against heatway.see at.homeowners contend,therefore,that goodyear,which asserted that heatway had committed fraud,was the operative pleading.aplt.op.br.at see at.accordingly,homeowners maintain that goodyear designation of heatway as a nonparty at fault was limited to its allegation of fraud,and that the jury was thereby precluded from considering any other claims in determining heatway fault.aplt.op.br.at.
the amended final pretrial order,dated february,however,by its own terms supplanted all prior pleadings of the parties.at.the amended pretrial order states 
plaintiffs claims asserted against goodyear are barred or reduced to the degree or percentage of negligence or fault attributable to certain at fault pursuant to,
at emphasis supplied.
homeowners argue that the amended final pretrial order affords no basis for altering the plain meaning of goodyear specific designation of heatway as a nonparty at fault.aplt.reply br.at.we disagree.to the extent goodyear was the operative document,it was obviated by the amended final pretrial order which clearly contemplated the reduction of goodyear liability based on the negligence or fault of nonparties,including heatway.further,logic compels the conclusion that the amended final pretrial order contemplated more than the fraud allegation contained in goodyear because heatway was not a nonparty to that claim it was the defendant.moreover,to the extent goodyear designation of heatway in the amended final pretrial order was insufficient or lacked a basis for altering its designation in goodyear,the homeowners failed to make a timely objection on that basis.redden,at plaintiff objected to a nonparty designation before the case was submitted to the jury.
homeowners maintain that even if goodyear designation was proper,goodyear failed to provide sufficient evidence that heatway was negligent or at fault.the jury apportioned fifty percent fault to heatway as a nonparty to the claims successfully asserted against goodyear,but the verdict form did not allow the jury to indicate the claimed basis for its finding of fault defective product,negligence,or negligent failure to warn.that is,the apportionment of fault verdict was general.as such,the jury apportionment of fault to heatway could have been based on defective product,negligence,or negligent failure to warn.
homeowners did not object to the instructions defining the elements of each claim,and our review of colorado law reveals that they were proper.the jury instructions on defective product and negligence both required the jury to find goodyear manufactured entran ii.at.the jury instruction on negligent failure to warn was not so restricted 
if a manufacturer or seller of a product knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the use of a product may be harmful or injurious to a consumer or user property,and such risk of harm or injury is not obvious to a reasonable consumer or user,then the manufacturer or seller must use reasonable care to warn the consumer or user of the risk of harm or injury if a reasonablely careful person would under the same or similar circumstances.the failure to do so is negligence.
upon review of record,we have little trouble concluding that sufficient evidence was adduced at trial to support such a finding.the homeowners failure to use a corrosion preventative may have contributed to the harmful effect that entran ii had on the homeowners hydronic heating systems,and ultimately their homes.further evidence suggested that such risk of harm or injury was not obvious to homeowners.evidence was also presented that heatway failed to use reasonable care to warn the homeowners of these risks by,for example,providing them with instructions for the use of entran ii,including the need for corrosion prevention.
homeowners argue that heatway was not aware of any problems with the design of entran ii and thus could not have been negligent for failing to warn the homeowners of the risks associated therewith.however,this argument unduly narrows what the jury was required to find in order to conclude that heatway was at fault for negligent failure to warn.the jury was required to determine whether heatway,knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,that the use of entran ii may be harmful or injurious to the homeowners property.see at.a reasonable jury could well have found that heatway,in the exercise of reasonable care,should have known of the risks associated with using entran ii and that it acted negligently in failing to warn the homeowners thereof.moreover,it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that this negligence contributed to the homeowners damages.therefore,we will not disturb the jury determination that heatway was equally at fault for the damages suffered by the homeowners.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying heatway motion on this basis.
ii.and the holzwarths 
although the district court construed goodyear rule b motion as a rule e motion,it effectively granted goodyear judgment as a matter of law on two grounds.first,because the jury awards mirrored the amounts homeowners expert testified were appropriate for future repair costs,these damages were impermissible.the holzwarths and would never incur those costs as they had already sold their homes,and thus the awards exceeded the amount which could have been granted based upon the evidence.second,to the extent future repair costs served as a proxy for the losses these homeowners incurred on selling their homes,the jury was given the opportunity to award them diminution in value damages,but declined to do so.the holzwarths and ask us to reverse the district court grant of goodyear motion and to reinstate the full amount of their jury verdicts.they assert that they provided sufficient evidence to support the jury awards because future repair costs represented a proxy for the amount they lost on the sale of their homes.further,they maintain that because the evidence supports the damages awarded,the district court should have given effect to the jury intention to award these diminution in value damages.we agree.
we review the grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,reviewing all of the evidence in the record.see reeves sanderson plumbing products,d.all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the nonmoving party and this court does not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.id.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party position.finley united states,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.we will reverse the district court if,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we find evidence upon which the jury could have properly returned a verdict in its favor.see harolds stores,dillard dep t stores,cir.in diversity cases,the substantive law of the forum state governs the analysis of the underlying claims,including specification of the applicable standards of proof.oja howmedica,cir.
under colorado law,diminution in value is ordinarily the rule applied to measure damages to real property.see board of county com rs of weld county slovek.the goal in compensating the property owner is to reimburse that owner for the actual loss suffered.id.damages are not recoverable,however,for losses beyond an amount that a plaintiff can establish with reasonable certainty by a preponderance of the evidence.pomeranz mcdonald.the rule of certainty requires a reasonable degree of persuasiveness in the proof of the fact of damages or injury.western cities broadcasting,schueller,interpreting pomeranz,quotations in original.once the fact of damage has been established with the requisite degree of certainty,a plaintiff will not be barred from recovery for failing to prove the amount of loss with mathematical certainty.id.the amount of damages to be awarded is a matter within the sole province of the jury,and such award may not be disturbed unless it is completely without support in the record.margenau bowlin,see bennett longacre,cir t he amount of damages awarded by a jury can be supported by any competent evidence tending to sustain it.
sufficiency of the evidence 
our review of the record reveals the following.at trial,holzwarth testified that he and his wife incurred in repair costs due to the problems they experienced with their hydronic heating system.he also testified that they considered repairing or replacing the entran ii,estimating the cost to be as much as.tr.vol.xviii at.the holzwarths expert,wilson,supported that estimate.id.vol.xxx at.due to the high cost,the holzwarths sold their home without replacing the hydronic heating system.holzwarth testified that in his opinion,they received to less for their home then they would have had it contained a fully functional hydronic heating system.id.at.based on this testimony,the jury could have returned a verdict in the holzwarths favor for in diminution in value damages.holzwarth,as the owner of the home since it was built,was qualified to testify regarding its value.see united states acres of land,cir.
to the extent the district court concluded that of the jury award to the holzwarths was attributable to the testimony of wilson regarding future repair costs,a different conclusion is not required.the holzwarth decision to forego complete repair or replacement of the hydronic heating system was a function of the high cost of doing so.the jury was free to make the reasonable inference that the purchase price of the holzwarth home was diminished by that amount.this evidence was sufficient to support the jury award of in favor of the holzwarths.
like the holzwarths,sold their home before trial.at trial,sutterley testified that when she first listed her to her discovery of any alleged defects in the entran ii listed it for.tr.vol.xxvi at.she later learned about the problems associated with entran ii from a realtor and various plumbers.id.at.after evaluating the difficulties with repairing or replacing the entran ii,disclosed the problem and dropped the listing price to.id.at.sutterley eventually sold the home for.id.at.in her opinion,she solidly lost on the sale of her home because of the presence of entran ii.id.at.sutterley,as the designer and owner of the home since it was built,was qualified to testify regarding its value.see acres of land,at.in addition,wilson testified that the cost to repair the hydronic heating system in the home would be approximately.tr.vol.xxx at.
the jury awarded.the testimony of sutterley and wilson provide sufficient evidence to sustain this award.sutterley testified that she lowered the asking price of her home because of the difficulties associated with repairing or replacing the entran ii hose.wilson testified that the cost to repair or replace the entran ii hose in the home would be approximately.as with the holzwarths,the jury was free to make the reasonable inference that the purchase price of the home was diminished by the amount wilson testified to.although the figure exceeded sutterley assessment that she solidly lost on the sale of her home,because sufficiently established the fact of damages,it was within the province of the jury to determine the amount of those damages to be awarded 
goodyear argues that any claim of that future repair costs were a proxy for,diminution in value damages was contradicted by counsel closing.counsel suggested for the decrease in market value of the home.the jury was properly instructed,however,that statements and arguments are not evidence in this case.at.counsel closing arguments did not alter the evidence before the jury.
goodyear also urges us to reject the characterization of the damages theory by these homeowners.goodyear maintains that the holzwarths and made a pretrial election to seek repair or replacement costs and uncertainty damages that foreclosed them from seeking damages for the diminished prices at which they sold there homes.goodyear ans.br.at.given the record,though,we can not accept this contention.without objection by goodyear,these homeowners presented evidence at trial that they sold their homes at a diminished price because of entran ii.in fact,counsel for goodyear diligently both holzwarth and sutterley on this issue.tr.vol.xviii at vol.xxvi at.any argument that the holzwarths and were prohibited from seeking damages under a diminution in value theory was waived by goodyear when it implicitly consented to trial of the issue.b pleadings deemed amended when issues tried by consent green country food market,bottling group,llc,cir a party impliedly consents to the trial of an issue not contained within the pleadings either by introducing evidence on the new issue or by failing to object when the opposing party introduces such evidence.
goodyear also argues that the holzwarths and should be precluded from seeking diminution in value damages under the election of remedies doctrine,citing lakeside ventures,lakeside dev.however,the doctrine of election of remedies is inapposite.the doctrine of election of election of remedies prevents double recovery by requiring a party to make an election when the remedies sought are inconsistent and contradictory.it has no application where a party seeks only one remedy.id.here,the holzwarths and did not seek inconsistent remedies.they did not seek both diminution in value damages and costs to repair or replace.rather,they argue that future repair costs serve as a proxy by which to measure the losses they sustained on the sale of their homes.
last,goodyear emphasizes that the holzwarths and provided no basis for their opinions on the value of their property.but both holzwarth and sutterley are deemed to have special knowledge of their property given their long ownership and familiarity with it.see acres of land,at.moreover,neither holzwarth nor sutterley negated their special knowledge by their own testimony.id.owner of property in condemnation suit negated the presumption of special knowledge by testifying that he relied on impermissible grounds when opining on the value of his property.accordingly,they were permitted to offer such testimony without further qualification.id.furthermore,in testifying as to the value of their property they were entitled to the privileges of a testifying expert.id.
damages verdict 
the jury placed the total it awarded the holzwarths in the category of the verdict form labeled reasonable repair replacement costs.at.the jury awarded in the category of the verdict form labeled other reasonable costs or losses.at.the district court concluded that although the jury was provided the opportunity to award loss in market value damages,it declined to do so.at.it reasoned that the jury categorization of the damages was inconsistent with the theory of damages advanced by the holzwarths and.
when reviewing jury verdicts,we are guided by our duty to attempt to reconcile the jury answers to special verdict questions.see,heno,at gallick,at.we must attempt to reconcile the jury findings,by exegesis if necessary,before we are free to disregard the jury special verdict and remand the case for a new trial.if there is any reasonable view of the case which makes the answers consistent,the case must be resolved in that way.see heno,at palmer city of monticello,cir.the consistency of a jury verdict must be considered in light of the instructions given to the jury,among other factors.see harvey,at.
the jury was instructed that t he homeowners have the burden of proving the nature and extent of their compensatory damages by a preponderance of the evidence.at emphasis supplied.the jury was further instructed that i n determining these damages,you shall consider the following reasonable repair replacement costs,if any other reasonable costs or losses,if any and the decrease in market value,if any,to the homeowner homes,as repaired.id.emphasis supplied.we note that category does not state reasonable repair replacement costs incurred and a reasonable jury certainly could conclude in light of the evidence that the categories were not mutually exclusive.
the holzwarths put forth evidence to substantiate the nature of their damages.while living at the home,the holzwarths incurred in repair costs due to entran ii,an amount which is uncontested by goodyear.as discussed,the holzwarths also provided evidence to support their claim for diminution in value damages.a fair reading of the jury verdict suggests the jury accepted the holzwarths diminution in value theory of damages and,as required by the jury instructions,considered the amount wilson testified to would cost to repair or replace the holzwarths hydronic heating system.as such,the jury placed the corresponding amount in the category for reasonable repair replacement costs.the jury was not limited to reasonable repair replacement costs incurred,and could well have decided that the diminution in value of was an excellent proxy for the repair replacement costs that would have been required to remedy this problem.although other interpretations may be reasonable,this view harmonizes the jury verdict and we are bound by it.accordingly,the jury award of to the holzwarths must be reinstated.
also put forth evidence to substantiate the nature of their damages,their claim for diminution in value damages.unlike the verdict form given to the jury for the holzwarths claims,the verdict form for did not have a category for reasonable repair replacement costs.instead,in considering the damages to award,the jury had the option to award either other reasonable costs or losses,or the decrease in market value,if any,as repaired.at emphasis supplied.the jury awarded as other other reasonable costs or losses.id.a fair reading of the jury verdict indicates that this was the proper category for the jury to place the award because did not have their home repaired.again,this view harmonizes the jury verdict and we are bound by it.as such,the jury award of to must be reinstated.
iii.dismissal of glas claims 
glas argues that she presented sufficient evidence that the presence of entran ii in her home decreased its sale price.aplt.op.br.at.she seeks remand of her claims and requests that goodyear be precluded from relitigating the issue of liability on her claims for defective product,negligence,and negligent failure to warn under the doctrine of.accordingly,glas requests that we enter judgment for her on the issue of liability and order a new trial limited to damages.
applying de novo review to the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law and applying colorado law concerning damages,our review of the record reveals the following.glas had a long history with entran ii before the sale of her home.she listed the home for sale on several occasions.tr.vol.xxii at.the fact that entran ii was installed in the home was disclosed in each listing.id.at.glas testified that one realtor refused to continue listing her home unless she fixed the problem with her heating system.id.upon glas request,a construction company provided her an estimate of to remove the entran ii hose.id.at.she declined to have the work performed.
in,after this litigation commenced,glas contracted with a new real estate broker,richard kesler.id.at.the broker testified that he advised glas that entran ii would decrease the market value of her home.id.at.based on her own experience and her broker advice,glas listed her home for million.in addition to the price,the listing stated s eller shall be entitled to any proceeds from this litigation as partial compensation for any reduction in the purchase price for the subject property.id.at.the home ultimately sold for,million below the listing price.id.at.glas testified that she believed the presence of entran ii was the cause of the reduced price she was offered and ultimately accepted for her home.id.at.in addition,wilson testified that if glas owned the home at the time of trial,she would have to pay approximately to have the entran ii replaced and would incur uncertainty damages of approximately.
the district court initially set forth its reasons for granting goodyear motion for judgment as a matter of law in its ruling of july.the district court reasoned 
t here is no dispute that glas has no past repair costs.in light of her testimony,as well as wilson,and the purchaser,it is apparent to me that even in the light most favorable to this plaintiff,any damages with regard to future repair costs,estimated at,and uncertainty in the amount of,is wholly speculative.it has no reasonable foundational basis to submit this claim by this plaintiff to the jury.each of the claims pled by the plaintiff and tried in this case have as an element that damage was caused by the conduct inherent in each claim i have an unwavering conviction that her damage claim is wholly speculative.

in a later written order,the district court reinforced its conclusion by again referring to deposition testimony admitted at trial concerning the intent of the home purchaser.the purchaser testified that his primary purpose in buying glas property was to use the land as a ranch and that the presence of entran ii was never a negative to the property and never used as a negotiating point on my behalf to the property.at.the district court also noted kesler testimony that the existence of entran ii was never a specific item of negotiation with the purchaser the home price negotiations were more generalized.id.at.the district court concluded that in whole,no evidence supports glas claim for damages caused by a decrease in market value due to entran ii in her home.id.
the evidence provided by glas does not materially differ from that of the holzwarths and.the only noticeable difference in the district court disposition of goodyear motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to glas claims appears to be the district court reliance on the purchaser intent when buying glas home.the district court heavy reliance on the purchaser intent was error.the testimony of the purchaser was,at most,some evidence for the jury to weigh against glas evidence.however,the proper inquiry for the purposes of granting judgment as a matter of law was whether glas provided sufficient evidence upon which a jury could determine that the value of her home was decreased due to the presence of entran ii.construing the evidence and inferences most favorably to glas,we are persuaded that she did 
goodyear again argues that glas pretrial election to seek repair costs and uncertainty damages foreclosed her from seeking damages she incurred when she sold her home at a diminished value.goodyear ans.br.at.we reject this contention for same reasons already discussed with regards to the holzwarths and.
finally,we turn to the relief sought by glas.she maintains that the jury findings of liability against goodyear on the claims of other homeowners is law of the case controlling her claims and that a new trial would be unnecessary on the issue of liability.aplt.op.br.at.glas acknowledges,as she must,that the law of the case doctrine does not generally apply to jury verdicts.she notes that the district court entered judgment on the verdicts,both in the case in which glas was a plaintiff and the cases consolidated with her own,based on the same claims and evidence.therefore,she argues that the relief she seeks rests on a purely legal judgment and that a jury finding of no liability as to her claims could not be sustained.aplt.reply br.at.
while her argument is imaginative,the doctrine of law of the case does not apply here.t he law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.united states monsisvais,cir quoting arizona california,d.glas provides no authority for the proposition that once the district court enters judgment on a verdict,it somehow becomes a conclusion of law and thus is appropriate for application within the law of the case context.we decline glas invitation to create such authority.we therefore remand glas claims for a new trial.
iv.gorog verdict 
gorog claims that the district court erred in denying his rule motion because the jury verdicts can not logically be reconciled.he asks this court to enter judgment against goodyear on the issue of liability and for a new trial limited to goodyear statute of limitations defense and damages.
we review a trial court ruling on a motion for new trial or to alter or amend judgment under an abuse of discretion standard.see anaeme diagnostek,cir minshall,at.accordingly,this court will not reverse a decision of the district court unless the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.minshall,at citations omitted.as previously discussed,we are required to reconcile verdicts where reasonably possible.the district court denied gorog motions on two grounds the jury instructions and verdict form could be interpreted to mean that the jury found in favor of goodyear on its statute of limitations defense,and the jury could have concluded that gorog,unlike the other homeowners,failed to prove causation or damages.
the jury instructions defined the elements of each claim and stated that if the homeowner proved the relevant elements then its verdict must be for the homeowner on that claim.at.these instructions continued 
as to plaintiff gorog only,you must also consider goodyear affirmative defense of the expiration of the statute of limitation.if you find that this affirmative defense has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence,then your verdict must be for goodyear and against plaintiff gorog.
id.at,emphasis supplied as to each of the claims,the verdict form asked whether gorog had proven his claim against goodyear.the verdict form instructed the jury that if it answered no to these questions,then it was not to answer the statute of limitations questions.
the jury returned a verdict against gorog on all claims.it did not answer the statute of limitations questions.the district court,noting its duty to attempt to reconcile jury answers to special verdict questions in order to avoid the need for retrial,citing palmer,at,determined 
it is reasonable to conclude that the jury read the instruction s to require it to answer no as to gorog claims because it found in favor of goodyear on the basis of its lieu of answering yes to gorog claims and answering yes as to goodyear defense to defeat those claims.
understandably,the district court first sought to reconcile the verdict with the statute of limitations evidence.but in reconciling the verdicts,the district court disregarded the jury express theory of denial and embraced one not addressed by the jury.the jury simply did not answer the statute of limitations question on the verdict form.by concluding that the jury found in favor of goodyear on this defense,the district court stepped beyond reconciling the verdict with a reasonable view of the case,palmer,at,into the impermissible realm of speculation as to what the jury actually determined in violation of gorog seventh amendment right to a jury trial.see carr stores,cir.
relying on domann vigil,cir,goodyear argues that a failure by a jury to answer some of the questions in a special verdict does not vitiate an otherwise unanimous verdict where the unanimous answers to the verdict conclusively dispose of the case.goodyear ans.br.at.the principle espoused in domann does not,however,apply when questions on the verdict form that are vital to the disposition of the case remain unanswered.the district court based its first ground for reconciling the verdict on its conclusion that the jury must have found for goodyear on its statute of limitations defense.thus,the jury answer to the statute of limitations question was necessarily vital to the district disposition of the case.the principle in domann is inapposite.
we briefly consider the district court alternative holding.the conclusion that the jury simply could have concluded that gorog,unlike the other homeowners,failed to prove causation or damages does not inspire confidence when viewed in the context of the record.goodyear argues that gorog damages may have been caused by the dayco hose installed in his home,rather than entran ii hose.goodyear ans.br.at.however,goodyear offered materially the same evidence regarding dayco hose in response to the claims of both gorog and the holzwarths.yet,the jury found for the holzwarths on their claims of defective product,negligence,and negligent failure to warn.we therefore find it unreasonable to conclude that the jury accepted goodyear defense regarding dayco hose as to gorog only.
accordingly,we turn to the relief sought by gorog.he,like glas,maintains that the jury findings of liability against goodyear on the claims of other homeowners is law of the case controlling his claims and that a new trial would be unnecessary on the issue of liability.we reject this contention for the same reasons already discussed with regards to glas.we therefore remand gorog claims for a new trial.
goodyear for recalculation of prejudgment interest 
goodyear questions the district court calculation of prejudgment interest.the district court granted homeowners motion for prejudgment interest under.b.the district court determined that prejudgment interest on the jury awards should accrue from the dates on which the homeowners heating systems were originally installed.goodyear maintains that the district court should have set the accrual date on one of two alternate dates when the homeowners paid for their repair or replacement costs or when the homeowners claims accrued for purposes of the statute of limitation.
the standard by which we review the district court grant of prejudgment interest is well established.a federal court sitting in diversity applies state law,not federal law,regarding the issue of prejudgment interest.atlantic richfield farm credit bank of wichita,cir quoting chesapeake operating,valence
