collins,john kristensen and matthew for real parties in interest.
defendants and petitioners toyota motor corporation,toyota motor north america,and toyota motor sales,collectively,toyota seek a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting a motion to compel toyota to produce five of its employees,who are japanese residents,for deposition in california and to enter a new and different order denying that motion.
code of civil procedure section provides that a nonresident of california is not obliged to attend as a witness in this state.after a careful review of the relevant statutes and related legislative history,we conclude that this residency limitation applies not only to trials,but also to discovery.as a result,the trial court has no authority to compel japanese residents to come to los angeles to attend depositions.neither the legislative history nor the meager case authority on this issue persuasively provide otherwise.we will therefore grant toyota petition for a writ of mandate and remand with directions.
factual and procedural background 
in february,plaintiffs and real parties in interest michael stewart and shawna stewart,individually and as personal representatives and to the estate of michael levi stewart,and logan ivie,tucker hathaway and luckus sisiam collectively,plaintiffs filed this products liability action against toyota.the action arose out of the single vehicle crash of plaintiffs toyota pickup truck in idaho.in summary,plaintiffs alleged that the steering rod in their vehicle contained a defect that caused it to crack and break the failed steering rod prevented steering,resulting in the crash decedent michael levi stewart,as well as plaintiffs ivie,hathaway and sisiam,all were injured in the crash decedent subsequently died of his injuries and after learning of the alleged defect,toyota waited too long to recall affected vehicles,and instituted a recall in japan before it did so in the united states.
in march,plaintiffs noticed the depositions of five individual toyota employees as individual witnesses,not corporate representatives.all five individuals are japanese residents.they are hiroyuki yokoyama,a japanese executive and former head of toyota customer quality engineering division in japan mitsatiru kato,who works at toyota in japan tag taguchi,who had been assigned to toyota north american operation but had returned to japan shinji miyamoto,current head of the customer quality engineering division in japan and morikazu tsuji,who heads a subgroup there.
after plaintiffs sought deposition dates for these witnesses,toyota declined to produce them for deposition in california and responded that the individual employees must be deposed in japan.in april,plaintiffs moved to compel toyota to produce the five japanese residents for depositions in gardena,california.plaintiffs conceded that section precluded the court from ordering japanese witnesses to travel to california for trial,but asserted the court had authority under section to compel said witnesses to travel to california for deposition.
in opposition to the motion to compel,toyota argued section precludes the court from compelling a foreign national to submit to deposition in california.instead,a party seeking to depose a resident of a foreign country may depose the witness in his or her homeland pursuant to section.in the alternative,toyota argued that even assuming section authorized the court to compel a foreign resident to attend a deposition in california,the balancing test of section,subdivision b weighed against compelling the depositions to be taken in california.
on june,the trial court granted plaintiffs motion to compel the five named foreign resident executives of toyota to attend deposition in california,subject to the following terms and conditions a plaintiff shall pay reasonable airfare economy class,and reasonably priced lodging for the deponents in california and b the deposition of each deponent shall be one day in duration,from to with a minute break each hour and a one hour lunch break,at toyota counsel gardena,california offices.the trial court noted the dearth of case law directly on point and stayed the matter to enable toyota to seek writ review.
on june,toyota filed the instant petition for writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing.
issue on appeal 
the essential issue presented in this case is does section prohibit the trial court from compelling a witness residing outside of california to travel to california for deposition or,as plaintiffs argue,does section vest the trial court with the discretionary authority after applying the balancing factors set out in section,subdivision b,to compel a nonresident witness to travel to california for deposition 
discussion 
standard of review 
the issues raised in this case must be resolved by the interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the code of civil procedure.these are issues of law which we review de novo.suman bmw of north america,th.it is worth emphasizing that the trial court expressed considerable uncertainty about its decision in this matter and encouraged appellate court review by granting a limited stay of its order for that purpose.
we will first discuss the plain language of the statutes,which leads us to the conclusion that section prohibits the trial court from compelling a foreign resident to attend a deposition in california.second,we will consider the legislative history of the relevant statutes,which confirms our conclusion.finally,we will consider a case which reached a contrary conclusion glass superior court d glass and reject its analysis.
section applies to deposition witnesses 
section provides that a witness is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court,judge,justice or any other officer,unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service.section defines witness to mean a person whose declaration under oath is received as evidence for any purpose,whether such declaration be made on oral examination,or by deposition or affidavit.italics added.moreover,a deposition can only take place before an officer.thus,section applies not only to those witnesses obliged to attend as witnesses in court proceedings,but those witnesses obliged to give testimony by deposition before deposition officers.
additionally,we note that the civil discovery act provides a means for taking depositions of residents in the state or country of their residence.section,provides for depositions in other states,and section,provides for depositions in foreign nations.
while section provides for a court to permit a deposition of a party or officer,director,managing agent,or employee of a party at a place that is more distant than that permitted under section miles from the deponent residence or within the county where the action is pending and within miles of the deponent residence,section does not provide for those depositions to be held at a place more distant than that permitted by section.there is simply no conflict between the plain language of sections and.section permits depositions more than or miles from a deponent residence,but section restricts a deponent from being required to attend a california deposition if the deponent is not a california resident.
the trial court order violates the terms of section by compelling the japanese resident deponents attend as witnesses before an officer even though they were not resident within the state at the time of service.it follows that the order compelling their attendance at deposition was error and must be reversed.see amoco chemical certain underwriters at lloyd of london th.
legislative history supports this conclusion 
while we see no conflict in the plain language of sections and,a review of the legislative history of both sections,taken together,confirms our interpretation.
originally,section applied to depositions 
the legislative history of both sections together begins with the legislative history of section standing alone.the statute was originally enacted in,and provided,a witness is not obliged to attend as a witness before any c ourt,j udge,j ustice,or any other officer,out of the county in which he resides,unless the distance be less than miles from his place of residence to the place of trial.it was subsequently amended four times to successively increase the mileage limitation to miles stats,ch,miles stats,ch,miles stats,ch,and miles stats,ch.
even though section used language defining the mileage limitation as the distance between the witness residence and the place of trial,section applied to depositions as well as trials.see pollak superior court cal,requiring witnesses to attend depositions within miles of their residences,noting that there is no language circumscribing the territorial limits within which depositions shall be taken,except those set forth in section.indeed,at the time section was initially adopted,section,which defines witness to include a witness whose declaration is made by deposition,was simultaneously enacted.
as section was not amended,other than to increase the permitted mileage,from its enactment until,we turn to the statutes governing depositions.we join this area of statutory development in,when the taking of depositions was governed by former section.as originally enacted see stats,ch,section did not contain any mileage limit.section,subdivision a merely provided that notice of taking depositions must be at least days adding also one day for every miles of the distance of the place of examination from the residence of the person to whom the notice is given.see twin lock,superior court cal d,twin lock.after the enactment of section,section continued to apply to depositions.twin lock,supra,cal d at version of section is not sufficient to justify a conclusion that the legislature thereby contemplated that witnesses could be compelled to attend the taking of depositions at distances greater than the maximum set forth by section see also kaiser hawaiian village radio,superior court cal d prisch superior court cal d.
b.the deposition statute was amended to provide an 
exception from section 
in,section was amended to include a distance limitation.a new subdivision a was added to section,which limited the place of depositions to no more than miles from the residence of a witness unless the party taking the deposition obtained an order under a balancing provision.stats,ch.the balancing provision was new subdivision b.
as enacted in,section,subdivision b provided,notwithstanding section,the court may,upon motion on days written notice and for good cause shown,make an order requiring a deponent who is a party to the record of any civil action or proceeding or is a person for whose immediate benefit said action is prosecuted or defended or is at the time of the taking of the deposition an officer,director or managing agent of any such party or person to attend a deposition at a place more than miles from the residence of such deponent.in granting or refusing such order,the court shall consider whether the moving party selected the forum,whether the deponent will be present at the trial,the convenience of the deponent,the suitability of discovery through a deposition by written interrogatories or other discovery methods,the number of depositions sought under this section,the expense to the parties of requiring the deposition to be taken within miles of the residence of the deponent,the whereabouts of the deponent at the time the deposition is scheduled to be taken,and all other factors tending to show whether or not the interests of justice and the convenience of the parties and witnesses will be served by requiring the deponent to appear for his deposition at a place more than miles from his residence.such order may provide that the party desiring to take such deposition shall pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the deponent in attending such deposition and that he furnish an undertaking approved by the court to secure such payment and may contain such other terms and conditions as are equitable and just.stats,ch.
significant for our purposes is that this balancing provision began with the language,n otwithstanding section.the language was both an acknowledgement that,until that point,section mileage limitation governed the taking of depositions twin lock,supra,cal d at and an amendment of the law to allow a court to exercise its discretion to order a deposition outside the mileage limitations of section,when the balancing factors justified it twin lock,supra,cal d at.
the california supreme court had the opportunity to address the effect of this amendment in,in twin lock.in that case,the defendant sought to obtain the los angeles depositions of certain officers and directors of the plaintiff twin lock corporation,which individuals were residents of new york.although the amendment to section has been enacted by the legislature by the time of the supreme court opinion,the defendant had noticed the depositions under the prior version of the law,which contained neither a balancing provision nor the n otwithstanding section language.twin lock unsuccessfully moved to vacate the notice,or to move the depositions to new york,on the basis of section.the trial court indicated that sanctions would be imposed if twin lock did not comply with the deposition notices in california,and twin lock sought a writ of prohibition.
the supreme court agreed with plaintiff twin lock that its officers and directors residing in new york could not be compelled to appear for deposition in california.the high court explained,since section is by its terms applicable to the new york residents involved here,defendants position may be sustained only upon the theory that the enactment in of sections and sanctions amounted to a partial implied repeal of section,which,as we have seen,has been a part of our statutes since.we find nothing in the discovery and deposition provisions adopted in which discloses that the legislature intended such a substantial departure from the practice of limiting the territorial scope of the powers of a court to compel the attendance of witnesses.twin lock,supra,cal d at,italics added.
the twin lock court observed that although the enactment of section did not alter the territorial limitations of section,the amendment to section did authorize the trial court to compel the depositions in california of new york residents.it was the amendment to section,subdivision b that added the override proviso,notwithstanding section.therefore,on remand,the defendants were not precluded from seeking an order,if they so desire,for the taking of the depositions of these witnesses pursuant to subdivision b of section as amended in.twin lock,supra,cal d at.
further notwithstanding section language was 
added to the deposition statute 
in,section was amended to fully exempt depositions from the limitations of section.stats,ch.section,subdivision a was modified to read notwithstanding section and the distance provisions specified in paragraph of this subdivision,the deposition,whether of a party or any other person,shall be taken only in the county of residence of the deponent or at a place not more than miles from the residence of the deponent or,if the deponent is a party,in the county of place of trial when the place of deposition is less than miles from the residence of the deponent,unless the court,pursuant to paragraph or of subdivision b of this section,otherwise orders.italics added.under the express language of the amendment,section no longer had application with respect to the location of a deposition in california.both the mileage limit,subd.a and the balancing provision,subd.b specified that they applied n otwithstanding section.
subsequent amendments of section followed,but none of them would impact the n otwithstanding section language until.the next legislative development of significance,however,was an amendment to section.
section changed from a mileage limitation 
to a residency limitation 
in,section was amended.as it existed prior to that amendment,section provided that a person was not obliged to attend as a witness out of the county in which he resides,unless the distance be less than miles from his place of residence to the place of trial.in,section was amended to read as it now does,that a witness is not obliged to attend as a witness unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service.stats,ch.thus,section was changed from a limitation on witness compulsion to one that was.in addition,the reference to place of trial was deleted.in other words,section simply provides that a witness can not be compelled to testify before any court or officer unless the witness is a resident of california.
as originally introduced,the bill which amended section was intended to repeal it.assem.bill reg.sess,as introduced.the bill was proposed by the california state bar,which believed that,given the development of travel capabilities over the years,even the mile limitation was artificial and unrealistic.assem.com.on judiciary,bill digest of assem.bill reg.sess.may.
the bill author received objections with respect to the impact of such repeal and the bill was modified to make the changes to section to make it read as it does today.as already noted,this amendment changed the nature of section from a limitation to one based on state residency section,relating to depositions,was untouched,and still provided limitations a balancing test to permit those limitations to be overridden and notwithstanding section language.thus,section then provided a means by which a deposition could be taken in california of a resident.
e.the discovery act of eliminated the 
notwithstanding section language 
in,the civil discovery act was enacted as a comprehensive revision of california discovery laws.language governing the location of a deposition,which had previously been in section,was moved to section,subdivision e.we compare the language ultimately enacted as section,subdivision e with the immediately preceding statutory language governing depositions in former section.section,subdivision e provided as follows the deposition of a natural person,whether or not a party to the action,shall be taken at a place that is,at the option of the party giving notice of the deposition,either within miles of the deponent residence,or within the county where the action is pending and within miles of the deponent residence,unless the court orders otherwise pursuant to paragraph.stats,ch.section,subdivision e provided similar mileage limitations for organizations as deponents.stats,ch.while these mileage limitations are similar,but not identical,to those of former section,subdivision a the most significant difference between the statutes is that former section subdivision a began with n otwithstanding section,stats,ch,while section,subdivisions e and e contained no such language stats,ch.
subdivision e of section provided a balancing provision to override the mileage limitations for a party or witness.it is similar to the balancing provision in former section,subdivision b.indeed,the two statutes identify the same list of factors in largely the same order compare stats,ch,with stats,ch.however,as with the mileage limitations themselves,the balancing provision in subdivision e of section no longer had the n otwithstanding section language of its immediate predecessor.compare stats,ch,with stats,ch.
it is significant to our analysis to determine how this language came to be enacted.that is,we must review the legislative history of the civil discovery act to determine how section,subdivision e came to nearly restate the provisions of former section,including the balancing provision which allows the mileage limitations to be bypassed,but without the n otwithstanding section language.
the bill as originally introduced would have eliminated the balancing provision entirely.as originally proposed,section,subdivisions e and e set mileage limits,not alterable by the court,on the distance a deponent could be required to travel.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended.this was in line with the recommendation of the state bar judicial council joint commission on discovery.state bar judicial council joint commission on discovery,proposed california civil discover act of proposed act and reporter notes.the reporter note indicates that the joint commission specifically proposed eliminating the balancing provision,then in former section,subdivision b,because neither parties nor third persons should be required to travel long distances for a deposition.id.at.
the los angeles county bar association performed a lengthy analysis of the bill,agreeing with many of its provisions and disagreeing with others.see los angeles county bar association,letter to assemblyman harris,and attachment.specifically,the county bar opposed the deletion of court authority to order a party deposition more than miles from the deponent residence.id.at attachment.
likely in response to concerns such as this,the senate amended the bill to reinstate the balancing provision of former section,subdivision b,but did not reinstate the n otwithstanding section language.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended june.there is no doubt that section,subdivision e was modeled on former section,subdivision b.the same balancing factors were utilized in virtually the same order as former section,subdivision b omission of the phrase n otwithstanding section was the only substantive change made.while further amendments would subsequently be made prior to enactment of the civil discovery act of,this key reinstatement of the balancing provision without the n otwithstanding section language remained in the statute as ultimately enacted,and has been carried into section,one of the statutes governing the location of depositions today 
in determining the legislative intent behind the reenactment,in section,subdivision e,of the balancing provision of former section,subdivision b without the n otwithstanding section language,we are guided by the principle that w hen the legislature deletes an express provision of a statute,it is presumed that it intended to effect a substantial change in the law.royal.auctioneers,coast printing equipment d,barajas city of anaheim th.this principle applies specifically to the civil discovery act.see,sexton superior court th,applying civil discovery act we find it significant the amendments of sections,subdivision and,subdivision did not include the earlier provision of section subdivision a the elimination of the pre law which gave authority to extend the time for making a motion to compel further answers indicates an intention by the legislature not to vest any authority in the court to permit discovery that is not timely made kohan cohan d,applying civil discovery act former section,subdivision d,by its terms applied to willfully failing to comply with discovery.that language has been omitted from section,subdivision b l,so current version does not require a misuse of the discovery process to be willful before sanctions are imposed see also reid google cal th,where prior statute required objections to be made either in writing or orally and legislature removed those words,we can reasonably infer that the legislature intended not to restrict the manner in which objections had to be presented.thus,by removing the words authorizing the trial court to override section,the legislature presumptively intended to withdraw that authority which had previously existed.
moreover,there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that the n otwithstanding section language was omitted because it was determined that such language was no longer necessary.we again note the history of this amendment.originally,the joint committee proposed eliminating trial court discretion to order a deposition beyond the mileage limitations entirely,and the assembly bill followed that proposition.after criticism arguing that the trial courts should retain such discretion,the senate amended the bill to restore such discretion,but without the language permitting the discretion to be exercised in derogation of the limits imposed by section.that the legislature chose a middle course between the prior law of unlimited discretion and the joint committee proposal of no discretion is not only reasonable,but likely.
thus,the legislative history supports our conclusion based on the plain language of the statutes.the intentional omission of the n otwithstanding section language from the balancing test once again renders a trial court orders regarding the location of depositions subject to the restrictions of section.
the glass decision does not support plaintiffs position 
plaintiffs disagree with our conclusion and rely on glass,supra,d.their reliance takes two forms.first,plaintiffs argue that the glass decision itself controls the result in this case.second,plaintiffs argue that the legislature renumbering of the discovery statutes following the glass opinion constituted an implied adoption of this authority.we disagree with both contentions.
a.the glass decision itself 
plaintiffs rely on glass,supra,d,an appellate court opinion decided years after the supreme court decided twin lock,and two years after the civil discovery act of had removed the n otwithstanding section language from the balancing provision.the issue in glass was whether the senior managers of ameriana,a foreign corporation which had filed the action in california,could be required to attend depositions in this state.
in glass,the petitioners sought to depose three senior members of ameriana management team in california pursuant to section,subdivision e.ameriana opposed the motion on the ground that the deponents were indiana residents and could only be deposed within miles of their residences.glass held the petitioners were entitled to an order compelling the depositions in california.
glass reasoned that,because section,subdivision e was virtually identical to the version of section,subdivision b,which the supreme court held in twin lock was sufficient to overcome the restrictions of section,the same result should apply.glass,supra,d at.ameriana argued that the statutes were not virtually identical,because the version of section,subdivision b included the n otwithstanding section language,but section,subdivision e did not.the glass court rejected that argument in a footnote,stating ameriana offer s no legislative history or other compelling support for this argument.furthermore,it is more reasonable to assume the legislature determined the phrase was superfluous in light of the year old twin lock decision,its revised discovery scheme and its stated goal of eliminating unnecessary to other discovery statutes.glass,supra,d at,fn.
we find glass unpersuasive for several reasons.first,we believe the glass court misconstrued the supreme court language in twin lock.the supreme court had found the presence of the n otwithstanding section language in the version of section,subdivision b to be o f particular significance.twin lock,supra,cal d at.given that,we can not accept the glass court conclusion that section,subdivision e,which lacks such language,is virtually identical to the version of section,subdivision b second,we have before us the legislative history which was not before the glass court having reviewed that history at length,we have concluded that the omission of the n otwithstanding section language in was intentional,and must be given effect.third,we disagree with the glass court supposition that the legislature determined the n otwithstanding section language was superfluous in light of twin lock.twin lock found that language to be important to its analysis removing the language removes one of the underpinnings of twin lock and renders its discussion of the version of section,subdivision b inapplicable 
glass has been on the books for years and has not been cited in any published decision we disagree with its analysis and decline to follow it.
b.the subsequent renumbering of the discovery act 
has no effect 
as already noted the legislature renumbered the civil discovery act in,some sixteen years after the glass decision.plaintiffs argue that the legislature reenactment of the civil discovery act in constituted legislative approval or adoption of the conclusions reached in glass.we disagree.
there is no legislative acquiescence in an existing interpretation of the law by a subsequent statutory amendment which is merely nonsubstantive in nature.in order for the doctrine of legislative acquiescence to apply,the legislature must have had the substantive topic before it.ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th.in this case,the legislature reenactment of the civil discovery act was expressly nonsubstantive.the california law revision commission recommended a nonsubstantive reorganization,explaining that t he statutes governing civil discovery are logically organized,but are difficult to use due to their length and complexity.recommendation civil discovery nonsubstantive reform cal.law revision com.the reorganization was intended to enhance readability and assist courts and practitioners in interpreting and following the law by b reaking the statute into shorter,more comprehensible segments.ibid.in addition,the commission advised that the renumbering would simplify the legislative process,which requires reprinting the full text of a section in any bill amending it.id.at fn.the commission stated that it had taken care to ensure that the proposed revisions are strictly nonsubstantive.id.at.further,the statute itself states that it was not intended to change the law stats,ch,nothing in this act is intended to substantively change the law of civil discovery lee superior court th,fn.changes were not intended to have any substantive effect.
given this legislative history,we reject plaintiffs argument that this renumbering had the effect of placing the legislature imprimatur on the glass case.the renumbering had no such effect.
conclusion 
the plain language of the statutory scheme and the legislative history of that language fully support the conclusion that a trial court can not order a to appear at a california deposition plaintiffs arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.we will therefore grant toyota petition for writ of mandate.
disposition 
toyota petition for writ of mandate is granted.upon remand,the trial court is directed to vacate its order of june,which granted plaintiffs motion to compel and to enter a new and different order denying such motion.toyota shall recover its costs in this appellate proceeding.
klein,concurring.
i concur in the lead opinion and its holding that irrespective of code of civil procedure section which authorizes a court to permit the deposition of a party or officer,director,managing agent or employee of a party at a location more distant than that permitted under section,the superior court is precluded by section from ordering a nonresident to appear at a california deposition.but i have concurred in the court opinion because i agree the present discovery statutory scheme compels the conclusion reached in that opinion.i write separately,however,to express my concern the current statutory scheme is inadequate and inappropriate in today era of globalization.it is my view the legislature should promptly address this issue.
section was originally enacted in.it has now become an archaic limitation on discovery.further,because section provides a nonresident of california is not obliged to attend as a witness in this state,it applies not only to residents of foreign countries,but also to residents of other states in these united states.the legislature should address this subject at the earliest opportunity in order to update the law and to bring california in line with other jurisdictions.
residency requirement of section is inconsistent with 
california intent to exercise broadest possible jurisdiction 
over nonresidents 
it should be noted that section,commonly known as california statute integral development weissenbach th,provides a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction over nonresidents on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.section manifests an intent by california to exercise the broadest possible jurisdiction,limited only by constitutional considerations.sibley superior court cal d,accord archdiocese of milwaukee superior court th.
given the legislature authorization in section of the broadest possible exercise of jurisdiction over nonresidents,it is difficult to understand section stringent residency requirement for the attendance of witnesses in this state.
deposition of nonresidents in other jurisdictions 
federal courts 
federal courts routinely order the depositions of foreign corporate executives on american soil,pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure,rule b as stated in custom form manufacturing,omron custom form,when a foreign corporation is doing business in the united states,is subject to the court jurisdiction,and has freely taken advantage of our federal rules of discovery,exceptions to the general rule on the location of depositions are often made.under such facts,the foreign corporation agents are frequently compelled for deposition on american soil.see in re honda american motor.dealership relations litigation,requiring agents of a japanese corporate defendant to be deposed in maryland m c corporation erwin behr gmbh,requiring a german corporate defendant agents to appear for depositions in detroit barron nuclear fields australia,wl,requiring depositions of dutch and australian defendants in chicago roberts heim,compelling the appearance of a swiss defendant for deposition in san francisco.the bottom line is that a foreign corporation,subject to the in personam jurisdiction of this court,can be ordered under rule b to produce its officers,directors or managing agents in the united states to give deposition testimony.work bier.custom form,supra,at,italics added.
state courts 
various state courts likewise have ordered foreign nationals to attend depositions in this country.see,state ex rel.bunker resource recycling reclamation,howald canadian resident,who was corporation managing agent,could be required to give deposition in missouri johnson johnson swiss executive required to appear in new jersey in re turner,trial court had discretion to order hong kong resident deposition to take place in texas.
ex parte toyokuni,so d toyokuni,a wrongful death action against a japanese corporation,is instructive.there,the alabama supreme court upheld an order requiring japanese corporate representatives to travel to alabama for deposition.toyokuni stated depositions of nonresident corporate defendants ordinarily should be taken at the corporation principal place of business,but t here may be circumstances that would justify the taking of a deposition somewhere other than the corporation principal place of business,at.
in upholding the lower court discovery order,toyokuni reasoned the trial court is in a better position than an appellate court to weigh the circumstances in a particular case and to determine whether the deposition should be taken somewhere other than the corporation principal place of business the circuit judge was faced with a difficult situation in this case and,under the circumstances,we conclude that he did not abuse his discretion.toyokuni,supra,so d at.
the toyokuni court explained,the action is pending in the circuit court of mobile county,and toyokuni counsel and the administrator counsel practice law in the city of mobile,located in mobile county.in addition,the stultses,who are also defendants,have filed a against toyokuni,seeking to recover for property damage,and their counsel practice in mobile.the administrator argues that it would be less expensive for toyokuni representatives to travel to mobile than for the other parties and their counsel to travel to japan all parties are represented by counsel in mobile.citation.it could be a greater financial burden to all parties to conduct the deposition at a location other than the forum.toyokuni,supra,so d at.
toyokuni reasoned,moreover,japan system of discovery is very different from our open discovery system.under japanese law,judicial officers conduct all pretrial questioning of witnesses and discovery is basically limited to voluntary depositions.see in re honda american motor.dealership relations litigation,supra,at.it could be unfair to make the administrator conduct the deposition under japan strict discovery procedures,especially since,at the same time,toyokuni would have access to our more open discovery methods.an attempt to compel discovery pursuant to our rules on japanese soil could infringe foreign judicial sovereignty.citation.therefore,the circuit judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to order that the deposition take place in japan.toyokuni,supra,so d at,italics added.
toyokuni further recognized that holding the deposition in japan could thwart the circuit court control of this case.conducting the deposition in the forum would allow the circuit court to have greater control over the discovery process if disagreements arose.citation.if a dispute arises over the right to discover certain information,or if the defendant refuses to cooperate,by failing to answer certain questions or to produce certain documents,then,with the deposition taking place in mobile,the circuit court will be in a much better position to resolve any conflict.having the deposition take place in mobile and thus allowing the circuit court to exercise its control will serve the clear interest that the united states in general and alabama in particular have in maintaining the integrity of our judicial system and in exercising the jurisdiction of this state and this nation over persons whose products are distributed in the united states and in alabama.see in re honda american motor,at.toyokuni,supra,so d at,italics added.
policy considerations 
this case does not implicate the sovereignty of foreign countries.the policy question which the legislature should review is whether california courts should have the discretionary authority to require a corporate defendant foreign officers,directors,managing agents or employees to appear for deposition in california.
amicus curiae in support of toyota claim that deposition access to foreign corporate party employee witnesses would disrupt business operations and would impose an oppressive discovery burden on every international corporation whose products are sold in california.however,case law in other jurisdictions see,ante reflects that corporate defendants are capable of producing foreign employees for deposition,and that trial courts are presumably capable of managing such discovery in a fair manner.
the policy reasons articulated in toyokuni pinpoint the need for the legislature to reexamine section.we are now living in a global economy.permitting the deposition in california of nonresident employees of foreign corporations doing business here would help maintain the integrity of our judicial system by enabling the superior court to exercise control over discovery in the event litigation should arise.it would also enable california to exercise its jurisdiction over foreign corporations whose products are distributed here.
another factor militating in favor of conducting depositions in california,rather than overseas,is that the procedures for conducting depositions abroad may thwart discovery.as stated in toyokuni,japan system of discovery is very different from our open discovery system.under japanese law,judicial officers conduct all pretrial questioning of witnesses and discovery is basically limited to voluntary depositions.see in re honda american motor.dealership relations litigation,supra,at.it could be unfair to make the plaintiff conduct the deposition under japan strict discovery procedures,especially since,at the same time,defendant would have access to our more open discovery methods.toyokuni,supra,so d at.
additionally,if the depositions are conducted in this forum,in the event of disputes arising during the depositions,such as if the witnesses refuse to cooperate,the superior court would be in a much better position to resolve any conflict.
further,it may well be more economical for plaintiffs to bring individual deponents from abroad,rather than for a team consisting of plaintiffs,their attorneys,a stenographer,a videographer and a translator,to travel abroad for depositions.
moreover,the current state of affairs,in which toyota foreign executives can not be required to appear for deposition in california,creates an uneven playing field for american business.as discussed in toyokuni,deposition procedures in japan are far more restrictive.toyokuni,supra,so d at.if foreign corporations doing business here are able to shield their personnel from effective discovery,they would have an unfair advantage over domestic automakers and other competitors,who are subject to extensive discovery in this country.
