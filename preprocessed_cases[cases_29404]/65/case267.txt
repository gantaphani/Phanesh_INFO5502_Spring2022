this appeal from a diversity damages suit between identically named parties and no,it is not a suit for divorce started off on a very bad foot,with the appellant certifying in its statement of jurisdiction that it was appealing from a final judgment and the appellee certifying in its statement of jurisdiction that the appellant statement was complete and correct.in fact the judgment order stated merely that summary judgment was being granted for the plaintiff,without specifying the amount of damages that was being ordered.such a judgment is nonfinal and therefore with immaterial exceptions unappealable.liberty mutual ins.wetzel,d mercer magnant,cir.so we dismissed the appeal.the judge then entered a proper judgment awarding million to the plaintiff,and the defendant filed a new notice of appeal.
worse was to come.the parties as we said have the same name,but the plaintiff is a california corporation and the defendant a korean corporation.from here on in we call them and.the briefs suggest that the only relation that has ever existed between them was that was the distributor of products.but we discovered at argument that when the suit was filed,was a subsidiary of,though it was later sold.a suit by a subsidiary against its parent is sufficiently outr√© to warrant mention by the parties.we shall set the former relation between the parties to one side for a moment but come back to it.
the appeal arises from the following sequence of events,which we state in simplified form.sold a tent,together with the stakes for fastening it to the ground,to american recreation products arp.it is unclear where got the tent that it sold arp,but the stakes were manufactured by an independent contractor in korea that hired for this task,according to specifications that arp furnished it.shipped the tent and stakes to,which packaged them and delivered them either to arp or to arp customer.one of the stakes had been defectively manufactured,and it broke and caused a serious injury to a child named amanda cochran.that was in.shortly afterwards,she by her parents sued arp,and a third firm kellwood,the role of which in this whole business is obscure and which therefore we shall ignore,in an illinois state court.the suit sought damages on grounds of breach of warranty,strict products liability,and negligence.
two years into the suit filed a claim against.the cochrans then amended their complaint to add as a defendant jinwoong,described in the amended complaint as a domestic corporation that was however the same entity as.this domestic corporation was in fact.soon learned that was being sued both by and by the cochrans.but it made no effort to intervene.says that it tried to implead but was rebuffed by the court the record is muddy on this issue.although did not receive formal notice of the claims against until much later,it is apparent from an in the record and other evidence that,though not impleaded or otherwise formally notified,learned about the claim against soon after it was filed.
in the cochrans suit was settled after they obtained summary judgment against on liability.agreed to pay them million and then brought this diversity suit against,seeking indemnity for the amount of the settlement.it is from the belatedly entered judgment for that amount that is appealing.
indemnity is another name for insurance,and it is common for the parties to a contract to provide that in the event that one is held liable the other shall indemnify it for the consequences.for example,contracts between authors and publishers invariably require the author to indemnify the publisher should the latter be held liable for defamation contained in the author book.the underlying principle is that the party that is in the better position to avoid liability is given an incentive to do so by being made responsible for the consequences.mcmunn hertz equipment rental,cir marvin chirelstein,concepts and case analysis in the law of contracts ed.but even if the parties fail to include an indemnity provision in their contract,if it is apparent that they would have done so had the point occurred to them the courts will read it into their contract unless it is disclaimed.contract completion is a standard function of common law courts.harold wright dupont de nemours,cir wisconsin real estate investment trust weinstein,cir lisa bernstein,social norms and default rules analysis,cal.interdisciplinary.it reduces transaction costs and gives the parties an approximation to what,if they were omniscient,they would have provided respecting every possible contingency that might arise in the course of performance of the contract.
for indemnity to be thus implied in a contract,the illinois cases require and it is illinois common law that all agree governs the substantive issues in this diversity suit that the parties must have already had a relationship when the tort giving rise to the liability remember that the function of the doctrine of implied indemnity is to fill out the parties contract it is not to create a contract where none existed.in addition,the party on whom the duty to indemnify is sought to be imposed must have been in some though often an attenuated sense at fault and the other party blameless though is to say,only strictly liable,by virtue of respondeat superior,implied warranty,strict products liability,or some other legal principle that imposes liability regardless of fault,frazer munsterman,kerschner weiss,d.obviously the fact that the party seeking indemnity was sued and settled rather than litigating to the death does not establish blame and thus refute his right to indemnity.richardson chapman,faier ambrose cushing.
it is by virtue of the requirement of a preexisting relation that the parties failure to disclose their corporate affiliation which did not dissolve till after this suit was brought so startles.obviously they had a preexisting relation one was owned by the other yet denied in its brief that there was any preexisting relation,and said only that the two companies had a relation,role being to import the goods from korea and market them in the united states.may have denied the relationship in an effort to deny one element of the illinois test for indemnity,while may have ignored the relationship lest its existence make us think that they were indeed the same entity so that the fault of should be attributed to.another possibility,however,is,as we shall see,that the preexisting relation was not the right kind from the standpoint of indemnity doctrine.still,the lawyers should have been more forthcoming.
a further question about the corporate relation is whether it renders the suit collusive.we think not.was a subsidiary but we were told at argument without contradiction not a wholly owned one,so its board of directors had obligations to minority shareholders,especially in a case that involved a conflict with the parent it may also have had obligations to creditors who by virtue of the principle of limited liability could not look to the parent to pay debts.one obligation of to its minority shareholders was to enforce any right of indemnity that the law gave it,or rather not to refuse to enforce it merely because the right was against its parent.sinclair oil levien,case new york central,palley mcdonnell.the obligation was honored.having dutifully bought insurance that funded the settlement with the cochrans,the insurance company became the subrogee of indemnity claim and is,we understand,controlling this suit.is insured by another insurance company,which is controlling the defense.
so the suit is not collusive and let us move to the merits.as we said,because implied indemnity is meant to fill a gap in the parties contract there has to be a preexisting relation in the nature of contract and there was here was distributor.the corporate relation itself was not the preexisting relation that the cases require if the corporations though affiliated were not dealing with each other,imposition of implied indemnity would be an end run around limited corporate liability,which with immaterial exceptions applies even between affiliated corporations.that is,if a sues b,a subsidiary of c,b would no
