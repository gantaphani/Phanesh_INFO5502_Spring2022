plaintiff ronald gradle fell into the machinery of a ski lift and lost his leg.he and his wife brought suit against doppelmayr usa,the company that designed and provided the equipment for the retrofit of the ski lift,alleging a design defect and negligence.the jury returned a verdict for doppelmayr.the gradles appeal,contending the trial court erred in excluding evidence of california occupational safety and health act rules and regulations to establish negligence per se.they assert such evidence is admissible under recent amendments to labor code section.the gradles also contend the court erred in excluding doppelmayr notice of motion for summary judgment,which they wanted to use as an admission to impeach an expert witness.finally,the gradles contend the court erred in finding a settlement offer of was reasonable and awarding doppelmayr expert witness costs of under code of civil procedure section.
we find merit in the first contention.under amended labor code section,evidence of standards are now admissible to establish negligence per se except as against the state for violation of a mandatory duty.the error in excluding this evidence requires reversal of the judgment.we address the two remaining contentions for guidance of the trial court on remand.the notice of the summary judgment motion was not an admission and was properly excluded under evidence code section.we find,however,that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding doppelmayr expert witness fees as costs.
factual and procedural background 
following a serious accident,involving the failure of a yan detachable chair lift,at whistler in british columbia,california required all yan lifts be modified.mammoth mountain ski area contracted with doppelmayr to modify their four yan lifts,including lift at june mountain.the retrofit involved converting the yan detachable grip system to a doppelmayr detachable grip system.doppelmayr provided the design and engineering for the retrofit,and new sheave assemblies,grips,chairs and hangers,and machinery for the terminals.
ronald gradle worked for mammoth mountain as the electrical supervisor at june mountain.he was a good,safe employee,with an impeccable record.when he went to work on the morning of january,it was cold,windy and snowing with ice.there was a problem with the proximity switch on lift.the proximity switch prevents two chairs from being in the safety zone at the same time to avoid collisions.gradle adjusted the switch at the bottom of the lift while the lift was stopped.he then took a snowmobile to the top of the lift.
a mechanic asked gradle if he wanted the lift stopped and gradle said no.gradle climbed into the operator shack at the terminal.there is a three and a half foot high tub wall that is a barrier to the machinery.gradle climbed on top of the tub wall and made his way to the switch.there was snow and ice on the top of the tub wall.gradle yelled to the mechanic,who was feet away,to take the lift to start speed and then stop it.the mechanic replied,okay,but apparently did not hear the command to stop the lift.gradle squatted on top of the tub wall waiting for the lift to stop and slipped.he got caught in the machinery and lost a leg.
in the fall of,gradle and his wife brought suit against doppelmayr and others.as to doppelmayr,the amended complaint alleged design defect due to the lack of safety guards on the machinery and negligence.
on august,doppelmayr made an offer to compromise pursuant to code of civil procedure section,offering to gradle and to his wife.the gradles did not respond to the offer.
several months later doppelmayr moved for summary judgment on two grounds that it did not manufacture the portion of the lift involved in the accident and assumption of the risk.the trial court denied the motion.
before trial doppelmayr filed numerous motions in limine to exclude certain evidence.one motion sought to exclude evidence of alleged labor code violations and findings.the gradles wanted to admit evidence of a preliminary safety order requiring safety guards for the machine and machine parts and guards for the on the accelerator and decelerator systems.the trial court granted doppelmayr motion.the gradles renewed the objection during trial and it was again denied.
the gradles wanted to introduce doppelmayr notice of the motion for summary judgment as an admission to show that doppelmayr falsely claimed it did not manufacture the machinery involved in the accident.the court ruled it was not a judicial admission,but requested briefing on whether it was a party admission.the court subsequently ruled the notice was not admissible it was not a declaration,but argument of counsel.if the notice was relevant,the court would exclude it under evidence code section because it had minimal probative value and a great potential to consume time as counsel would need to explain it.
the old yan lifts had removable cover plates or guards over the machinery.the gradles offered expert testimony that the guarding was a part of a complete design and it was below the standard of care not to provide guarding.doppelmayr countered that guarding was not part of the contract,it was to be done by mammoth mountain,and it could not be done until the project was complete.
doppelmayr had retained an engineer to review and certify its design.a load test on the lift was conducted in.the engineer recommended that the lift not be opened until construction,including the enclosure and guarding,was complete.mammoth mountain opened the lift before construction was complete.the morning of the accident,mammoth mountain was anxious to get the lift open.doppelmayr had provided an emergency pull cord to stop the machinery it was be installed a few feet above the tub wall.mammoth mountain had not installed the cord at the time of the accident.
mammoth mountain had a lock out safety procedure that the lift maintenance people used.the lift was turned off and the key pulled out of the main control so the lift could not be started while maintenance was working on it.there was testimony that gradle violated this safety procedure.gradle testified the maintenance mechanic smelled boozy and appeared a little hung over the morning of the accident.
the jury returned a special verdict,finding no design defect and that doppelmayr was negligent but its negligence was not the cause of the injuries.
doppelmayr moved for costs of,including for expert witness fees due to the gradles rejection of the section offer.the gradles moved to tax costs,including all of the expert witness fees.they argued the offer was not reasonable.the court granted the motion only as to certain computer and mediation costs and awarded doppelmayr costs of.
the gradles appeal.
discussion 
the gradles contend the trial court erred in excluding evidence of regulations and the preliminary order issued in this case.they contend they established the foundation necessary under evidence code section for a presumption of negligence per se,and regulations are admissible in personal injury actions by an employee against a third party other than his employer under amended labor code section.they contend the court erroneous ruling gutted their case.
the issue of whether regulations are admissible in an employee action against a third party to establish the standard of care or a presumption of negligence is currently pending before the california supreme court in elsner uveges,review granted april.
the gradles concede regulations were not admissible in actions against third parties under the prior version of labor code section section,but they contend the amendments to that section now permit the admission of such evidence.former section,by its plain language,clearly limited application of standards and safety orders to actions between an employee and his employer.the previous version of section provided it is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this division shall only be applicable to proceedings against employers brought pursuant to the provisions of chapter commencing with section and commencing with section of part of this division for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.neither this division nor any part of this division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action arising after the operative date of this section,except as between an employee and his own employer.stats,ch.
every appellate court in the state of california which has considered the question of legislative intent of this section has concluded regulations are not applicable to nor admissible in an employee action against a third person not his or her employer.the legislative intent of labor code section is patent and clear.widson international harvester d.
the amended version of section is not so clear.section,as amended in,provides 
it is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this division,and the occupational safety and health standards and orders promulgated under this code,are applicable to proceedings against employers for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.
neither the issuance of,or failure to issue,a citation by the division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action,except as between an employee and his or her own employer.sections and of the evidence code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.the testimony of employees of the division shall not be admissible as expert opinion or with respect to the application of occupational safety and health standards.it is the intent of the legislature that the amendments to this section enacted in the regular session shall not abrogate the holding in brock state of california d.stats,ch.
as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation.citation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision citation.citation.people murphy cal th,d.
we begin by examining the words of the amended statute.section contains two paragraphs.the first is a single sentence that provides standards are applicable to proceedings against employers for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.at first glance,under the maxim expression unius est exclusion alterius the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another,this provision might be interpreted to limit the applicability of standards to proceedings against an employer.the maxim is not immutable and is inapplicable if its operation would contradict a discernible and contrary legislative intent.citations.people anzalone cal th,d.
we do not read the first paragraph of section in isolation to limit the applicability of standards to only proceedings against employers.in,the legislature reworded the first paragraph,changing its wording from shall only be applicable to are applicable.this change has considerable significance.the gradles contend this change from a restrictive provision to a merely descriptive provision lifted the previous ban of evidence in third party cases.we agree the first sentence does not require the exclusion of standards in third party cases it does not speak to that situation,but merely sets forth the exclusive purpose of such standards in proceedings against employers.
the second paragraph of section contains four sentences and addresses the rules for admission of standards in personal injury and wrongful death cases.the first restricts evidence of the issuance of or the failure to issue a citation to personal injury or wrongful death actions between an employee and his or her employer.if the first paragraph limited admissibility of standards to actions between an employee or an employer,this provision would not be necessary.in interpreting a statute we reject an interpretation that renders one of its provisions nugatory.people craft cal d.by limiting the admissibility only of the issuance of or failure to issue citations to actions,this provision suggests that other evidence of standards are admissible in a broader array of cases.
the next sentence of section provides that evidence code and,relating to judicial notice and a presumption of negligence,apply to standards in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.there is no express limitation on the type of cases or parties to which these evidence code provisions may apply.read alone,this provision strongly supports admission of standards in any case,provided the requirements of evidence code sections or are met.the gradles sought to admit the evidence under the provisions of evidence code section.
usually evidence code sections and will only apply in cases involving a defendant other than the employer because the exclusivity provisions of workers compensation will bar actions against an employer.we recognize there are some situations where an action against the employer is allowed,such as where the employer fails to carry compensation insurance.previous law allowed evidence of standards in such cases without any reference to the evidence code.the addition of the reference to evidence code section and implies an intent to broaden the scope of cases in which standards are admissible.
the third sentence of the second paragraph of section prohibits an employee of the division of occupational safety and health from testifying as an expert.again,there is no limitation on the type of case.this provision is not at issue here.
finally,the last sentence of section states the express legislative intent not to abrogate the holding in brock state of california d.thus,we must construe section and the admission of standards consistent with the holding in brock.the parties disagree on the scope of that holding.the gradles contend the holding in brock is a limited one the state can not be sued for a failure to inspect under.doppelmayr contends the holding in brock is broader standards can not be used to establish the duty of care of a third party who is not the employee employer.
brock state of california,supra,d.is a case from this court.it arose from a fire at a paper plant that killed or injured several employees.id.at.plaintiffs filed personal injury actions against several defendants,including the state of california.two causes of action were alleged against the state.the first alleged that the state had a mandatory duty to inspect manufacturing facilities to assure they were reasonably safe places for workers,through inspections the state knew of violations at the paper plant but failed to exercise their mandatory duty to ensure compliance.ibid.the second cause of action against the state alleged the state had a mandatory duty for inspection,maintenance and general safety of the premises and knowingly conspired with officials and employees of the paper plant to violate certain laws,codes and regulations the state had a mandatory duty to enforce.id.at.
the state demurred to the complaint on the ground that section prohibits reliance on as a basis for a personal injury or wrongful death action except as between an employee and employer.brock state of california,supra,d at.it was undisputed that plaintiffs complaint was based on duties.the trial court sustained the demurrer and this court found that ruling was correct.id.at.
in reasoning that section precluded the case,the brock court stated the fact that the state has a mandatory duty to inspect and to enforce provisions is irrelevant to the issue of whether those provisions can be relied upon in a personal injury action against the state when the state is not the employer.it is evident that the purpose of section is to prevent the technical safety provisions from enlarging the personal injury liability of third parties beyond basic common law liability.brock state of california,supra,d at.the court reasoned there was
