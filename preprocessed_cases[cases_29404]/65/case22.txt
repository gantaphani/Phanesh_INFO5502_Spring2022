this appeal turns on a nuanced question that lurks at the intersection of federal and state law does an amended complaint that changes the identity of a named defendant after the expiration of the applicable limitations period relate back to the date of the commencement of the action the district court,after first concluding that the puerto rico rule controlled the analysis,answered this question in the negative and jettisoned the action we hold that the federal rule applies that because the conditions to the operation of the federal rule are satisfied,the amendment relates back to the date of the commencement of the action and that,therefore,the judgment below must be reversed.
background 
the pertinent facts are largely undisputed.on november,a parked on an inclined street in puerto rico began rolling downhill and crushed a child,johnathan román morel.the infant died that evening.alleging that the death resulted from the vehicle flawed design,the decedent family members repaired to court.
invoking diversity jurisdiction,a,the family members whose names and exact relationships are immaterial here commenced their action in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on november.their complaint alleged a gallimaufry of product liability theories and named as a defendant,which the complaint described as an automobile company incorporated,operated,and with its principal place of business in michigan the plaintiffs served corporation dcc on december,in auburn hills,michigan.
on february,dcc responded to the complaint by moving for summary judgment on the ground that it had never manufactured or sold vehicles and that,therefore,the plaintiffs had sued the wrong party.dcc noted that a different entity,ag,had manufactured the vehicle described in the complaint and that daimlerchrysler ag dcag,a german company,was the successor in interest to ag 
on february,the plaintiffs amended their complaint as of right,see.a,substituting dcag as the party defendant.dcag received a copy of the amended complaint on march.the company was formally served under the hague convention later that month.
the defendant moved for partial summary judgment,see supra note,asserting that the adult plaintiffs claims were.the plaintiffs countered that,under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,the amended complaint related back to the date of the commencement of the action and,thus,their suit was timely.
the district court concluded that a puerto rican statute of limitations conferred substantive rights and that rule c could not be allowed to trump those rights.morel daimler chrysler ag,d,unpublished.instead,the court applied puerto rico rule and determined that the amendment did not relate back.id.at citing laws ann.tit,app.iii.accordingly,the court granted dcag motion and entered a final though partial judgment under rule b.this appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we afford de novo review to a district court entry of summary judgment.see dávila corporación de para la diofusión pública,cir.because this is a diversity case featuring an array of tort claims rooted in local law,we look to the law of the forum here,puerto rico for the applicable statute of limitations.see guaranty trust york.under puerto rico law,the limitations period for tort claims is one year.laws ann.tit.since the fatal accident took place on november,the limitations period expired on november.
the plaintiffs sued on november,well within the period.but that complaint did not mention dcag.they filed their amended first pleading targeting dcag as a february.that was after the expiration of the period.thus,the question reduces to whether the amended complaint relates back to the time of filing the initial complaint.
in the first instance,the answer to this question hinges on whether federal or state law furnishes the controlling rule.consequently,we start there.
dcag maintains that puerto rico statute of limitations is substantive.see,rodriguez narváez nazario,cir.building on that foundation,it reasons that because an application of a federal rule would allow the plaintiffs to skirt that temporal bar,puerto rico rule must control.its argument boils down to the following construct if relation back under a federal standard would require a party to defend a claim that would otherwise be barred by operation of a substantive state rule,then the state rule must take precedence.we do not decide,but accept arguendo,that the claim would otherwise be barred by the puerto rico rule regardless of whether that rule is characterized as substantive or procedural.
this mode of outcome determination analysis has some footing in the supreme court diversity jurisprudence.see,york,at.but o utcome determination analysis was never intended to serve as a talisman.hanna plumer,d citing byrd blue ridge rural,d.
in fact,the supreme court has held that a federal rule controls notwithstanding that an inconsistent state rule would,if applied,have resulted in a different outcome.id.at.although chief justice warren acknowledged that a federal court need not wholly blind itself to the degree to which the rule makes the character and result of the federal litigation stray from the course it would follow in state courts,id.at,he made clear that such a civil rule ordinarily should take precedence.his opinion stated 
to hold that a federal rule of civil procedure must cease to function whenever it alters the mode of enforcing rights would be to disembowel either the constitution grant of power over federal procedure or congress attempt to exercise that power in the rules enabling act.
id.at.footnote omitted.
hanna held that the dichotomy,derived from the decision in erie tompkins,and york outcome determination test do not apply to matters covered by the federal rules of civil procedure.hanna,at.rather,as long as a rule is consonant with both the constitution and the rules enabling act,that rule must be given effect regardless of contrary state law.gasperini ctr.for humanities,d see also hoyos telecorp,cir.
in the case at hand,rule c is squarely on point.for aught that appears,the rule was properly promulgated and there is no credible basis for impugning its constitutionality.nevertheless,dcag asseverates that applying rule c in the circumstances of this case would contravene the rules enabling act,which declares in part that a federal rule of civil procedure shall not abridge,enlarge,or modify any substantive right.we reject that asseveration.
this language does not preclude the use of rule c in the instant case.the test of whether a challenged rule violates the statutory prohibition turns on the characterization of that rule if the rule relates directly to the practice and procedure of the district court,it does not violate that section of the statute.see hanna,at.
rule c is of that genre.it is a truly procedural rule because it governs the dispute resolution processes rather than the dispute that brought the parties into court consequently,it does not transgress the rules enabling act.johansen du pont de nemours,cir accord brown bliss,cir santana holiday inns,cir.indeed,no federal court has suggested that rule c is beyond the scope of the rules enabling act.charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.the commentators statement,published in,remains true today.we decline dcag invitation to break ranks and disregard rule c quintessentially procedural nature.
sound policy considerations support this point of view.the federal policy behind the rules enabling act aspires to the creation of a system of procedure in the federal courts that is uniform,comprehensive,and rational.the desirability of such a system substantially outweighs any countervailing state interest that might be served by ceding absolute priority to a conflicting state rule.while application of a federal rule may interfere with the operation of state rules at the margins,a pplication of state rules as to relation back would disrupt important federal policies favoring simplification and uniformity of pleading,and liberality of amendment.welch.power light,cir.
moreover,even though rule c is intimately connected with the policy of the statute of limitations.c advisory committee notes amendment,the rule does not actually alter state limitations periods.under rule c,the original complaint still must be filed within that limitations period.so viewed,t he state underlying interest in protecting persons against stale claims is adequately protected by the practical notice requirements built into rule c.davis piper aircraft,cir see wright et,supra,at.
the conclusion that rule c applies in a diversity case notwithstanding the incidence of a more restrictive state rule is implicit in our own precedent.see leonard parry,cir freund fleetwood,cir breyer.what is implied in these decisions is explicit in the holdings of many other courts of appeals.see,simmons cent.skyworker,cir johansen,at santana,at davis,at ingram kumar,cir loudenslager teeple,cir crowder gordons transports,cir.we join the ranks of those courts.
one other matter requires our attention.in support of its position that state law controls,dcag cites marshall mulrenin,cir.there,we stated that rule c is not to be applied to the extent,if any,that it would defeat rights arising from state substantive law as distinguished from state procedure.id.at.but context is important in marshall,the situation was the obverse of the situation here that is,the state rule was more generous than the federal rule.id.at.in that circumstance,we applied the less restrictive state rule.id.at.thus,marshall can be squared with hanna because state and federal law do not directly conflict when state law is less restrictive and adhering to state law may be consistent with the general purposes of rule.wright et,supra,at.
at any rate,any questions either about this distinction or about the correctness of the marshall decision have been rendered moot by a amendment to rule,which explicitly dictates relation back if the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back.c a.this subsection was designed to make it clear that the rule does not apply to preclude any relation back that may be permitted under the applicable limitations law.advisory committee notes amendment.the provision cements in place a ratchet less restrictive state rules will displace federal rules,but more restrictive state rules will not.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.for these reasons,we hold that federal rules apply here.still,that determination does not end our inquiry.the question remains whether these rules allow relation back of the plaintiffs amended complaint.
rule c c limns three conditions each of which must be satisfied in order to permit relation back of an amended complaint seeking to substitute a defendant.see leonard,at.first,the claim asserted against the defendant must satisfy the terms of rule c b,which provides that the claim must arise out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set attempted to be set the original pleading.second,within the period provided by federal rule of civil procedure m for serving the summons and complaint,the party to be brought in by amendment must have received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.c c i.third,it must appear that within the same time frame the defendant either knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.c c ii.
the first of these conditions is clearly satisfied here.the claim asserted against dcag unarguably arises out of the occurrence described in the original complaint.
the second condition involves notice.that notice need not be manifested by formal service of process within the prescribed period.rather,notice must simply be such that the defendant will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.c c i.at a minimum,though,notice requires knowledge of the filing of suit,not simply knowledge of the incident giving rise to the cause of action.singletary.dep t of,cir.
the notice that was communicated here plainly satisfied these criteria.dcag received a letter,attaching a copy of the amended complaint,on march.that transmittal informed it not only of the nature of the claims but also of the pendency of the suit.the only nagging question is whether the notice was timely under the terms of rule c c,which requires that the defendant receive notice within the time allotted for service of process under rule m.
the plaintiffs argue that the time limit prescribed in rule m does not apply in this case because rule m does not pertain to service of process in a foreign country instead,rule f which specifies no particular time.regardless of what uncertainty surrounds the amount of time afforded for service of a foreign corporation in such circumstances,it is logical that rule c c would afford no less time for the giving of notice in cases involving foreign corporations than it would in the ordinary case to which rule m applies.and here,dcag received notice within the period.
to recapitulate briefly,the chronology is as follows.the plaintiffs commenced the action on november.because the day of filing is excluded from the ensuing computation of time,see.a,the period began to run on november.measured from that date,the day was saturday,march.both that day and the next sunday,march were excluded from the computation.see.a.thus,the last day of the period was monday,march day on which the aforementioned transmittal arrived.this time line shows beyond hope of contradiction that dcag received notice of the action within the allotted period.
this brings us to the third condition knowledge of a mistake in identity.to satisfy this condition,the plaintiffs must show both that they made a mistake about the actual identity of the proper defendant and that,within the prescribed time,that party knew or should have known that,but for the mistake,it would have been sued.see leonard,at.
it is obvious from the face of the original complaint that the plaintiffs intended to sue the manufacturer of the allegedly defective automobile.for aught that appears,they made a mistake concerning the manufacturer identity.see generally webster third new int l dict.defining mistake as a wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment,inadequate knowledge,or inattention.but for this bevue,they would have sued dcag,not dcc.thus,when dcag which knew full well of its legal responsibility for the manufacture of the vehicle received notice of the action,it must have known or,at least,should have known that the action would have been brought against it in the first place but for the plaintiffs mistake.consequently,the final condition precedent to the operation of rule c was satisfied.
dcag attempts to parry this thrust by suggesting that the plaintiffs might intentionally have sued by an ambiguous name and served the complaint in michigan in the hopes that dcag would respond and thereby obviate the need for the costly and often requirements of hague convention service.appellee br.at.we find this suggestion fanciful.
the summary judgment record contains nothing that would support this suggestion indeed,there is no indication that dcag made this argument below.what we do example,the assertion by plaintiffs counsel that was named because the corporate website did not distinguish between dcc and in the opposite direction.
litigation should not be reduced to a game of cat and mouse.in the last analysis,it seems highly improbable that,with the limitations period about to expire,the plaintiffs,represented by seasoned counsel,would have made such a risky strategic choice.on this record,the only reasonable inference is that a mistake was made 
iii.conclusion 
we need go no further.in this instance,rule c controls.because the plaintiffs have satisfied all the conditions for the application of that rule,their amended complaint designating dcag as a party defendant relates back to the date of the commencement of the action it follows inexorably,as night follows day,that the action against dcag was timely and that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment.
to be precise,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of this defendant.the or
