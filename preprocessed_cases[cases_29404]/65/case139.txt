toll,toll appeals a district court order granting summary judgment against it in this action against dryvit systems,imperial stucco,and gill levesque,imperial stucco,llc seeking primarily to recover the costs it incurred in removing allegedly defectively designed synthetic stucco from homes that it had built and then recladding the homes with a different finish.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
toll is a real estate developer and builder.in or around,toll began development of a residential community called newtown chase in newtown,connecticut.toll contracted with imperial to clad some of the homes in the development with outsulation,a synthetic stucco exterior insulation finish system eifs that dryvit manufactured.
in october,several newtown chase homeowners whose homes were clad with dryvit eifs the homeowners wrote to toll expressing concerns regarding the eifs and alleging that toll advertising and promotional literature did not reveal that the homes would be clad in synthetic,rather than actual,stucco.the letter requested information regarding toll written warranty policies relating to the eifs as well as the eifs product warranty.the homeowners also asked for a letter of compliance from the contractor that installed the system verifying that installation was completed in accordance with the manufacturer specifications.
in august,the homeowners again contacted toll,this time demanding,inter alia,that toll remove dryvit eifs from their homes and reclad them with another finish.by this time,it was not just the homeowners who had questions regarding dryvit eifs toll had also come to believe that the eifs was defectively designed in that it permitted water and moisture to penetrate the exterior of the houses without provid ing a means for the water to evaporate or drain,thereby causing significant problems including rotting,structural damage,health hazards and diminished property value.although toll had not yet received any complaints of actual water infiltration from newtown chase homeowners,it nevertheless agreed to remove the eifs and reclad the homes with a different product.in return,the homeowners released toll from liability for future harm caused by the eifs and assigned toll their rights to sue the responsible parties.
toll subsequently initiated this action in connecticut state court,primarily seeking compensation for the costs it incurred in stripping and recladding the homes.against both dryvit and imperial,toll asserted claims for unjust enrichment,unfair trade practices in misrepresenting the capabilities of the eifs,see.ann.west,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,and claims under the connecticut product liability act cpla,see.ann.west.toll complaint also alleged an indemnification claim against imperial based on a contractual indemnity clause.
after appellees removed this suit to federal district court the district court granted summary judgment against toll.the court expressed doubt regarding whether toll had forecasted sufficient evidence that the eifs was in fact defectively designed.that issue aside,however,the court ruled as a matter of law that no such defect had caused any harm to the homes and that the proximate cause of toll dispute and settlement with the homeowners was toll misrepresentation to them that the homes would be clad in actual,rather than synthetic,stucco.ruling as a matter of law that dryvit could not have reasonably foreseen that toll would make such a misrepresentation,the district court determined that toll had failed to forecast evidence creating a genuine issue of fact about whether its injuries were proximately caused by the defectiveness of the eifs or appellees misrepresentations concerning that defectiveness.
the district court further ruled as a matter of law that toll contract with imperial did not entitle toll to indemnification.the court noted that the indemnity clause in the parties agreement states that imperial is only obligated to indemnify toll from and against all claims,damages,losses and expenses arising out of or resulting from the performance of imperial work.the court reasoned that,as a matter of law,the homeowners claims arose out of toll misrepresentations,not imperial work.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the disputed facts in the light most favorable to toll.see edelman lynchburg college,cir.summary judgment is warranted when the admissible evidence forecasted by the parties demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.williams staples,cir.
toll does not dispute that to recover under any of its claims,it must establish that the financial losses it incurred as a result of its dispute with the homeowners were proximately caused by the defectiveness of dryvit eifs toll argues,however,that the district court erred in ruling that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the defective design of dryvit eifs proximately caused toll alleged injuries.in so doing,toll challenges the ruling of the district court that the record established as a matter of law that its injuries were proximately caused by its misrepresentation to the homeowners that the homes were to be clad in actual,rather than synthetic,stucco.we agree with toll.
under connecticut law proximate cause is an actual cause that is a substantial factor in the resulting harm.stewart federated dep t stores,internal quotation marks,alteration emphasis omitted.whether a plaintiff injuries were proximately caused by the defendant generally presents a factual question for the jury to determine.see id.at.the question becomes one of law only when the mind of a fair and reasonable person could reach only one conclusion if there is room for a reasonable disagreement the question is one to be determined by the trier as a matter of fact.trzcinski richey,internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the forecasted evidence does not establish as a matter of law that toll misled the homeowners regarding whether the homes were to be clad with synthetic stucco.although dryvit forecasted evidence of the homeowners complaints that toll misled them,the evidence that such complaints were made is not admissible to prove that they were true.see.c hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.hearsay is not admissible except as provided by the federal rules of evidence or by other rules prescribed by the supreme court pursuant to statutory authority or by act of congress.
moreover,even if the record established as a matter of law that toll misled the homeowners regarding whether it used actual stucco on their homes,there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the misrepresentations proximately caused toll dispute and settlement with the homeowners.homeowner craig tenenbaum testified by deposition that the homeowners complaint that toll represented to them that the homes were to be clad with actual stucco was only one of the reasons that the homeowners demanded that dryvit system be replaced.the possibility that the system installed simply was not sufficient to protect the homes from water damage was also a primary concern.see id.at tenenbaum deposition testimony that the homeowners wanted their homes reclad because they thought dryvit system might cause water damage.indeed,in their initial letter to toll,the homeowners requested toll written warranty policies regarding the system.thus,the record did not establish as a matter of law that the homeowners would not have made the same demands absent any misrepresentation by toll.
similarly,the record does not establish as a matter of law that any misrepresentation by toll was a substantial factor in toll decision to submit to the homeowners demands.toll forecasted evidence that it was the likelihood of future water damage to the homes from the defective eifs that it was concerned about when it decided to settle with the homeowners.specifically,greg kamedulski,a toll vice president,stated in an affidavit that at the time toll decided to use dryvit eifs,it believed that the eifs was suitable for use on residential homes it reclad the homes because it discovered that the eifs was inherently defective and the recladding was undertaken in an effort to prevent further damage to the homes.id.at.for all of these reasons,the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that misrepresentations by toll,rather than the defectiveness of dryvit eifs,were the proximate cause of toll injuries 
appellees contend that any injuries suffered by toll were nonetheless not actionable in the absence of forecasted evidence that dryvit system damaged the homeowners homes.we agree with appellees regarding toll cpla claim.to recover under the cpla,a plaintiff must prove personal injury,death or property damage caused by the product.ann.b.because toll does not claim that dryvit eifs actually damaged the homes,its cpla claims fail as a matter of law.bellsouth,grace,cir holding that cpla claim did not accrue simply by presence of asbestos but upon discovery of actual harm caused by the dangerous product.
the lack of forecasted evidence of property damage is not a proper ground for affirmance,however,regarding toll other claims.toll has alleged that appellees misrepresentations and other tortious actions induced it to use dryvit defective cladding.these claims fall outside of the cpla to the extent that they seek damages for a wholly financial injury,namely,the cost of toll dispute and settlement with the homeowners.see gerrity reynolds tobacco,holding that claims alleging only financial injury and no property damage,death,or personal injury fall outside the scope of the cpla.
appellees do not deny that toll faced potential future liability,by warranty or otherwise,for damage caused to the homes by dryvit system.appellees nevertheless maintain that toll was required to choose between allowing such damage to occur or preventing the damage at its own expense with no right of recourse against appellees.the law does not require such a hobson choice,however.that is so because in connecticut,as elsewhere,the failure by a plaintiff to make a reasonable attempt to avoid injury from a defendant tortious action may bar the plaintiff from recovering for his injury.see keans bottiarelli.the corollary to this proposition is that a plaintiff may recover from a the expense of a reasonable attempt to avoid being injured by the tort.see fogel zell,cir stating that had a city learned that it had installed a defectively manufactured sewer pipe,it would have been entitled by the doctrine of mitigation of damages to remove the pipe or take other prophylactic or reparative measures,and to seek restitution of the expense of doing so from the manufacturer,provided the expense was prudent in the circumstances restatement second of torts one whose legally protected interests have been endangered by the tortious conduct of another is entitled to recover for expenditures reasonably made or harm suffered in a reasonable effort to avert the harm threatened.here,toll has created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether its recladding of the homes was a reasonable attempt to avoid incurring liability resulting from appellees tortious misrepresentations and nondisclosures concerning the capabilities of dryvit eifs.thus,the wholly financial nature of toll alleged injury did not doom its entire action.
the dissent rejects our conclusion but misstates the basis for our decision.the dissent claims that we accept that damage to the houses actually resulted from dryvit eifs,post,at,when clearly we do no such thing,see supra,at noting that toll does not claim that dryvit eifs actually damaged the homes.appellees argued before the district court and continue to argue before us that the fact that toll has forecast no evidence that any of the newtown chase homes have been damaged by the eifs entitles them to summary judgment.as we have explained,we reject the notion that the lack of evidence of property damage is fatal to toll claims because toll would be entitled to recover on those claims if it established that its actions constituted a reasonable attempt to avoid incurring liability proximately caused by appellees tortious conduct.
although the dissent notes that connecticut law does not allow recovery of damages for a possible future injury,see post,at,it does not dispute that a plaintiff may be reimbursed under connecticut law for expenses it has actually incurred in a reasonable attempt to avoid future liability resulting from a defendant tortious conduct.the dissent nevertheless states that it would affirm the grant of summary judgment on the ground that toll has forecasted insufficient evidence concerning the likelihood that damage would have occurred had toll not intervened.see id.at.we disagree.toll forecasted evidence that the dryvit eifs causes entrapment of incidental water and that such entrapment has frequently caused consequential damage to underlying water sensitive wall components such as sheathing and framing.although the precise likelihood that the eifs would cause future damage to the newtown chase the extent of the expected be relevant on the issue of whether toll measures constituted a reasonable attempt to avoid or mitigate its damages from appellees alleged tortious conduct,we conclude that toll forecasted evidence is at least sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning reasonableness.see williams ford,hartford courant,we have consistently held that reasonableness is a question of fact for the trier to determine based on all of the circumstances.
toll also maintains that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that toll was not entitled to indemnification for its expenditures under its agreement with imperial.we disagree.
toll agreement with imperial states that imperial must indemnify toll from and against all claims,damages,losses and expenses arising out of or resulting from the performance of imperial work.imperial agreed to furnish all labor and material necessary to clad the homes with dryvit system and guaranteed that all material would be as specified.id.at.toll does not point to any specifications regarding the material that imperial failed to meet.the problem,if any,was that the material that imperial had agreed to provide was defectively designed.stated another way,assuming that dryvit system was defective,as toll alleges it was,it was toll decision to clad the homes with that defective product,not imperial supplying or installation of the system,that caused toll to incur the costs associated with its dispute with the homeowners.indeed,toll has failed to forecast evidence that it could have avoided these costs by subcontracting with a different company 
appellees maintain that to the extent that summary judgment should otherwise be reversed,it should be affirmed on the basis of spoliation of the evidence.specifically,appellees complain of toll removing the eifs and disposing of it without alerting them or giving them an opportunity to determine if the systems,as they were actually installed,were defective.this court is of course free to affirm a judgment on any ground appearing in the record.see united states smith,cir.but,because the district court has not yet addressed the spoliation issue,we will refrain from ruling on it at this time.see silvestri motors,cir holding that the question of whether a case should be dismissed because of spoliation is one for the district court to address in the first instance.
in sum,for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the order granting summary judgment against toll on its claims under the cpla and its indemnification agreement with imperial,but otherwise reverse the order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision 
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
because the majority opinion is based on issues that are,in my view,irrelevant to the proper disposition of this case,i can not join it.i agree with the judgment of the district court because toll brothers failed to submit sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the syntheti
