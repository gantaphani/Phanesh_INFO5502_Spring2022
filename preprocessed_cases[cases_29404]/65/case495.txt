introduction 
the first element of a loss of consortium cause of action is the existence of a marriage at the time of injury to the plaintiff spouse.with illnesses,as with other latent diseases,appreciable injury does not occur at the time of exposure to the toxic substance,but often decades later when disease is diagnosed or symptoms are discovered.in this opinion,we hold that the first element of a loss of consortium cause of action is satisfied if the plaintiff marriage to the injured spouse predates discovery of symptoms,or diagnosis,of an disease.this is so even if the marriage postdates the spouse exposure to the asbestos that ultimately results in the injury.
petitioner sherrell vanhooser seeks a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting the motion of defendant hennessy industries,hennessy for summary judgment of her loss of consortium cause of action.hennessy premised its motion on zwicker altamont emergency room physicians medical group th zwicker to argue that petitioner has no claim for loss of consortium because she was not married to her husband when he was exposed to the asbestos that caused his mesothelioma.petitioner contends the ruling was incorrect because,pursuant to california supreme court authority,her cause of action for loss of consortium damages could only arise once her husband was diagnosed with mesothelioma,not when he was exposed to the asbestos that later resulted in the disease the trial court certified its ruling granting summary judgment to this court code civ.we conclude that zwicker is entirely distinguished,and we grant the petition and the writ.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner husband,frederick kenney,was exposed to asbestos in the and during his service in the united states navy,and until as an automobile mechanic working with automobile parts.it is undisputed that his last encounter with hennessy products was sometime between and august.the couple married on december,or.petitioner husband first exhibited symptoms of mesothelioma in late almost years later,and he was diagnosed with the disease in june.
frederick sued numerous companies,including hennessy,seeking damages for negligence and strict products liability.petitioner included a cause of action for loss of consortium.hennessy ground for summary judgment of petitioner cause of action was that petitioner did not marry frederick until after the claimed event in this case,namely his exposure to asbestos,with the result that,as a matter of law,petitioner has no cause of action for loss of consortium.hennessy argued the dates of both diagnosis and discovery of the illness are irrelevant under zwicker.
the trial court granted hennessey summary judgment motion ruling pursuant to zwicker that the date of the wrongful act,namely exposure to asbestos,was the relevant date for ascertaining existence of a loss of consortium cause of action.as frederick married petitioner after he was exposed to asbestos,the court ruled,petitioner had no claim for loss of consortium damages as a matter of law.petitioner effectively married her cause of action.the court expressed its dislike for the result zwicker engendered and certified its ruling to this court.the trial court stated the loss of consortium issue addressed in this order is a recurring issue in the los angeles,orange,and san diego county asbestos cases pending before this court.the court believes that it is a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion,appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.this petition for writ of mandate ensued because frederick is gravely ill and the question presented by this petition is one of statewide concern.we issued a stay of the trial court proceedings and an order to show cause.
discussion 
for purposes of creation of a loss of consortium cause of action,injury to the spouse in the latent disease context occurs when the illness or its symptoms are discovered or diagnosed,not at the time of the tortious act causing the harm.
t he right to recover for loss of consortium is founded on the relationship of marriage,and absent such a relationship the right does not exist.elden sheldon cal d.a person who suffers a loss of consortium as the result of a negligent or intentional injury to his or her spouse is entitled to recover damages from the tortfeasor.mealy b mobile,th,citing rodriguez bethlehem steel cal d.
there are four elements to a cause of action for loss of consortium a valid and lawful marriage between the plaintiff and the person injured at the time of the injury a tortious injury to the plaintiff spouse loss of consortium suffered by the plaintiff and the loss was proximately caused by the defendant act.hahn mirda th,fn,italics added,citing levy et,cal.torts loss of consortium.a loss of consortium cause of action is triggered by the spouse injury.rosencrans dover images,th,bartalo superior court d,husband loss of consortium cause of action does not arise unless his wife has sustained a personal injury.a cause of action for loss of consortium is,by its nature,dependent on the existence of a cause of action for tortious injury to a spouse.hahn mirda,supra,at.and,there is no right of action for loss of consortium if the spouse injury occurs before the marriage.zwicker,supra,th at,italics added.therefore,it is the couple marital status at the time the spouse is tortiously injured that determines whether the plaintiff can meet the first element of a loss of consortium right of action.
injury is an essential element of any cause of action.d actions,e very person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another,may recover damages d etriment is a loss or harm suffered in person or property rodriguez bethlehem steel,supra,cal d at each spouse has a cause of action for loss of consortium caused by a negligent or intentional injury to the other spouse by a third party.italics added.without injury to the spouse,the plaintiff has no loss of consortium claim.thus,a cause of action is not complete in the sense it is not actionable,without spousal injury.hahn mirda,supra,th at,fn.
although injury often occurs at the same time as the wrongful act is committed see,zwicker,supra,th at,that is not always the case.with latent diseases,it is difficult to determine when the injury occurs and n o temporally discrete event exists that encompasses the defendant breach and the plaintiff injury.buttram owens corning fiberglas cal th,italics added buttram.
mesothelioma is a latent,progressively developing disease,our supreme court explained.d ecades can often pass between the time a person is first exposed to asbestos and the time he first develops a cancerous mesothelioma tumor.moreover,although early formation of undetected cellular changes ultimately leads to contraction of the disease,it may be to years before the cancerous cells will result in a tumor large enough to be detected,be medically diagnosed,or cause symptomatology of the disease.buttram,supra,cal th at.the combination of lengthy latency periods and diagnostic difficulties is a unique feature of toxic substances cases for purposes of statutes of limitations analysis or related legal issues instead,insidious disease litigation involves an extended chronology of causation unlike traditional snapshot torts.citation,italics added,brackets omitted.
with particular reference to latent injuries,our supreme court has established that a cause of action for a latent injury or disease generally accrues,in the sense that it is ripe for suit,when the spouse discovers or should reasonably have discovered he has suffered a compensable injury.hamilton,sup
