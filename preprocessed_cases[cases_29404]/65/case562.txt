this case presents an unusual forum non conveniens situation in which the decedent is alleged to have suffered some injury from exposure to chemicals in california,the forum selected by texas plaintiffs,but subsequently experienced exposure to chemicals for almost two decades in texas,the forum preferred by defendants.
glenn richard morris died of leukemia in the state of texas in february.plaintiffs are his widow and two minor children,who are texas residents.plaintiffs filed a california survival and wrongful death action against defendants,alleging that morris decedent contracted leukemia from exposure to toxic chemicals manufactured by defendants which he used in his employment in printing shops.most of decedent employment,and all of his medical treatment,occurred in the state of texas.
defendants moved to stay or dismiss the action on the ground of forum non conveniens,arguing that the action should be tried in texas.the trial court denied the motion to dismiss,but granted the motion to stay,finding that california was an inconvenient forum.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred.we disagree and affirm because texas is a suitable alternative forum and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that california is a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action.
from until,decedent worked as a pressman for various commercial printing companies.from to he worked for fremont litho,fremont litho in fremont,california.from october to july he worked for consolidated publications in sunnyvale,california.it is undisputed that both fremont litho and consolidated publications are out of business 
from july to july decedent worked for publishers choice book manufacturing in mars,pennsylvania.he then relocated to texas.
between september and march,roughly years,decedent worked for two printing companies in austin,texas.he worked for sweets printing company from september to december,and for hart graphics,hart graphics from january to march.hart graphics then closed its austin printing facility and decedent went to work as a landscaper for the city of round rock,texas.
in november,decedent was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia.he was immediately admitted to a houston hospital,where he remained until his death on february.from until his death years later,decedent lived and worked only in the state of texas.it appears from the record that decedent widow lived with him in texas during the pertinent time periods,and his children were born in texas and have lived nowhere else.
in,plaintiffs filed a survival and wrongful death complaint in the district court of travis county,texas.plaintiffs alleged they were texas residents,and sought damages for negligence,gross negligence,strict liability,and breach of warranty against corporate defendants.in their complaint and their response to defendants request for disclosure,plaintiffs alleged that the defendants manufactured,distributed and supplied various solvents,cleaners,and other substances to which decedent was exposed during his employment around printing presses,and that these substances contained benzene or benzene derivatives which caused decedent leukemia.
plaintiffs response to the disclosure request listed several people with knowledge of facts relevant to the case.the majority of these persons were texas residents.these included george eschberger and mark goehmann,who worked with decedent at hart graphics.
the parties commenced discovery in the texas action.on june,close to a year after filing their complaint,plaintiffs filed a notice of nonsuit which was tantamount to a request for dismissal.on june,the travis county district court dismissed the action without prejudice.
on october,plaintiffs filed a complaint for survival and wrongful death in the superior court of alameda county.they sought relief on theories of negligence,strict liability,fraudulent concealment,and breach of implied warranties,based on decedent exposure to benzene and other toxic substances while working for the commercial printing companies mentioned above.they named as defendants companies which they alleged manufactured,distributed,or supplied the toxic substances.
as defendants phrased it below,the california complaint names some of the defendants named in the texas a ction,plus several others footnote omitted.the california complaint alleged,as plaintiffs currently represent in their opening brief,that only two defendants are california corporations.
discovery ensued.plaintiffs responded to four sets of interrogatories in.
on september,defendants filed a joint motion to stay or dismiss plaintiffs california action based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens.code civ,subd.a.defendants argued that california was an inconvenient forum because the action has no connection to california,and the applicable public and private interest factors set forth in stangvik shiley cal d,d,stangvik weighed heavily in favor of a stay or dismissal.it was undisputed that the applicable texas statutes of limitations had expired by the time the motion was filed.defendants argued that the trial court could stay or dismiss the action even though the expiration of the texas statutes of limitations effectively left plaintiffs without a forum.
defendants based their motion in part on the february interrogatory responses,which showed that all of the approximately physicians and medical providers who treated decedent work in texas.the responses also listed,supervisors and friends who plaintiffs claimed had personal knowledge of decedent work history and illness.the vast majority are texas residents who worked with decedent at hart graphics or sweets printing.
only of these witnesses worked with decedent in california,at fremont litho or consolidated publishing.plaintiffs could provide residence addresses for only all five of these witnesses reside outside of california one in washington,one in arizona,and three in texas.a sixth witness was believed to live in portland,oregon.plaintiffs listed most of the remaining witnesses by their last known business address fremont litho and consolidated publishing,both defunct companies.
defendants also relied on declarations of three witnesses,selected at random among the witnesses identified in plaintiffs discovery responses george eschberger,who was identified in the disclosure response in the texas action as a of decedent at hart graphics mark goehmann,who was identified in the interrogatory responses as a of decedent at hart graphics and russell peterson,identified as one of the who worked with decedent in california.
eschberger declared he was a resident of austin,texas.he met decedent around while they both worked at hart graphics in round rock,texas.they worked in the same building but not always on the same printing press.eschberger left hart graphics in and had minimal contact since then with decedent.he had not been to california since he was in the army in.he and his wife both had medical conditions making it difficult for them to travel.he was retired and could not afford to travel to california.traveling to testify in the california action would be extremely inconvenient and an extreme financial hardship.
goehmann declared he was a resident of fredericksburg,texas.he met decedent in august while they both worked at hart graphics.he left hart graphics in and had no further contact with decedent.he had never been to california and did not regularly travel outside texas.he supported three children and his wife was pregnant with a fourth.he was employed full time and could not afford to take time from work or pay travel expenses.traveling to testify in the california action would be extremely inconvenient and an extreme financial hardship.
peterson declaration was unsigned.the text of the declaration states that peterson was a resident of scottsdale,arizona,knew decedent from working with him at fremont litho,and was as a repairman and was on call hours a day,seven days a week.traveling to testify in the california action would be extremely inconvenient and an extreme financial hardship.
plaintiffs opposed the motion.they argued that the motion was untimely because it was not filed within a reasonable time after defendants appeared in the action.they also argued that the motion was not supported by sufficient evidence.plaintiffs challenged each of the three declarations.they objected that peterson declaration was not signed.they contended that goehmann declaration did not show that he possesses any relevant,material,or admissible testimony to provide at trial despite the fact that plaintiffs designated him a witness in the texas action.plaintiffs argued that eschberger declaration was obtained by deception because defendants allegedly told him the action would only be transferred to texas,not dismissed.
in a broader argument,plaintiffs claimed the evidence in support of the motion was insufficient because defendants did not identify the and provide a description of their anticipated testimony and how it would be admissible.plaintiffs concluded that the motion was based merely on bald assertions and generalities.
on the merits,plaintiffs claimed that defendants had failed to establish that there was a suitable alternative forum because the statutes of limitation in texas had expired.plaintiffs also contended that the public and private factors set forth in stangvik,supra,cal d,d,did not weigh heavily against california as the appropriate forum.
plaintiffs claimed that the passage of time would make it difficult to identify most of the.but plaintiffs were aware of the whereabouts of a small of key witnesses who possess relevant information concerning decedent work and exposures at fremont litho,sweets publishing,and hart graphics.they submitted declarations of four of them,one a resident of washington and three,including eschberger,residents of texas.all four were willing to travel to california and testify at trial plaintiffs identified other as potential witnesses who either resided in california or a state other than california or texas,and would have to travel in any event.
plaintiffs also argued that the vast majority of decedent medical providers would not be called as witnesses at trial.
plaintiffs concluded t he evidence before the court is that defendants have greatly overblown the spector sic of witness inconvenience in this action,and indeed no such witness inconvenience exists.
in reply,defendants represented that they would waive any defenses based on the applicable statutes of limitations in texas,and would waive any defenses based on personal or subject matter jurisdiction.they argued their motion was timely,that they had met their initial burden of establishing that california is an inconvenient forum,and that plaintiffs had shown only that a t best,four of the identified potential witnesses will not be inconvenienced by a trial in alameda.defendants argued that this case that has little real,if any,connection to the s tate of california and that this is a matter for texas and for texans.
in a detailed written ruling,the trial court denied the motion to dismiss,but granted the motion to stay.the trial court ruled that the motion was timely,and any delay in filing did not prejudice plaintiffs.the trial court went on to rule that texas was a suitable alternative forum because of defendants agreement to waive any defenses based on the statutes of limitation or jurisdiction,and that the balancing of the public and private interest factors set forth in stangvik,supra,cal d,d,weighed in favor of litigating this matter in texas.
the court stayed the california action to permit p laintiffs to their claims in texas.the court retained jurisdiction over the action only to allow for the highly unlikely situation where a defendant might assert a statute of limitations defense in texas.
as we discuss further below,the trial court denied a motion for reconsideration based on evidence that should have been included in the initial opposition to the motion but was not,and thus was not a proper basis for reconsideration.see new york times superior court th,d.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs contend the motion was untimely,to their prejudice the motion was procedurally defective and lacked the minimally required evidentiary showing the trial court should have denied the motion as a matter of law because plaintiffs seek damages for an injury which occurred in california when decedent was a resident of california and the trial court abused its discretion by granting the motion to stay because the stangvik public and private interest factors do not weigh heavily against california as the more convenient forum for this action.
timeliness 
as the trial court noted,defendants brought their motion one year after the case was filed in october,and nine months after receipt of the discovery responses in february that are the basis for the motion.but the court also noted,t here is no time limit for filing a motion to stay based on inconvenient forum.
plaintiffs argue that such a motion must be filed within a reasonable time after the last defendant has appeared in the action.but as authority for that proposition plaintiffs cite four cases dealing with motions for changes of venue,not motions for stay or dismissal for forum non conveniens 
in any case,the trial court found no prejudice to plaintiffs.while the motion could have,and should have,been brought sooner,there is no prejudice to p laintiffs in the delay because the case can be in texas and all d efendants have agreed to consent to jurisdiction in texas and that they will not assert the statute of limitations as a defense in texas.
plaintiffs dispute the finding,but rely largely on evidence brought to the trial court attention for the first time on a motion for reconsideration.through declarations of morris and one of plaintiffs counsel,plaintiffs argued that they and their counsel had invested a large amount of time and resources and plaintiffs were suffering serious financial could be alleviated by the minor plaintiffs speedy trial preference in california.code civ.
as noted above,the trial court denied reconsideration because of the failure to present this evidence in the initial opposition.the court noted it had already considered the question of delay,which is only about six months.in explaining its original ruling,the court reasoned that this delay must also be considered in light of p laintiffs decision to pursue the original case for months in texas,to wait almost months between when the texas case was dismissed and the california case was filed,and to assume the additional delay inherent in needing to all defendants in the california case.
it does not appear that the motion was untimely.in any event,any untimeliness did not prejudice plaintiffs.
procedural evidentiary showing 
in essence,plaintiffs argue that defendants failed to support their motion with sufficiently detailed affidavits,and thus have not made a minimal evidentiary showing to support their the trial court california is an inconvenient forum.plaintiffs appear to argue that defendants had to provide declarations regarding each of the,and perhaps the medical providers as well,listing their names,their anticipated testimony,reasons why the testimony would be admissible,whether the witness had been deposed,and why it would be inconvenient for the witness to travel to california.plaintiffs also claim that the declarations supporting the motion provide insufficient information.
plaintiffs rely primarily on cases,which do seem to require or at least recommend affidavits of factual particularity.plaintiffs also rely on ford motor insurance of north america th,d ford motor,which makes the general assertion that t here must be merely bald support the trial court determination that california is an inconvenient forum.id.at,d.but the sole authority in support of this statement is bechtel industrial indem.d,which said only that such a determination must be supported by substantial evidence.
plaintiffs present no authority for a requirement of particularized affidavits in forum non conveniens cases.we have found none.as another division of the first district recently stated stangvik did not require an extensive evidentiary showing.the principal evidentiary showing stangvik requires is that trial may be had in the alternative forum and that some form of relief may be granted examination of the private and public interests at stake involve more general considerations.campbell th,d see,hemmelgarn boeing d.court looks to general facts of case and general considerations under forum non conveniens factors,and makes both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis.
in other words,the evidence before the court,which may include affidavits of the parties,discovery responses,and the undisputed general knowledge of the nature of the action,need only be sufficient to give the court the ability to soundly exercise its discretion regarding the applicability of the general considerations of the stangvik,supra,cal d,d,factors to the question of forum non conveniens.the evidence in the present case is sufficient.that evidence includes discovery responses showing that the vast majority of almost witnesses identified by plaintiffs reside in texas,and the undisputed fact that decedent worked in texas for the vast majority of his career in commercial printing where chemical exposure allegedly took place.
effect of decedent california injury residency 
plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have denied the motion as a matter of law because plaintiffs seek damages for an injury which occurred in california when decedent was a resident of california.this argument was raised only in passing below.in any case,it is without merit.
plaintiffs base their argument on the premise that an action by a california resident for an injury occurring in california can not be stayed or dismissed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.we note at the outset that plaintiffs are not california residents.apart from that,we can not accept plaintiffs reasoning.
plaintiffs rely principally on archibald cinerama hotels cal d,archibald.but archibald held only that an action by a california resident can not be dismissed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens,except under exceptional circumstances.see century indemnity bank of america th,d century indemnity.
archibald explicitly acknowledged that an action by a california resident could be stayed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.archibald,supra,cal d at,see century indemnity,supra,th at,d.the trial court has considerably wider discretion to grant stays precisely because under a stay california retains jurisdiction.citation.even an action brought by a california resident is subject to a stay.citation.century indemnity,supra,at,d.
the trial court in the present case did not lack the authority to stay the action.the question now is whether the trial court ruling was proper on the merits.
the stangvik factors 
application of the stangvik factors involves a analysis.
in determining whether to grant a motion based on forum non conveniens,a court must first determine whether the alternate forum is a suitable place for trial.if it is,the next step is to consider the private interests of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining the action for trial in california.the private interest factors are those that make trial and the enforceability of the ensuing judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive,such as the ease of access to sources of proof,the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses,and the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses.the public interest factors include avoidance of overburdening local courts with congested calendars,protecting the interests of potential jurors so that they are not called upon to decide cases in which the local community has little concern,and weighing the competing interests of california and the alternate jurisdiction in the litigation.citations.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.
the ultimate question is whether the balancing of the stangvik factors shows that california is a seriously inconvenient forum.ford motor,supra,th at,d.the defendant,as moving party,bears the burden of proof.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.
the trial court first determination,whether there is a suitable alternative forum,is a nondiscretionary legal question subject to de novo review.american cemwood american home assurance th,d american cemwood chong superior court th,d chong see stangvik,supra,cal d at,fn,d.the second determination,the weighing of private and public factors,is discretionary and subject to review only for an abuse of we must accord substantial deference to the trial court balancing of the factors.stangvik,supra,at,d,american cemwood,supra,at,d chong,supra,at,d.
the availability of a suitable alternative forum for the action is critical.american cemwood,supra,th at,d.a forum is suitable if there is jurisdiction and no statute of limitations bar to the action.it is sufficient that the action can be brought,although not necessarily won,in the suitable alternative forum.id.at,d chong,supra,th at,d.
here the trial court found that texas was a suitable alternative forum.on de novo review,we agree with the trial court conclusion all defendants have agreed to consent to jurisdiction in texas and state that they will not assert the statute of limitations as a defense in texas.therefore,there is no bar to proceeding in texas.the trial court correctly relied on the judicial council comment to code of civil procedure section,quoted in stangvik,supra,cal d at page,d,which states that a forum is suitable if there is jurisdiction and a defense stipulation not to raise the defense of the statute of limitations in the alternative forum.
we now turn to an review of the trial court balancing of the stangvik factors.those factors have evolved over many years in california law,as described in pawlicki,stangvik shiley and forum non conveniens analysis does a fear of too much justice really close california courtrooms to foreign plaintiffs spring transnat l law,pawlicki 
we first note some general principles.a plaintiff choice of forum is entitled to great weight even though the plaintiff is a nonresident.ford motor,supra,th at,d accord,hansen fiberglas th,d hansen.but a plaintiff choice of forum can be disturbed if the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant.hansen,supra,at,d ford motor,supra,at,d.
the defendant residence is also a factor to be considered in the balancing process.a corporate defendant state of incorporation and principal place of business is presumptively a convenient forum.see stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.as noted,two of the corporate defendants in the present case are california corporations.but a resident defendant may overcome the presumption of convenience by evidence that the alternate jurisdiction is a more convenient place for trial of the action.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
the trial court must be flexible in its weighing of the factors.p rivate and public interest factors must be applied flexibly,without giving undue emphasis to any one element.stangvik,supra,cal d at,d.the doctrine of forum non conveniens may not be based on identification of a single factor rather than the balancing of several.citation,fn.omitted.
an undue emphasis on a single factor is especially threatening to a balanced analysis because some of the matters to be weighed will by their nature point to a grant or denial of the motion.for example,the jurisdiction interest in deterring future wrongful conduct of the defendant will usually favor retention of the action if the defendant is a resident of the forum,whereas the court congestion factor will usually weigh in favor of trial in the alternate jurisdiction.stangvik,supra,cal d at,fn,d.and the court must consider the public policy considerations such as california interest in deciding actions against resident corporations whose conduct in this state causes injury to persons in other jurisdictions.id.at,fn,d.
here the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that on balance,california is a seriously inconvenient forum.in weighing the private interest factors,the trial court noted that decedent employers from until his death years later are in texas,as are the vast majority of the witnesses concerning the decedent work history and medical care.in contrast only decedent employers from to were in california.they are now out of bu
