gregory and staci tober filed this action pursuant to indiana product liability act ipla,seeking recovery for the heartbreaking death of their son,trevor tober.following a trial,a jury rendered a verdict in favor of graco children products,incorporated graco,finding that the tobers had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that one of graco products,the lil napper plus battery powered swing lil napper model manufactured in by century products company century was defective.on appeal,the tobers contend that the district court erred in the exclusion of certain evidence at trial,in certain rulings the district court made as a matter of law prior to trial,and in how the district court instructed the jury.notwithstanding the tragic death from which this case arises,we agree with the district court rulings and,therefore,affirm.
background 
on the morning of april,staci tober dropped off her son,trevor,at timolyn fitzgerald suburban indianapolis home.fitzgerald owned and operated an unlicensed,daycare named precious angels daycare daycare.on that day,fitzgerald and her mother were caring for ten other children.
among the variety of children products in fitzgerald home was a lil napper.the lil napper swing consisted generally of an structure with a seat suspended from two bars.a motor sat atop the and moved the bars suspending the seat forward and backward in a swinging motion.
the lil napper swing came with a harness restraint system which was comprised of an strap that extended from the rear of the swing through two slots or channels near the top of the back of the seat.the two straps fit over each of the child shoulders to meet in a v between the child legs.at the end of the v was a buckle that secured the straps to the bottom of the swing seat between the child legs.the harness restraint system was also equipped with a strap slide which was positioned on the back side of the swing seat to anchor the straps firmly to the back of the seat.the strap slide allowed a caretaker to adjust the harness straps to fit infants of various sizes.the last component of this restraint system was a harness tie.the harness tie was threaded through the two harness straps and positioned on top of the infant chest.
century included an instruction manual with the lil napper swing that specifically addressed the proper use of the harness restraint system.century also placed warning labels on all lil napper swings,including fitzgerald,that stated,among other things,the following 
never leave child unattended 
always keep child in view even while sleeping 
stay within reach of your child.
the instruction manual stated that failure to use the restraint system properly may result in the baby falling from the swing.there was no mention of any potential risk of entanglement or strangulation.fitzgerald testified at trial that she bought the lil napper swing new in and that it was fully and properly assembled at the time of purchase,except for portions of the legs which she installed herself.fitzgerald testified that she did not read the instruction manual or the warning labels affixed to the infant swing because she felt she could operate the swing without reading any of the materials that came with the swing.
by,century had received four reports of children who were either injured or killed after becoming entangled in the lil napper harness straps.century investigated each of these accidents and discovered that each had occurred because the lil napper had not been used according to the instructions.specifically,the caregivers in each situation had applied the harness straps too loosely while leaving the infant unattended in the swing.based on this potential hazard from misuse,century voluntarily recalled the lil napper swing in.century notified owners of the lil napper that it would retrofit the swings with new seat pads and provide a combination harness to substitute for the harness.the consumer product safety commission cpsc or commission approved century voluntary recall program.
on the morning of april,fitzgerald fed trevor breakfast and put him in the lil napper swing where he usually took a morning nap.while trevor was in the swing,fitzgerald turned her attention to the other children at the daycare.fitzgerald kept trevor in her sight while she fixed breakfast for the other children,but left trevor alone while she went downstairs with her mother to deliver breakfast to the children when fitzgerald returned upstairs,she found trevor hanging from the swing with the harness straps wrapped around his neck.fitzgerald untangled trevor,called,and started cpr.emergency personnel arrived and took trevor to the hospital where he later died from asphyxia.
on the day of the accident,police crime lab experts inspected the daycare and the condition of the lil napper swing.the officer in charge of the investigation testified that the harness straps of the swing had been tied together in a fixed knot behind the back of the seat which made the harness straps of the swing impossible to tighten and properly fit trevor.the officer also testified that the harness restraint of the lil napper had been through the wrong slot in the back of the seat.
after trevor death,the tobers filed a civil suit in state court against fitzgerald,daycare,and graco.the tobers eventually settled with fitzgerald and her daycare,and graco removed the case to federal court.in their complaint,the tobers alleged that graco negligently designed the swing,failed to include appropriate warnings with the swing,and failed to correct the defect,warn of the danger and adequately recall the swing.a jury thought otherwise and returned a verdict in favor of graco.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
evidentiary ruling 
at trial,the tobers sought to introduce a letter dated october,from the cpsc to century.in the letter,cpsc informed century of its preliminary determination that the lil napper infant swings

we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the letter.first,cpsc letter does not indicate that the commission conclusively determined that the lil napper was defective.to the contrary,cpsc made only a preliminary determination that the swing presented a substantial risk of injury if not used properly.second,the letter does not mandate any corrective action beyond that already voluntarily underway.the commission acknowledge d and encourage d the actions which century products ha d already taken to correct the problem and accepted century plan as adequate.finally,the tobers argument that the failure to respond constitutes an adoptive admission is further undermined by the letter itself,which states that a firm taking corrective action does not constitute admission by the firm that a substantial product hazard exists.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that,particularly in light of these representations in the letter,failure to
