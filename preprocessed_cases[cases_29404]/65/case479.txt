in this asbestos case,plaintiffs james shiffer and his wife sued cbs corporation,whose predecessor,westinghouse,provided a turbine set and insulation for a power plant where shiffer worked for several months in and.the trial court granted summary judgment to cbs.we affirm.plaintiffs failed to produce evidence raising a triable issue that shiffer suffered bystander exposure to westinghouse asbestos while at the plant.the trial court also properly denied plaintiffs motions for reconsideration and a new trial,because evidence of potential harm from of asbestos was not new and could have been presented in opposition to the original summary judgment motion.
background 
plaintiffs sued numerous entities that allegedly caused shiffer to be exposed to asbestos,eventually resulting in his developing mesothelioma.as to defendant cbs,they alleged shiffer was exposed to materials at the ginna power plant in rochester,new york in the summer of.shiffer then employer,pacific gas electric,had sent him to ginna in july of that year to train employees on the operation of westinghouse equipment being installed in the plant.
westinghouse had sold ginna a turbine generator set and insulation,including blanket,block,and plastic insulation for the turbine and certain related piping,namely and piping.westinghouse began shipping the equipment in july of,a year before shiffer arrived.installation took place during and.cbs person most knowledgeable for the case,douglas ware,conceded at his deposition that the blanket,block,and plastic insulation,including that used on and piping,contained asbestos.
reports,each labeled field report,westinghouse form and steam service department,recorded progress on the installation.with respect to the insulation work,these reports stated the following during the week of may,insulators were on strike and the turbine cylinder and pipes were not yet insulated.by the week of june,a team of insulators was back on the job.insulators continued work on the turbine cylinder and pipes through the weeks of june,july,july,and july.but as of june before shiffer arrived in july the turbine had been hot functional and the main,inch thick layer of insulation would have been in place.during the week of july,work continued on the insulation of,crossover and crossunder piping,drains,and glands.as the project entered the week of august,insulators were near completion of insulation of the and piping.the final report in the record,for the week of august,suggests insulation was still incomplete,stating due to job conditions,only two insulators are working on the turbine contract.
at his september deposition,shiffer testified when he arrived at ginna in july of,all of the major components in the plant were installed but there was the last stages of construction going on.his recollection was that the turbine insulation specifically was already put on.as he would wander around the plant there was a small amount of insulation.it would have been piping insulation but the main turbine insulation or steam line insulation was already installed.he then reiterated the turbine and its insulation were already installed.and again the exchanges were insulated prior to my arrival the main steam lines were already insulated,though he saw drains and smaller auxiliary lines getting insulated.although shiffer observed these things while walking the plant,his workstation was in another building,separate from the turbine building.
plaintiffs took ware deposition six months later,on march,and ware,as noted,conceded the presence of asbestos in the and pipe insulation.there is nothing from ware,however,about the nature of the insulation of any other kinds of pipes.ware took no issue with the installation progress revealed in the westinghouse progress reports.
shiffer then filed a declaration dated march,nearly two weeks after ware deposition in opposition to cbs motion for summary judgment.in it,shiffer was far less specific about his observations than he had been during his deposition six months earlier.shiffer stated that when he arrived at ginna in july,construction was still in progress,including insulators insulating piping in the turbine building.he further declared he had to enter the turbine building almost every day to educate himself about the plant to better conduct his training work.
there is no dispute shiffer did not repair or maintain any westinghouse equipment,and did not install or remove any insulation material himself.nor is there any dispute that no insulation was removed or disturbed during shiffer time at ginna.
plaintiffs expert,charles ay,declared the installation of piping insulation containing asbestos creates large amounts of respirable asbestos dust as the material is cut,manipulated,and handled.ay further opined,based on his training,education and experience,the insulation work documented on the westinghouse forms would have created magnitudes of dust throughout the work area.the trial court excluded this latter statement on objection it was vague and speculative.though ay reviewed other discovery materials,he admittedly did not review shiffer deposition testimony or his declaration.
another of plaintiffs experts,christopher depasquale,considered shiffer declaration in which shiffer stated he had observed construction at ginna,including the insulation of piping in the turbine building,and had spent time in this area while educating himself and conducting training.assuming insulation work continued into august,as documented by the westinghouse work reports,depasquale opined shiffer was exposed to hazardous levels of respiratory asbestos as a bystander.the trial court excluded this opinion on objections that it lacked foundation.though despasquale reviewed shiffer declaration,he did not review his deposition testimony.
plaintiffs also submitted the declaration of barry horn,a medical doctor who had examined shiffer.according to horn,shiffer exposure from the continuing work on the turbines at the ginna plant while he was present in the facility,including the insulation on the westinghouse equipment was a substantial contributing factor to the total aggregate dose of shiffer asbestos exposure.horn further opined e ach and every exposure to asbestos experienced by a person with mesothelioma is a substantial contributing factor in the development of the disease.horn reviewed shiffer summary judgment declaration,but like depasquale and ay,did not consider shiffer deposition testimony.the trial court did not rely upon and did not address the admissibility of horn declaration.
in its written order granting summary judgment to cbs,the trial court stated shiffer failed to submit evidence he was exposed to products or materials.it subsequently denied plaintiffs motions for reconsideration and a new trial.
discussion 
initial grant of summary judgment 
on an appeal from an order granting summary judgment,we independently examine the record to determine whether there are any triable issues of material fact.citation.in performing our review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the losing parties,resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in their favor.mcgonnell kaiser gypsum,th,d mcgonnell.
a threshold issue in asbestos litigation is exposure to the defendant product if there has been no exposure,there is no causation.mcgonnell,supra,th at plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that exposure to asbestos products was,in reasonable medical probability,a substantial factor in causing or contributing to the risk of developing cancer.rutherford owens illinois,cal th,d.factors relevant to assessing whether such a medical probability exists include frequency of exposure,regularity of exposure and proximity of the asbestos product citation.therefore,plaintiffs can not prevail without evidence of exposure to materials manufactured or furnished by a defendant with enough frequency and regularity as to show a reasonable medical probability that this exposure was a factor in causing the plaintiff injuries.citations.while there are many possible causes of any injury,a possible cause only becomes probable when,in the absence of other r
