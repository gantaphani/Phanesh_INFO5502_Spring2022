chrysler corporation chrysler,appeals a jury verdict rendered against it for in compensatory and in punitive damages in a product liability action brought by,dorothy clark,individually and as administratrix of the estate of charles clark charles or clark,her deceased husband.it argues,in this lawsuit growing out of a car crash in which clark was killed,that the judgment for clark should be reversed and judgment entered in its favor because she failed to produce legally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find causation and impose punitive damages or,in the alternative,it should be granted a new trial because a the testimony of clark expert witnesses was unreliable and should have been excluded by the trial court under fed evid.for failure to conduct tests of the allegedly defective product or of alternative designs that could have prevented the decedent injuries and death,b the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that compliance with federal safety standards should be considered merely as one piece of evidence on the issues in this case,rather than instructing it as required by the kentucky revised statute krs that compliance with federal safety standards created a presumption that the product,a dodge ram truck,was not defective,and c the trial court erroneously allowed clark expert to testify regarding other alleged incidents as evidence that the product was defective without establishing that the incidents involved were substantially similar to the incident in this case.for the reasons discussed herein,the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
charles clark,an owner of a small construction company,was fatally injured on october,in an automobile accident when he and his two nephews,freddy clark freddy and billy clark billy,left a job site in gray,kentucky,to obtain lunch.clark,who was driving his dodge ram club cab pickup on kentucky highway with freddy in the front seat and billy in the back seat,stopped at the intersection of highway and interstate route.as clark began to make a left turn onto route,his truck was hit by a kentucky state police cruiser driven by alfred barnett officer barnett approaching from his left.officer barnett testified that he was traveling miles per hour when he saw clark pull into the intersection.officer barnett applied his brakes and turned his wheels to the left in an effort to avoid the truck.however,he was not able to do so,and the right fender of his vehicle struck the truck left front fender.the vehicles collided in such a way that they rotated,causing them to side slap after impact.clark truck continued to rotate in a clockwise position while officer barnett cruiser,traveling south at the time of impact,continued left across two northbound lanes of traffic,coming to rest after hitting a dirt embankment feet away.during the course of the accident,charles clark,who was not wearing a seat belt,was ejected from his vehicle and thrown into the grass median.he died six hours later at the university of kentucky hospital as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.the coroner determined that the cause of death was due to cardiorespiratory arrest and blunt force injury to the thorax growing out of a motor vehicle collision.neither of clark nephews was ejected.they were not wearing seat belts at the time of the accident.officer barnett,who was wearing a seat belt,and the dog that was traveling in the cruiser with him,were not seriously injured.the only injury officer barnett testified to was a laceration to his right forearm.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction over the case.after a trial,the jury rendered a unanimous verdict on october.the jury found in favor of clark on claims of strict liability,negligence and failure to warn.it stated in answer to interrogatories 
the dodge ram pickup truck in question was defective and unreasonably dangerous for use by charles clark,and that such defect or defects was a substantial factor in causing charles clark injuries and death.
chrysler corporation failed to exercise ordinary care in the design,testing,manufacturing or marketing of the dodge ram pickup truck in question,and that such failure was a substantial factor in causing charles clark injuries and death.
chrysler corporation failed to use reasonable care to provide adequate warning of potential dangers associated with the dodge ram pickup truck in question and that such failure to warn was a substantial factor in causing charles clark injuries and death.
the jury found that both chrysler and charles clark were each at fault.it returned a verdict of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.thereafter,the court entered judgment against chrysler for,which reflected of the compensatory damages plus the total amount of the punitive damages found by the jury.after trial,chrysler renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law which the court had denied at the end of clark case and also filed a motion for a new trial.the court denied both motions.
chrysler argues that the trial court should have excluded the testimony of clark experts,billy peterson,a latch expert,and andrew gilberg,a and accident reconstruction expert,because they did not perform any testing relative to the accident in suit.we review the decision of a district court to admit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion.general joiner,d.deference to the decision of the trial court is the hallmark of review.id.at.giving the ruling of the trial judge the broad range of discretion to which it is entitled,this court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case.
in determining whether to admit expert testimony,the trial court must decide whether an expert testimony is both relevant and reliable.clay ford motor,cir.chrysler challenge herein does not go to the relevance of the testimony given by clark experts but to its reliability.in making this determination,the supreme court confirmed in kumho tire,carmichael,d,that the gatekeeping function which the supreme court enunciated in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,applies not just to scientific evidence but to all expert testimony,including testimony based on technical and other specialized knowledge.kumho tire,at.the court also indicated that the factors which it set forth in daubert as being pertinent to whether scientific evidence should be admitted,testing,peer review and publication,potential rate of error,and general acceptance in the relevant community,may be considered by the trial court in regard to proffered expert testimony.id.however,the court explained that whether these factors are reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter that the law grants the trial judge broad latitude to determine.id.at.
at trial,chrysler filed a motion in limine regarding the testimony of both of clark experts.in support of its motion in limine seeking to exclude gilberg testimony,chrysler argued that gilberg opinions were not based on independent scientific tests that he had conducted and that he did not produce any test results on which he based his opinions.the trial court denied the motion,stating 
gilberg used a scientific method previously in testing door latches.even though he did do it in this particular case,he can speak to these latches because he has previously tested similar latches.and the differences between those latches can be examined on those differences are not a reason to grant a daubert motion.
joint appendix ja at.the court stated further 
his opinion is based upon his own physical examination of the latches here at issue and upon his conducting of his own testing.
h is knowledge is based upon his own testimony and assists the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.and so i going to let it in.
daubert goes on to talk about acceptance of others in the field and other methods of establishing reliability.and i satisfied that with his own testimony,that all taken care of.
chrysler also argued in its motion in limine that the testimony of peterson regarding should be excluded because he only conducted a physical examination of the and did not do any testing himself.prior to ruling on the motion,the court summarized peterson testimony as follows 
y our peterson will testify about pillars in general,particularly b pillars,and will compare the ram b pillar with the b pillars of contemporary chevrolet,ford,nissan and toyota pickup trucks.peterson will discuss b pillars in the concept of design structure and materials and deformation principles,which are basic principles of mechanical engineering.he will testify that horizontal rotation of b pillar and door latch striker is a well recognized failure of a latch system in side impact accidents.
ja at.thereafter,noting that daubert does not require an expert to come in and actually perform tests in any given situation,the court concluded that this testimony should not be precluded merely because peterson had not performed testing in the case.the court found peterson opinions based on his examination of the to be sufficiently reliable because they were based on his training as a mechanical engineer and his experience as a safety standards engineer with the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa.he was therefore permitted to render an opinion at trial on how the door came open and that the latch was defective.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing gilberg to testify at trial.the bases for gilberg testimony and opinions are clearly reliable.first,gilberg demonstrated thorough knowledge of automobile door latch systems.gilberg received an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from rensselaer polytechnic institute and a masters of science degree in mechanical engineering from the university of michigan.he worked for ford motor company for six years in the area of safety research beginning in.he later worked for a period with versatech,a consulting company,doing,among other things,accident investigations for insurance companies,attorneys,the automobile industry and local governments.in this capacity,he looked at how vehicles acted and held up in accidents and was sometimes involved in reconstructions of accidents.ja at.eventually,gilberg came to study the ejection of occupants from vehicles,including how and why ejections happen.in,he began analyzing cases involving door latch failures.at the time of trial,he was employed by his own company and had been involved in testing door latches for strength and how they failed for twelve years.at that point,almost all of gilberg work dealt with door latches and door latch systems he had done approximately cases of this type by the time of trial.
second,gilberg has done extensive testing on door latches,and in particular,testing of bypass failure,which is what he maintains caused the door of the dodge ram pickup to open in this case,ejecting clark.for example,gilberg has designed a number of fixtures to test door latches.one of gilberg tests was specifically designed to test bypass failure.this test has been used by the nhtsa.the fact that he did not do any specific testing in this case goes to the weight of his testimony and not to its admissibility.see clay,at.
third,gilberg testimony at trial demonstrates that he was familiar with the chrysler k latch,the type found on the dodge ram which was involved in the accident,and which was the primary door latch used by chrysler for a period of to years,beginning in.he explained that the chrysler k latch had two basic elements,called a ratchet and a pawl,that work together to hold the door closed.gilberg described the ratchet as a pivoting arm that grasps a striker a bolt sticking out of the at the rear opening of the door and holds the door closed.the pawl is a detent lever with a little tooth,which drags down and holds the ratchet in a closed position.ja at.in other words,when the striker on the frame moves into the latch on the door,the pawl drops down to hold the ratchet closed.when the handle is pulled,the pawl is lifted,releasing the striker and opening the door.normally,the only way the door should open is when the inside or outside handle lifts the pawl.bypass failure occurs when the ratchet and pawl are out of alignment with each other.when this happens,they slide by each other.
fourth,gilberg examined the latch in this case twice.he also examined other k latches identical to the one on clark dodge ram which had been involved in accidents.during his testimony,he emphasized there was not much damage to the frame of the door,even where the collision occurred,or to the area of the truck where the screws hold the latch onto the door.there was,however,significant damage to the,which was twisted and rotated outward.likewise,the striker,which would normally point forward,had been turned outward.gilberg further testified that his examination of the latch revealed several indications that bypass failure had occurred in this case.specifically,he pointed to the denting in the back of the latch opening where the striker was forced and a nick on the ratchet caused by the fork bolt getting hooked on the corner of the pawl.this indicated to him that the ratchet and the pawl were out of alignment and just at the end a little bit of metal was clipped off.ja at.according to gilberg,this meant that if you lift that pawl,particularly with enough force to bottom it out here to make a nick,you have released the latch.ja at.as to the other k latches gilberg examined,he testified that at least four had failed in an identical manner to the one in this lawsuit and,in total,had resulted in five ejections.he further indicated that the five bypass cases he had seen occurred within the last five or six years prior to suit.
fifth,gilberg testimony at trial demonstrates that he had extensive technical knowledge on the type of bypass failure testing that was performed on chrysler k latches manufactured at the time of the accident,and specifically,on the inadequacies of such testing.he testified that the concept of latch bypass failure has been known in the industry since this type of latch was introduced.he stated that the latch itself was designed to resist the forces described by the federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss.those safety standards require automobiles to demonstrate,through a machine test which rigidly holds the latch in one jaw and the striker in the other,that they can not be pulled apart up to a certain amount of pressure.ja at.according to gilberg testimony,there are significant problems with this test in that the latch and striker are not allowed to move around relative to each other as they do in a car body.for example,they are not allowed to twist,making the latch appear stronger than it actually is.thus,the test does not accurately relate how the latch will perform in an accident.
gilberg testified that another problem with the test is that it requires force to be applied in only two the way the car travels and in a burst direction to the door,in an effort to shear the lock off.although gilberg testified that the chrysler k latch did not perform poorly on these two tests,he explained that latches are almost never subjected to pure longitudinal or pure shear force during a crash.rather,the force applied to the latch is usually a combination of not only these forces,but force as well.
the reliability of gilberg testimony as to this issue is substantiated by the fact that in,the national highway traffic safety administrator posted a notice in the federal register indicating its desire to change the testing procedure for latches to make it more reflective of the kind of stress latches undergo in an accident 
finally,gilberg testimony at trial regarding and in door latches at the time the dodge ram was manufactured also demonstrates that his opinions were reliable.specifically,he testified that the latch in the dodge ram pickup was not or.he noted that the hinges on the door were not damaged and that there was no technical challenge to making the door latch as strong as the hinges.indicating that the overall problem was a systems problem,and not just a latch problem,he explained that the strength of the latch could have been increased by stiffening up the mounting or moving the mounting points or screws closer together so they could bracket the area where the ratchet and pawl meet.this would have made the latch more resistant to prying without adding weight.another method that could have been used to make the latch stronger would have been to utilize a ratchet which bracketed both sides of the detent lever so that the pawl tooth was inside the ratchet and could not move sideways.he described several examples in the industry that were at the time clark dodge ram was manufactured,including a pin and cone system,which has a pin sticking out of the body that mates with a hole in the latch to help reinforce the latch.gilberg testified that it was his opinion,to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty,that a latch would not have allowed the door on the dodge ram to open.
for these reasons,the trial court did not err in allowing gilberg to testify at trial.gilberg opinion that the dodge ram k latch system was defective and that it was unreasonably dangerous was based on his technical knowledge with respect to automobile door latch systems,his extensive testing of door latch bypass failure,his familiarity with the chrysler k latch,his examination of the latch in this case as well as other k latches identical to the one involved in this lawsuit,his technical knowledge as to the type of bypass failure testing that was performed on chrysler k latches manufactured at the time of the accident,as well as the fact that a door latch probably would have prevented clark ejection.the court therefore agrees with the trial court that under daubert,there was a sufficiently reliable foundation for gilberg testimony.
the trial court also did not err in denying chrysler motion in limine with respect to plaintiffs other expert,peterson.peterson was hired to testify as an expert on why the door on clark truck came open and on accident reconstruction.like gilberg,there was a sufficiently reliable basis for peterson testimony at trial.
as the trial court found,the fact that peterson only conducted a physical examination of the and did not do any testing himself does not render his testimony unreliable.clay,at.first,peterson testimony as to the cause of the door opening was based on his extensive background in automobile safety testing.peterson graduated from north carolina state with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in.after working a short period with the army at aberdeen proving grounds in the automotive division,he worked in aerospace at nasa and sperry rand for seven years.in,he began a stint with the nhtsa,the department of transportation entity responsible for establishing the rules and standards automobile manufacturers have to comply with in the united states.at the nhtsa,peterson was a safety standards engineer responsible for writing standards to apply to vehicles.during this period,he also set up a small test facility in atlantic city,where nhtsa did testing,research and development.there he was involved in testing of various kinds,including side impact testing and rear impact testing.in,he transferred to the transportation research center of ohio,another nhtsa facility,to create a research,development,and testing arm of the center.he was a division chief in charge of project engineering and was involved in a substantial amount of testing for defects in vehicles.his work with this group also included research on barrier tests for the nhtsa research and development group in washington.
in,peterson established automobile safety testing,incorporated.for the first six or seven years of the company existence,it did consulting work for manufacturers,including chrysler,performing various types of tests.even after peterson started his company,he continued to consult with transportation research center of ohio for six years.eventually,the company began doing less work for manufacturers than previously and became more involved in litigation.
peterson testified that through his work with the nhtsa and at automobile safety testing,he has been involved in hundreds of crash tests.some of the side impact crash tests he worked on involved evaluating door latches.most of the crash tests were run with dummies so that peterson and others could study occupant kinematics,how the dummy moved if it hit anything,and the extent to which it would have been injured if it were a human.occasionally,these tests would be run with the occupant unrestrained.
second,peterson opinions and his testimony in the case were based in part on his examination of clark truck,the accident scene,the police report,the photographs and the depositions in the case.he originally examined the truck in kentucky but then brought it back to his facility in ohio for more inspection.although he was not able to actually view the police car,he studied photographs of it.
based on his examination of the truck as well as his extensive knowledge of automobile safety testing,peterson explained the structure to which the door attached when it closed was called the.he described the as the skeleton of the vehicle and noted that pillars are usually reinforced to act as a structure.according to peterson,one of the most efficient and easiest ways to make a structure is to make a box of sheet metal by forming a square and spot welding it.however,he described the in this case as being little more than the sheet metal body of the vehicle.it is very lightly reinforced sheet metal which,for the most part,has not been formed into a box.he described the metal as a low alloy steel which is high strength in tension,when it is grabbed on either side and pulled,but is not very strong in bending or shear.peterson testified that in his opinion,the involved in this case was defective at the time the vehicle was made and assembled in.he noted that after the accident,the striker which should be directly parallel to the center line of the vehicle it pointed out at an angle to that direction.ja at.he described the as being bowed outward.
third,peterson testimony at trial regarding the in at the time the dodge ram was manufactured also demonstrates that his testimony and opinions were reliable.at trial,peterson testified about how other vehicles at the time the dodge ram was manufactured,including a toyota pickup,a nissan,and a ford,had boxed that is,the was boxed and reinforced in the area of the striker.analyzing a of the type used in the chrysler pickup involved in the accident,peterson noted that it did not utilize the box within a box design as in the other vehicles.although the in clark truck did have some boxing from the bottom of the window up,the boxing did not begin until considerably above the striker.peterson testified that the in clark truck was twisted out at the place where the latch striker plate is attached.according to him,the latch failed because there was nothing below the window to prevent the from twisting out.peterson testified that the latch on the dodge ram was clearly not to the contrary,it was probably years out of date.he further testified that he had never seen a that was a single piece of sheet metal like the one in the dodge ram.he concluded that the was defectively designed and that boxing would have prevented the.
finally,peterson testimony was based in part on general acceptance in the automobile industry regarding testing at the time the dodge ram was manufactured.peterson indicated that though was a known failure mode in the automobile industry,he had never seen one to the extent of the one involved in this lawsuit.he noted that in,general motors submitted a test procedure to nhtsa for informational purposes.the procedure was also made available to other automobile manufactures,including chrysler.despite its awareness that general motors was testing its for,chrysler did not choose to test its latches for failure.
for these reasons,chrysler motion in limine to exclude peterson was properly denied by the trial court.peterson opinions were based on his extensive background in automobile safety testing his examination of clark truck,the accident scene,the police report,the photographs and the depositions in the case the and industry in and general acceptance in the automobile industry regarding testing at the time the dodge ram was manufactured.the court therefore agrees with the trial court that under daubert,there was a sufficiently reliable foundation for peterson testimony.
chrysler also argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court permitted gilberg to testify regarding four other alleged incidents as proof that the dodge ram door latch was defective,even though there was no showing that the other incidents involved circumstances substantially similar to those surrounding clark accident.
in order for evidence of prior accidents to be admissible,the prior accidents must be substantially similar to the accident in suit.rye black decker,cir.substantially similar means that the accidents must have occurred under similar circumstances or share the same cause.id.at.in reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence concerning accidents or incidents,this court applies an abuse of discretion standard.in making this determination,the trial court decision is to be given great latitude and it can not be reversed unless there is a strong showing of abuse.id.upon review,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing gilberg to testify about the four prior chrysler k latch failures.
the testimony to which chrysler objects occurred during the direct examination of gilberg concerning why the test required by fmvss did not realistically represent what was likely to happen in a side impact accident.during this portion of his direct examination,gilberg testified that fmvss 
is a test of either the shear strength or the tensile strength of the latch.this latch,the latches almost could even say in a crash a latch is almost never put in a pure tension or a pure shear.it either a combination of both,usually there is a force acting on the latch as well.
ja at.gilberg indicated that from his examination of the dodge ram latch,he could tell that it was subjected to a force.counsel thereafter sought to elicit testimony from gilberg regarding his examination of chrysler k latches in other accidents.chrysler counsel objected on the ground of relevance,and the following colloquy took place at side bar 
sutter defendant counsel he never seen an ejection in this type of vehicle.he has seen ejections in other vehicles,other makes and other models.none in a damaged club cab.
the court where are you going with this 
hay plaintiff counsel your honor,he he got five other latches.
the court five k latches 
hay pardon me 
the court five k latches 
hay oh,yes,had the same failure.
sutter in other vehicles,in other accidents.
the court that cross examination.overruled.
thereafter,gilberg testified that he had examined other k latches identical to the one involved in the lawsuit and that four of them had failed in a manner identical to the latch involved in the lawsuit,resulting in five persons being ejected.ja at.he indicated that these latches had failed in the five or six years prior to trial and that they involved bypass failure of the locks just as the lock involved in the clark accident did.
it is clear that the purpose of gilberg testimony about the four recent instances where he had seen the k latch suffer a bypass failure was to further demonstrate that door latches failed in ways that were not measured by fmvss.his expertise taught him that these bypass failures were a result of the vehicles involved being subjected to a twisting or prying load,as in the accident in suit.from the context of gilberg testimony,it is evident that the prior accidents shared the same cause as clark accident.gilberg testimony clearly demonstrated that he could tell by looking at a door latch whether or not the latch had been subjected to a force or prying load during an accident.because gilberg could tell that the latches in the prior accidents as well as the latch in the accident in suit had all been subjected to a force and not just a tensile shear force.
although the fact that the accidents shared the same cause would have been enough to support the trial court conclusion that gilberg testimony should be admitted,the testimony also could have been admitted on the basis that clark accident involved similar circumstances as the prior accidents.in order to prove that an accident occurred under similar circumstances,it is not necessary to prove,as chrysler argues,that the prior accidents involved a vehicle identical to the one driven by clark or that all of the circumstances of the accidents are identical.as the tenth circuit noted in smith,cir 
the substantial similarity rule does not require identical products nor does it require us to compare the products in their entireties.the rule requires substantial similarity among the variables relevant to the plaintiff theory of defect.
id.at.in this case,all of the incidents gilberg testified to involved failure of the k latch in accidents involving chrysler vehicles.particularly in light of testimony in the case that officer barnett cruiser hit clark truck at a relatively low impact,most likely at a lower,or at most,the same,impact than the prior accidents,the trial court would have been justified in concluding that the circumstances of the prior accidents were sufficiently similar to the accident in this case to allow gilberg testimony.
giving the trial judge the latitude required by the abuse of discretion standard,we find that she did not abuse her discretion in allowing gilberg testimony on the four prior accidents and requiring chrysler to show on such dissimilarities between the accidents as it wished.
chrysler lastly argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court erroneously failed to give a jury instruction that chrysler compliance with fmvss created a presumption that the dodge ram pickup truck was not defective.instead of such an instruction,the trial court gave the following instruction 
you have heard testimony that the door latch and hardware of the dodge ram pickup truck complied with federal motor vehicle safety standard.compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standard does not exempt chrysler corporation from any liability you may find.this standard should be considered by you merely as one piece of evidence on the issues in this case.the application of the standard to the facts of the case is solely for you to determine,as is the weight to be given the standard in determining the issues.
this court reviews a district court refusal to give requested jury instructions under an abuse of discretion standard.see buziashvili inman,cir.we review jury instructions as a whole in order to determine whether the instructions adequately inform the jury of relevant considerations and provide a basis in law for aiding the jury to reach its decision.hisrich volvo cars of,cir citation omitted.
to support its argument that chrysler compliance with fmvss created a presumption that the dodge ram pickup truck was not defective,chrysler cites kentucky revised statutes krs,which states 
in any product liability action,it shall be presumed,until rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary,that the product was not defective if the design,methods of manufacture,and testing conformed to the generally recognized and prevailing standards or the state of the art in existence at the time the design was prepared,and the product was manufactured.
chrysler acknowledges that the kentucky supreme court has not addressed the issue of whether the presumption embodied in krs requires a jury instruction.see fiberglas golightly,refusing to address the issue because it had not been presented for appellate review.it nevertheless argues that pursuant to krs,it was entitled to its requested instruction.
on review,the court finds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the instruction requested by chrysler.the fourth circuit,in applying krs in a product liability action against a helmet manufacturer,found that no such jury instruction was required.in sexton bell helmets,cir,the parties agreed that at the time the helmet was designed and manufactured,there were three industry standards which existed pertaining to the manufacturing of helmets.the parties also agreed that the helmet at issue complied with each of the standards.after substantial evidence was presented that the product was defective,the trial court concluded that the presumption was no longer a matter to be considered.the trial court,therefore,sent the case to the jury without any instruction regarding the presumption set forth in krs.the court of appeals agreed that this was proper,stating 
i f the plaintiff fails to present substantial evidence to prove his case that a product was defective,the court will direct the verdict if the plaintiff presents substantial evidence that carries him over the directed verdict threshold,the evidence will take the case to the jury and,at the same time,overcome the presumption created by the statute.the standard for rebutting the presumption under the statute,by introduction of evidence that shows a defect by a preponderance of the evidence is the same as that which makes out a prima facie case for the plaintiff.
id.indeed,the court noted that it could perceive no reason why the trial court would ever have to instruct on this statutory presumption.id.having burst the bubble by the introduction of evidence of product defect,the plaintiff was entitled to have the question decided on the evidence and the presumption of krs was no longer applicable.
the fourth circuit opinion in sexton is in accord with the manner in which presumptions are generally handled in civil cases in kentucky,where juries are not normally instructed in regard to presumptions except in a narrow set of circumstances.id.as the kentucky supreme court stated in meyers chapman printing,i n kentucky jury instructions do not include evidentiary presumptions.the court clarified the purpose of such presumptions,explaining that they 
alter the burden of going forward with the evidence,and thus may result in a directed verdict in the absence of countervailing evidence.however,the jury instructions should be framed only to state what the jury must believe from the evidence in order to return a verdict in favor of the party who bears the burden of proof.
id.the chapman court also described the kentucky approach to jury instructions as not to provide detail,but only to provide the bare bones of the question for jury determination.id.
the decision by the kentucky court of appeals in leslie cincinnati products,further supports the conclusion that the trial court did not err in not giving a jury instruction that chrysler compliance with fmvss created a presumption that the dodge ram pickup truck was not defective.in leslie,the appellate court overruled the trial court granting of the defendant summary judgment motion,where the defendant had relied on the presumptions in krs.in doing so,the court stated,t he statutory presumptions of krs do no more than leave the burden of proof with plaintiff to prove that the product was defective.id.
for the reasons,this court finds that the kentucky supreme court is unlikely to conclude that a jury instruction on the presumption established in krs is necessary.therefore,because the instruction given by the court adequately informed the jury of the relevant considerations and provided the jury a basis in law for reaching its decision,the trial judge did not err in failing to give the instruction requested by chrysler.
chrysler also argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant its motion for judgment as a matter of law,both in regard to clark claim for compensatory damages and her claim for punitive damages.the court will first address chrysler arguments in regard to compensatory damages.
to support its motion for judgment as a matter of law with regard to compensatory damages,chrysler maintains that clark failed to establish the cause of clark death.specifically,chrysler argues that there was insufficient evidence presented to support a jury finding that clark ejection from the vehicle caused his death rather than,for example,injuries he sustained inside the vehicle.inasmuch as the court has already determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to bar testimony of clark experts under.or in admitting testimony regarding other accidents,the court will consider chrysler arguments with respect to its motion in light of all of the evidence in the record.
in a diversity case,the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law based on sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed under the law of the state whose substantive law governs,which in this case is kentucky.see morales honda motor,cir.under kentucky law,a motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted only if there is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action,or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable minds could differ.id.citing washington goodman.in the determination of such a motion,every favorable inference which may reasonably be drawn from the evidence should be accorded the party against whom the motion is made.id.
kentucky has adopted of the restatement second,of torts,which imposes liability on product manufacturers upon a showing that the product is in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.under kentucky law,a defect can be said to be the cause of an injury or death if it is a substantial factor in bringing about the injury or death.deutsch shein.at trial,clark sought to establish that clark injuries and death were caused by a defective door latch on the dodge ram pickup that he was driving at the time of his death.on review of the trial record,we find that there was evidence in the record from which the jury could have concluded that the dodge ram defective door latch was a substantial factor in bringing about clark death.
specifically,clark offered testimony to establish that the accident did not occur at high impact and that clark would not have been seriously injured or killed had his door latch not failed and he not been ejected from the truck.the fact that neither of clark nephews was ejected and that neither suffered any serious injuries supports this theory.freddy,who was sitting in the front passenger seat at the time of the accident,testified that the accident stoved my neck up a little bit,but it did hurt me that bad.ja at.billy,sitting in the back seat,was seen in the emergency room,where he was given tylenol and sent home.likewise,officer barnett and the dog that was traveling in the cruiser with him were not seriously injured.
officer barnett testimony at trial that the collision between the two vehicles was simply a glancing blow lent further support to clark position.ja at.the investigating police officer,gary martin,also described the collision as a glancing blow and noted that it was not a direct degree blow at all.ja at.peterson,who provided expert testimony on accident reconstruction,testified that the blow to the truck resulted in a change in velocity of approximately miles per hour on the truck.ja at.he explained that this would be like taking this truck and running it down to a concrete barrier approximately at miles per hour.id.noting that the crash test standard for new cars was miles per hour.there was also testimony at trial by the investigating police officer and others that the damage to clark vehicle was mostly to the body in the area,and not to the frame or close to the door latch.
peterson also testified that the impact to the left front wheel of the pickup truck would have immediately propelled clark toward the impact and into the left front door of the vehicle.he supported this opinion with evidence that the door was bowed from the inside out,indicating that his body made contact with the door.he further opined that clark was ejected from the vehicle immediately upon impact,the point at which maximum force was exerted,and before the second contact between the vehicles when they.ja at.
finally,there was evidence produced at trial to establish that clark did not receive massive crash injuries to his thorax while inside the vehicle.the investigating police officer testified that upon examination of the truck after the accident,he found nothing protruding into the driver space inside of the truck.the officer testified that there was no sign that clark had significant contact with the steering wheel.specifically,there was no damage in the passenger compartment space,other than to the inner door panel into which clark was thrown.
chrysler does not disagree that under,the appropriate question is whether the defective latch system was a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries or death of clark.however,citing this court decision in volkswagen of america,and,wl cir,chrysler maintains that because clark own actions precipitated the automobile accident,the crashworthiness doctrine applies to this case.under the crashworthiness doctrine,courts deny recovery unless the plaintiff establishes by competent expert testimony that the defect was responsible to some degree for enhancement of injury to the plaintiff.id.at.
in relying on this unpublished opinion of our court,chrysler maintains that pursuant to sixth circuit rule g,the case has precedential value in relation to a material issue in the case and that there is no opinion which would serve as well.in disputing that the crashworthiness doctrine should not be applied to this case,clark argues that kentucky courts have never adopted the doctrine and notes that there are a number of cases which serve as relevant precedent for the issues before the court.chrysler does not dispute that the court acknowledged that kentucky courts have not adopted the crashworthiness doctrine.indeed,it cites this fact in favor of why the court should look to as precedent for applying the doctrine under kentucky law.
where the crashworthiness doctrine applies,a plaintiff must prove,inter alia that there is a practicable,feasible,safe,alternative design that the design would have remedied the problem and that in the absence of the alleged defects,the decedent would not have been injured or would have incurred less of an injury.id.assuming,without deciding,that the kentucky courts would adopt the crashworthiness doctrine,this court finds that clark has proven causation under the doctrine as well as under other existing principles of causation under kentucky law.
in,the plaintiff,a old boy,was seriously injured when he drove a volkswagen jetta off the road at an excessive rate of speed.he sued volkswagen,maintaining that the injuries which he suffered were caused by a defective seat belt and door latch.the court in that case described the accident as follows 
after leaving the road,the car crossed over a ditch,struck an embankment,climbed the embankment,and struck two or three of a group of three large logs at the top of the embankment.at this point the car was upside down and moving forward.one log hit the roof of the car with such force that the roof was peeled back and upward on the driver side.another log came diagonally across the hood of the car from the right front corner,penetrated the upper left corner of the windshield,struck the seatbelt emergency release mechanism,and then hit the driver side pillar.the car on this log,stretching the door frame like a rubber band and releasing the door latch.the log was carried with the vehicle for approximately feet.the log and vehicle then separated,and the rear of the car dug into the ground,causing it to rotate in the opposite direction.as the jetta fell toward the ground,was ejected from the car.moving slightly ahead of the vehicle,he came to rest on the ground and the jetta finally landed on top of him.estimates as to the total distance traveled by the vehicle including yaw marks varied from feet to feet.
at trial,experts offered testimony that the door and seat belt in the jetta were defective and that a motorized track above the door would have provided a practicable alternative design that would have prevented the plaintiff injuries.however,in reversing the jury verdict in favor of,this court found that there was no proof that this alternate design would have prevented the harm,that is,that the motorized attachment would not have activated when the door flew open in this accident.id.the court stated further that 
given the fact that one log peeled back the roof of the car and the car continued to roll after that,it was incumbent on plaintiff to prove that he would have been injury free if restrained in his seat.
id.at also finding that the plaintiff experts had not adduced proof that the seat belt would have remained intact if the jetta had located the emergency release mechanism between the two front seats rather than near the door mounting,another alternative design proposed by plaintiff.
finally,the court found that did not prove that a defective door latch caused his injuries.in reaching this conclusion,the court rejected the testimony of one of plaintiff experts,who testified that plaintiff would have been unhurt if he had remained in the car,as having no basis.the court stated 
given the condition of the roof after the accident and the fact that the jetta hit the ground at the terminus of its pole vault in an inverted position and continued to roll,this assertion appears to have no factual basis.
id.at also noting that had not proposed an alternative design for a more crashworthy door lock and that the information he submitted regarding the evaluation of the latch system as a whole did not include data regarding existing practices within the industry.
the facts of are critically different from the facts of this case.here,clark has produced evidence that there were feasible alternative designs to the chrysler k latch system that would have prevented clark injuries.gilberg testified that several simple fixes would have prevented bypass failure and that a or latch would not have allowed the door to come open.many of the alternative latch systems proposed by gilberg had actually been in use by vehicle manufacturers for many years prior to the time the dodge ram was manufactured,the pie and cone used by mercedes benz since the and which was no more costly than the k latch.clark other expert,peterson,demonstrated the difference between the unsupported sheet metal used by chrysler and the boxed and supported used by ford,general motors,nissan and toyota.he testified that if the from the clark vehicle had a boxed,it would not have twisted out.
finally,all of the evidence must be viewed in light of the fact that clark evidence in this case in regard to causation does not suffer from the deficiencies we found in.as explained above,there was competent evidence before the jury that charles clark would not have been injured had he remained in the car and that his ejection from the car was a result of a defect in the latch system.
chrysler also maintains that the trial court erred in not entering judgment in its favor as a matter of law in regard to the jury award of punitive damages.in its motion before the trial court,chrysler argued that clark was not entitled to any punitive damages because they were not proven and because the jury award of such damages was excessive 
as to chrysler argument that there was insufficient evidence to support an award of punitive damages,the court reviews the trial judge denial of chrysler motion for judgment as a matter of law under the same standards it reviewed the substantive claims above.judgment should therefore be granted only if there is a complete absence of proof on a material issue in the action,or if no disputed issue of fact exists upon which reasonable minds could differ.morales,at.the court also can not substitute its judgment for that of the jury rather,it must review the evidence in the light most favorable to clark and she must be accorded every reasonable inference from the evidence.id.this court finds,after review of all of the evidence,that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support an award of punitive damages.
in this case,the parties agreed on the jury instruction that was to be given by the court.it permitted the jury to return a verdict for punitive damages if the conduct of chrysler corporation in designing,manufacturing and marketing the dodge ram pickup truck constituted gross negligence.ja at.the instruction defined gross negligence as a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other persons,inclu
