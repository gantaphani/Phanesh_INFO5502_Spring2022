by petition for extraordinary writ,robert carpenter asks us to vacate an order that he submit to a mental examination pursuant to code of civil procedure section he contends the court did not specify the diagnostic tests and procedures of the examination,as required by section,in merely ordering that the tests would be limited to standardized written psychological tests that evaluated emotional and cognitive functioning.in addition,carpenter complains,the court erred in not ordering that he could obtain a copy of the written testing materials and his written answers after the mental examination.
we conclude that the court order does not comply with section.we also conclude that the court was incorrect in ruling that copyright law precluded carpenter from obtaining a copy of the written test materials.a peremptory writ of mandate shall issue.
facts and procedural history 
carpenter alleged mental impairments 
carpenter filed a lawsuit against real party in interest yamaha motor corporation,usa yamaha,seeking damages for personal injuries he sustained while riding his yamaha motorcycle at a motocross track.according to his petition,a defective accelerator failed as he traversed a jump,his motorcycle pitched forward,and he was thrown headfirst into the ground.according to yamaha,the accident was caused solely by rider error.
the impact broke carpenter neck and compressed his vertebrae.he also fractured most of his ribs,separated his shoulder,bruised his heart,bit his tongue in half,broke most of his front teeth,and suffered a traumatic brain injury.in addition,carpenter allegedly continues to suffer from headaches,sensitivity to light,vision problems,problems with smell and taste,pain,weakness,limited movement,memory deficits,and confusion.
carpenter seeks to recover millions of dollars from yamaha,contending that he has sustained brain damage affecting all aspects of his cognitive functioning,emotional functioning,and personality.based on a report from his healthcare providers,cognitive and emotional testing indicates that he suffers from cognitive barriers affecting future employment,including impairment in regard to memory,problem solving and abstract reasoning,and organization,and certain psychological work skill barriers affecting future employment,including impairment in word recognition and auditory comprehension,physical limitations,and difficulty with anger management.in his deposition,carpenter testified that he suffers from depression,anger,and frustration,as well as problems with his memory,communication skills,and emotions.
yamaha demand for mental examination 
on june,yamaha served carpenter with a demand for independent medical examination,requesting a neurological examination and a neuropsychological examination in the course of a single day on august,ime demand.the neurological examination was to be performed by mark strassberg,while ronald roberts,would administer the neuropsychological examination.the ime demand did not name the tests that would be employed,but advised these standard examinations are to consist of patient history and such other routine tests and procedures as may be deemed necessary to determine the existence and nature of bodily and psychological injuries allegedly suffered during the incident which is the subject of this litigation.no physically intrusive or invasive procedures will be performed.
carpenter served a written response to the ime demand on july.among other things,he contended that the reference to routine tests was not sufficiently specific,and claimed that a written test such as the mmpi minnesota multiphasic personality inventory is impermissibly protracted.
the parties met and conferred.by letter to carpenter counsel dated august,yamaha counsel purported to memorialize a conversation of july,in which the parties agreed that separate physical and mental examinations would be held on september.the letter confirmed that strassberg would conduct the physical neurological examination,and roberts would perform the mental neuropsychological examination,which would consist simply of written tests that can be completed in the same day as the physical examinations.carpenter counsel could observe the physical examination,but only the mental examination.see,subd.a.
on august,however,carpenter counsel asserted in a letter that the parties had not yet worked out the specifics for the september mental examination.although carpenter was agreeable to a mental examination,he objected to roberts duplicating strassberg neurological examination refused to take the mmpi because,he claimed,it was a personality inventory exceeding the scope of his injuries insisted on recording the neurological examination by court reporter refused to allow extensive questioning regarding medical history and maintained that yamaha was required to set forth precisely what written tests are to be included as part of the mental examination.
yamaha attorney wrote back on september.she advised that strassberg would actually conduct both a physical examination and neuropsychiatric mental evaluation,of which only the physical examination could be attended by counsel.in addition,roberts would conduct the psychological mental testing,which would not duplicate strassberg interview,and no third party could attend.yamaha defended the use of the mmpi and claimed there was no authority for carpenter to obtain in advance a list of the particular tests to be administered,since the tests would be selected according to carpenter presentation of his condition and an advance list would enable carpenter to prepare for the tests and manipulate the results.
carpenter attorney responded that same day at approximately,one business day before the examination.he insisted that yamaha should have to identify the specific tests to be used during the mental examination,since any court order for a mental examination under section would have to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures.carpenter agreed to be physically examined by strassberg on september,but refused to proceed with the mental examination.
september physical neurological examination by strassberg 
carpenter appeared with his attorney at strassberg office on september.with much interruption by carpenter attorney,strassberg conducted a physical neurological examination and asked carpenter some questions to help assess his mental functioning and memory.the mental neuropsychiatric examination did not take place.
yamaha motion to compel mental examination 
yamaha filed a motion seeking an order compelling plaintiff compliance with the stipulated to and noticed mental examination.in an accompanying declaration,strassberg described the nature of the planned mental examination,noting that his neuropsychiatric examination of carpenter would be followed by written psychological tests in which roberts would assist.the written tests,strassberg explained,would be selected in accordance with the nature and scope of the plaintiff presenting complaints.further,strassberg advised we use only standardized procedures that are relied upon by other psychiatrists and psychologists.the tests evaluate cognitive and emotional functioning,such as memory,concentration,attention,visual spatial capacity.there will be no procedures which are painful,intrusive or protracted.carpenter,as all patients,will be treated with due care and respect.italics added.strassberg could not,however,identify in advance the specific tests to be employed it may be possible to provide a list of all psychological tests which could possibly be administered,but we can not provide a list of specifically which psychological tests will be administered,because they will be selected based upon the patient clinical presentation.
in his opposition to yamaha motion,carpenter did not dispute that yamaha is entitled to a mental examination,but argued that the court could not issue an order comporting with section,because yamaha never identified the specific diagnostic tests and procedures to be used.as a new matter,carpenter requested that the court order yamaha examiner s to provide him with copies of all tests,test responses,and other written communications by carpenter immediately after the examination.
the trial court tentative ruling granted yamaha motion but directed the parties to meet and confer on the form of the order,which would list each and every diagnostic test sought to be performed in addition to the other items required by ccp d.
both carpenter and yamaha contested the tentative ruling and appeared at the hearing on november.after considering the argument of counsel,the court continued the hearing to december,with instructions for counsel to meet and confer to resolve the disputed issues.
the parties were unable to resolve their dispute over the disclosure of the names of the diagnostic tests that might be used.carpenter proposed a procedure by which he would initially submit to an oral mental examination by strassberg,strassberg would then determine the psychological tests to be performed,the list of those tests would be conveyed to carpenter counsel,and carpenter could object to any tests his expert deemed inappropriate.yamaha counsel rejected this proposal,claiming that the selection of written tests was not made on the basis of the initial oral interview,which had another purpose.yamaha also refused to provide carpenter with copies of the written tests and answers at the conclusion of the testing session,on the ground it would violate copyright laws and strassberg ethical obligations.at the hearing on december,the court took the matter under submission.
e.the trial court order 
on december,the court issued its written order,requiring carpenter to submit to a mental examination by strassberg and his assistants and colleagues presumably roberts.under the heading of n ature of examination,the court provided that the examination shall test emotional and cognitive functioning.under the heading of m anner,diagnostic tests and procedures,conditions,and scope,the court ruled that carpenter could audiotape the examination,but no third party including his counsel or court reporters could attend.the court also set forth the following schedule at am carpenter shall be asked to fill out preliminary paperwork.he may obtain copies of these forms.at approximately am strassberg shall conduct a neuropsychiatric interview.the interview will last approximately hours depending upon the medical presentation,necessary breaks,and issues.there will be a one hour break for lunch.carpenter may choose a shorter time for lunch.depending upon the time of morning when the interview ends,carpenter may choose to begin some of the written testing before taking the lunch break.following the interview and possibly the lunch break depending upon when carpenter chooses to take lunch,standardized written psychological tests shall be administered to carpenter.no standardized written psychological tests are specifically prohibited from the examination,because plaintiff opposition has cited no authority in support of such a position.the written testing will likely last hours,but it may last approximately hours depending upon the medical presentation,necessary breaks and the process.if carpenter insists upon reading every written question into the audio tape,the examination may need to be continued to a further day.italics added.
in addition,the court ruled that carpenter was not entitled to receive a copy of the testing materials t hese are standardized tests,and the names of the tests are sufficient to allow the plaintiff his retained psychological expert to determine precisely what questions were asked.it is not possible to provide a copy of the exam questions following the examination,as it would be a copyright infringement for each of the standardized tests.the court also noted that carpenter could obtain a copy of the physician report after the examination and take the deposition of yamaha disclosed experts.
ii.discussion 
as mentioned,carpenter raises two issues whether the trial court complied with the requirement of section to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures of the examination by ordering standardized written psychological tests of emotional and cognitive functioning and whether the court abused its discretion in failing to allow him to obtain a copy of the written testing materials and his written answers.we address each contention in turn 
specifying diagnostic tests and procedures under section 
civil discovery by physical and mental examination is governed by sections through.as a general matter,a defendant may obtain a physical or mental examination of the plaintiff,in accordance with those provisions,if the plaintiff has placed his or her physical or mental condition in controversy,subd.a see.
the procedure for obtaining certain physical examinations differs somewhat from the procedure for obtaining a mental examination.if the plaintiff seeks recovery for personal injuries,the defendant may obtain one physical examination of the plaintiff by serving a demand,without leave of court,as long as the examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,protracted,or intrusive and is conducted within miles of the plaintiff residence,subd.a.the demand must specify the time,place,manner,conditions,scope,and nature of the examination,subd.c.
if,as here,the defendant wants to obtain discovery by a mental examination or by a physical examination other than that described in section et,the defendant must obtain leave of court,subd.a.the motion for a mental examination,like the demand for a physical examination under section,shall specify the time,place,manner,conditions,scope,and nature of the examination,as well as the identity and the specialty,if any,of the person or persons who will perform the examination,subd.b.
section governs the order granting a motion for a mental examination.to protect the plaintiff privacy interests from unnecessary intrusion,the mental examination may be ordered only upon a showing of good cause,subd.a see vinson superior court cal d,vinson former sporich superior court th,d former,subd.d.in addition,and ostensibly for the same purpose,the court in its order must set forth certain details of the examination an order granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination,as well as the time,place,manner,diagnostic tests and procedures,conditions,scope and nature of the examination,subd.d,italics added.the requirement that the order specify the diagnostic tests and procedures does not appear in the requirements for a demand for a physical examination or the requirements for the motion for a mental examination or other physical examination.
at issue here is the meaning of the requirement that the court specify the diagnostic tests and procedures of the examination.this question of statutory interpretation is a matter of law on which we exercise our independent judgment to discern the intent of the legislature.we begin with the statutory language,according each word a commonsense meaning based on the language used and the evident purpose of the statute.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,hughes.if the language is unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.ibid.if the language is susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning,we turn to standard rules of statutory construction and consider other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history.see id.at,d.
plain meaning of section 
the word specify means to speak of fully or in detail.oxford english dict.ed.the plain meaning of section,therefore,is that the court is to describe in detail who will conduct the examination,where and when it will be conducted,the conditions,scope and nature of the examination,and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed.the way to describe these diagnostic tests and procedures fully and in to list them by name.
yamaha argues that a trial court can just mention the types of diagnostic tests and procedures such as written standardized tests evaluating emotional and cognitive functioning,because section does not expressly state that each and every diagnostic test must be individually named.yamaha argument is unpersuasive,for several reasons.
first,it was unnecessary for the legislature to include the language yamaha suggests,since the language it did use shall specify the diagnostic tests and procedures plainly means the same thing.indeed,given the clarity of the language chosen by the legislature,it is not significant that the statute omits an explanation that each test be named but it is quite significant that the statute omits any statement that the mere type or category of test can be mentioned.
second,the mere description of test types is the kind of information that satisfies another requirement,also in section,that the court specify the scope,and nature of the examination.the legislature separate mandate that the court also specify the diagnostic tests and procedures imposes something more than identification of the general types or categories of tests.see agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,w henever possible,significance must be given to every word in pursuing the legislative purpose,and the court should avoid a construction that makes some words surplusage.
third,while no published decision has determined how a court must describe diagnostic tests and procedures under section,at least one decision has confirmed that other information required in an order granting a mental dates of the examination and identity of the be stated with particularity.in baqleh superior court th,d baqleh,mental evaluations administered pursuant to the penal code had produced inconsistentconclusions as to a criminal defendant competency to stand trial.the prosecution thereafter sought an order requiring the defendant to submit to a reasonable examination by duly licensed psychiatrists psychologists retained by the people,at a maximum of five sessions,of no longer than four hours per session,scheduled between the hearing on this motion and february.baqleh,supra,at,d.the trial court granted the motion,ordering the defendant to submit to an evaluation by a psychiatrist retained by the prosecution,as requested by the prosecution in this case.id.at,d,italics omitted.the court of appeal ruled that the order was erroneous,because the trial court failed to comply with the applicable discovery statute for mental examinations.in particular,the court observed,former section,subdivision d the predecessor to section required the motion to specify the time,place,manner,conditions,scope,and nature of the examination,as well as the identity and the specialty,if any,of the person or persons who will perform the examination,yet neither the motion nor the order had specifically identified the examiner and the time of the examination,or limited the scope and nature of the examination to the question of mental competency to stand trial.baqleh,supra,at,d see id.at,d.the specificity required in baqleh as to the examiner and examination date should apply as well to the diagnostic tests and procedures.
fourth,the need to identify the diagnostic tests and procedures with specificity furthers the evident purpose of the statute.section applies to mental examinations,as well as physical examinations other than the first physical examination of a personal injury plaintiff under section instance,where there are multiple physical examinations or the proposed procedures will be painful,protracted,or intrusive.thus,in the instances covered by section,there is a heightened risk of undue mental or physical invasion.moreover,in the case of mental examinations,the plaintiff may not be accompanied by his attorney or other representative who can protect the plaintiff interests.requiring the court to identify the permissible diagnostic tests and procedures,by name,confirms that the court has weighed the risks of unwarranted intrusion upon the plaintiff against the defendant need for a meaningful opportunity to test the plaintiff claims of physical or mental injury.furthermore,the resulting specificity and clarity of the order will also aid the examiner in understanding and complying with the parameters imposed by the court.
in sum,the plain meaning of section is that the trial court must specify the diagnostic tests and procedures of the mental examination by naming the tests and procedures to be performed.yamaha remaining on a federal district court decision,legislative history,and the claimed effect of our ruling on the efficacy of the examination and motion addressed next.
ragge and the federal rules of civil procedure 
yamaha notes that former section was based on rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure frcp.vinson,supra,cal d at fn,doyle superior court th,d.the california discovery act of,which introduced the requirement of specifying diagnostic tests and procedures along with many other provisions,was generally patterned after the frcp as well.on this basis,yamaha urges us to follow the federal district court decision in ragge studios ragge,proclaiming that it involves precisely the same issues presented in the underlying motion.yamaha is incorrect.
in ragge,a plaintiff filed a lawsuit in federal court,claiming damages for emotional distress.the defendant sought a mental examination under frcp rule,which reads in part the order for a mental examination may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time,place,manner,conditions,and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.ragge,supra,at,italics added.the plaintiff opposed the motion,insisting inter alia that the examiner disclose in advance the specific tests to be administered at the examination.id.at.a declaration submitted by the defendant doctor had set forth the nature of the examination to be conducted,including the types of psychological tests he may choose to administer.id.at.there was no indication that anything unusual or improper was proposed.ibid.the court concluded under rule of the frcp that no purpose would be served by requiring the defendant mental examiner to select,and disclose,the specific tests to be administered in advance of the examination.ragge,supra,at.
ragge stands for the proposition that the manner,conditions and scope of the examination under frcp rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure can be satisfied by the examiner identification of the types of tests that will be employed.this language in frcp rule a was identical to the language of an earlier version of former section.reuter superior court d,fn.but former section was amended by the civil discovery act of to add the language that now is included in section,requiring not just specification of the manner,conditions and scope of the examination,but also specification of the diagnostic tests and procedures.frcp rule a does not require what is required by section,and ragge is not on point.
nor does the discussion in ragge otherwise persuade us that it would be inappropriate to compel advance disclosure of the test names.yamaha refers us to a passage in which the ragge court stated because the mental examination provides one of the few opportunities for a defendant to have access to a plaintiff,and the only opportunity for a defendant to have a plaintiff examined by defendant expert,some preference should be given to allowing the examiner to exercise discretion in the manner and means by which the examination is conducted,provided it is not an improper examination.ragge,supra,at.in general,we have no quarrel with this proposition.certainly the examiner should have some discretion in choosing the manner and means of conducting the only as long as the tests he or she proposes are not unduly invasive or otherwise inappropriate.the way to assure that the tests do not make the examination improper,as ragge puts it,is to require the court to name the tests in its order.this assures that the court has considered any objections to the tests and provides the examiner clear parameters for the examination.
legislative history 
yamaha urges us to consider the legislative history of section because,yamaha claims,the statute is ambiguous.in particular,yamaha contends that section is arguably ambiguous because it requires the order for a mental examination to specify more information than the motion.it is arguably latently ambiguous,yamaha adds,because providing the test names in advance allows a plaintiff to prepare and manipulate the results.see in re marriage of campbell th,d legislative history may be considered in cases of latent ambiguity.
we do not agree that section is ambiguous for the reasons yamaha asserts.the clear statutory requirement to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures in the order does not become ambiguous merely because another statutory provision fails to expressly require the moving party to specify the tests and procedures furthermore,as explained post,there is nothing in the record to support yamaha assertion that advance knowledge of the test names will enable a plaintiff to skew the results of the mental examination.nevertheless,we consider the legislative history of section,if only to confirm that it contains nothing contrary to our reading of the statute.
the language explicitly requiring the order for a mental examination to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures first appeared in former section,subdivision d,as a result of amendments imposed by the civil discovery act of.the portion of the civil discovery act of pertaining to mental examinations was introduced as california state assembly bill reg.sess.ab.the content of ab in turn originated from a proposed revised discovery act,presented to the legislature in january by the state council joint commission on discovery commission.the commission proposed discovery act included reporter note s,which discussed the potential substantive changes.
while former section as it then existed provided that t he order shall specify the time,place,manner,conditions,and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made,stats,ch,the new provision proposed by the commission required that the motion would have to specify the time,place,manner,conditions,scope,and nature of the examination,as well as the person or persons who will perform the examination,and the order would have to specify the person or persons who may perform the examination,and the time,place,manner,diagnostic tests and procedures,conditions,scope and nature of the examination.italics added.
according to the commission reporter notes,the proposed amendment to former section articulate d a requirement,perhaps implicit in the present statute,that the motion itself be quite specific as to the time,place,nature,scope,of the examination sought.italics added.although carpenter seizes upon this remark as evidence that the legislature believed the existing language of former section implicitly required specification of the diagnostic tests and procedures,we are not persuaded.the remark referred to the new requirements for the motion for a mental examination,not the new language regarding the order granting the examination.only the latter included the phrase diagnostic tests and procedures.
carpenter also points us to a typed document,prepared at some unknown time by some unidentified author,expressing someone concern that requiring the order to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures might unduly limit the examiner or be impossible until after an initial interview problems is not the court interference into what tests can be done,unduly limiting a professional bound by rules of ethics,etc often sic not know sic what tests etc are appropriate untill sic initial interview completed.i s this essentially going to require that every examination sought will be throu gh motion i s the old way abused or require hearing now 
this passage,however,has little significance.in the first place,we can not identify the maker of the statement or the context in which it was made.moreover,the legislative record does not contain any response.from the fact that ab was passed,it could be construed that the legislature believed the specification of the diagnostic tests and procedures was appropriate,notwithstanding the concerns that had been raised.on the other hand,it could also be concluded that the legislature rejected the implication that the new statutory language would compel the disclosure of each and every test.given this uncertainty,the unidentified statement is unhelpful to our analysis.
having considered the material submitted by the parties,we conclude there is no competent evidence of any express discussion of the diagnostic tests and procedures language in the legislative history of ab 
yamaha makes two arguments in connection with legislative history.first,it notes that one of the purposes of the civil discovery act of was to bring california provisions generally more in line with their federal counterparts.as mentioned in the senate rules committee report of august,in general,the revisions would bring california law closer to the discovery provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.we accept that,i n general,that was the intent of our legislature.as to former section in particular,however,the legislature elected not to preserve the language that was identical to frcp rule a,but instead to add language that made the california statute read differently than frcp rule a.moreover,even if we concluded that our legislature had desired to keep former section in line with frcp rule a,it would not resolve the matter before us there was no published federal decision addressing the specificity required under frcp rule a as of the time ab was passed.ragge was decided nearly a decade later.
next,yamaha notes that ab amended not only former section,pertaining to physical and mental examinations,but also former section,which addressed discovery of expert witnesses.the text of former sections and,yamaha contends,shows that the legislature intended a mutual exchange of information between litigants,to promote the efficient resolution of cases sections and provide for a mutual exchange of doctor reports within a reasonable time after the physical or mental examination and sections,and provide for a mutual exchange of expert names and reports and the opportunity to take the deposition of the other party potential expert witnesses.in addition,the legislature noted its intent to further efficient and forthright discovery t he purpose of this act ab is to promote the just,speedy,and economical determination of civil actions by providing parties with mutual knowledge of the information needed to resolve their disputes.given this purpose,each litigant and each attorney has a duty to conduct and to respond to discovery in a manner that is honest,forthright,cooperative,prompt,and.chief counsel rubin lopez,letter to assemblyman elihu harris.
in light of the legislative intent to further the mutual exchange of information in pretrial discovery,yamaha contends that the plain meaning interpretation of the language of section is incorrect.in particular,yamaha urges,by seeking advance disclosure of the names of the tests the defendant examiner will use,or by seeking disclosure of the written test questions after the examination,plaintiff is demanding that the defendant produce more information regarding the plaintiff alleged injuries,than what the plaintiff is willing to produce in support of his own injuries.
yamaha concern is misplaced.certainly the legislature intended the civil discovery act of to lead parties and counsel to be forthright in producing discoverable information.but this goal can not be interpreted to limit the disclosure a defendant must provide a plaintiff before subjecting him to a battery of mental tests,or to deprive the trial court of the opportunity of determining whether any of those tests may be inappropriate.nor is there any indication in the legislative history of ab that its general mission of encouraging the forthright and efficient exchange of information should render the phrase,specify the diagnostic tests and procedures to have anything other than its plain meaning.
section in practice 
insisting that section means what it the diagnostic tests and procedures must be result in an orderly and efficient means of balancing the interests of the plaintiff and defendant.the defendant,aware that the court must name the diagnostic tests and procedures in the order granting a mental examination,will identify the potential tests and procedures in its moving papers.the plaintiff,assisted by counsel and a psychologist or other expert,may consider whether the proposed tests are inappropriate,irrelevant,or abusive,and submit evidence and argument to that effect if necessary.if the parties can not agree on the specific tests that may be employed,the matter will be resolved by the court in deciding the defendant section motion 
yamaha expresses two concerns.first,it argues that disclosure of the names of the tests,before the mental examination,would allow the plaintiff to prepare for the tests and manipulate the results.the record in this matter,however,contains no support for yamaha position.strassberg did not assert any such danger in his declaration in support of yamaha motion.nor did yamaha present any other evidence that a plaintiff,knowing what tests might be used,could prepare for the tests and manipulate them,much less manipulate them in a manner undetectable to the examiner.in correspondence yamaha submits to us from publishers of the mmpi and other written psychological tests,it is contended only that disclosure of the test materials themselves before the examination could affect the integrity of the test.it is not asserted that identification of the names of the proposed tests would pose the same risk.indeed,we find the prospect unlikely,since the actual test questions are a carefully guarded secret among the publishers and examiners identification of just the names of the meaningful to the plaintiff psychologist for purposes of determining their not likely lead to the plaintiff gaining access to the actual questions 
second,yamaha admonishes that extensive motion practice will arise if a defendant is forced to disclose in advance the mental tests to which it may subject the plaintiff.yamaha foresees that psychologists will provide a list of potential tests,the parties will never agree on the propriety of the tests,motions will be brought,and e ach individual psychological test will be on trial,with the tests in abstentia because they are subject to copyright protection.further,yamaha warns,trial judges will not be competent to evaluate and compare the psychological tests and determine which ones should be allowed.
not so.in the first place,even without an obligation to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures,mental examinations are often obtained by motion practice,since a court order is required.see former.while it is possible for parties to forgo a contested motion by stipulating to the mental examination,such a stipulation seems just as likely,if not more likely,where the defendant forthrightly discloses the names of the potential tests rather than refusing to let the plaintiff know what tests might be used.furthermore,there is no indication in the record that motions to obtain mental examinations will become more onerous if defense counsel,anticipating the need of the court under section,names the proposed tests in its moving papers.the plaintiff is obligated to object to the proposed tests only in good faith,the litigants must meet and confer in good faith,and the trial court is empowered to deal with those who choose not to.while the court may have to make more specific decisions about individual tests,it is untenable to say that,in some vague hope of avoiding more complicated motions,plaintiffs and their counsel must be kept in the dark as to what the defendants mental examiners intend to do,contrary to the plain language of a statute and the evident intent of our legislature.
nor are we persuaded that the copyright protection purportedly afforded the psychological tests would hamper the process.for a party to argue whether the test should be administered,it may not be necessary to give the court a copy of the actual test.to the extent a copy of the test must be provided,we note that copies of published court decisions and other copyrighted materials are submitted along with motions rather routinely.and to maintain the secrecy of the test content,the materials could be filed under seal,similar to the procedure employed when filing trade secret or other confidential material.
lastly,we disagree that trial courts lack the competence to determine whether there is good cause for particular psychological tests.courts are routinely called upon to decide similar matters that may exceed the personal experience of an individual judge,based on the evidence and arguments submitted by the parties.
in the final analysis,section requires the trial court to list by name the diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed in the mental examination.yamaha gives us no reason to depart from this clear mandate.
the trial court order must be vacated 
in the matter before us,the court ordered carpenter to submit to standardized written psychological tests to test emotional and cognitive functioning.the order did not set forth the names of the tests.nor does the record demonstrate that standardized written psychological tests for evaluating emotional and cognitive functioning has so precise and finite a meaning in the mental health profession as to be the functional equivalent of a list of specific tests.the order does not comply with section.
yamaha refers us to bittle superior court d.bittle,for the proposition that an order for an examination may not be erroneous even though it fails to comply precisely with procedural requirements.in bittle,the trial court required a personal injury plaintiff to appear for a physical examination pursuant to former section,subdivision a.bittle,supra,at.the plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate,contending that the order failed to specify the time,place,manner,conditions,and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made,since it did not state a specific time or place for the examination or the name of the doctor.id.at.the court of appeal held that the failure to repeat these particulars in the order did not make the order defective per se,since the scope of the examination was clear from the order and notice of motion,taken together,and the lack of specificity was to some extent due to the plaintiff counsel.id.at.the appellate court also rejected plaintiff contention that the defendants had failed to show good cause for the examination by failing to state the precise physical examination requested or specific facts warranting the examination.id.at.it would have been difficult to make the notice of motion more specific,the court concluded,since it incorporated plaintiff extremely broad allegations of her injuries.ibid.
bittle does not help yamaha,because it was decided under an earlier statute governing physical examinations former,subd.a,not the current section governing mental examinations.unlike the provision at issue here,former section,subdivision a,did not require the order to specify the diagnostic tests and procedures.furthermore,to the extent bittle stands for the proposition that the specificity requirement can be satisfied by details set forth in the motion papers,yamaha motion papers did not name the specific diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed.
we recognize that strassberg claimed he could not identify in advance all of the specific tests he would eventually conduct,since the ultimate selection depended upon carpenter presentation of his injuries during the mental examination.but certainly,for yamaha to have requested the mental examination in good faith,strassberg had to have known of some tests that he would necessarily administer.indeed,strassberg averred that he would almost certainly administer the mmpi,in light of his review of carpenter records.he also stated that he could provide a list of all the tests that could be other words,the written standardized tests from which he would select in testing carpenter emotional and cognitive functioning.given the limited time allotment of four to six hours to conclude all the written testing including the mmpi,it is surprising that the parties could not have come to a reasonable agreement on the tests to be used that afternoon.because strassberg list of potential tests was never disclosed by yamaha or demanded by carpenter,it can not be said that the task was too daunting for the that they refused to try 
the trial court erred,and the order granting the mental examination must be vacated.a peremptory writ shall issue.because the parties do not dispute that a mental examination of carpenter is appropriate,the parties shall meet and confer concerning the specific tests that yamaha examiner may employ,with any remaining disputes to be resolved by the trial court 
provision of copies of written test questions and answers 
although we vacate the order granting the mental examination,we consider carpenter further contention that he should be provided with a copy of the test questions and answers after the mental examination,due to the likelihood that an order granting a mental examination will eventually be ordered and the issue will arise again.
in his opposition to yamaha motion to compel,carpenter requested that the examiner be ordered to provide copies of any and all written communications with plaintiff at the conclusion of the testing session,including written test questions and answers,scantron sheets.
the court did not explicitly rule whether carpenter should be provided a copy of his written answers to the tests.it did order that carpenter could audiotape the mental examination,and that carpenter could read the written questions and presumably his answers onto the tape,but that the written test questions could not be provided to him due to copyright law.specifically,the court ruled carpenter may if he chooses audio tape the examination if carpenter insists upon reading every written question into the audio tape,the examination may need to be continued to a further day.however,these are standardized tests,and the names of the tests are sufficient to allow the plaintiff his retained psychological expert to determine precisely what questions were asked.it is not possible to provide a copy of the exam questions following the examination,as it would be a copyright infringement for each of the standardized tests.
in his writ petition,carpenter maintains that he is entitled to copies of the written test materials and his answers,because the statute governing physical examinations allows for stenographic or audio recordation,and the statute governing mental examinations allows an audio recording.the fact that section permits the mental examination to be audiotaped,however,does not provide statutory authority for compelling the examiner to provide a copy of the written test questions and answers.
while there is no express statutory authority for carpenter position,neither is there statutory authority precluding a trial court,in its discretion,from ordering the disclosure of the written test questions and answers.see golfland entertainment centers,superior court th,d golfland court retains discretion in discovery matters to take prophylactic measures other than those required by statute.this discretion should be exercised,carpenter urges,because his rights to take discovery of and yamaha expert witnesses are not meaningful unless he obtains copies of the test questions and answers on which the experts opinions are based.see,subd.a.further,he argues,the disclosure of the actual test questions and answers will protect against abuse and subsequent disputes over what occurred.see golfland,supra,at,d purpose of permitting recording of mental examination is to ensure the examiner does not overstep the bounds for the examination,the context of the responses can be judged at trial,the examinee interests are protected,and evidence of abuse can be presented to the court see also gonzi superior court cal d,court reporter should be present during physical examination because the plaintiff and the defendant examiner may recall their communications differently.
because the resolution of this matter is for the discretion of the trial court,we would ordinarily review the court determination for an abuse of discretion.see golfland,supra,th at,d.in the matter before us,however,the court decision to deny access to the written test questions was based on a conclusion regarding copyright law,which,as shown post,was erroneous.we therefore discuss the copyright issue,and the issue of professional and ethical obligations raised by yamaha,and leave the matter for further consideration by the trial court.
copyright protection for test questions 
federal law grants copyright owners the exclusive right to copy and distribute copyrighted works.with certain exceptions,original works of authorship receive copyright protection once fixed in tangible form.ibid.components of the mmpi test have been held protected by copyright law.applied innovations regents of the of cir.yamaha also contends that standardized tests,such as those provided to evaluate emotional and cognitive functioning,may be copyrighted as secure tests.see chicago bd.of educ.substance,cir,involving the chicago academic standards exams.
yamaha contends that copyright law precludes providing carpenter with a copy of the written tests that strassberg might use.at the outset,we note that yamaha itself is not the copyright owner,or even the licensee of the copyright holder.nor has it indicated how yamaha might be liable under copyright law if it complied with a court order to produce the tests to the opposing party in litigation.it appears yamaha is really arguing that strassberg would exceed the scope of his contractual obligations if he copied the tests and distributed them to carpenter or,perhaps,that the copyright protection afforded the test questions should preclude on public policy grounds any order that strassberg disclose them.
the evidence before the trial court,however,was insufficient to support the finding that providing a copy of the tests would be a copyright infringement for each of the standardized tests.the material before the court did not indicate what tests strassberg would use,or the terms by which strassberg came into possession of the tests,or any limitations on their disclosure.even if it could be presumed that all written standardized tests evaluating emotional and cognitive functioning were subject to copyright protection,it was not established that providing a copy of the test questions,after an examination and by court order,would violate copyright law in every instance.given the state of the record,the trial court erred.
for the benefit of the parties and trial court upon remand,we next consider the material yamaha has presented to us from two of the copyright holders of certain standardized psychological tests.according to correspondence purportedly received by yamaha,ncs pearson,pearson,is the publisher of the mmpi,the,and other standardized psychological tests commonly used to evaluate emotional and cognitive functioning.pearson contends that the mmpi,the test booklet,the scoring software,and other test materials are protected by copyright.further,pearson asserts,it distributes these tests only to qualified professionals subject to a binding contract,and protection of the validity of the tests requires restriction of the test content to qualified professionals bound by ethical obligations to maintain test integrity.
additional correspondence provided by yamaha indicates that harcourt assessment,harcourt is the publisher and copyright owner in regard to the wechsler adult intelligence edition,the wechsler memory and third editions,the california verbal learning edition,and the raven standard progressive matrices.harcourt considers these tests to be secure tests,treats them as trade secrets,and views the test questions and answers presumably,answer sheets as opposed to an examinee responses to be highly confidential proprietary information.these materials are sold only to qualified individuals who are bound by the ethical standards of their profession to protect the integrity of the materials by maintaining the confidentiality of the test items and answers.as a condition of the sale,purchasers must limit access to the test materials to qualified persons who agree to saf
