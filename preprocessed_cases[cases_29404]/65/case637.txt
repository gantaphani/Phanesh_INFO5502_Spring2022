nearly ten years ago,we observed that asbestos litigation had reached maturity.in re ethyl.even mature claims evolve,however,and courts have continued to struggle with the appropriate parameters for lawsuits alleging injuries while science has confirmed the threat posed by asbestos,we have not had the occasion to decide whether a person exposure to some respirable fibers is sufficient to show that a product containing asbestos was a substantial factor in causing asbestosis.because we conclude that it is not,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for the petitioner.
factual and procedural background 
arturo flores is a retired brake mechanic.flores spent much of his working until his retirement in the automotive department at sears in corpus christi.while there,flores handled several brands of brake pads,including those manufactured by flores used pads from,on five to seven of the roughly twenty brake jobs he performed each week disk brake pads contained chrysotile asbestos fibers,fibers that comprised seven to percent of the pad weight,depending on the particular type of pad.flores job involved grinding the pads so that they would not squeal.the grinding generated clouds of dust that flores inhaled while working in a room that measured roughly eight by ten feet.
flores sued and others,alleging that he suffered from asbestosis caused by working with brakes for more than three decades.at the trial,flores presented the testimony of two experts,dinah bukowski,a pulmonologist,and barry castleman,an independent consultant in the field of toxic substance control.bukowski examined flores on a single occasion in may.she reviewed flores,which revealed interstitial lung disease.although there are more than causes including smoking of such disease,bukowski diagnosed flores with asbestosis,based on his work as a brake mechanic coupled with an adequate latency period.according to bukowski,asbestosis is a form of interstitial lung disease,one of the scarring processes of the lungs caused from the inhalation of asbestos and found on biopsy to show areas of scarring in association with actual asbestos bodies or asbestos fibers.bukowski noted that asbestosis can be fatal and is progressive,meaning that the scar tissue increases over time.once inhaled,the fibers can not be expelled,and there is no known cure for asbestosis.she asserted that flores asbestosis could worsen that he could suffer stiffening of his lungs,loss of lung volume,and difficulty with oxygenation.she acknowledged that everyone is exposed to asbestos in the ambient air it very plentiful in the environment,if you a typical urban dweller.she conceded that flores pulmonary function tests showed mild obstructive lung disease,which was unrelated to asbestos exposure.
barry castleman,testified that he has written numerous articles in journals,as well as a book entitled asbestos medical and legal aspects.chapter,titled asbestos disease in brake repair workers,discusses risks to brake mechanics,a long term interest of his and reviews the published and some unpublished literature on asbestos as a hazard to brake mechanics.castleman did not conduct independent research regarding the brake industry instead,his research involved look ing at what was publicly available.castleman testified that brake mechanics can be exposed to asbestos by grinding of brake pads brake shoes and the case of brake lining blowing out the accumulated dust in the the brake housing in doing a brake repair job.he described a conference on the hazards of brake repair held by ford of britain in and published in in the annals of occupational hygiene.that conference evaluated the levels of exposure to asbestos fiber in the air from brake servicing jobs,and it showed that the levels of exposure could be significant.they might not have necessarily exceeded the allowable exposure limits of the day,but in some cases,at least,they came close to doing that.castleman then described some of the literature pertaining to mechanics in particular a article that reported a case of mesothelioma in a garage hand and chauffeur information published by the national institute for occupational safety and health warning about dangers to brake mechanics,emphasizing that grinding of brake parts was a hazardous job with high levels of asbestos exposure and a brochure published by the friction material standards institute fmsi,a vehicle for companies in that subgroup of the asbestos industry to avail themselves of knowledge relating to the hazards and government regulation of their products in the years following,warning brake mechanics about the dangers of asbestos.the fmsi brochure led castleman to conclude that the hazards to brake mechanics were effectively accepted by the asbestos product manufacturers by that time.
castleman testified that a article determined that most of the asbestos in brake linings is destroyed by the heat of friction and therefore is not released to the public air as asbestos fiber.but some of the asbestos was found to survive the heated friction of the braking process.when questioned about whether friable asbestos remained,castleman testified that r espirable asbestos fibers still remain,and a brake mechanic could be exposed to those fibers e ither by grinding brake parts or by blowing out brake housings doing brake servicing work.on,castleman conceded that he had not researched products and did not have any specific knowledge about them.while he knew that manufactured brake pads,he did not have any more detailed knowledge about the company than that.
flores admitted to smoking from the time he was until three weeks prior to trial.flores cardiologist reported a year smoking history,greater than the to year history flores reported to bukowski.at the time of trial,flores chief medical complaint was shortness of breath,which he testified manifested itself primarily after he had been mowing the lawn for minutes.flores also suffers from coronary artery disease and high cholesterol.
expert,pulmonologist kathryn hale,examined flores and testified that,in her opinion,he did not have asbestosis and that his did not show any asbestos disease.she also testified that she had reviewed the literature,including epidemiological studies involving brake mechanics,and had not seen any articles indicating that auto mechanics suffered an increased risk of lung cancer or mesothelioma.she acknowledged that flores medical records included an report from a niosh certified physician who opined that flores had bilateral interstitial fibrotic changes consistent with asbestosis in a patient who has had an adequate exposure history and latency period,but hale testified that she relied on criteria promulgated by the american thoracic society,and under those criteria,flores did not have asbestosis.
the jury found that flores sustained an injury or disease negligence as well as that of three other settling defendants proximately caused flores injury or disease all four defendants were engaged in the business of selling brake products and the brake products had marketing,manufacturing,and design defects,each of which was a producing cause of flores injury.the jury apportioned to of the causation and to each of the other three defendants.the jury awarded flores for future physical impairment,for future medical care,for past physical pain and mental anguish,and for future physical pain and mental anguish in the second phase of the bifurcated trial,the jury found,by clear and convincing evidence,that flores injury resulted from malice and awarded in exemplary damages against.the trial court signed a judgment in conformity with the verdict,and appealed.
the court of appeals affirmed,holding that there was legally sufficient evidence of negligence,citing the following 
flores was a mechanic from to as a mechanic,flores ground new brake pads prior to installation,a process necessary to minimize brake squealing the grinding process produced visible dust,which flores inhaled from to,flores ground brake pads manufactured by brake pads contained between seven and percent asbestos by weight in,flores was diagnosed with asbestosis castleman testified that brake mechanics can be exposed to asbestos by grinding brake pads,a process which produces respirable asbestos fibers bukowski testified that brake dust has been shown to have asbestos fibers and bukowski also testified that brake dust can cause asbestosis.
petitioned for review arguing,among other things,that a plaintiff claiming to be injured by an product must meet the same causation standards that other plaintiffs do we granted the petition.
perhaps the most widely cited standard for proving causation in asbestos cases is the lohrmann frequency,regularity,and proximity test.lohrmann pittsburgh corning,cir see also slaughter southern talc,cir noting that lohrmann is t he most frequently used test for causation in asbestos cases and applying lohrmann to an asbestos claim governed by texas law.in lohrmann,the fourth circuit court of appeals considered whether a trial court correctly directed a verdict in favor of four asbestos manufacturers,after determining that there was insufficient evidence of causation between use of their products and the plaintiffs asbestosis.id.at.the appellate court noted that,under maryland law,proximate cause required evidence that allow ed the jury to reasonably conclude that it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a substantial factor in bringing about the result.id.at noting that section of the restatement second of torts uses the same substantial factor test.the court rejected a standard that if the plaintiff can present any evidence that a company product was at the workplace while the plaintiff was at the workplace,a jury question has been established as to whether that product proximately caused the plaintiff disease,as such a rule would be contrary to the maryland law of substantial causation.id.at.instead,the court concluded that t o support a reasonable inference of substantial causation from circumstantial evidence,there must be evidence of exposure to a specific product on a regular basis over some extended period of time in proximity to where the plaintiff actually worked.id.at.the court noted that i n effect,this is a de minimis rule since a plaintiff must prove more than a casual or minimum contact with the product.this is a reasonable rule when one considers the maryland law of substantial causation and the unusual nature of the asbestosis disease process,which can take years of exposure to produce the disease.id.at.
we have not adopted the lohrmann test,and several amici urge us to do so here.the parties contend that our precedent adequately addresses the issue,as it requires that a party conduct or product be a substantial factor in causing harm.we agree,with lohrmann,that a frequency,regularity,and proximity test is appropriate,but those terms do not,in themselves,capture the emphasis our jurisprudence has placed on causation as an essential predicate to liability.it is important to emphasize that the lohrmann court did not restrict its analysis to the tripartite phrase indeed,it agreed that restatement section requires that the exposure be a substantial factor in causing the disease.id.that analysis comports with our cases.for example,restatement section substantial factor test has informed our causation analysis on several occasions.see lear siegler,perez,see also union pump allbritton.we have recognized that c ommon to both proximate and producing cause is causation in fact,including the requirement that the defendant conduct or product be a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff injuries.union pump,at.the word substantial is used to denote the fact that the defendant conduct has such an effect in producing the harm as to lead reasonable men to regard it as a cause,using that word in the popular sense,in which there always lurks the idea of responsibility,rather than in the philosophic sense,which includes every one of the great number of events without which any happening would not have occurred.lear siegler,at quoting restatement second of torts cmt.a.in asbestos cases,then,we must determine whether the asbestos in the defendant product was a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff injuries.
one of toxicology central tenets is that the dose makes the poison.bernard goldstein mary sue henifin,reference guide on toxicology,in federal judicial center,reference manual on scientific evidence,ed hereafter reference manual.this notion was first attributed to sixteenth century paracelsus,who stated that a ll substances are is none which is not the dose differentiates a poison from a remedy.david eaton,scientific judgment and toxic primer in toxicology for judges and lawyers,pol y citing curtis klaassen,casarett and doull toxicology the basic science of poisons chs,mcgraw hill ed.even water,in sufficient doses,can be toxic.reference manual at see also marc fisher,radio stations and the promotional games a fatal attraction.post,at,available at.washingtonpost.describing woman death from water intoxication after participating in radio contest to win a system.
dose refers to the amount of chemical that enters the body,and,according to one commentator,is the single most important factor to consider in evaluating whether an alleged exposure caused a specific adverse effect.eaton,scientific judgment and toxic torts,pol y at.we have recognized that e xposure to asbestos,a known carcinogen,is never healthy but fortunately does not always result in disease.forest prods.carter.we have held that epidemiological studies are without evidentiary significance if the injured person can not show that the exposure or dose levels were comparable to or greater than those in the studies.merrell dow,havner.the federal reference manual on scientific evidence provides 
an opinion on causation should be premised on three preliminary assessments.first,the expert should analyze whether the disease can be related to chemical exposure by a biologically plausible theory.second,the expert should examine if the plaintiff was exposed to the chemical in a manner that can lead to absorption into the body.third,the expert should offer an opinion as to whether the dose to which the plaintiff was exposed is sufficient to cause the disease.

castleman testified that,despite the heat generated by braking,some asbestos,in the form of respirable fibers,remained in the brake pads,and that brake mechanics could be exposed to those fibers when grinding the pads or blowing out the housings.flores testified that grinding the pads generated dust,which he inhaled.bukowski testified that every asbestos exposure contributes to asbestosis.there is no question,on this record,that mechanics in the braking industry could be exposed to respirable asbestos fibers.but without more,this testimony is insufficient to establish that the brake pads were a substantial factor in causing flores disease.asbestosis appears to be,so that the more one is exposed,the more likely the disease is to occur,and the higher the exposure the more severe the disease is likely to be.see david faigman et,modern scientific evidence the law and science of expert testimony,at id,at noting that it is generally accepted that one may develop mesothelioma from low levels of asbestos exposure.while s evere cases of asbestosis are usually the result of,exposure to asbestos,e vidence of asbestosis has been found many years after relatively brief but extremely heavy exposure.stephen carroll et,rand institute for civil justice,asbestos litigation citing american thoracic society,the diagnosis of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos update official statement of the american thoracic society,am.respiratory disease.one text notes that 
there is general agreement from epidemiologic studies that the development of asbestosis requires heavy exposure to asbestos in the range of to fibers per cubic.accordingly,asbestosis is usually observed in individuals who have had many years of exposure,typically asbestos miners and millers,asbestos textile workers,and asbestos insulators.
